    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aries
March 21- April 19
You like to take charge of your destiny but let fate intervene. Accepting a last-minute invitation, ‘talking’ to the new person at work or joining a forum could lead to pleasantly surprising developments. Diversions are where possibilities lay, whether it’s discovering common ground with a colleague or meeting an interesting online mutual friend so stay off the beaten track.
Taurus
April 20-May 20
Patience is a virtue many human beings lack. You however, have it in spades. In recent months though for obvious and less obvious reasons yours has been stretched to the absolute limit. If you don't do something to decompress today you could well blow a gasket. It's your birthday season so do something to spoil yourself.
Gemini
May 21-June 21
Playing it safe isn’t really part of your makeup. You love spontaneity and being a bit impulsive. Today it will pay to take a chance, whether it’s doing something very ‘not you’, making a controversial statement or asking an acquaintance for their phone number. Daring to be different will win admirers, so be brave and bold!
Cancer
June 22-July 22
Has something seemed a little bit amiss or is it you that's actually missing something? If so the mystery piece of the jigsaw puzzle or lost item is bound to present itself. Heightened cosmic clarity will also give you some insight into a friend’s nature or motivation and you’ll probably see that your suspicions weren’t altogether unfounded.
Leo
July 23-August 22
Fire signs, particularly Felines, operate at a brisk pace but today it's best to take your foot off the accelerator and make an effort to ‘live in the moment’. During your 'lunch break' kick off your shoes and walk on lush grass, get your feet wet or scrunch in sand - it'll reset your internal clock.
Virgo
August 23-September 22
Discussions about children or your own 'brain child' whether you’re experiencing your own issues or a friend's using you as a sounding board are likely to occur. Yes it's tricky times, those who can afford to be present whether it involves work or supervising children may be prone to helicoptering. The best thing to do right now is lean out.
Libra
September 23-October 22
The cosmic conditions are ideal for intimate gatherings and all forms of entertaining, preferably at home. How is that going to happen? If it’s been a while since you invited friends for lunch or cooked a Sunday dinner a wave of hospitality will inspire you to showcase your culinary prowess ... in more modern and technical ways.
Scorpio
October 23 – November 22
Today you might need to navigate your way through a tricky situation. And although you're a sensitive water sign that's stronger than most you may engage in a conflict, most likely with a Taurus. The stars are enhancing your assertive qualities so you’ll be able to make your point effectively, but without burning any bridges.
Sagittarius
November 23-December 20
With sexy Venus in your relationship sector it’s unlikely that your love life has been anything but dull. However, if it could use a little extra spice don’t wait for Cupid to strike and take aim yourself. Join a dating app and connect with someone online or plan a romantic evening with your partner.
Capricorn
December 21-January 19
Like most of us you probably have a bit of extra time on your hands and as sentimentality takes hold you could be flicking through old photo albums or reminiscing about a childhood friend. Some of you might go one step further and try to track them down on social media or organise a reunion via Zoom.
Aquarius
January 20-February 18
Creative self-expression is very important to you right now, and while you’re willing to work with others you’ll want the last word on any joint projects. In fact, guidelines of any sort will be stifling so try to be as autonomous as possible. Having said that, also accept situations in which you can’t act alone.
Pisces
February 19-March 20
You’re known for being sensitive, caring and an endless source of support. But, as the empath of the zodiac you sometimes overextend yourself and absorb other people's emotions and problems which can lead to you feeling depleted. Today you may be pulled in several directions so it's time to put some boundaries in place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oakey and Kingaroy shiver below zero as wintry winds blow in</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two south-east Queensland towns recorded below-zero temperatures overnight as gusty, southern cold air blew into Queensland on Saturday.
Oakey, west of Toowoomba, and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, were the coldest places in the state early on a windy Saturday morning.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Peter Markworth said the two towns were colder than Applethorpe in the Granite Belt, which was kept warmer by the winds.
"Two locations got to below zero this morning," Mr Markworth said.
"Oakey was the coldest and got down to 0.4 degrees centigrade, and Kingaroy got to 0.1, just a touch below zero.
"Applethorpe got to 4.2 degrees centigrade, but it is quite breezy up through there and that would have played a role."
No reading from Stanthorpe's manually read temperature gauge was available early on Saturday.
The gusty 15- to 20-knot winds over much of Queensland were affecting temperatures, Mr Markworth said.
"A good example is up near Townsville. A lot of the surrounding areas got down to the low teens – like 11 degrees – but Townsville itself was quite isolated [from the winds] and the temperature was 19.6 degrees," he said.
Mr Markworth said the chilly weather was an early taste of a typical winter day in July.
"But while we are moving into cooler temperatures in the longer term, in the short term, we will see temperatures begin to warm back to average – in the mid-20s – quite gradually," he said.
"We should get back to average conditions by the middle of next week."
People using Moreton Bay and the waterways around the coast should be wary of the strong gusty winds over the weekend, he said. Those strong winds will return early next week as well.
"We do have quite a bit of wind over the coastal waters – 15 to 20km/h – and into next week, they are going to pick up again," he said.
Winds could be slightly stronger on Sunday in south-east Queensland, gusting up to 35km/h, but easing in the afternoon.
"It is pretty breezy and gusty over the water already, but it is really an issue for early next week," Mr Markworth said.
"Just south of the border in New South Wales does have some strong wind warnings.
"So it can be quite rough in Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast waters."
Overall, clear, bright days are expected until Tuesday, when a chance of rain emerges.
The maximum temperature in Brisbane is tipped to be 24 degrees on Saturday and Sunday, down to 10 degrees on both nights.
By Wednesday there is a 50 per cent chance of slight rain in south-east Queensland, which could continue until Friday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You cannot possibly be the best at everything, so don’t waste your time and energy trying. Cut back on your ambitions this year and focus only on the two or three goals that are easiest to reach. That’s not an admission of failure, it’s a sign of maturity.
A relationship or friendship has been a lot of fun but now it may be time to move on to something new. If you do go your separate ways make sure it is on good terms. You never know when you might want to get back together again.
Just because someone says they will support you does not mean they actually will, so don’t get into a position where your success depends entirely on them. You may not want to be cynical but ultimately the only person you can fully trust is yourself.
Listen carefully to friends and family members whose knowledge in certain areas is clearly superior to your own, then make your choice as to whether or not you will take their advice. The final say in the matter must always go to your conscience.
If you have kept things hidden from partners and loved ones you must now come clean and let them know what’s been going on. It may be no big deal to you but they could lose trust in you if you continue to keep them in the dark.
Your powers of persuasion can get you just about anything you desire, but make sure other people don’t lose out as a result. You win best when other people win with you, so whatever you ask for make sure friends and relatives get a fair share too.
You could face a serious problem if you let slip information you should have kept to yourself. The powers that be won’t be impressed that you could not be trusted and may decide not to trust you again, so keep your lips zipped over the next 24 hours!
You must not be afraid to make unpopular decisions, but on the other hand you must not make them when there are other options available that could work just as well. Remember too that the quickest route to success is not always the best route .
Something or someone will come into your life over the next few days that does you a power of good. It may be that something or someone else has to go out of your life to make room for it, or them, but that’s life. Don’t be too sentimental.
If there is something you would rather be doing than what others expect you to be doing then you need to let them know there are going to be changes. No one can blame you for getting bored with your current regime – and you wouldn’t care if they did.
You should by now have a much clearer idea of what it is you want to be doing over the coming weeks and months. You may not be able to move toward your new goals just yet but you can make detailed plans. Start on them now.
No matter how eager you may be to press ahead with something that excites you there are a number of other issues that must be dealt with first. Sadly, there are people out there who would love to see you fail. Don’t give them a chance to criticize you.
Something has been worrying you for some time and you really do need to sort it out. To start with you must be honest with yourself about why you fear it so much. Once you have done that you may find it has less of a hold over you.

BIRTHDAY SUNDAY:You cannot possibly be the best at everything, so don't waste your time and energy trying. Cut back on your ambitions this year and focus only on the two or three goals that are easiest to reach. That's not an admission of failure, it's a sign of maturity.
ARIES (March 21 - April 20):A relationship or friendship has been a lot of fun but now it may be time to move on to something new. If you do go your separate ways make sure it is on good terms. You never know when you might want to get back together again.
TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):Just because someone says they will support you does not mean they actually will, so don't get into a position where your success depends entirely on them. You may not want to be cynical but ultimately the only person you can fully trust is yourself.
GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):Listen carefully to friends and family members whose knowledge in certain areas is clearly superior to your own, then make your choice as to whether or not you will take their advice. The final say in the matter must always go to your conscience.
CANCER (June 22 - July 23):If you have kept things hidden from partners and loved ones you must now come clean and let them know what's been going on. It may be no big deal to you but they could lose trust in you if you continue to keep them in the dark.
LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):Your powers of persuasion can get you just about anything you desire, but make sure other people don't lose out as a result. You win best when other people win with you, so whatever you ask for make sure friends and relatives get a fair share too.
VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):You could face a serious problem if you let slip information you should have kept to yourself. The powers that be won't be impressed that you could not be trusted and may decide not to trust you again, so keep your lips zipped over the next 24 hours!
LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):You must not be afraid to make unpopular decisions, but on the other hand you must not make them when there are other options available that could work just as well. Remember too that the quickest route to success is not always the best route .
SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):Something or someone will come into your life over the next few days that does you a power of good. It may be that something or someone else has to go out of your life to make room for it, or them, but that's life. Don't be too sentimental.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):If there is something you would rather be doing than what others expect you to be doing then you need to let them know there are going to be changes. No one can blame you for getting bored with your current regime — and you wouldn't care if they did.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):You should by now have a much clearer idea of what it is you want to be doing over the coming weeks and months. You may not be able to move towards your new goals just yet but you can make detailed plans. Start on them now.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):No matter how eager you may be to press ahead with something that excites you there are a number of other issues that must be dealt with first. Sadly, there are people out there who would love to see you fail. Don't give them a chance to criticize you.
PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):Something has been worrying you for some time and you really do need to sort it out. To start with you must be honest with yourself about why you fear it so much. Once you have done that you may find it has less of a hold over you.

Any contact can be deeply satisfying and, with your wit and self-expression at their peak, your on-screen presence will be in high demand. You’ll thrive on the insightful conversations you have with others, even remotely.
Taurus
April 20-May 20
Thursday’s full moon in your relationship sector will stir up drama – great for couples who’ve become complacent. You can’t deal with certain realities until you face them, and once you do you’ll realise just
Gemini
May 21-June 21
Today could bring unexpected responsibilities but you’ll relish the challenge. A conversation with a parent or mentor will be very helpful.
Cancer
June 22-July 22
Be clear with your intentions when it comes to your love life. A stab in the dark will cause unnecessary upheaval but a calculated risk could prove to be highly beneficial, so weigh up the odds.
Leo
July 23-August 22
Diversions are where possibilities lay. Whether it’s discovering common ground with a colleague or meeting an interesting stranger, you have good reasons to stay off the beaten track.
Virgo
August 23-September 22
Your ability to see someone else’s point of view will bring the two of you much closer. The most important thing is to share and work together as a team.
Libra
September 23-October 22
You’ll have plenty of energy for artistic pursuits. But if your masterpiece is to reach fruition, you’ll need discipline to match. You’ll also be more attentive and passionate towards your partner.
Scorpio
October 23 – November 22
Full moons are a time for closing chapters, beginning new ones and reaping the rewards of hard work. If you’ve been struggling to balance your desires, Thursday’s will help you to achieve that equilibrium.
Sagittarius
November 23-December 20
You may take a step back from a person or project you were only recently very invested in. Weigh up the pros and cons. It may seem inconvenient but could be a blessing in disguise.
Capricorn
December 21-January 19
You have immense discipline and intellectual prowess. If you’ve been having difficulty grasping a concept, finding solutions or absorbing new information, things will begin to click.
Aquarius
January 20-February 18
As the rebel of the zodiac, red tape is the enemy. But backtracking, double-checking and re-signing on the dotted line are unavoidable, so bite the bullet and don’t waste time getting frustrated.
Pisces
February 19-March 20
A situation you’ve let slide suddenly demands your undivided attention. You might initially feel unsettled but being snapped out of complacency will get you on track. Once you are, you’ll feel motivated to stay on top of things.

Today could bring unexpected responsibilities but you’ll relish the challenge. A conversation with a parent or mentor will be very helpful.
Cancer
June 22-July 22
Be clear with your intentions when it comes to your love life. A stab in the dark will cause unnecessary upheaval but a calculated risk could prove to be highly beneficial, so weigh up the odds.
Leo
July 23-August 22
Diversions are where possibilities lay. Whether it’s discovering common ground with a colleague or meeting an interesting stranger, you have good reasons to stay off the beaten track.
Virgo
August 23-September 22
Your ability to see someone else’s point of view will bring the two of you much closer. The most important thing is to share and work together as a team.
Libra
September 23-October 22

Full moons are a time for closing chapters, beginning new ones and reaping the rewards of hard work. If you’ve been struggling to balance your desires, Thursday’s will help you to achieve that equilibrium.
Sagittarius
November 23-December 20
You may take a step back from a person or project you were only recently very invested in. Weigh up the pros and cons. It may seem inconvenient but could be a blessing in disguise.
Capricorn
December 21-January 19
You have immense discipline and intellectual prowess. If you’ve been having difficulty grasping a concept, finding solutions or absorbing new information, things will begin to click.
Aquarius
January 20-February 18

Pisces
February 19-March 20
A situation you’ve let slide suddenly demands your undivided attention. You might initially feel unsettled but being snapped out of complacency will get you on track. Once you are, you’ll feel motivated to stay on top of things.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather: Temperatures to hit 23C by VE Day with blazing sunshine next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain looks set to leave the rainy weather behind this week, swapping it for blazing sun and highs of 23C at the peak.
The last week has seen grim weather, with cooler temperatures as well as heavy rain and clouds. 
But the outlook looks set to be brighter and more spring-like next week, ending in a toasty 23C on Friday for the bank holiday, according to BBC weather.
The week will begin with a dry, sunny Monday, setting a trend for the week ahead. 
Temperatures will peak on Thursday, the day before bank holiday Friday for VE Day.
The day celebrates the Allies formally accepting Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender from World War II in 1945.
The week ahead marks the UK’s seventh week in lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.  
The glorious weather may present yet another temptation to break lockdown rules, but Brits must follow government measures to stay indoors and socially distance. 
The Met Office outlook:
It’s going to be cloudy in the south and east this evening, leading into tonight, while the north-east and south-east Scotland will see outbreaks of rain, some extensive. The north-west will see clearer spells and there may be a ground frost overnight. 
It’s going to be a fairly pleasant start to the week on Monday, with mostly dry and sunny spells in the west while the south will get some fresh, easterly winds. The east won’t be so lucky with some rain and scattered showers.
It’s set to be mostly dry with sunny spells on the lead up to a warm VE Day. Tuesday will see grim weather in parts of the country, with outbreaks of rain and thunder in the south. There will be some showers on Wednesday and Thursday but those days will mostly be dry and sunny.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Texas theater chain to take your temperature as it reopens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a few states have allowed movie theaters to open to the public in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, some that are choosing to get back to business have surprising new security regulations.
One theater chain in Texas, EVO, plans on opening with an "airport security-style check-in" on Monday, EVO Entertainment Inc. CEO Mitchell Roberts told Variety Friday. This includes asking people if they have had flu symptoms or have been around someone with flu symptoms in the last 14 days along with an infrared temperature scan. If theatergoers have a temperature above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, they will be turned away. Patrons will also be required to wear masks. 
Another chain, Santikos, will require employees to wear masks, but not customers, according to Variety. Both chains will implement spaced seating and new cleaning regimens.
The CDC and top infectious disease experts recommend wearing masks as an effective way to help slow the spread of coronavirus.
While some states like New York are requiring people to wear masks in public when social distancing of at least six feet is not possible, Texas does not have the same rules.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott started allowing some establishments to reopen on Friday, including restaurants, retail shops, and movie theaters, with guidelines on limits for the amount of people that can be let in to these spaces. Movie theaters can only operate at 25 percent of their usual capacity (or 50 percent in rural counties) with employees making sure people are social distancing and regularly cleaning parts of the theaters that are frequently touched, the Texas Tribune reported. Although Texas asks that employees at restaurants wears face masks, the state has made it clear that it won't require diners and shoppers to do so. 
However, many business owners have decided to remain closed despite the state's relaxed rules. Larger theater chains like AMC and Cinemark, for example, do not plan to reopen in either state as of right now, and many restaurants have remained closed or stuck to take-out and delivery only.
Texas reported nearly 1,300 new positive cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, the second-highest daily jump since reporting started. The state has a total of about 30,100 cases. Meanwhile, Georgia has about 28,300 cases, with an increase of about 840 cases from Friday night to Saturday night. (While the jump in numbers is worrying, it can't be directly connected to reopening at this point. Both states have also ramped up testing.)

Renowned man of God and Founder of the International Christian Gospel Church (ICGC), Pastor Mensa Otabil, has hinted that for anyone who believes that God is with them, there will be storms but with God in the boat.
During his virtual Sunday service which aired live on the Global Media Alliance Broadcast(GMAbc) platforms, Happy Fm, eTV Ghana and across the Y-Triangle, he stated that currently, a lot of people are facing the storm which is the Coronavirus, but if Christians continue to believe in God, He will be with us on the boat and we will smile at the storm.
“Storms will come to test us and to test the stuff we are made of. If you really believe God is with you, then there will be a storm”, he said.
Ps. Otabil continued, “If you believe God has opened a door for you, there will be a storm. If you believe God is giving you victory in 2020, there will be a storm but with Jesus in the boat”.
The pastor preached referring to the scriptures that even with God, it is very possible that things may not go well with individuals. However, there is always the assurance that things will get better in God’s own time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horoscope: May 3-9 - Heather's Horoscope</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OVERVIEW: The sun in the sign of Taurus places a stronger focus on finances, the markets and any efforts made to stabilize. Cut losses and pull practical plans together no matter what is needed. Navigate around circumstances. Efforts made will get results on most levels. Those with power behind the scenes add some influence in the right departments as they see they will benefit from this as well. Play the long game if you can do it. Private deals will provide compensation for any up front costs. The full moon in Scorpio agitates those with intense emotions. A poker face is useful right now while negotiating terms or positions. Plan next moves.
ARIES: You can be the key player in any dealings with others as you engage and take charge.
TAURUS: Be the star near or far as your feet-on-the-ground methods calm the anxiety of others. 
GEMINI: Play cards very close to the vest. It's better if others don’t know your level of influence.
CANCER: You need all the information or evidence required to convince others to work with you. 
LEO: You shine in the eyes of others as they see what a trooper you are. Take charge if you can. 
VIRGO: A hands-on approach helps your agenda or clear your path. Brainstorm with others now. 
LIBRA: Clarify details regarding finances or assets that could also be connected jointly to them.
SCORPIO: Measure your words carefully or your intensity could alter the status quo. Just relax. 
SAGITTARIUS: Private deals are a win-win for all involved. Process everything in the right order. 
CAPRICORN: Your steady, stable personality calms others and attracts some good luck to you. 
AQUARIUS: Take a stand if you have to be the one in charge as your leadership is important.
PISCES: Play a bit of a shell game with associates for now. You need to feel your way with this.

    <h5 class="mb-1">If you’re flying Hawaiian Airlines, you’ll need a face mask going forward</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Hawaiian Airlines is making changes to in flight policies, even though air travel is the last thing on the minds of many during this pandemic.
Starting May 8, Hawaiian Airlines said passengers will need to be wearing a face mask or cloth covering for all flights.
The company said passengers will be required to wear the masks from checking in at the airport, while riding on the plane up until they deplane at their arrival destination.
The new policy is in place going forward. They added young children who are unable to keep a face covering on, or guests with certain medical conditions will be exempt from the policy.
This is a significant change from the early days of the pandemic when flight attendants worried for their safety after they said they were not allowed to use face masks in flight. There was no previous requirement for passengers.

Hawaiian Airlines has also ramped up disinfecting and cleaning their planes and are adjusting seating arrangements to practice social distancing.
The company says middle seats will no longer be assigned to passengers, and boarding will be done a few rows at a time.
“Taking care of our guests and employees has always been our primary focus, and these new health measures will help us maintain a safe travel experience, from our lobbies to our cabins, as Hawaii continues to make progress in containing COVID-19,” said Peter Ingram, president and CEO at Hawaiian Airlines.
“We appreciate our guests’ understanding and flexibility as we adapt our operations with their wellbeing guiding every decision we make,” he added.
The company, like every other airliner, has seen a dramatic drop in passengers due to the pandemic. Everyone who flies into the state or even inter-island are subject to the 14-day quarantine rules.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: What you need to know today</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1: 69; April 30: 76; April 29: 69; April 28: 74; April 27: 58; April 26: 51; April 25: 46; April 24: 57; April 23: 38; April 22: 39.
These numbers are the death tolls of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India on the 10 days between April 22 and May 1.
On May 2, the number was 98.
The total death toll in India was 1,319 on Saturday.
In some ways, this is the only number to track. In the absence of a lockdown, the number of infections would have definitely soared, as would have the death toll.
Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage
I have written previously about how data from both Mumbai and Delhi shows that the number of non-Covid-19 deaths has reduced during the lockdown. I have also written about just how difficult it will be to hide a death from that most omnipresent thing in India — a mobile phone camera. This would suggest that the number of deaths is a good metric of just how India is handling the pandemic.
There’s another reason to keep tracking this number. Most diseases are so well understood that we can work backwards from the number of deaths to find the number of those affected or infected. We don’t know enough about Covid-19 now, and the widely varying fatality rates around the world are of no help — not when, as both The New York Times and Financial Times have pointed out, based on their own analysis, the actual number of deaths from Covid-19 was much higher than those attributed to the disease. India wasn’t covered by either.
But this ignorance won’t last. We already know more about the disease than we did a month back, and every day seems to bring new answers. It also brings new questions, as it should with a disease of as recent vintage as this. In a column in The New York Times written in mid-April, Charlie Warzel asked some of these questions. More have been added to that list since (and some have been answered).
Eventually, we will know enough about the disease to arrive at a range, a narrow one, for the death rate. And then work backwards from that.
My guess is that the death rates are nowhere close to what’s being reported. The current global death rate is 7.02% of all infected people. That’s far too high. The real number is likely to be anything between 1% and 3% (again, this is a guess, not science). But this would mean that the actual number of infected people is much higher — which is plausible.
That’s actually another reason to track deaths, not number of cases.
The death tallies for the week before April 22 in India were as follows: April 21: 54; April 20: 32; April 19: 39; April 18: 32; April 17: 40; April 16: 24; April 15: 33.
Over the past forthright, then, the number of deaths has seen a steady increase but the numbers are not alarming — not yet. They are closer to Germany’s trajectory than they are to, say, that of the US.
The worrying thing is that most countries have seen the number of deaths per day follow what’s called a hockey-stick curve — gradual curve upwards, and then a steep rise. Which is why it makes sense to watch the number of daily deaths in India, especially over the next two weeks.
In more cheerful news, it turns out that Gilead’s Remdesivir, a failed hepatitis and Ebola drug, may well be a cure for Covid-19. A study in the US found that it accelerated recovery rates, although it didn’t have a huge impact on death rates (it had some). Still, that promise was enough for the US Food and Drug Administration to allow the use of the drug on Covid-19 patients.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Any time from Monday to Wednesday finds you proclaiming your heart’s desire. A sweet smile wins the day in every area of life and could even help you dodge a legal challenge, much to a rival’s annoyance. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus pandemic
The future has to be bright. With a leap and a bound you’ll soon be free, leaving behind the burdens of work and everyday responsibility, and waving goodbye to a battle with authority. Don’t take on too much, too soon, though, for you’ll have a second chance after another few months.
Mercury is doing its best, and that is cause for rejoicing. For one thing, you’ll have all the best ideas. For another, if you play your cards right, success will be served up while you hardly have to lift a finger.
The Moon will soon be in significant regions of your chart, but not just yet, and that means that you’ll have to wait a few days for social satisfaction. Your new emotional cycle is increasingly secretive, so you’ll be keeping your cards very close to your chest.
You’ve certainly been getting your slice of the action, and now you are ready to reap your share of the rewards. From Thursday onwards, life will slow down, and you’ll take the chance to reflect and weigh up the odds. Creative and artistic individuals are now experimenting with new activities at the moment right now.
You’re going through a mildly bumpy patch currently, though nothing you can’t handle. Family affairs seem to be moving along nicely, even if there have been one or two hold-ups. These, it must be said, have not been your fault. However, the final outcome in a romantic adventure will be very much to your liking.
Your romantic stars are mixed. Tuesday and Wednesday are excellent days for declaring your love, but you’ll have to put up with partners who want it all their own way: if you can’t beat them, you may as well join them. But then, you might not be in a mood to compromise.
You’re stuck in a sort of cosmic waiting room. One phase of life is over, another is waiting to begin, and in the meantime partners and lovers have it all their own way. Yet an increase in your earnings is now a definite possibility, and one which will transform your life.
These are busy days and the more time you spend on all those dull but essential routine chores, the better off you’ll be when your dreams come true, first, next month and then a couple of months later. In love, you may go for broke, insisting that a partner accepts your desires without question.
Your planetary energy is at a peak, but that doesn’t mean that everything will go with a swing. It’s preferable to arrange your own schedule so that you get the right amount of exercise, rest and healthy food. You’re about to take a long, hard look at your spending commitments.
You do love other people so much, but now you want a bit of the attention yourself. Plus, some people reckon that your guiding principle in relationships is ‘don’t do what I do, but do as I say’. However, as you may have found out, that’s not always the best recipe for peace and harmony.
A large cheque, or some other significant saving, might be on the way. Wednesday looks like your most profitable day, but any good fortune has nothing to do with luck. It’s to do with making the most of opportunities while other people waste their time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
While we have made tremendous strides fighting the coronavirus, we want to temper some of that enthusiasm as it relates to the markets as we have a long way to go until things are settled. Clearly it is good news that growth in the number of new cases of the coronavirus is cresting which will permit some states and countries to open. We believe that the pace of the recovery will be slow until we have a therapeutic, antivirals, contact tracing, more testing including antibody tests and eventually a vaccine. While we finally can see light at the end of the tunnel, we will not see a semblance of how things were until 2022.
The financial markets are fighting a tug of war between global economic weakness and tremendous liquidity to the tune of over $7 trillion having been created so far by all the monetary authorities and governments around the world. We find it amusing to listen to the pundits who constantly remain one step behind, getting bearish as markets decline and bullish when the tape is rising.
We are in a unique economic environment where we see only a handful of fundamental winners over the next few years. These companies are benefitting directly and indirectly from the new normal where we spend more time in our homes utilizing smart devices to access services heretofore done in person.
We would continue to avoid all companies needing government assistant who are in financial trouble due to the drop off in demand as a result of the coronavirus. We do not see demand for most of these companies returning to levels achieved just a few months ago until 2022 therefore profitability and balance sheets will remain challenged and at risk. Many may not even make it. We see the market tiering further over time giving higher than historic valuations to the winners in the new normal while avoiding the losers.
More than ever this is a market of stocks rather than a stock market. Active management is the only way to invest in the new normal as passive money managers will hold many of the losers that need to be avoided at all costs. It will be interesting to hear what Warren Buffett says at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) online Annual Meeting. While he is the ultimate active manager, he has sung the virtues of passive investing for years.
The global number of coronavirus cases as of Friday hit 3.28 million with 234,000 deaths while the number of cases in the U.S now exceeds 1.1 million with over 63,800 deaths. While the rate of gain has crested, we remain concerned that countries and states are opening too soon as we do not have enough testing nor is there a therapeutic available so we can feel safe. We get how hard it is for politicians to risk of opening too soon.
They have to weigh economic, social and emotional impact of not opening vs. the risk of the virus continuing to flourish and possibly resulting in death. Personally, my biggest concern is an acceleration of cases as we open, which, of course, would cause another lockdown. As we open slowly, we need to maintain strict social distancing and making the wearing masks mandatory for several more weeks.
We heard last week that Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) Covid-19 treatment Remdesivir showed encouraging results from a key U.S trial. Patients who received the drug recovered in 11 days, on average, while those taking a placebo took 15 days. Both Drs. Fauci and Hahn, after reviewing the data, said that this could be a game changer and are supporting emergency authorization by the FDA to permit its use. There was also some positive news on a vaccine from Moderna and Oxford University/Astra Zeneca (NYSE:AZN). Bill Gates, who is investing heavily in this area, went out on a limb predicting a vaccine possibly as soon as in 9 months but certainly within 18 months. There are over 100 drug companies working on therapeutics, testing and vaccines. All good stuff!
It appears that monetary authorities have unlimited capacity to provide liquidity to the financial markets. We heard last week from the Fed, BOJ, Bank of England, and the ECB that each will buy unlimited amounts of bonds in response to the coronavirus. Again, all this liquidity will not create demand which really is the only way out of the global recession/depression.
We will need - as Fed Chairman Powell and ECB President Lagarde both said - major fiscal spending programs to boost demand while also providing money to individuals/companies to make it to the other side. We expect our government to implement Phase 4 and 5 programs as needed to supplement individual incomes and provide money to small/medium size businesses to stay afloat rather than filing bankruptcy.
Bonds spreads continue to narrow which shows that monetary policy has provided enough liquidity to assuage market concerns. The bond market is operating very efficiently permitting companies to raise money up to 100 basis points better than expected. Boeing's 25 billion offerings were oversubscribed by 3-4 to 1. U.S high-grade bond issuance continues to set new records each week. All good news!
We focus on long term profitable investing with a 12- to 24-month time frame. The market environment remains favorable as the Fed is providing so much excess liquidity not needed by the real economy such that it is pushing investors further out on the risk curve. We always maintain cash reserves knowing that the market could have a correction at any time providing opportunities to add to our portfolios at lower prices. We believe that the U.S economy will be bottoming out shortly which is good news even though we think the recovery will be an elongated U.
Not all stocks are equal. Corporations have never faced an environment like this so it is important to listen to earnings calls so you can differentiate the winners from the losers. Especially in today's environment, you need to focus on management, strategies, and financial strength. Avoid at all cost companies with demand and financial problems as it will last well into 2021 at a minimum.
We continue to focus on the winners in the new normal. Our list includes companies whose business models are mostly tied to the web/internet/data centers where usage has gone through the roof. Our positive view on these companies was supported by their first quarter earnings reports and conference calls which demonstrated all their favorable short- and long-term strengths. The best is yet to come for each of them. The Democrats are proposing an $80 billion-dollar bill to promote broadband expansion and buying smart devices for all that cannot afford them. 5G will play a major role as the next generation for cellular technology. If you can, listen to the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) conference call. We also added a financial and an industrial. Both are best in class and will gain market share/profitability as we move through the other side.
We do not own bonds, the dollar nor private equity funds.
Finally, we would hope that all countries work together investigating the origin of the coronavirus rather than doing it individually.
Remember to review all the facts; pause, reflect and consider mindset shifts; turn off your cable news; do independent research listening to the earnings calls and… Invest Accordingly!
Our weekly webinar will be held on Monday May 4th at 8:30 am EST.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Employers Could Terminate Your 401(k) Plan Due to COVID-19. What to Do if It Happens.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic has essentially brought the economy to a standstill, causing thousands of businesses to close their doors and resulting in millions of layoffs. The organizations that are fortunate enough to stay open have also faced challenges, many of them experiencing cash flow problems as more Americans are asked to stay home.
As a result of these budget strains, some organizations have opted to slash employee benefits, including 401(k) plans. While some companies have simply suspended employer-matching contributions, others have decided to terminate their plans altogether to save money. Here's what to do if that happens to you.
The good news is that relatively few organizations are ditching their 401(k) plans entirely. Only around 1.3% of companies said they plan to terminate their 401(k) plan due to COVID-19, according to a recent survey from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. Approximately 16% are temporarily suspending matching contributions, and nearly 77% said they're not planning on making any changes at all to their plans.
However, the not-so-good news is that workers may not be in the clear just yet. Small businesses, in particular, are at a higher risk of facing financial problems as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, so they may be more likely to have to make changes to their 401(k) plans if money gets tight.
Approximately 42% of small businesses might be at risk of eliminating their 401(k) plans due to COVID-19, according to a report from the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries. That's around 216,000 retirement plans that are at risk of termination, the report revealed.
If your 401(k) plan is terminated, or you're concerned it might be in the future, you can still save for retirement. You have other options, and you shouldn't need to put your retirement plans on hold if you lose your 401(k).
You don't need a 401(k) plan to save for retirement, and if you lose your plan through your employer, you have a couple of options: Roll your money into a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, or withdraw your cash.
The option to avoid is withdrawing money from your 401(k). When you withdraw your savings from your 401(k) before age 59-1/2, you're typically faced with a 10% penalty and income taxes on the amount you withdraw. Under the CARES Act, the 10% penalty is temporarily waived, but you'll still need to pay income taxes on your distribution, although you do have three years to pay these taxes, thanks to the new regulations. If you have a significant amount of cash in your 401(k), though, that can be a hefty tax bill.
In addition, by withdrawing your cash now, you're taking away your money's growth potential. Your retirement investments need as much time as possible to compound, and if you stick them in a checking or savings account, you're essentially pressing pause on your retirement strategy.
To avoid withdrawing your savings, you can either roll your money over into a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Both are strong options, and they differ in one key aspect: Taxes. With a traditional IRA, you'll get a tax deduction when you make the initial contribution, but you'll have to pay income taxes on your withdrawals. With a Roth IRA, you'll pay taxes now, but your distributions will be tax-free.
You can't go wrong with either option, but right now might be a particularly good time to opt for a Roth IRA. You will need to pay income taxes on the amount you roll into your Roth account, but because the stock market has taken a tumble over the past few months, you probably don't have as much in your 401(k) right now as you did a few months ago. That means if you convert to a Roth now, your tax bill will be smaller -- and your retirement withdrawals will be tax-free. If you opt for a traditional IRA, you won't pay any taxes right now, but you may face a higher tax bill in retirement when you start making withdrawals.
COVID-19 has turned the world upside down and affected nearly every aspect of our lives, and it's also having an impact on 401(k) plans. However, even if your 401(k) is eliminated, you don't have to let it derail your retirement. By rolling your money over into a new account, you can ensure your plans stay on track.
