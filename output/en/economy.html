    <h5 class="mb-1">Morning mail: ABC warns cuts ahead, 'happy hypoxia', mourning at a distance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 4 April.
A new report shows that the ABC has lost $783m in funding since the Coalition came to power in 2014. Despite a hiatus in implementing budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the ABC’s managing director, David Anderson, has warned staff he will unveil measures to meet the shortfall at the end of July.
A survey has found that most Australians want government, not business, to lead the post-pandemic recovery. Ninety-five Australians have now died after contracting Covid-19. The poll by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, shows two in three Australians believe the government should take the lead in sustaining the economy, and almost four in five said they trust the government to give clear and accurate advice on the pandemic. On Sunday the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, said he “overstepped the mark” when criticising the Victorian government over schools earlier in the day. A Melbourne primary school will be closed for three days after a teacher was infected with coronavirus.
The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has claimed there is “enormous evidence” the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory. He didn’t provide any of the alleged evidence and the claim is an escalation in rhetoric about the origins of the pandemic. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken of his dramatic stay in intensive care, saying it was a 50-50 decision on whether he should be ventilated, and revealing that plans were drawn up about how to announce his death. UK ministers face ongoing criticism about coronavirus testing, with daily tests dropping below a goal of 100,000, and more people are now in hospital with coronavirus in the north-west of England than in London. Spain and Italy, two of the European countries hardest hit by coronavirus, are beginning to emerge from strict lockdowns, but Russia and Afghanistan have reported their biggest one-day rises in new infections.
The Australian government will offer $300m to boost hydrogen investment under clean energy financing. The government will change the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, directing it to make up to $300m available for a new Advancing Hydrogen Fund. The move comes ahead of other changes the government is planning to the CEFC’s investment program. Australia’s energy ministers signed off on a national hydrogen strategy in November when the Coag energy council met for the first time in more than 12 months.
The coal industry in NSW and Queensland is using as much water as all of Sydney’s households, new research shows. The report was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation and used public data to examine the impact of coalmining on water resources.
A byelection in the NSW seat of Eden-Monaro will take place in a political scene utterly transformed since the federal election a year ago. The battle for the traditionally marginal seat is a first test for the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as the Coalition hopes to pull off the rare feat of gaining a seat while in government.
Google Australia says the search engine is the internet-age equivalent of a newspaper poster in a newsagent’s window. The local arm of Google is responding to the government’s claim that Australian news content is lucrative for tech titans.
Doctors have reported a mysterious phenomenon in coronavirus patients they are calling “happy hypoxia”: patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death. It is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients
A global coalition of artists, scientists and celebrities are urging Brazil’s leaders to take immediate action to save the country’s indigenous peoples from a Covid-19 “genocide”. In an open letter to Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, the group warns the pandemic poses an extreme threat to the survival of indigenous communities in the Amazon.
Benjamin Netanyahu could be barred from forming a government after Israel’s high court began assessing petitions that seek to obstruct the prime minister because he is under criminal indictment.
Syria’s richest man and the first cousin of President Bashar al-Assad has exacerbated a spectacular falling out with the Syrian leader – accusing him of sending security forces to arrest his employees and take over his business. Rami Makhlouf is accused by the US and EU of bankrolling the Syrian regime.
It’s time to radically rethink public toilets. Public health experts, designers and architects say the pandemic has exposed fundamental flaws in their design that risk spreading a second wave of coronavirus – or new, future pandemics. As Elias Visontay writes, some suggested innovations include more sensor taps, self-cleaning cubicles, and exits that don’t require human contact.
Mourning at a distance is complicating the rituals of grief. Natasha Seymour discovered this firsthand when her maternal grandfather died. Without the ceremony of grief, how do we mark change? In the hours after his death, she didn’t focus on her feelings – she was too busy trying to process the logistics of attending the funeral, with limits on the number of people who can attend, and the prospect of quarantining while travelling interstate.
As our worlds have become smaller and smaller in lockdown, babies are the rare individuals learning and growing while confined to the home. Tom Whyman has realised that the best thing about lockdown is his nine-month-old baby, who “becomes more of a little person every day”. Despite the pressure of working from home and being unable to go outside or have any childcare help, looking after his child is the best part of his day.
Is remdesivir an effective treatment for Covid-19? Full Story looks at the experimental treatment, which was hailed as a breakthrough last week. It will be trialled in Australia – but some experts urge caution and say serious questions remain to be answered.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sold its entire holdings in U.S. airlines in the wake of the coronavirus that has led to a virtual standstill of the industry and revenue losses in the billions.
Buffet revealed the news to shareholders on Saturday, according to a Reuters report, which included that the conglomerate had some $7 to $8 billion invested in the airline industry:
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business,” Buffet said. “We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. We will not fund a company that — where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.”
Bershire had already sold 18 percent of its Delta stake and four percent of Southwest shares, it announced on April 3.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s virtual annual meeting. “I am the one who made the decision.”
“Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines,” Reuters reported. “He did invest in USAir in 1989.”
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in 2007. “Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Life has never been the same again’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The medical personnel who are in the forefront of the battle against coronavirus carry a greater risk as chances of getting infected are high. Moreover, working in COVID-19 hospitals, treating patients in the ICU and helping them to come to terms with a life completely changed, is an altogether new ball game for them.
Thirty-year-old Sowmya Basanthi, a staff nurse working at the Government General Hospital, Guntur, has been on duty for the last 30 days and for the past two weeks, she has been serving at the COVID Intensive Care Unit.
Unusual experience
For Ms. Basanthi this is an unusual experience trying to balance the family, nursing a three-year-old daughter and working in six-hour shifts daily at the ICU. She gets support from her husband, a PH.D scholar, and her in-laws.
"Along with other nurses, I started duties on March 23. After the initial training sessions, we were allotted duties and life has never been the same again. Though we have been following the medical protocol since swine flu outbreak, wearing masks, PPE kits and gloves, the COVID protocol is different. Personally, I began to take precautions by keeping all my keys and personal belongings in a separate bag, washing myself and sanitising all our belongings. Since I have a small child, I took extra precautions," says Ms. Basanthi. She works from 8 am to 2 pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Some small businesses that got aid fear the rules too much to spend it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When a $192,000 loan from the federal government’s small-business aid program arrived in his bank account last month, George Evageliou, the founder of a custom woodworking company, felt like one of the lucky ones.
Under the program’s rules, Evageliou has eight weeks from the day he received the cash to spend it. But nearly three weeks after the clock started on April 14, he hasn’t used a penny.
His quandary? If Evageliou wants his loan to be forgiven, he must spend three-quarters of it paying the 16 workers he laid off from Urban Homecraft, his Brooklyn business, in late March. But bringing his workers back now, when they can’t work in their fabrication shop or install woodwork in clients’ homes, won’t help his business. And if New York City remains shut when his eight weeks are up in mid-June, Evageliou would have to lay off his employees again — something he wants to spare them.
The government has “made this so hard to use,” he said. “It starts to feel like a lose-lose situation.”
The $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program was meant to extend a lifeline to small businesses battered by the pandemic, allowing them to keep employees on the payroll. But it has been dogged by problems. Countless small businesses couldn’t get money, and hundreds of millions of dollars instead flowed to publicly traded companies.
Now many of the small businesses that did get loans are sitting on the money, unsure about whether and how to spend it. That’s compromising the effectiveness of a program meant to help stabilise the country’s reeling economy.
Some owners don’t see the point of hiring back workers when business is so slow. Others chafe at having to use the money within eight weeks, when they would like to keep the financial cushion for longer. And many of the owners are confused about whether they have any flexibility. They would rather use the cash to retool their operations for an altered world or buy protective equipment for workers, but the rules require them to spend it on specific expenses, like payroll.
Owners also say they are afraid of running afoul of the program’s rules, which are complicated, ambiguous and still evolving. Accountants, lawyers and lenders are struggling to understand the nuances and offering clients tentative guidance.
“It’s chaos,” said Howard Berkower, a New York lawyer who advises corporate clients. “It’s impossible for businesses to have any degree of comfort that they’re following the rules when the rules are still being written.”
The $2 trillion CARES Act, which created the program, specifies that small businesses — generally those with fewer than 500 employees — can use the loan money to pay employees, but also for rent, utilities or interest payments. The loans will be forgiven if they are spent on those expenses within eight weeks and the business keeps paying the same number of employees, at the same rate, as it did before the pandemic.
The Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration, which is running the program, added a restriction: For a loan to be forgivable, businesses have to spend at least 75% of it on payroll. Otherwise, the rules say, the borrower will pay interest of 1% on any portion of the loan that is not forgiven.
But what’s unclear is what happens if borrowers keep all the money as a loan to be used later or if they must spend the entire sum within eight weeks, with an economic turnaround still months away.
Take Jodi Burns, the owner of Blazing Fresh Donuts in Guilford, Connecticut. Burns could use the loan she got — an amount under $50,000 — to hire back her eight employees, but she would be paying most of them to stay home, since the bakery is open only 12 hours a week these days. She would prefer to hold on to the cash beyond eight weeks; her hope is that it becomes a low-interest loan she can use for payroll and rent when her shop is open longer.
Burns doesn’t know whether she can do that. She has called her local SBA office, small-business advisory organisations, a law firm and her lender to ask for guidance, but no one has given her any assurances. Moreover, having signed documents requiring her to use the funds for purposes allowed under the paycheck program’s rules, Burns is nervous about misusing them.
“I don’t accidentally want to commit bank fraud,” she said.
Many lawyers are telling small-business owners that they think the loans can be used broadly, although no one is certain. Some bankers are reasoning that since the aid program is based on existing SBA programs that are more flexible, the pandemic loans will be, too.
“As long as they’re using the funding for the operating expenses of the business, our interpretation — and we think it’s clear — is yes, you can use it as effectively a working capital loan,” said John Asbury, the chief executive of Atlantic Union Bankshares, a community lender in Richmond, Virginia.
But officials at Treasury and the SBA won’t confirm that interpretation. Asked repeatedly if companies can simply hold on to the money for now because paying employees doesn’t make sense to them, an SBA spokeswoman would say only that the funds must be used for purposes “consistent with the Paycheck Protection Program.”
Ryan Hurst, a partner at RKL, an accounting and advisory firm, said the program had been put together hastily and remained murky on critical issues. “Every day I’m sitting at my computer, hitting refresh multiple times a day, hoping we’ll get more guidance from Treasury and the SBA,” he said.
Since the SBA has not provided lenders with customised application forms, many banks are using a generic document with provisions that do not apply to the paycheck program.
Dutchess Maye, the owner of eduConsulting Firm, an educational services provider in Raleigh, North Carolina, received a contract from her bank that made no mention of having her $20,000 loan forgiven.
Maye, who plans to use the money for payroll, balked at signing a legal document that didn’t seem to describe the forgivable loan she thought she was getting. Her business has no debt, and the idea of incurring any — especially as the economy is nose-diving — spooked her.
“I felt it was predatory,” she said.
She called her lender, which assured her that the loan would be eligible for forgiveness, but the representative she spoke with told her that the bank had no idea yet what the process would be. In the end, reluctant to risk missing out on badly needed aid, she signed. But Maye plans to set $20,000 from her savings aside for a few months as a reserve.
“I had to have a backup plan in order to take the money, in case I have to pay it back,” she said.
Coyote Ugly, an international chain of honky-tonk bars made famous by the 2000 movie of the same name, is sitting on its loan money. The company’s American bars have been closed since mid-March. Bartenders and security staff were laid off immediately, but the bars’ managers were kept on.
Through a small Louisiana bank, nine of the company’s bars in the United States applied for loans “because they were there,” said Jeff Wiseman, Coyote Ugly’s general counsel. At the time, executives figured the economy might reopen before the loans came due, in which case the money could be used for payroll and overhead like rent.
The bars’ loan applications — ranging from $40,000 to $120,000 — were approved in mid-April. By then it had become clear that Coyote Ugly would not be serving customers for a long time. Some locations might never reopen.
On April 18, Liliana Lovell, the company’s founder and chief executive, told managers that most of them were being furloughed. Some were furious to be let go just as the company was granted the federal loans.
Lovell and Wiseman acknowledged those grievances, but said Coyote Ugly hadn’t had much choice. They didn’t see the point in paying managers to sit around in empty bars, and in any case the funds would be exhausted within a couple of pay cycles. Their understanding was that if Coyote Ugly used most of the money for purposes other than payroll, like buying personal protective gear or cleaning supplies, the company would have to repay the loans with interest, further weakening its precarious finances.
And so the hundreds of thousands of dollars remain deposited in Coyote Ugly’s bank accounts, unused.
“It’s important for us to sit and wait,” Lovell wrote in an email on Thursday to the laid-off managers.
Even borrowers who are happy with their aid see it as a temporary fix.
Erik Anderson is a co-owner of a string of high-end hair salons for men, Scissors and Scotch, which has locations in several Midwestern cities. He and his partners, along with their franchisees, all got relief money and used it to pay employees, rent and utilities at their stores while they remained shuttered.
Now, some of the states where Scissors and Scotch has locations are slowly reopening. But fewer stylists can work in the salons at once, and fewer customers will be allowed in. Everyone has to wear a mask. The salons’ aid money will help supplement their stylists’ earnings, since few, if any, of them will be able to work full 35-hour weeks.
Anderson’s understanding is that he is not allowed to use money from the small-business program for work like reconfiguring his spaces, he said. He hopes more aid will be coming if he needs it — or his company may not survive.
When the loans run out, Anderson asked, “what are we supposed to do then?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nigerian actors, practitioners lament coronavirus impact on movie industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The immediate effects of coronavirus on the Nigerian movie industry are already being felt.
When President Muhammadu Buhari’s first announced a 14-day national lockdown on March 31 to combat COVID-19, it abruptly halted the activities of industries across Nigeria.
Those immediately impacted by the lockdown directive include the Nigerian film industry and its workforce, which largely survives on daily wages.
Many Nigerian filmmakers like ‘Omoni Oboli who was shooting a new Tv series, ‘Last Year Single’, had to halt the production abruptly.
The COVID-19 outbreak has, no doubt, sparked a dramatic first for movie industries across the world. As the lockdown persists, filmmakers are screening their movies for free on online platforms like YouTube.
A Nigerian filmmaker, Kayode Kasum, recently premiered his 2018 movie project,’ ‘Oga Bolaji’ on YouTube for free.
The likes of Kasum have found a way to monetise their works by uploading some of their classics on YouTube.
His counterparts in the U.S have also resorted to streaming their films online since cinema houses might not be reopening anytime soon.
Nigerian cinema operators count losses
As cinemas and movie theatres remain closed across the world, the global box office revenues have dropped significantly.
Online streaming sites like Showmax and Netflix are experiencing Coronavirus-led subscriber growth.
Netflix added 15.8 million new subscribers during the three months that ended on March 31. A financial advice platform, fool.com, said the figure was more than double the company’s own estimate of seven million new additions.
But while movie streaming sites owners rake in cool cash this period, film exhibitors are counting losses.
Cinema Exhibitors Association of Nigeria (CEAN) said they have lost as much as 30 per cent of their weekend revenues since January.
According to them, between January 17 and 19 Nigerian cinemas grossed N75.9m. The figures dropped by 20.8 per cent to N60.1 million by the first weekend of February.
At the beginning of March, the figures dwindled further to N54.9 million, and two weeks after, the figures stood at N45,283,647.
Nigerian cinema exhibitors and operators say the industry’s revenue dropped by as much as 30.65 per cent between January and March 2020.
There is no respite for now as the Coronavirus pandemic has already taken a huge toll on the industry.
PREMIUM TIMES also interviewed three Nigerian actors about the impact of the coronavirus on filmmaking.
Actor and filmmaker, Segun Arinze
I had so many projects I was working on. It’s just like any other business, we always have something going on that must have been affected by this lockdown in one way or the other.
I had a lot of things I’ve kept on hold because we just have to follow instructions and we hope this will end soon so that we can go back to our daily routine.
I can’t say this has not affected our income as actors but it’s not every part of filmmaking that we do outdoors.
Just like you’re doing your own work now, we have things we do from home like scriptwriting, we have meetings and conferences online.
A while ago, I was having an online class with some of my students. However, the lockdown has actually affected many of our actors, financially.
Even before the lockdown, some of them have had to stop acting because of Ill-health or other things. In circumstances like these, some actors don’t have money to fall back on.
That is why I have been talking about having residual money in the industry. I plan to speak with the president of the actors’ guild about this. There are countries where actors employ this means to help their colleagues out.
Yoruba actor, Funsho Adeolu
I just finished on a movie set when the lockdown started. I was at home preparing to go on another set. Unfortunately, we can no longer go on sets because of the lockdown. For an actor that is always working, the lockdown is really boring for me. There’s no work to do and nowhere important to go.
As a celebrity, people are always flocking into your house to ask for money and food. Because I know these things affect us at varying degrees, I do my best for them.
People will see you on the road and expect you to drop something, whereas, we are not even making any money at the moment.
Acting is not like civil service where your salary comes in, whether you work or not. Here, you have to work to make money. Not everybody finds it easy, even before the lockdown.
That is why, I do my best to reach out to people every month, especially the elderly actors that cannot work as much or at all. I pick at least two every month and reach out to them, as much as I can.
I still do that and I encourage a few people that I can talk to, to do it as well. If we all make little efforts like that, it will eventually become big. It has gotten to a point where we cannot continue to look up to the government to do things for us. We have to take responsibility and pick things up by ourselves.
Actor, Yemi Solade
Is it important to ask these questions now? You guys will sell your papers. You’re not bringing palliative measures to say let’s give to these people and you want me to start telling you how I’m coping with the lockdown? Why don’t you tell me how you’re coping first?
Let’s just leave my projects and all for now. I’m not interested until COVID-19 is over.
You’ll sell your newspaper, there’s nothing I’m going to benefit from telling you about these things. You’re earning a salary, I’m not. Nobody is going to pay me anything. No palliative has been offered to me so I don’t see what I’m going to benefit talking to you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On World Press Freedom day, stories of journalism without fear or favour by ThePrint</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Sunday marks World Press Freedom Day, a day significant for journalists and a reminder to the world that there is nothing worth defending more than freedom.
This year’s theme is ‘Journalism without Fear or Favour’, an idea that is especially significant in the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, when the press has been declared an essential service, and journalists are part of the frontline battle, bringing stories on everything to do with the coronavirus.
At ThePrint, our reporters have been travelling for the past month, from hotspot to hotspot across states to bring you news on the pandemic. We’ve reported from several districts across states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.
In our travels, two of our own, National Photo Editor Praveen Jain and reporter Simrin Sirur contracted the virus. They are asymptomatic, and are currently in quarantine in Vadodara.
If you’ve missed our earlier reports, here is a quick round up from our journalists on the ground.
Covering Ahmedabad was the most difficult part of our Rajasthan-Gujarat trip, because officials were reluctant to speak to the press and the hotspots we visited hadn’t been frequented by anybody in the recent past.
Upon seeing the press, people in these neighbourhoods rushed towards us, telling us stories of lack of ration and not enough testing by authorities. It was heartening to see neighbours caring for one another, and pooling in their resources to make sure no one went hungry.
The real challenge, though, has been collecting the stories as quickly as possible while reminding others to keep their distance. The process can be nerve-wracking because you never know who carries the virus and who doesn’t.
You can read her report here.
Apprehension, fear and uncertainty greeted me as I embarked on a journey to Uttar Pradesh from Delhi to cover the Covid-19 crisis.
While I had seen pictures of migrants being beaten up by police at bus stations, or many standing in queues to get food, the enormity of the situation struck me when I saw scores of them walking or cycling over 1,000 km to reach their homes in UP and Bihar.
The only food they were carrying were packets of biscuits and water to quench their thirst. Carrying big bags on their heads, they were determined to reach their homes.
Along with my colleague and photographer Suraj Singh Bisht, we listened to their ordeal with many complaining of blood oozing out of their blisters. Many even asked us to request the police to not beat them up.
While we faced quite a few difficulties in getting accommodation, food and were denied entry to many places, it seemed nothing compared to what these migrant workers were going through.
You can read her full report here.
In the past week, I journeyed from Delhi to Agra, on to Lucknow, then Varanasi and I am now heading to Patna. Wherever I travelled with my colleague Neelam Pandey, the common sight was migrant labourers and workers trudging along on national highways, either on foot or on bicycles, trying to make it back to their villages.
We spoke with many of them, only to constantly hear about them starving and worried about money. The lockdown, in one move, left thousands of them without jobs. Many openly wept, talking about how their families were struggling to manage two square meals a day for their children. This was particularly heart wrenching for me to see.
We helped some people out by giving them money and whatever food, such as biscuits and fruits, we had.
This has been an experience for me to see how quickly life can change.
When my colleague Soniya Agarwal and I arrived in Indore, a city that has among the highest number of cases in India, we found an administration that was scrambling to implement a massive sampling exercise.
But the story that shook me the most was the drastic rise in the number of burials in Muslim cemeteries. These were mostly non-Covid patients who had been denied treatment by hospitals amid the uncertainty — a testimony of the innumerable lives that the pandemic has cut short.
When Angana and I were in Bhopal, we worked on a story about the deaths of people who had survived the 1984 Bhopal gas leak. While we were determined to reach different spots and report from there, for one of our daily vlogs, we decided to shoot from inside the Union Carbide factory.
After a long detour, we finally reached the site, only to be turned away by two guards. They said we would require a written permit from the District Collector. The building wore an eerie, dilapidated look and it seemed like no one had been there in ages.
After much deliberation, we managed to sneak into the premise from a hole in the perimeter wall locals had made. While it may seem mundane, the entire process took us two hours.
Covering this pandemic on the ground has meant dealing with fear first hand. At Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi, traders were scared that they had already been infected and essentially crowded around my mic when I went to speak to them. They were at least 30 of them vying for a chance to be heard. In that moment, I realised my first task as a journalist — spreading information on the ground. I put the camera and mic down and explained the importance of social distancing before I heard their stories.
You can read her full story here.
When the shelter home at Kashmere Gate in New Delhi was burnt down on 11 April, hundreds of people took to the banks of the Yamuna for shelter amid the Covid-19 lockdown. They had no roof over their heads, nothing to eat and survived on the daily langar from the nearby gurdwara. One person I interviewed (at Yamuna Pushta) pleaded for help and asked if this story would make his case to go back to his family in Bihar.
You can read the full story here.
I have spent the past month covering the Covid crisis in India. One of my initial assignments was at Bhilwara, a hotspot in Rajasthan, with my colleague Swagata Yadavar. To say I was anxious and nervous would be an understatement. From then, up until recently when I was at Jahangirpuri in Delhi, another hotspot area, I’ve noticed a change in me. I am not longer that afraid, and my paranoia has gradually turned into cautiousness. These experiences helped me change my attitude towards the “invisible enemy“, and I believe I have grown stronger as a journalist.
I have been working as a journalist for less than a year. So when I travelled to Punjab to cover the coronavirus crisis there, not only was I nervous since it was my first outstation assignment, but the experience was laced with the fear of being infected.
As my colleague Urjita Bhardwaj and I covered coronavirus stories in Punjab, the story of how a small district in the state kept the virus at bay for 28 days really stood out for me. In a world where bad news is most of the news, bringing out a positive story like this feels just as important.
While visiting crowded bastis and residential areas in various districts of Punjab, especially Malerkotla, one thing became quite clear — journalists on the field are one of the most vulnerable sections, coming in direct contact with people they aren’t sure are infected by Covid-19.
As people flocked around me, I could not help but think about the worrisome news of 53 journalists testing positive. So, the fear loomed large over my head every minute. Despite taking all the recommended precautions, you can never tell when the ‘invisible enemy’ will catch hold of you.
 
Manisha Mondal and I were among the first journalists from outside the state to reach the industrial town of Bhilwara in the last week of March when it had 25 cases and India had just 649.
For over 10 days, the city was under a strict lockdown and its borders were sealed and each house surveyed for possible suspects. The efficiency of the operation which would later be championed as the ‘Bhilwara model’ in isolating suspects, testing, treating and ensuring seamless supply of essentials, was impressive. I was glad we were the first ones to report from the ground on the model that would later be implemented across the country.
Read her full account here.
Barely a few days after the lockdown was first implemented, Praveen Jain and I set out to cover the massive reverse migration of daily wage labourers. We saw people from everywhere being uprooted overnight after years of painstaking effort and hard work to build a life in the city.
However, what was most unbearable was seeing children and pregnant women, some as advanced as eight months, walk barefoot on the road that was scorched in the sunlight. Many of them had developed blisters.
At many points on our route to Uttar Pradesh, we were stopped by authorities. At these times, we noticed how social distancing wasn’t strictly followed as well as the lack of other measures such as use of mask and sanitisers.
It was also heartbreaking when were forbidden from distributing food and/or water to the migrants we spoke to. This was to avoid huge crowds gathering in one place.
This was while hundreds of migrants have been camping at bus stops, hospital and petrol pumps across cities hoping for help or a way back home.
Reporting amid a lockdown doesn’t just mean restricted movement, it also means having to face a highly hostile environment where authorities will do whatever they can to curtail access.
In mid-April, I learnt how many ‘lockdown violators’ were being kept in shelter homes meant for migrant workers and the homeless. These alleged violators had a home in Delhi, but were being kept in a hostage-like situation, away from their families. Despite repeated attempts to bar our entry into such shelter homes, we managed to report on their trauma.
While reporting from Nizamuddin Markaz, the coronavirus hotspot in New Delhi, it was challenging to bring out an original on-ground story amid countless reports over the government’s negligence and the communalisation of the Tablighi Jamaat’s congregation. Soon, I stumbled across a Delhi government-approved shelter which was housing over 300 migrants living in close proximity instead of practicing social distancing, despite being a stone’s throw from the hotspot. The administration’s negligence reinstated my belief that press freedom is important, especially in times like these.
You can read her full report here.
On 30 April, my colleague Manisha Mondal and I went to cover the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara’s community kitchen, which has been cooking for and delivering food to around 75,000 people, including migrant workers and the poor. A police officer had stopped us at the entry gate, asking us to get a written permission from the deputy commissioner of police (DCP).
He refused to listen to us when we explained that the gurdwara wasn’t under the government’s administration and if the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management was allowing us, we shouldn’t need a police permit.
When we did go to the DCP’s office, we were told no such permission was required. This whole exercise meant we wasted an hour trying to chase an unnecessary permit.
We eventually had to return the next day to cover the story.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTube terminates David Icke’s account</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.
The video service, owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.
“Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke’s page from their site on Friday.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who claim Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30 million times.
“We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke’s channel,” said CCDH’s chief executive Imran Ahmed.
“However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke’s content (and) need to be removed.”
They asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.
“Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket: England's 'stir-crazy' Roy happy to play behind closed doors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: England's Jason Roy is ready to play in empty stadiums if the post-coronavirus situation demands so, said the opener who got a taste of it in his last outing.
Roy played a Pakistan Super League match on Mar 7 which took place behind closed doors in Lahore just before the pandemic halted international sports across the globe.
"There was no atmosphere, simple as that," the Durban-born batsman, a key figure in England's World Cup winning squad last year, told British media.
"It was very strange. As a batsman when the bowler’s running in you learn to block out the crowd, but as soon as the ball is done you can hear them going absolutely berserk.
"(In Lahore) there was just dead silence. You could hear your mate calling ones and twos, so you don’t just have to work off each other’s body language. It was hard to get up for it. But it was something we knew we had to deal with."
Playing without fans has been suggested as one possible way to resume cricket as soon as the pandemic subsides and Roy was ready to adjust.
"I'm more than happy to play behind closed doors. It would just be nice to get out there. I feel like a kid again," he said, adding he was "going a bit stir crazy" in the shutdown.
The global health crisis and the restrictions it has forced have clouded the outlook for this year's Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in Australia.
"If players aren’t able to prepare in the right way and are unable to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it," Roy said of the tournament scheduled in October-November.
"But if it goes ahead and we’re told we have three weeks to prepare all the boys will be putting in the hard yards to make sure we’re ready."

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘A buying spree of epic proportions’: How the Federal Reserve bucked precedent and forever changed its role in the US economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Reserve is no longer the central bank it used to be.
In a matter of weeks, the steadily expanding US economy slipped into its worst recession in nearly a century. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, spending froze, and credit health tanked. While the Fed’s response began with its traditional financial-crisis playbook – pushing interest rates to the floor and buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities – a shift was brewing.
Then, on March 20, the monetary authority’s role changed. The Fed announced it would begin buying corporate bonds for the first time in its 107-year history, offering aid for cash-strapped businesses large and small. That facility marked a paradigm shift to the central bank’s code and separated the Fed from its originally intended role in the US economy.
“The big concern is that the line between the function of the Fed and the Treasury is getting blurred,” Bruce Mizrach, professor of economics at Rutgers University, said, adding past bailouts, commercial or municipal, were handled by the latter and not the former.
He added: “That’s a larger function than what was envisioned for the Fed, and once you assume those responsibilities, it then becomes harder to back away.”
Until the financial crisis, the Fed’s primary tool was its benchmark interest rate. When the 2008 meltdown hit and rates were pushed to zero, the Fed turned to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and other unconventional assets.
To combat the coronavirus downturn the central bank expanded its toolbox once more. The Fed’s corporate bond purchases were initially exclusive to investment-grade debt before an expansion incorporated so-called fallen angels, companies that recently slipped from high-quality ratings to junk status.
“The use of high-yield purchases is designed explicitly to say, ‘look, if you were an investment-grade company before March 223 and you got downgraded because of COVID, that shouldn’t have happened,'” Lauren Goodwin, economist at New York Life Investments, said in an interview.
The Fed’s own leaders have acknowledged the shift, with Dallas branch president Robert Kaplan telling Fox Business on Friday that the bank’s role includes serving as “a lender of last resort.”

Still, experts worry that the move into risky debt purchases will make an eventual recovery more turbulent than usual. The Fed doesn’t want to be seen as impeding market dynamics, but its move from stable Treasury bonds to corporate credit has already changed valuations across the board.
In the days following the Fed’s March 23 announcement, corporate bonds retraced sharp declines. The stock market enjoyed an indirect boost, as investors viewed the policy as a strong backstop for risk assets.
“The problem with official intervention in markets is you’re no longer letting the market determine prices. So what is the right valuation?” Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon, said, adding “the possibility that the Fed will broaden the scope of its interventions” is even affecting prices in sectors ineligible for Fed lending.
Even if market valuations normalize and account for the Fed’s policy, closing its facilities in the wake of the economic downturn will drive violent price swings all over again, Goodwin warned.
“The rollback of these programs and the timing of that rollback is going to be an enormous focus for investors and it will absolutely prompt market volatility,” she said.
Where some are worried about the scope of the Fed’s latest measures, others point to their size as a serious long-term risk.
Through quantitative easing programs from 2010 to 2015, the Fed’s balance sheet roughly doubled to $4.5 trillion. It took until September 2019 to unwind about $800 billion from its balance sheet, yet the subsequent repo crisis and coronavirus pandemic undid four years of progress in a matter of weeks. From February 24 to April 27, the Fed added another $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet.
The race to pad markets resulted in “a buying spree of epic proportions,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a Tuesday note. The central bank’s purchases show no signs of stopping, with five of its nine lending facilities yet to begin operations. Experts expect the Fed’s holdings to land between $7 trillion $10 trillion by the end of the year, dwarfing the expansion seen during the financial crisis.

Reversing the balance sheet explosion poses its own threat.

The central bank must also gain approval from the Treasury to close its lending facilities, and the department’s leaders may decide against pulling back on corporate aid.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'A buying spree of epic proportions': How the Federal Reserve bucked precedent and forever changed its role in the US economy, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Reserve is no longer the central bank it used to be.
In a matter of weeks, the steadily expanding US economy slipped into its worst recession in nearly a century. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, spending froze, and credit health tanked. While the Fed’s response began with its traditional financial-crisis playbook – pushing interest rates to the floor and buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities – a shift was brewing.
Then, on March 20, the monetary authority’s role changed. The Fed announced it would begin buying corporate bonds for the first time in its 107-year history, offering aid for cash-strapped businesses large and small. That facility marked a paradigm shift to the central bank’s code and separated the Fed from its originally intended role in the US economy.
“The big concern is that the line between the function of the Fed and the Treasury is getting blurred,” Bruce Mizrach, professor of economics at Rutgers University, said, adding past bailouts, commercial or municipal, were handled by the latter and not the former.
He added: “That’s a larger function than what was envisioned for the Fed, and once you assume those responsibilities, it then becomes harder to back away.”
Until the financial crisis, the Fed’s primary tool was its benchmark interest rate. When the 2008 meltdown hit and rates were pushed to zero, the Fed turned to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and other unconventional assets.
To combat the coronavirus downturn the central bank expanded its toolbox once more. The Fed’s corporate bond purchases were initially exclusive to investment-grade debt before an expansion incorporated so-called fallen angels, companies that recently slipped from high-quality ratings to junk status.
“The use of high-yield purchases is designed explicitly to say, ‘look, if you were an investment-grade company before March 223 and you got downgraded because of COVID, that shouldn’t have happened,'” Lauren Goodwin, economist at New York Life Investments, said in an interview.
The Fed’s own leaders have acknowledged the shift, with Dallas branch president Robert Kaplan telling Fox Business on Friday that the bank’s role includes serving as “a lender of last resort.”

Still, experts worry that the move into risky debt purchases will make an eventual recovery more turbulent than usual. The Fed doesn’t want to be seen as impeding market dynamics, but its move from stable Treasury bonds to corporate credit has already changed valuations across the board.
In the days following the Fed’s March 23 announcement, corporate bonds retraced sharp declines. The stock market enjoyed an indirect boost, as investors viewed the policy as a strong backstop for risk assets.
“The problem with official intervention in markets is you’re no longer letting the market determine prices. So what is the right valuation?” Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon, said, adding “the possibility that the Fed will broaden the scope of its interventions” is even affecting prices in sectors ineligible for Fed lending.
Even if market valuations normalize and account for the Fed’s policy, closing its facilities in the wake of the economic downturn will drive violent price swings all over again, Goodwin warned.
“The rollback of these programs and the timing of that rollback is going to be an enormous focus for investors and it will absolutely prompt market volatility,” she said.
Where some are worried about the scope of the Fed’s latest measures, others point to their size as a serious long-term risk.
Through quantitative easing programs from 2010 to 2015, the Fed’s balance sheet roughly doubled to $4.5 trillion. It took until September 2019 to unwind about $800 billion from its balance sheet, yet the subsequent repo crisis and coronavirus pandemic undid four years of progress in a matter of weeks. From February 24 to April 27, the Fed added another $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet.
The race to pad markets resulted in “a buying spree of epic proportions,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a Tuesday note. The central bank’s purchases show no signs of stopping, with five of its nine lending facilities yet to begin operations. Experts expect the Fed’s holdings to land between $7 trillion $10 trillion by the end of the year, dwarfing the expansion seen during the financial crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">England’s ‘stir-crazy’ Jason Roy happy to play behind closed doors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England’s Jason Roy is ready to play in empty stadiums if the post-coronavirus situation demands so, said the opener who got a taste of it in his last outing.
Roy played a Pakistan Super League match on May 7 which took place behind closed doors in Lahore just before the pandemic halted international sports across the globe.
“There was no atmosphere, simple as that,” the Durban-born batsman, a key figure in England’s World Cup-winning squad last year, told British media.
“It was very strange. As a batsman when the bowler’s running in you learn to block out the crowd, but as soon as the ball is done you can hear them going absolutely berserk.
“(In Lahore) there was just dead silence. You could hear your mate calling ones and twos, so you don’t just have to work off each other’s body language. It was hard to get up for it. But it was something we knew we had to deal with.”
Playing without fans has been suggested as one possible way to resume cricket as soon as the pandemic subsides and Roy was ready to adjust.
“I’m more than happy to play behind closed doors. It would just be nice to get out there. I feel like a kid again,” he said, adding he was “going a bit stir crazy” in the shutdown.
The global health crisis and the restrictions it has forced have clouded the outlook for this year’s Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in Australia.
“If players aren’t able to prepare in the right way and are unable to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it,” Roy said of the tournament scheduled in October-November.
“But if it goes ahead and we’re told we have three weeks to prepare all the boys will be putting in the hard yards to make sure we’re ready.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Weighing The Week Ahead: Are You Ready For Some High-Stakes Gambling?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
It is a light economic calendar if measured by the number of reports but an important one given the focus on employment. We will get reports from ADP, the “official” BLS employment situation numbers, and the weekly early indicator from jobless claims. Whatever else happens in the economy, jobs take center stage.
Despite the interest in employment, markets are looking beyond the current horrible numbers. Everyone is paying attention to the reopening of the US economy and how things will look in the future. The nature and pace of the reopening has implications for your personal health, societal wellbeing, and financial markets. The question is:
Are you ready for a high-stakes gamble?
The gamble is especially interesting, partly because one’s ability to control personal risk is much lower than it would be in a casino!
In my last installment of WTWA, I warned about excessive emphasis on what was working in the current market, asking whether investors should behave like traders. Thanks to those of you who joined in with comments and examples. Especially when the market is making big moves in both directions, it certainly seems like there is opportunity.
This was not a subject picked up in financial media, which benefits from very active trading. As I noted at the start of 2020, I am emphasizing the issues that are most important for investors. I recognize that many of these will not become major themes – at least not right away.
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart. This week I am featuring Jill Mislinski’s version, an excellent combination of the most important information.
As has been the case for several weeks, there are frequent opening gaps. This has been accompanied by much more active trading in the overnight futures markets (WSJ).
Here is an interesting chart from our research team showing what has been working. As I have recently written, this is not a road map for investors unless they want to imitate traders.
The market lost 0.2% on the week. The trading range was 4.7%, a continued reduction from a few weeks ago. You can monitor these along with historical comparisons in my weekly Indicator Snapshot (below).
I am finding myself with more good material on science, economics and the investment implications than I can use. I am trying to find a way of providing it on my site instead of leaving it on the cutting room floor. I am finding fewer investment ideas that I can really endorse.
I am still looking for some time off. Next week is a possibility.
EconoFact analyzes who is an essential worker and who is on the front lines. The data show that the risks differ in recognizable patterns.
Read all of the evidence to see why they reach this conclusion:
Each week I break down events into good and bad. For our purposes, “good” has two components. The news must be market friendly and better than expectations. I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news – and you should, too!
New Deal Democrat’s high frequency indicators have always been a valuable part of my economic review. Over the next year we will watch for signs of the eventual economic rebound; NDD’s three time frames will be especially helpful. The overall picture, terrible now and on short indicators and mildly positive on long indicators continues. Some of the short-term indicators are slightly “less terrible.”
Until we have more relevant data, I will just hit the highlights and provide some interpretation. Some of the “good” news fits the less bad description, especially if beating expectations. I do not intend this to sugar coat the terrible economic situation. It is simply a technique for taking note of changes.
Everything else declined significantly. Some of the March data still does not reflect the entire coronavirus effect.
China’s role in the origin of coronavirus. Evidence of original research and cover-up. Threats of retaliation?
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance. Good luck with that! Second best is planning what to look for and how to react.
The economic calendar is light in the number of reports, but the focus on employment makes it an important week. We will see April data on both the ADP private employment change and the official employment situation report. ISM non-manufacturing will provide a read on the service sector, with a big decline expected. Jobless claims have become even more important than usual as the first read on employment changes.
Corporate earnings reports will provide continuing company-by-company descriptions of the shutdown effects and future prospects. The big story will once again be the pandemic and the prospects for reopening at least part of the economy.
Briefing.com has a good U.S. economic calendar for the week. Here are the main U.S. releases.
The employment data will certainly attract attention, but most market watchers will focus on the gradually reopening US economy. There is an obvious willingness to look beyond the current horrible data, if there is some assurance that change is coming. The push for that change has created an issue that reaches far beyond the financial markets. It is a matter of personal and societal health. Strong and sharply differing opinions are voiced, but no one really knows what will happen.
Are you ready for this high-stakes gamble?
I have been writing for weeks that understanding models will prove to be essential in reaching logical policy and investment conclusions. I have also described the issues involved in finding the needed data. I am going to use just one of the simple modeling problems to highlight the intense and growing division over the issue of reopening US business. The key question is determining the case fatality rate.
While this seems simple enough, it is often confused with the mortality rate or loosely described (even by top journalists) as the “death rate.”
Here is how that goes wrong. First, the denominator. Suppose that you start with people who are sick. Calculating fatalities from that gives an inflated rate.
Even if you try to discover everyone, you will have a large number of asymptomatic cases that are not included.
How about the numerator of the equation? Surely, we know how many people died, don’t we?
Some think the deaths are overstated, including non-COVID19 victims or people who would have died anyway.
But several media figures who are sympathetic to the president have started to question the official death toll, claiming it is being distorted for political purposes, by including in the statistics people dying of other causes.
Fox News’s Brit Hume, who has previously tweeted that New York’s “fatality numbers are inflated”, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s late-night show on Tuesday to claim that any person with the virus is being counted as a Covid-19 death “regardless of what else may be wrong”. Carlson responded by saying, “There may be reasons people seek an inaccurate death count,” adding: “When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.”
The rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh, who received the presidential medal of freedom from Trump, previously dismissed Covid-19 as similar to the “common cold” but changed tack recently to claim: “It’s admittedly speculation, but… what if we are recording a bunch of deaths to coronavirus which really should not be chalked up to coronavirus?”
Most experts believe that the deaths are actually understated. Many who died in hospitals were not tested. Others died at home.
Since many reject science and models, they are free to reach any conclusion they wish.
Both of the principal sides agree that the case fatality rate is over-stated. One side says that this proves that the reaction has been overdone because of a false assumption of lethality. The other concludes that the higher denominator proves that the virus is more infectious than believed.
There is a patchwork of state decisions concerning reopening businesses. This chart shows the expected peak for each state.
Even within the states where reopening permission has been given, there are questions about what to expect about the actual pace. Business owners, workers, and consumers have a cautious attitude (Washington Post).
There are methods to reopen that do not require the end of the pandemic (WSJ). Hint: Schools will reopen, and young people will be the first to emerge from shelter-in-place. The OldProf and his demographic colleagues will get to read and watch more movies.
Reopening would be speeded by testing and tracing. Will people accept that loss of privacy?
Nearly 3 in 5 Americans say they are either unable or unwilling to use the infection-alert system under development by Google and Apple, suggesting that it will be difficult to persuade enough people to use the app to make it effective against the coronavirus pandemic, a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll finds.
As usual, I’ll suggest some conclusions of my own in today’s Final Thought.
I have a rule for my investment clients. Think first about your risk. Only then should you consider possible rewards. I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update, featuring the Indicator Snapshot.
For a description of these sources, check here.
Welcome to David Moenning and his Indicator Wall. His approach has many parts, but I will attempt to summarize two time periods on our five-point scale. The C-Score spiked again. It is a dramatic change in underlying factors which normally provide important indications. This level is an outlier that cannot readily be interpreted. I’ll have more on this soon. Georg Vrba has paused the BCIp signal because of the extreme readings. It has done its job for now.
I am treating forward earnings and the resulting measures as not meaningful until we get more clarity.
I continue my rating of “Neutral” in the overall outlook for long-term investors, but it is close to becoming mildly bearish. I am not trying to guess what will happen in the next week or two. As an investor, I would be neither a buyer nor a seller at this point. I did a little buying for new accounts and for programs where our cash had built to more than 30%.
Bob Dieli: Business cycle analysis via the “C Score”.
Brian Gilmartin: All things earnings, for the overall market as well as many individual companies. This week Brian suggests that one way of looking ahead might be to average 2020 and 2021 expected growth rates.
Georg Vrba: Business cycle indicator and market timing tools. Georg’s business cycle index continues its steep decline.
David Moenning: Developer and “keeper” of the Indicator Wall. His most recent update summarizes the key elements.
Doug Short and Jill Mislinski: Regular updating of an array of indicators, including the very helpful Big Four.
The sharp decline is apparent and broad. If it is sustained as everyone expects then the NBER might call March or April the month when the recession started. We’ll get that verdict in a year or so!
Investors should understand and embrace volatility. They should join my delight in a well-documented list of worries. As the worries are addressed or even resolved, the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely.
If I were to recommend a single must-read investment article this week, it would be Marc Gerstein’s Searching For Less-Known ETFs: Large-Cap Value. He shows a means for investors to be contrarian while also getting good stocks and good prices. He wonders first about why this is the right time to seek large-cap value. One answer is keeping down risk.
High P/E is dangerous, not in and of itself, but only if or when the market comes to realize that the growth expectations (or dreams) that support high ratios are not going to be achieved. We saw it in the 1960s with the once-beloved “Nifty Fifty.” We saw it in the early 2000s with then-new internet stock. But we’ve lately come through a very long business expansion, accompanied by a new generation of newly introduced businesses, that for a long time have made disappointment, or unfulfilled expectations seem like a thing of the past.
I like his discussion of “the usual suspects.” His ratings for big firms all looked alike and came up neutral in his ratings. Going beyond these, he tweaked some standard screening rules and came up with QARP (for quality at a reasonable price). Haven’t heard of it? Neither had Marc. The ETF is small ($84.4 M AUM) and rather thinly traded, but it is based upon Russell 1000 stocks. This means that the ETF process can liquidate underlying assets if necessary.
Marc goes on to discuss several better-known choices. As is the case with many of my “best of the week choices” he is combining solid ideas with a process that provides a lesson for investors.
Here are a very few ideas to consider, keeping in mind the companies and sectors that will be viable on “the other side.”
Chuck Carnevale is enjoying a menu with more attractive choices! This week he analyzed NetApp (NTAP), which combines dividend safety, attractive valuation resulting, and high yield. As always, Chuck’s analysis includes both positive and negative factors, and an educational video highlighting important valuation metrics.
How about sports? Barron’s explains that you can now buy Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE) for the site and Madison Square Garden Sports (MSGS) for the teams. This is another good “other side” question. Mrs. OldProf adds that you can also buy stock in her Packers, but there is not much of a resale market!
There is a current focus on consumer staples, a group that is doing well right now. Be sure to consider how well they will do on “the other side.”
Mondelez: Great Execution, Stock Slow To React
PepsiCo: A Dividend Aristocrat With 47 Years Of Solid Growing Income
Blue Harbinger has an interesting idea that lets you benefit from the oil glut, including the low prices. Own those with storage. The corporate structure is a bit tricky and be sure to read the risk section carefully!
Lyn Alden Schwartzer discusses how to protect purchasing power when you purchase ostensibly risk-free Treasuries.
I have resumed my series on boosting your dividend yield by writing near-term covered calls. This week I discussed a trade in Cardinal Health (CAH) the day before we executed it for clients.
Stone Fox Capital is looking beyond current performance to incipient changes. How will American Airlines Group (AAL) do as air travel rebounds? The author sees a rebound on this stock and the sector as a whole, “as the public increasingly returns to flying, even while the domestic economy is virtually locked down.” Check out the full post to review the supporting data, including a rebound in traffic through TSA checkpoints. He also has a post on Southwest Airlines (LUV).
I am intrigued by these ideas because my Great Rotation research team was working on LUV Friday afternoon. As I have recommended in recent posts, we are looking at three tests:
I will not buy or hold any stock that does not meet these tests, and you should not either.
I welcome those who have already joined my Great Reset Project. There is no charge as you monitor our progress, including some stock ideas as they emerge. We hope that members will join in a few brief surveys assisting with our use of James Surowiecki’s Wisdom of Crowds approach. More members will improve my research results. The airlines provide one example. We need to know how deep the dip in air travel and for how long it will last.
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have offered opinions, but they are not regular customers. (In fact, they have been known to take the train to enjoy a few hours of bridge. They fly their favorite partners to the departure point and home after they arrive. It is a great idea for a peaceful and relaxing trip). Airlines have done passenger surveys. Analysts and industry experts opine. This is actually a perfect example of the Wisdom of Crowds approach. There are many other similar sectors to consider. I cannot describe the full method within the context of WTWA, so join us to learn more.
Inovio (INO). Paulo Santos looks at the vaccine potential and concludes that it is a “strong sell.”
The high-stake gamble is one that an individual can hedge – at least a bit.
For myself and my clients I am pretty cautious right now. That comes with my academic tradition and commitment to finding the best experts on each topic. If the easing of restrictions leads to a rebound in the virus, we will not have an indication for at least two weeks. We can afford to wait a bit longer.
One striking conclusion: Usually governments test the waters with a variety of policies. They do more of what is working and stop policies that fail. In this case, if policies reduced the number of cases, many will conclude that restrictions were unnecessary. People are not very good at imagining counterfactuals – what would have happened in the absence of action.
And finally, everything has become politically loaded. My personal conclusions flow from my lifetime methods (which have been quite effective). One recommendation has been to avoid mixing politics with your investing.
The challenge of putting politics aside has never been greater! Or more necessary.
We all want a quick end to this, but we need more evidence before taking major steps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Speaker proposes more COVID-19 centers as part of ‘new normal’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This follows the seeming shift in government policies following the Balik Probinsya program proposed by Sen. Bong Go.
In a radio interview, Cayetano said the presence of health facilities, job opportunities and other infrastructure in the regions, including a reliable Internet and mobile communications network, would encourage people to go back to the provinces, decongesting urban areas in the process. Cayetano told the nation that health experts are predicting that COVID-19 would linger for some time until a cure or a vaccine is developed.
“Anyone who can adapt fast, innovate and manage the situation all around the world will get ahead. Initially, we were thinking of life after COVID but after the health experts found it in their mind, COVID is here to stay whether one year, 18 months o two years before there is a cure o vaccine. I'm still praying that there will be a miracle cure or vaccine,” Cayetano stressed.
Related to this, one of the first bills filed by Speaker Cayetano in the 18th Congress is House Bill (HB) No. 9, which aims to decentralize economic activities away from the urban areas to regional and provincial hubs.
“If COVID-19 is going to stay with us for the next two years we, will need separate COVID hospitals so that the other hospitals can treat people with other ailments - those with cancer, renal disease, those needing dialysis,” he said.
Many of these other sick people are shying away from hospitals for fear of getting infected by coronavirus, he said.
In some instances, he added that hospitals cannot treat them because they are full of COVID-19 patients.
At the same time, Cayetano urged people to prepare for and accept changes and challenges the new normal would bring about.
He said life will be different after ECQ and GCQ are lifted, and even after the world finds a Covid-19 cure or a vaccine, as social distancing and other prevention measures would still have to be taken.
“We cannot go back to the old normal. For instance, in public schools, if there were 50 students, that number would be reduced to 30 or 25 under the new normal,” he said.
He said students might even be required to wear face mask.
In factories, he said workers might have to distance themselves by at least one meter apart or put on personal protective equipment.
He added that social distancing in public transportation would be more challenging.
Cayetano stressed that people would have to live with changes in their way of life and in their tradition or culture like avoiding handshake or kissing even on rare occasions that members of a family get together.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ashford Group of companies, run by a donor of U.S. President Donald Trump, said on Saturday it would return a $58.7 million loan it received from the government’s program to help small businesses survive the economic impact of the coronavirus.
U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had sent a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) demanding a review of all loans made to Ashford, run by Trump donor and Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett.
According to media reports, the hospitality firm is the biggest known applicant of the government’s small-business relief program.
The company said it would return the funds due to the SBA’s “recently changed rules” and “inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.”
The group’s publicly traded companies overseen by Bennett include Ashford Inc, Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc.
Schumer said in his letter that he was “deeply concerned that large, publicly traded companies, like Ashford, may be exploiting the Program.”
The company said in its statement, “Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied” that Ashford accessed loopholes to qualify for the funds.” (Reporting by Aishwarya Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Alistair Bell)

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19, Near-Death Experiences, and Boris Johnson</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">‘A tough old moment’ is how the British prime minister described it. He was desperately ill in hospital with COVID-19 and the medical staff were ready to put him on a ventilator, and even considering how to announce his death. He says he didn’t actually believe he was going to die but he got close, very close.
Would we expect this to change a man? Could he have been changed by this confrontation with death? Yes. Most near-death research concentrates on the classic ‘near-death experience’ (NDE), with tunnels, lights, out-of-body experiences, and very occasionally a ‘life review’ – as though your whole life is flashing before your eyes. People who survive such experiences often report profound changes in their personality, preferences and – above all – their motivations. Stories abound of people who lost interest in earning as much money as possible and changed direction. Here’s an example from Raymond Moody’s original ground-breaking 1975 book Life After Life.
It was a blessing in a way, because before that heart attack I was too busy planning for my children’s future, and worrying about yesterday, that I was losing the joys of the present. I have a much different attitude now. (Moody 1975 p 91)
Right from the start of NDE research, it was clear that people’s lives could be changed forever. In Transformed by the Light Melvin Morse (1992), best known for descriptions of NDEs in children, describes how those who return from the brink of death live healthier and happier lives, have stronger family ties, better relationships, give more money to charity and, above all, lose their fear of death. Other research has found that concern for others increases (Flynn 1982) and motivations, values and conduct change (Ring 1980). More recently, Dutch researcher Pim Van Lommel (2013) found similar changes, concluding that NDErs gain more interest in spirituality, greater acceptance of and love for themselves and others, and less interest in possessions and power.
But Boris did not have an NDE — as far as we know — or describe tunnels or out-of-body experiences, so would we still expect him to be changed after his traumatic brush with death? Yes again.
Back in the 1990s, when I was researching for my book Dying to Live (Blackmore 1993), I interviewed many patients from our local hospital in Bristol. One woman’s husband remembered nothing from a medical crisis following a burst artery. Yet both their lives were changed.
Certainly I did not have a NDE — the most life threatening thing I did was to drink hospital coffee. Yet both of us found that the experience had a profound and lasting effect … coming very close to dying also shakes the very foundation of your existence.
NDE researcher Kenneth Ring compared people who did, and did not, have an NDE when they came close to death, and found that both reported changes including enhanced sense of purpose, appreciation for life, and empathy for others. One woman who reported no NDE after nearly being killed in a car explosion said:
My priorities have definitely changed … it suddenly made me realize that nothing is important unless you have people around you that you love … I just feel that I have a greater appreciation of being here. (Ring 1980 p 142)
Ring had just collected cases; his was not a prospective study with matched groups, but later studies were. For example, Van Lommel and his colleagues (2001) used Ring’s (1984) inventory of life-change questions and found that people’s motivations changed and their interest in nature and involvement in family life increased whether they had had an NDE or not.
Such changes are often noticed by others too.
Following this experience, it almost seemed as if I were filled with a new spirit. Since then, many have remarked to me that I seem to have almost a calming effect on them, instantly, when they are troubled. And it seems that I am more in tune with people now (Moody 1975 p 92).
What causes these profound changes in people’s lives? There are two main possibilities. One is that it’s a natural psychological response to realising one’s own mortality. The other is that the brain has been physically changed by whatever caused the close brush with death. For example, in a heart attack, when blood oxygen levels in the brain fall quickly, neurons may be damaged or destroyed. With the novel coronavirus we would not expect such sudden falls in oxygen. Yet the damage to the lungs and the consequent inability to breathe properly will certainly reduce oxygen levels in the brain and this might have longer lasting consequences. We simply do not know the answer to this question.
So, has anyone noticed a change in Boris? They have. David Wooding, political editor of the Sun newspaper, wrote
Over the years, I’ve met or interviewed Boris Johnson many times — but this meeting was like no other. Not only were we forced to sit far apart for social ­distancing, but it’s clear his brush with death has left him a changed man. His trademark bounce and optimism are still much in evidence. But he has emerged from the life-changing events of the past few weeks as a much more complex figure. … Boris 2.0 is a man who no longer feels the need to play to the crowd.
In a radio interview, Wooding added that “I saw for the first time in this interview a glimmer of real emotion.” Apparently, Boris stressed his sympathy for those with the virus, “if you ask me, ‘Am I driven by a desire to stop other people suffering?’ Yes, I absolutely am.” Though he did go on to stress his concern for the economy as well.
Maybe these changes will be ephemeral but maybe not. Van Lommel and his colleagues (2001) interviewed their near-death survivors two and eight years after their brush with death and found the changes were long-lasting. All of us are being changed by the new virus and our changed rules for living in lockdown, but maybe those who have been so ill and survived may experience even more profound changes. And from what the research tells us, I would say they are changes for the better.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From Drone Police To Second Wave Warnings, Russia In Full Coronavirus Panic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Russia seems to be in full coronavirus panic.
Their Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is the second high ranking official to be stricken by COVID-19. Boris Johnson of the UK was first.
The country has 134,687 cases as of Sunday evening, and 1,280 deaths. They’re approaching peak, but not there yet, based on the number of daily cases still rising.
This is a problem because as Germany, France, Spain and Italy all track lower in infection rates, Russia is on the cusp of surpassing them. It is the 7th most infected nation, trailing Germany.
Everyone must be looking at China and saying, “how on Earth did you get away with 82,000 cases and we’re stuck with double that?”
Regardless of China’s numerical inaccuracies, everyone is following in their footsteps with forced quarantine and business closures. Not only that, the use of surveillance drones are now becoming ubiquitous. Russia is rolling them out now to police people not abiding by social distancing orders.
The drones will be spying on residents of Moscow, according to police reports. Air surveillance was first used this weekend to monitor people’s movements in parks. Information on violators gets transmitted to police units serving on patrol routes nearby and if police catch you, you are fined at least 5,000 rubles for first offenders.
About 36 Gazprom workers came down with the virus over the weekend in one region, with the local health authorities estimating that the number is probably 100 times that.
Around 10,000 people were tested for the new SARS coronavirus at the Gazprom’s Chayandinskoye field and nearly 30% had a preliminary positive result in the first round of testing, according to health authorities there quoted by the Vedomosti business daily on Sunday. Those suspected this weekend to be positive had no symptoms of COVID-19.
MORE FROM FORBESIn 2020 Oil Crisis, Russia Seen Coming Out On Top This TimeBy Kenneth Rapoza
Europe is tip-toeing back to normal. But the coronavirus attacked Russia a bit later, so they are roughly a month behind them.
Aeroflot spokeswoman Yulia Spivakova said that they won’t begin international flights until “mid-summer”.
More than 9.3 billion rubles is expected to be allocated to Russian airlines from a Kremlin coronavirus relief package aimed to compensate them for lost income.  Another 2.1 billion rubles is going to airports for lost revenue due to Russia’s ban on international flights on March 27.
Like every other country stricken by the pandemic, Russia’s public health authorities need to give their blessing before state economies can get back to work.
The Minister of Health, Mikhail Murashko, said in an interview on Russia 24 this weekend that they were worried about the possibility of a second wave "if we do not get to population immunity."
He did not say when this second wave would hit. If this is like other seasonal coronaviruses, then it could come back in the winter.
The first SARS, discovered in China in November 2002, disappeared in July 2003 with little to no cases after that.
Murashko said there are too many unknowns in Russia to think about removing quarantine measures. But once they get past peak, he said they will move in stages like the rest of Europe.
“We still need to get to herd immunity,” he said, largely believed to be a 60% infection rate among the population.
Russia is dealing with the double whammy of weak oil and a public health crisis.
Equity investors like it, because it has made Russia’s best companies cheaper than ever.
“We bought Gazprom, Norilsk Nickel and X5 and are looking to buy more Yandex YNDX   YNDX ,” says Arent Thijsen, a fund manager for Blauwtulp Wealth Management in The Netherlands. “A lot of Russian equities are very cheap right now and have unexpectedly solid growth,” he says.
TS Lombard analyst Chris Granville thinks that Russia is falling into a recession deeper than its last one in 2014 when oil was also in a freefall. But this time, the added pressure of having to backstop business and individual income due to forced lockdown measures means a conservative-minded Russia will have to spend more liberally.
Russia will end up with a larger budget deficit for once, and that puts at risk the fiscal conservatism many foreign investors actually liked about Russia, especially if they were bond holders.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IRAs and 401ks Purchased Over One Million ETH at an $800 Premium</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are premiums and then there’s Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) where 0.09427052 eth is projected for $95.25. As we loop onto the same market the same price is available for just $18.18, translating with the current pricing of around $200 per eth.
While Ethereum is floating near $1,000 per coin, the highest premium has ever witnessed was in 2015.
According to the graphs created by the experts, there are around 13,255,400 of the shares till April 24, 2020 with 5,230,200 of them outstanding as of December 31, 2019. This concludes that over 8,025,200 shares have been bought, translating to 756,539 eth since December 31,2019.
As in the graph it has been seen that this year projects $143 for 1/10th of an eth, which means eth is at the spot all time high of $1,400.
It has been reported that Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) has given the amount with the only reason as there is a complete detachment and the users can easily buy Ethereum from IRA or 401k portfolio.
These are considered as pension portfolios. The IRA is the personal pension portfolio whereas 401ks are provided by employees who are contributing to the pension with the biggest perk with gain of zero capital through these plans.
There is no other way out to buy Ethereum through your pension. It is even not possible to buy shares and stock ISAs and mechanism save for Ethereum and for Europeans the eth ETNs trading in Stockholm.
Americans have got access to ETNs, but there are protectionist regulatory measures that make it quite a bit more complicated. Leading to the distorted demand for eth in part, on the other hand supply is also distorted with this getting around the usual rules by requiring the share is held for a year before it can be sold off.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke's account after he made unproven claims about coronavirus.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
The former footballer made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.  
'YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS,' the video service, owned by Google, told the BBC.
'Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke's YouTube channel.'
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke's page from their site on Friday.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms. 
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who claim Icke's conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30 million times. 
CCDH's chief executive Imran Ahmed said: 'We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke's channel.
'However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke's content (and) need to be removed.'
They asked for other networks to follow the lead adding: 'It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.
'Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘River monster’: Huge African dinosaur Spinosaurus thrived in the water</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The huge African predator ?Spinosaurus spent much of its life in the water, propelled by a paddle-like tail while hunting large fish – a “river monster,” according to scientists, that showed that some dinosaurs invaded the aquatic realm.
Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of fossil bones from the tail of ?Spinosaurus in southeastern Morocco that provided a deeper understanding of the appearance, lifestyle and capabilities of the longest meat-eating dinosaur on record.
“Spinosaurus had a highly specialized tail – a propulsive structure that would have allowed this river monster to actively pursue prey in the water column,” said University of Detroit Mercy paleontologist and anatomist Nizar Ibrahim, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.
Spinosaurus, which lived 95 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, was a highly unusual dinosaur, and not just because of its staggering dimensions – up to 50 feet (15 meters) long and seven tons.
The anatomy of Spinosaurus had remained mysterious for decades after crucial fossils were destroyed during World War Two until the 2008 discovery of the Morocco skeleton, with the additional tail bones dug up since 2015. Its tail was flexible with a large surface area thanks to a series of tall neural spines – different from the stiff and tapering tails of other carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex – indicating Spinosaurus and its close relatives engaged in tail-propelled locomotion unlike any other dinosaurs.
Laboratory experiments in which a plastic model of the Spinosaurus tail was attached to a robotic swimming device showed that the tail could move laterally to create thrust and power the animal through water like a crocodile, said Harvard University fish biologist and biomechanist George Lauder, a study co-author. This indicates Spinosaurus terrorized rivers and river banks as a semi-aquatic animal, not merely wading into the water waiting for fish to swim by. It may have eaten huge fish, including sharks.
“This discovery overturns decades-old ideas that non-bird dinosaurs were restricted to terrestrial environments,” said Harvard University vertebrate paleontologist and biomechanist Stephanie Pierce, a study co-author. “So, yes, we believe that this discovery does indeed revolutionize our understanding of dinosaur biology.” Spinosaurus still was able to move on land and lay eggs there, perhaps walking on four legs rather than two like other meat-eating dinosaurs.
“But it had so many adaptations to an aquatic existence – nostrils high on the skull and further back from the tip, flat bottomed-toe bones and claws, dense and thickened bone for buoyancy control, and this newly discovered tail form – that it would have been at least as aquatic as Nile Crocodiles,” University of Portsmouth paleontologist and study co-author David Martill said. “It just might topple T. rex,” Pierce said, “as the most famous and exciting meat-eating dinosaur.”

B&H closed its store at Ninth Ave. and West 34th Street on March 16.

As a result, we’ve decided to temporarily close the B&H New York City SuperStore until further notice. Our main focus is to keep you and every member of our team feeling safe, healthy, and supported during these difficult times.”
Horowitz continued: “Our online and telephone channels as well as store pickup of online orders remain open for business as usual, which will continue as long as we can do so safely. Our sales and customer service teams are available to answer your questions via phone, email or chat.”
One B&H employee told the New York Post he was surprised by the company’s decision to lay off so many staffers, because the company’s call center is “busy as hell” taking orders for “computers, movie cameras and accessories for setting up a home office.” It should be noted that many tech retailers in the US, Europe, and Israel are reporting booming business, since millions of middle class families are forced to stay at home.
The store’s HR Director Izzy Friedman told staff last Wednesday the store had “waited as long as possible” before deciding to let them go, and had been paying workers “through the Passover holiday break, and beyond to make this easier.”
B&H owner, Herman Schreiber, and most store employees are Satmar Chassidim. The store is closed on Shabbat, Jewish holidays, and Christmas. This includes online orders.
Last November, B&H Foto & Electronics Corp. was sued by the NY State Attorney General Letitia James for knowingly failing to pay taxes on the discounted portions of its merchandise, a discrepancy which, over 13 years, allegedly amounted to at least $67 million, for which B&H did not pay at least $7 million in taxes. B&H offered “instant rebate” deals to its customers, and the manufacturers reimbursed the company, but the company still had to pay taxes on the total price of the item, including the discounted part.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.
The video service, owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.
“Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke’s page from their site on Friday.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who claim Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30 million times.
“We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke’s channel,” said CCDH’s chief executive Imran Ahmed.
“However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke’s content (and) need to be removed.”
They asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.
“Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Atiku's company gives reason for employees' sack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gotel Communications Limited, the Yola-based media company ,which sacked scores of its staff on May 1, has explained why it took the decision.
The company, a firm of television and radio station owned by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, said the sack was the outcome of a restructuring exercise, which started last year.
The company handed sack letters to at least 46 of its staff on Friday when workers were marking Workers Day worldwide.
The affected staff disputed the actual number of sacked workers.
While some said they were over 50, others said although the initial list contained 56 staff, it was thinned down to 46.
A statement on why the action became imperative was however silent on the number of those affected.
The statement, signed by the General Manager of the company, Mohammed El-Yakub titled, ‘Rationalisation of staff in Gotel, outcome of long standing company restructuring,’ said Atiku Abubakar had no hand in the layoff action.
The statement reads: “The rationalisation of staff at Gotel Communications Limited, a company under the umbrella of Priam Group, is a culmination of the restructuring process in the companies under our Group.
“The founder of companies under the Priam had announced that many of his business concerns will be aggregated under the Priam Group. Priam Group had embarked on a restructuring exercise which led to a merger of many companies under its umbrella.
“Other components of the restructuring includes rationalisation of workforce and thus some members of staff of the group would be laid off, with their full disengagement benefits paid to them.”
It stressed the decision to “right size” the workforce in Gotel Communication Limited was the climax of the on-going restructuring exercise initiated last year.
It said it was out of context “to ascribe any mundane presupposition for being responsible for the decision to lay off some of the workforce in Gotel Communication Limited,” and explained following the unveiling of Priam Group last year, Atiku Abubakar ceased to be involved in the running of the affairs of his companies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CORONAVIRUS: DANGOTE PROMOTES WORKER FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT-EDWIN …THUMBS UP NIGERIAN WORKERS’ RESILIENCE</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As workers globally marked the May Day, a case has been made for the collaboration between employers and employees to work out strategies to minimize the impact of the business shut down occasioned by the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic.
President of the Chemical and Non-Metallic Sector Employers, Mr. Devakumar Edwin, is also a Group Executive Director of Dangote Industries Limited while commending Nigerian workers for their resilience said salaries of his companies’ workers are paid up to date despite the lockdown contrary to insinuations in a section of social media.
He urged other employers to protect their workforce on resumption of work in the face of the deadly scourge.
The Dangote Group top shot who was featuring on a Television programme “Business Morning” said the lockdown globally no doubt would have adverse effect on businesses but that the workers should not be made to bear the brunt saying no worker of Dangote Group has been laid off as a result of the current disruption of businesses.
As the President of Chemical and Non-Metallic Employers of the Federation, which is the largest sub-sector of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), I know many of our people are going to be affected because of lack of foreign exchange. But it is a reality because some company may suffer a long term impact of the lockdown, but others will pick up as soon as the lockdown is lifted.
He denied that salaries of Dangote Group workers at any level or subsidiary are being withheld because of the one month stay at home order by the federal government saying all staffers of the Dangote Group and its business units have been paid their salaries despite the lockdown.
Mr. Edwin stated that some companies have sacked some of their workers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic while some others have slashed salaries and that companies would have to take decision that suits them but that care would have to be taken not to take harsh decision that will affect the workers because whatever affect the workers will equally affect the operations of the company.
On the reports in some section of the social media that Dangote has stopped the salaries of its staff, the Group Executive Director who is in charge of Dangote Petroleum Refinery described it as rumours and outright fake news saying “although, things may be rough now, we believe that if we are able to maintain and retain our staff in this period of lockdown, we are going to reap the long-term benefits. Our action will boost the morale of the workers because the workers will now know that though, the company was not earning an income, it was still able to pay my salary in full.”
Mr. Edwin said as the President of the Chemical and Non-Metallic Sector employers said he has been advocating a win-win policy by the employers on resumption of works after the lockdown, noting that business disruption as a result of coronavirus is a global one.
He also denied that Dangote Industries Limited was not observing the lockdown pointing out that only the businesses of the Group that are essential have been operating like the Port Services, Sugar and Salt plants both of which belong to the food sector and that in doing so official laid down protocols and WHO standards were being followed to the letter.
Said he “Government has allowed essential workers to operate. We are into sugar and we are into salt, which are essential at this period. We have put in place measures to ensure that all staff on essential duties adhere strictly to health precaution as prescribed by the WHO. We have put in place controls and measures in the interest of the staff to protect their health.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19 concerns follow eager boaters anxious to start the season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s already May, the days are getting warmer and so are the region’s lakes.
With the COVID-19 pandemic throwing a monkey wrench into a lot of land-based activities, it seems like there’s no better time than now to launch the boat and get out on the water.
Unfortunately, those COVID-19 self distancing protocols still apply when you’re on the water, which could complicate things for owners of small pleasure craft wanting to socialize while on the lake.
Canadian Coast Guard assistant commissioner Roger Girouard weighed in on the subject recently, issuing a note to the boating community and marinas.
He says even though lakes in the Okanagan are largely under the jurisdiction of the province, the advice works for boaters there as well.
“We were wanting to raise COVID awareness for on-the-water activity and at the same time protect small isolated communities from possible spread,” he said in an email issued today, April 30.
Girouard acknowledges the desire to get out on the water and get away from restrictions currently limiting activities on land, but he’s asking mariners to stay close to home in a bid to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
“Don’t get on a boat if you have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, or if you have been feeling sick,” he advises.
Girouard says the Coast Guard has responded to more search and rescue calls than at the same point last year, putting those responders at risk of catching the virus.
“If you become involved in a water emergency and are feeling ill, let your rescuers know,” he says.
Boaters are also advised to boat only with family members where the vessels aren’t big enough to provide social distancing.
Municipal boat launches are open for the most part, but the closure of provincial parks and forestry sites has limited access to those boat launches, something Eric Wickham would like to change.
He has set up a petition on Change.org and currently has more than 7,100 signatures in a bid to reach 7,500.
“With all forestry sites and provincial parks closed, access to our waterways is very limited. This action has prevented citizens from being able to fish, as a form of outdoor activity, as most access is by utilizing boat launches within those locations,” Wickham states in the petition.
The petition can be accessed at this website.
The Okanagan's regional districts also operate boat launches in their regions. The regional districts of North Okanagan, Central Okanagan and Okanagan Similkameen say their launches remain open to boaters practicing safe hygiene and social distancing protocols. Signage has been posted at the boat launches providing physical distancing information.
The Thompson Nicola Regional District does not operate any boat launches in their region.
City owned boat launches in the region are taking a similar approach, with the City of Kamloops, the City of Penticton, the City of Kelowna and the City of Vernon all indicating their launches remain open to boaters who are practicing COVID-19 precautions.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Alabama man found his own Magic Kingdom this week in Florida’s Disney World, camping out in the “tropical paradise” for days before being busted, according to reports.
Security spotted Richard McGuire Thursday in Discovery Island inside the Orlando resort — which has been closed since mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, Newsweek reported.
McGuire, 42, who gained access to the park Monday or Tuesday, told cops he was “unaware” he had done anything wrong and claimed he just figured he just found a “tropical paradise.”
Numerous “no trespassing” signs visible on and near the island.
McGuire is believed to have been staying in one of the original buildings on Discovery Island, which has been closed to the public since 1999; before that, roughed it in a wildlife park.
The goofy camper reportedly told cops he only planned to stay about a week.
The Mobile man was charged with trespassing and barred from Disney properties, the report said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">We were prepared for Covid crisis when it hit Europe: CEO of MTR Foods</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MTR Foods, a subsidiary of Norwegian conglomerate Orkla, had scaled up its production capacity much before the lockdown was announced. Due to this, its inventory in March doubled from the level of 10-14 days of stock that the company usually holds. The Bengaluru-headquartered firm’s CEO Sanjay Sharma tells Samreen Ahmad that despite the coronavirus crisis, MTR Foods is still hopeful of reaching the Rs 1,000-crore revenue milestone by the end of this year. The FMCG major will also focus significantly on leveraging e-commerce channels, going forward. Edited excerpts…
How is MTR Foods running the show when most of the other branded packaged food products are not to be found in the market?
We started acting early in the crisis as the company is held by Norwegian conglomerate Orkla and Covid-19 crisis had already hit Europe well before it reached India. A lot of pre-planning was already communicated to us by our European counterparts. So we had started working on a plan by March 10. We started building up stocks. As compared to the average stock level of 10-14 days that we hold, we decided to hold an inventory for up to 30 days. The manufacturing cycle had already started working towards that. Currently, it has depleted to 10 days as demands has increased.
What are the major supply-chain challenges that MTR has experienced during the lockdown?
We have faced a business-continuity issue. The first week of lockdown was all about trying to reset the entire system. Our suppliers who were giving us raw materials were not seen as food processing units. So, we had to request the government to recognise them as critical services. We had to restructure our entire plants and methods of working, such as slowing down our lines and ensuring that all sanitation and social distancing norms were being followed. Many workers had gone home because of Ugadi, a major festival in Karnataka. We got government help to bring them back after arranging buses. We have paid 20-30 per cent more to secure trucks to transport our products.

What is the current capacity utilisation of MTR factories? How are you looking to scale up?
Currently our factories are working at 60 per cent capacity, with just 50 per cent of our workforce. We have a unit in Pune that is in the Red zone so for the past four weeks. It has been open only for two days. We have seven contract manufacturers in places like Indore and Guntur, which too are red zones so there have been major challenges to get these working. There’s an on-and-off impact whenever a new Covid-19 case is detected in areas near our warehouses or factories, which has disrupted the supply chain.
How is the company taking care of the health of its employees?
To a large extent, the factories have been quarantined. No outside person can enter the factories, including suppliers. We are following strong sanitisation measures and have arranged transportation for workers who are picked up from homes by buses that are sanitised after every trip. The buses are 50 per cent occupied to avoid any contact. We keep a track of who has travelled in each bus and temperature checks are done. We are working in shifts and those in shift-one are not allowed to interact with those in the second shift. Also plants are sanitised after every shift.

What is your plan for product launches, this year?
On an average we do around 8-10 launches in a year. Even in the current year we have done two launches (hyperlocal spices) before the crisis hit us. Given the current situation, we have kept our innovations on hold at this point of time as we want to see what will be the new normal situation. The consumer life has significantly changed and needs such as convenience are being evoked as the workload in homes have increased. We have seen a lot of demand in basic spices and breakfast mixes. Interestingly, as sweets shops are shut, we are seeing a huge demand for gulab jamun mixes.
Will MTR Foods be able to cross Rs 1,000 crore in revenue this year given the current crisis?
We are currently over Rs 900 crore in terms of revenue and it would be possible to touch the Rs 1,000-crore milestone this year. If the situation stabilises fast and we are able to find an equilibrium between managing this crisis and managing the business supply chain, then I see no reason why we will not hit those numbers.

How will things change for MTR once the lockdown is lifted?
This is one of those events that will change the world substantially. E-commerce is going to come out in a significant way and it is going to be one of our top priorities that we will carry into the future. Our e-commerce sales almost doubled to four per cent in April as compared to last year as we tied up with companies such as Swiggy and Zomato to get our products delivered. Also, as eating out will reduce and consumption patterns will change, we will also have to align our business accordingly.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> Since the government announced stringent measures to combat the spread of Coronavirus, people have had more time to spare, which compounded with the movement restriction, has increased the illegal sale and distribution of newspapers on social media platforms.
Various publications are forwarded on WhatsApp groups, Telegram, Facebook or Twitter, which that has led to a significant drop in income by some media houses.
Since the onset of digital publishing, the 4th estate has made available copies of its newspapers online at a cost. 
Kenya Copyright Board Executive Director Edward SigeiCitizen Digital
The media has expressed concern about the proliferation of the vice and sought the intervention of the Kenya Copyright Board (Kecobo)
Kenya Copyright Board Executive Director Edward Sigei on Saturday, May 2, announced a list of offences associated with copyright.
He started by stating that anybody who offers to sell work that is copyrighted and which is not coming from the copyright holder, commits an offence.
He added that anyone who tries to circumvent technical protection measures that are placed on digital platforms commits an offence.
"It is sad that some people want to benefit from this pandemic by selling people newspapers that are manipulated for fake headlines," he told Daily Nation.
Sigei further stated that the board had received complaints from a number of media houses, adding that the information would help them track four individuals who are thought to be responsible.
According to the Amended Copyright Acts 2001, the suspects would have to pay a fine five times the market product of each shared copyrighted product or Ksh 1,000 for each infringing product.
The guilty could also face up to 10 years in prison. 
Further, if one is noted to be a repeat offender, they could face up to 10 times the market value of the copyright product shared or Ksh 2000 for each infringing copy.
Alternatively, the guilty could face a jail term of 20 years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate surprises new parents during video-call to London hospital</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new mum and dad received an unexpected surprise when the Duchess of Cambridge paid them a virtual bedside visit.
Kate said hello during a video call to midwives she had worked with at Kingston Hospital last year.
She chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: ‘My goodness, you must be exhausted.’
She added Max was ‘so sweet’ before congratulating the new mum and dad.
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should ‘reach out and ask for help’ if they need it.
The call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.
During her video chat from her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents have changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
To maintain social distancing, three pairs of midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while another was filmed putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) before taking the laptop in to introduce the duchess to baby Max and his parents.
Ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week which begins on Monday, Kate spoke to a group of experts last week, including Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, and Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
The duchess, who has spent much of her public work highlighting the importance of the early years development of children and parental wellbeing, said to the group: ‘Parents do need to go out and reach out to those who can support them, particularly those who can provide knowledgeable resource as well.
‘It’s important to access and reach out for help when you do need it.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tech in Latin America: An entrepreneur’s guide to April’s startup news </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s been nearly four years since influential French journalist and startup founder Anna Heim published her last “Tech in Latin America” round-up article on The Next Web, a news briefing about the technology startup industry in Latin America that I eagerly awaited as a startup founder living part time in Colombia. 
Much has changed in four years. Venture capitalists, for instance, have taken a shine to the region, with funding in just the first quarter of 2019 quintupling the $500 million that was raised by companies in all of 2016, and the number of unicorns — privately held startups that are valued at over $1 billion — having shot up from one in 2016 to 14 by the end of 2019.
As technology ecosystems throughout the region face new challenges presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, I thought to continue the prior series, taking a look at some of the biggest technology and startup news from the region each month.
Despite rising economic uncertainty stemming from the novel coronavirus, April still saw some startups in Latin America raise funding, while others focused their efforts on solving COVID-19-related issues. And one of the region’s oldest government-backed tech accelerators turned 10 years old! 
Here’s an entrepreneur’s guide on what happened in Latin American tech in April. 
March and April saw most countries in Latin America implement strict shelter in place rules on their populations to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. In late March, UNESCO calculated that more than 95% of Latin American children enrolled in school were no longer able to attend because of shutdowns. 
With social distancing measures in mind, Facebook announced that it would expand the release of its Messenger Kids app to 70 countries, including many in Latin America, as a means to help “kids connect with friends and family.” In 2018, when the company first expanded the app outside of the United States, Peru was one of the first countries, along with Canada, to gain access. Safety of the app still remains a concern though, as last year, TNW reported that Facebook had sent out alerts to parents about a design flaw in the app which allowed children to join group chats with unapproved contacts. 
American commercial real estate firm WeWork and Japanese holding company Softbank ran into trouble with regulators in Mexico this month, resulting in a USD $138,000 fine, according to a press release from COFECE, the country’s antitrust watchdog. The two companies are accused by the regulator of declaring a stock purchase by Softbank of WeWork shares more than six months after the deal had already been made. The announcement comes amid a fiery legal spat between the investor and the portfolio company, with WeWork’s board suing Softbank for its withdrawal of an offer to buy $3 billion in shares of company stock. The co-working space provider has locations in Mexican cities including Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City. 
Colombia is the latest backdrop for a showdown in the bustling South American delivery app marketplace. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Brazilian food delivery app iFood acquired a 51% stake in the Colombian operations of Delivery Hero SE, the parent company of Domicilios.com, a direct competitor of the Andean nation’s startup darling Rappi. 
Regulators still need to approve the merger, however, iFood’s corporate vice president for Latin America operations already has high hopes for the market, telling Bloomberg’s Ezra Fieser, “Together with Domicilios in this new partnership we will be able to invest exponentially more than in the past. We will grab a lot of market space in Colombia.” 
Last year, Rappi, which was accelerated at Y Combinator and previously received investment from Andreessen Horowitz, received an enormous capital injection of $1 billion from Softbank, helping further expand its operations. 
Magma Partners, a venture capital firm headquartered in Santiago Chile, announced it was “doubling down” on Mexican startups by acquiring Guadalajara-based accelerator Rampa for an undisclosed amount of cash. 
In a blog post on the firm’s website, Magma Partners detailed how the firm has worked closely with Rampa for years, and will use this new relationship to accelerate its interests in Mexico, Latin America’s second largest market. The company noted that it had already invested in 12 Mexican startups, and with the addition of Rampa’s founder Mak Gutierrez, now counts 15 partners across Latin America in cities such as Guadalajara, Mexico City, Bogotá, Santiago, Buenos Aires, as well as cities in the U.S. 
In other news from Mexican startups, AI startup Omdena, accelerated by Tec de Monterrey’s Orion Startups, was featured on the NASDAQ billboard; Monterrey-based One Prize, incubated at USC’s prestigious incubator led by Paul Orlando, announced new milestones, while Startup Mexico announced its support for providing free online training and better support for doctors.
Entrepreneur.com en Espanol, via its Editor in Chief Martha Elena Violante De Santos, also introduced its list of entrepreneurs under the age of 25 that are changing industries.
As venture capitalists around the globe tighten their belts amid the coronavirus outbreak, Latin America is no different. 
The region’s largest startup ecosystem, Brazil, witnessed a steep decline in funds invested in its venture capital market according to Reuters, with a drop of 85% in March compared to the same period last year. And Contxto reported major layoffs at Brazilian companies including GetNinjas, Conta Azul, as well as the Brazilian offices of Indian hospitality startup Oyo Rooms. 
Despite setbacks, a few startups in the country did record some investment in April. 
Sanar, an education platform for Brazil’s healthcare workforce, announced a Series B funding round led by Valor Capital and DNA Capital with follow-on funding from e.bricks Ventures and Vox Capital, who had previously invested in the company’s Series A in 2018. The investment brings the total amount of funding disclosed by Sanar to $11.5 million, according to Crunchbase. 
The company was founded in 2013 to help expand educational opportunities for healthcare workers in remote areas of Brazil, far away from larger cities where most doctors and nurses are concentrated. The move is somewhat of a timely investment considering Brazil is the most-affected country in the region with over 70,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of this writing.  
Brazil’s PetLove, an online marketplace for pet supplies, raised $48 million from SoftBank according to Reuters. The company is the leading e-commerce pet store in the country, according to PETS International, an industry analyst, and total pet supply sales in the country reached $8.7 billion in 2019. PetLove had previously received investment from KasZek Ventures, Monashees and Tarpon, reported the Latin American Venture Capital Association (LAVCA). According to Startup Universal, Brazil accounts for most of Latin America’s VC investment, at about $1.3 billion.
Outside of Brazil, Latin American vocational skills training platform Aprende Institute announced that it raised a $1.6 million seed round of funding from Angel Ventures via its AV Pacific Alliance Fund II LP, Artisan Venture Capital, 500 Startups, Claure Group and other angel investors. The company, which is based in Coral Gables, Florida but services Latin Americans as well as the United States Hispanic market, aims to fill the gap between high-cost, high-commitment vocation institutes and free tutorials on YouTube and Google to help people make money in fields they’re passionate about including gastronomy, business and entrepreneurship, wellness, trade skills, and fashion and beauty. 
Techstars, a global startup and corporate accelerator, re-focused the latest series of their flagship Startup Weekend event to challenge entrepreneurs to build companies to solve problems related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Over 59 countries hosted virtual “Unite to Fight COVID-19” events at various dates throughout April, including 10 Latin American nations as well as the United States territory of Puerto Rico. 
In Colombia, organizers Marian Villa, Steven Rodriguez, Miguel Gonzalez and Flor Liévano brought together numerous startups for a 54-hour startup creation hackathon. Judges, which included Andrés Cajiao, co-founder of Torre; Sergio Granada, CTO of Talos Digital; Jim Glade, principal at Espacio; and Manuela Peña Gómez, startup coordinator at Universidad de La Sabana, crowned AportApp as the winner. Still in development, AportApp works as a reverse delivery service for donating food to vulnerable populations most affected by the COVID-19 labor shutdowns. Donors can use the app to select how many food packets they wish to donate, providers package the donated food and deliver it to families in need who’ve signed up for the service.
The company aims to help provide much-needed resources to at-risk communities including informal laborers which make up nearly 50% of Colombia’s workforce, and haven’t been able to go out into the streets to sell their wares amid country-wide lockdowns. 
Global startup accelerator 500 Startups is pushing forward through the economic slump brought on by the outbreak, announcing that it’s accepting applications for its 12th cohort in Latin America. Selected startups will receive $60,000 and work closely with 500 Startups mentors for 16 weeks — whether this will be in-person or virtually is still undetermined. 
Speaking with Forbes Mexico’s Alejandro Medina, 500 Startups Partner René Lomelí said, “With this work dynamic, the plans for 2020 continue to be carried out without changes, staying aware of the possibility of modifying the program to be remote by July.” 
Finally, one of the leading accelerator programs founded in Latin America turned 10 years old in April, and released some data that highlight its wins, as well as its short-comings. 
Startup Chile, the Chilean government-backed accelerator led by Sebastián Díaz Mesa that provides $40,000 equity-free funding to bring foreign entrepreneurs from as far off as Silicon Valley and Singapore to the Southern Cone, announced that during its tenure the program has accelerated 1,960 startups from 85 countries, created 7,241 jobs in the country, and raised over 17 times the amount of capital originally invested by the government. 
The accelerator also noted that it needed to do more to close the funding gap between male and female founders in the country. In Chile, of the total capital startup founders raised, women founders only captured about 12% of it, despite stats that indicate the strength of female-founded companies, including that Chilean startups that have at least one woman on the founding team survive more (60.7%) than those made only by men (49.4%), according to a report from local newspaper El Mercurio. 
According to the Chile’s government, the Startup Chile model has been replicated in over 50 countries, most notably in Puerto Rico, where former Startup Chile Executive Director Sebastian Vidal helped launch its government-supported accelerator, Parallel18, in 2015. Parallel 18 has since built a reputation off a number of successes, including agtech startup UAV-18, as well as healthtech firm Abartys Health.
Despite worldwide economic uncertainty, the tech scene in Latin America experienced a few ups along with the downs during the month of April. A clearer picture of COVID-19’s impact on the tech ecosystem could emerge in May.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kate Middleton is continuing her efforts to raise awareness about early childhood development and the realities of motherhood, even while social distancing. The Duchess of Cambridge recently shared a video, via the royal family's YouTube account, which shows her discussions with parents, midwives, and experts about the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on families. These conversations are especially timely as the United Kingdom prepares to celebrate Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week starting May 4.
The Kensington Palace Twitter account posted an extended video of the adorable interaction with the brand-new mom and dad. "He's so sweet!" Kate says in the clip, admiring the newborn. After the mom reveals she gave birth the night before, Kate responds, "Oh my goodness, you must be exhausted!" As a mother of three, Kate can sympathize with the demands of childbirth (she used hypnobirthing during her delivery!) and the sleepless nights with infants. Watch the video above to see part of their sweet chat, as well as Kate's full conversation with healthcare professionals from around the UK.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Press Freedom Day: Lawan, Gbajabiamila hail Nigerian journalists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sunday Aborisade, Leke Baiyewu and Chima Azubuike
President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, have congratulated Nigerian journalists and all the stakeholders in the profession as they join their colleagues all over the globe to mark this year’s World Press Freedom Day.
Lawan, in a statement by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, on Sunday, noted that the day was specially set aside to highlight the heroic contributions of journalists to human struggle for justice, peace and development.
The Senate President said Nigerian journalists in particular should be proud of their frontline roles they play in nation-building and entrenchment of democracy in Nigeria.
The Senate President said the theme for this year’s celebration: “Journalism without fear or favour” was quite relevant in the light of the challenges facing the profession and the entire world.
The Senate President said the media had a very significant role to play in the current health emergency by feeding the public useful information about the coronavirus pandemic.
“For the world to win the battle against COVID-19, journalists too must not only be appreciated as frontline workers, they must have access to relevant information to enlighten the people on how to surmount the emergency,” Lawan said. While Gbajabiamila lauded the doggedness of the Nigerian media in reporting and helping in finding solutions to the challenges facing the country, Wase commended journalists for their contributions towards the sustenance of the country’s democracy.
The officers of the House said this in separate statements on Sunday in commemoration of the World Press Freedom Day.
The Speaker, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Lanre Lasisi, stated that though the Nigerian media had contributed a lot in stabilising the country, it would not be out of place to call on media practitioners in the country to be more factual about their reportage.
Gbajabiamila said the Nigerian media must rise to the challenge of fake news, saying such news would not do the country any good.
The Speaker said, “The choice is ours: either to make our country great through good reportage and analysis of issues, or to allow fake news and, in many cases, flagrant falsehood, to take over the space. At this age of social/online media, the onus is on the real journalists to make a difference. But I believe that the Nigerian media would not do anything that will take us backwards.”
 Wase, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Umar Puma, said journalists in the country deserved a better deal, considering the poor conditions under which some of them were made to operate. He stated that better welfare would spur the media to be more productive and alive to their responsibilities.
The Deputy Speaker said, “As you join your colleagues across the globe to mark the World Press Freedom Day, I commend your resilience and commitment to good governance in the discharge of your duties as the fourth estate of the realm.
“I urge all media owners to   strive to provide enabling environment and improvement of the welfare of their employees.”
Also, the Gombe State governor, Inuwa Yahaya, in a press statement by Ismaila Misilli, the governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, particularly praised the sacrifice and active role of journalists in the state.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The world's oldest central bank hits legal roadblock in economic crisis fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden's central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it's to act on a pledge to do "whatever it takes" to save the economy.
The Riksbank's 352-year history gives it the distinction of being the world's oldest central bank. But the legislation governing it has yet to catch up with the kind of policy it needs to deliver to address the crisis triggered by COVID-19.
Specifically, the Riksbank doesn't have the legal right to buy bonds issued by companies, even though it's made clear it's ready to do so as part of a recent package of emergency measures.
"The intention of the current Riksbank Act doesn't allow the bank to make outright purchases of corporate bonds or other private securities on the primary or secondary markets," said Niklas Schullerqvist, secretary to the parliamentary committee charged with overhauling the bank's policy framework.
So far the Stockholm-based central bank has bought 5.6 billion kronor ($890 million) of corporate commercial paper as part of an emergency quantitative-easing plan. But it's refrained from buying corporate bonds - an important source of financing in the biggest Nordic economy - despite repeated assurances it will so.
Schullerqvist says the Riksbank needs to consider European Union legislation on state aid as corporate bond purchases "may be considered supporting some specific parts of the economy."
Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank's legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn't comment further because "it's an ongoing process."
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are "certainly on our agenda." He also said "there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market."
Sweden's primary bond market is a vital source of funding for the country's businesses. And with record-low borrowing costs and a growing investor base flush with cash, the market's growth has increasingly shaped Sweden's economy.
But the market has been turned on its head since the COVID-19 crisis hit. Investors panicked and tried to redeem their cash, prompting 35 fixed-income funds to shut their doors. Even so, clients withdrew record quantities of cash and a spike in yields locked out all but a handful of top rated borrowers.
In April, Sweden's syndicated public bond market only saw corporate issuance from investment-grade companies such as Volvo, Industrivarden and Scania, as well as state-owned entities including Jernhusen, Akademiska Hus and Sveaskog.
The crisis that's hit Sweden's corporate bond market has drawn pleas from the investor community for the Riksbank to intervene before it's too late.
The Riksbank "should support new money rather than being very active in the secondary market," said Daniel Sachs, chief executive at credit manager Proventus Capital Management AB.
Magnus Nilsson, founding partner of Nordic Cross Asset Management, says that a "first step" toward making it easier for struggling businesses to access funding "would be for the Riksbank to get involved in the primary market for investment grade bonds."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The solution to the Rohingya crisis does not lie in hatred or inaction — Rachel Tan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MAY 4 — “How long do we deserve to be killed, raped, looted, and tortured?”
These were the painful words from a Rohingya friend as we both saw the recent events unfold.
An avalanche of hate that bred fear and is now imprisoning hundreds of innocent lives: teenagers, women, children, and even babies who barely know the world. Over 700 migrants and refugees around Kuala Lumpur were arrested in a single day.
As they fade into the horrifying confines of death and despair in our detention centres, they are forced to relive the trauma that they so desperately tried to leave behind and protect their young ones from. 
Part of my job is to document country situations and monitor public sentiment towards refugees in the Asia Pacific.
As I watched how a few comments ignited from the refugee boat pushback just two weeks ago blazed into a fierce, xenophobic campaign towards the Rohingya people, I was horrified it happened in my own home. 
In the span of a few days, hundreds of thousands Malaysians signed onto petitions, endorsed Facebook groups and Whatsapp messages chanting harmful demands for the Rohingya to be criminalised and ousted.
Even some leaders we elected to represent Malaysian values have churned and condoned destructive comments provoking unfounded public anger. As someone who is an observer of Myanmar, this is a very familiar — extremely dangerous — cry.
Fellow Malaysians, do we even understand what we are asking for? 
Yanghee Lee, the UN Special Rapporteur, an independent expert specially appointed for Myanmar the past 6 years, has not produced a single human rights report without the words ‘violence’, ‘rape’, ‘killing’, ‘deprived of food’.
Her reports consistently paint the recurring themes of torture, cruelty, and horrific circumstances forcing the Rohingya into dangerous boat journeys at high costs.
The most recent one catalogued ‘immense suffering inflicted by the military’ in Rakhine and Chin states: Brutal killings of innocent women and children. Dozens of men disappeared, tortured, murdered. The severely injured prevented from urgent medical care. Aid workers targeted; lives taken. Internet and communications shut down so that these realities are suffocated.
Lee ended her term a few days ago with a strong call for UN investigations with the same warning: what is happening in Myanmar is a ‘war crime’.
The people who look forward to our Malaysian shores, any shore, see behind them decapitated bodies of their loved ones, the ruins of their lives and homes, and carry with them ashes of their trauma. And we are calling for them to be sent back. 
Fellow Malaysians, do we even know what is really happening and why people are leaving? 
Over a million Rohingya men, women and children have fled for a reason. I have seen the camps and heard from the Rohingya people there myself.
With Bangladesh’s hospitality considered, the Rohingya remain trapped in a precarious situation.
Extreme poverty forcing refugees into the hands of traffickers, sold into exploitative labour in exchange for torture and abuse. Girls as young as five raped.
Young children kidnapped and disappear. Monsoon and floods tearing their bamboo huts apart, putting the elderly and immobile at risk. Women and girls forced into sex work to put food on the table.
All these with the threat of being returned to Myanmar hanging over their heads. 
In one country they were demoted to being third-class citizens, while in another they are walled up by the cold metal fences struggling hard to survive and with no access to the outside world. Could one really blame them for seeking some form of life, safety and security?
After our pushback of a boat full of emaciated Rohingya men, women, and children, they were left afloat at sea for months on end. Hundreds died. Floating bodies found.
Hundreds who belong nowhere, whose existence and death will not be accounted for. And there are still boats out there now. 
We who call on injustice have turned to perpetrating injustice.
We who condemn violence have now become agents of violence. 
Vulnerable people are caught in the narrative.
My wise Rohingya friend once said, 
“The solution to the Rohingya crisis does not lie in hatred. But by restoring their human rights. 
It is only possible by helping them to get back to their own country with rights, safety, security and dignity. They are travelling illegally because they don’t have travel documents which is a basic human right. We must not be ignorant to understand that people are fleeing from a genocide.
“We want to go back but we can’t. If they are not safe in their own country or in countries where they took refuge, then consider creating a space where they can live in safely and in dignity. Otherwise how long do we deserve to be killed, raped, looted, and tortured?”
This is not just a Rohingya issue. This is not just a boat pushback issue. This is not a border or national security issue. 
This is a human issue that tests our compassion, where our values as Malaysians will be demonstrated and recorded. This is a regional issue that acutely needs regional cooperation for solution.
Malaysia can lead this effort. Much needs to be done to undo and reverse the damage Myanmar has caused, felt even by us Malaysians.
The voice we need to amplify is not dissent towards a vulnerable people. It is one that propels our government forward towards concerting strategy and action. 
As a Malaysian, as a person who has sat through hundreds of interviews and has had personal conversations with refugees and the Rohingya people, as a person who have been graciously invited into the homes of refugees and the Rohingya people in our country, as a person who witnessed first-hand the desperate conditions of camps of a million people in Bangladesh, and as a person who receives countless reports of ongoing merciless killings in Myanmar, I appeal to you to stop reacting to the misinformation you hear, and begin to listen and see the realities that are happening.
More importantly, do not sit idle, in silence or in inaction. We, Malaysians can lead the way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The world's oldest central bank hits legal roadblock in economic crisis fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden's central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it's to act on a pledge to do "whatever it takes" to save the economy.
The Riksbank's 352-year history gives it the distinction of being the world's oldest central bank. But the legislation governing it has yet to catch up with the kind of policy it needs to deliver to address the crisis triggered by COVID-19.
Specifically, the Riksbank doesn't have the legal right to buy bonds issued by companies, even though it's made clear it's ready to do so as part of a recent package of emergency measures.
"The intention of the current Riksbank Act doesn't allow the bank to make outright purchases of corporate bonds or other private securities on the primary or secondary markets," said Niklas Schullerqvist, secretary to the parliamentary committee charged with overhauling the bank's policy framework.
So far the Stockholm-based central bank has bought 5.6 billion kronor ($890 million) of corporate commercial paper as part of an emergency quantitative-easing plan. But it's refrained from buying corporate bonds - an important source of financing in the biggest Nordic economy - despite repeated assurances it will so.
Schullerqvist says the Riksbank needs to consider European Union legislation on state aid as corporate bond purchases "may be considered supporting some specific parts of the economy."
Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank's legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn't comment further because "it's an ongoing process."
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are "certainly on our agenda." He also said "there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market."
Sweden's primary bond market is a vital source of funding for the country's businesses. And with record-low borrowing costs and a growing investor base flush with cash, the market's growth has increasingly shaped Sweden's economy.
But the market has been turned on its head since the COVID-19 crisis hit. Investors panicked and tried to redeem their cash, prompting 35 fixed-income funds to shut their doors. Even so, clients withdrew record quantities of cash and a spike in yields locked out all but a handful of top rated borrowers.
In April, Sweden's syndicated public bond market only saw corporate issuance from investment-grade companies such as Volvo, Industrivarden and Scania, as well as state-owned entities including Jernhusen, Akademiska Hus and Sveaskog.
The crisis that's hit Sweden's corporate bond market has drawn pleas from the investor community for the Riksbank to intervene before it's too late.
The Riksbank "should support new money rather than being very active in the secondary market," said Daniel Sachs, chief executive at credit manager Proventus Capital Management AB.
Magnus Nilsson, founding partner of Nordic Cross Asset Management, says that a "first step" toward making it easier for struggling businesses to access funding "would be for the Riksbank to get involved in the primary market for investment grade bonds."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Sunday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, warned anti-lockdown protesters who are not adhering to federal guidelines that their actions are unsafe from a public health standpoint.
Birx was asked by host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday about “big crowds of protesters that went into the Michigan state capitol without masks, massing together in close quarters.”
“It’s devastatingly worrisome to me personally, because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or an unfortunate outcome they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives,” Birx said. “So we need to protect each other at the same time as we’re voicing our discontent.
Birx’s comments on the Michigan protests appeared to divert from those made by President Donald Trump who had previously seemed to tweet in support of the demonstrations on Friday.
Birx on Sunday also addressed whether it was safe for people to flock to beaches, as well as whether states should be opening up beauty salons and spas.
On beaches, she said, “if it’s done with social distancing, yes. If it’s not done with social distancing, no.” Wallace remarked that visuals in California showed crowds on beaches clearly not adhering to social distancing.
Even if both parties at beauty salons and spas are wearing masks, it’s not enough to guarantee safety, Birx noted.
“It’s safer but we’ve made it clear that that is not a good Phase One activity and I think the President’s made that clear when he discussed the case in Georgia,” she said, referring to the federal guidelines for reopening local and regional economies. Some states, including Georgia, have allowed non-essential businesses like beauty salons and spas, to reopen. Trump has said he told Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp that he “disagrees strongly” with the decision, noting that “it’s just too soon” to be opening up spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors and barber shops in Phase One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everton's biggest fan on what Blues must do to win trophies again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everton need to get back to winning the respect of the rest of football if they’re to return to winning trophies.
That’s the verdict of the club’s most-obsessive fan, the living legend that is Dr David France.
As the man who single-handedly amassed The Everton Collection, the world’s greatest single club assemblage of football memorabilia, Dr France knows the Blues history better than most so he’s as well-placed as anyone to pass judgement on what is a watershed if not welcome moment.
It’s now May 2020 of course, the month that marks 25 years since Everton’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the 1995 FA Cup final and therefore the first time in the club’s 142-year history that they have gone a quarter-of-a-century without winning a major trophy.
Speaking from his Arizona home, some 5,000 miles from his birthplace of Widnes, Dr France told the ECHO: “It seems a lot longer than 25 years to me. If you look back to 1995, the Premier League had only been going for three seasons.
“We were one of the founding fathers of the Premier League so we were part of that ship-building project but then seemed to miss the launch, failing to jump on board the boat as it were.
“Maybe it’s a case of the good years flashing by and the not-so-good ones, staying with you?"
Over the intervening period, as putting together what would become the aforementioned Everton collection, some 18,000 items including programmes and Club Minute Books, which are now archived and freely available to view, Dr France launched the Everton Former Players’ Foundation which raises money for the physical and pastoral care for retired Blues.
Unlike today’s millionaire Premier League footballers, many old pros of previous eras have fallen on hard times and as well as alleviating pain for them by paying for operations, the charity has in several cases, also helped to restore dignity through providing material items such as a new suit to wear at the iconic Gwladys Street Hall of Fame dinners Dr France organised that would seemingly shake the foundations of the Adelphi Hotel.
He said: “My own initiatives were two-fold. To celebrate who were are, especially in this fallow period.
“The unfortunate thing is that we are in the shadow of our neighbours but we can still celebrate who we are.
“Everton has a unique history. I know that people say that we don’t want to be a museum and we spend too much time looking backwards but I always respond with ‘I look forward to the past’.
“We had six First Division top scorers before Dixie Dean even arrived (Jack Southworth, Jimmy Settle, Alex ‘Sandy’ Young, Bert Freeman, Bobby Parker, Wilf Chadwick), names that have now been long-forgotten but we were a well-established club since he showed up.
“It’s hard for older fans to come to terms with the fact it’s the same club who were once leading the way by playing attractive football.
“You took pride with how well the club was organised and how the fanbase was in harmony with the club but I believe that hasn’t been the way now for some time.”
Dr France believes that Everton’s difficulties began long before the advent of the Premier League though.
Although the Blues’ long-time benefactor Sir John Moores died aged 97 at his Formby home ‘Fairways’ on September 25 1993, early in the second season after the English top flight was rebranded, a significant period had already passed since Goodison’s grand old man – a ruthlessly demanding taskmaster who insisted Everton’s supporters demanded and deserved the best – had been at the peak of his powers.
When Sir John embarked on his final spell as Everton chairman in 1972, the Blues were in a four-way tie for the most League Championships of any English club, alongside neighbours Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal, all of whom had won seven titles.
Over the subsequent period of now almost half a century, Everton have added two more titles, Arsenal six, Liverpool 11 (now poised at long last for a 12th) and Manchester United 13.
Dr France said: “For me it’s quite clear where the decline started. It was the day that the late John Moores got poorly and could no longer be a hands-on member of the club.
“He was still influential but during his last few years people were just trying to guess what he wanted rather than him telling them and when he passed away there was nobody who knew how to steer the ship.
“We had a spell of three fortunate years in the mid-1980s that have skewed our memory but since the 1970s we’ve been in decline.
“There was an opportunity for the side that had Bob Latchford and Martin Dobson to win the title in 1975 but from then on – Howard Kendall’s first spell as manager apart – we lost our way and it’s a drip effect.
“Sir John Moores didn’t just bring his money but his ambition and his standards. He demanded the best of people and if you talk to anyone from Littlewoods they would tell you the same.
“He was a great man. He didn’t just make his money from the pools but also from Littlewoods department stores and the mail order business. It’s not very often that a businessman is successful in three different areas.”

Dr France believes that Everton not only need reclaim their place among the English game’s elite with their football but reassert their positions within the minds of others.
He said: “I think the thing that we need to win more than anything is the respect of the other people in football. That’s what has changed.
“It’s taken me decades to come to terms with the thought that Liverpool are more successful than us. That I’ll concede now but I don’t concede that Manchester City, Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur are more successful than us in any way.
“I might be living in my own little world here in the high deserts of Arizona but we’ve been trivialised.
“Peter Johnson used to tell me (in the late 1990s) that we were being marginalised and we were no longer talked about in terms of being one of the big five as it used to be when we were part of it.
“The thing is, if you don’t tell people that you’re the best then nobody is going to believe you.”
Rather than point the finger of blame at others though, Dr France reckons that many of the issues facing Everton come from within the club itself and he doesn’t believe it’s a purely modern phenomenon that can be exclusively pinned on the likes of David Moyes and his successors in the Goodison Park dugout.
He said: “I think a lot of our problems are self-inflicted. It’s got nothing to do with Heysel.
“Liverpool Football Club did not make us buy Brett Angell or Denis Stracqualursi.
“As for choking in big games, we’ve always choked though. We shocked against Inter in 1963, we were a better team than them and could have gone on and won the European Cup all the way back then.
“Look how many times we’ve choked against Liverpool when it mattered or how many FA Cup semi-finals we’ve been to (26: with 13 wins and 13 losses, third behind Arsenal 29: 20/9 and Manchester United 28: 19/9) but we’ve only won the competition five times (Everton’s winning percentage in the final is even worse having lost eight).
“Throughout our history, going all the way back, there has been a lot of disappointment and that’s what makes us the fans that we are. We have the character to deal with it.”
TOMORROW – PART TWO: Dr France’s thoughts on Farhad Moshiri, Carlo Ancelotti, life in lockdown and the fate of the Premier League season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA Academy India’s Jagshaanbir Singh picked by Point Park University</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s tough for giants to take baby steps, at the best of times. But the coronavirus crisis has forced a rather tall, young Indian – Jagshaanbir Singh – to carefully calibrate his dream of playing in the NBA and take it one small step at a time.
Amidst unprecedented uncertainty, Jagshaan has committed to play on the Pioneers team of Point Park University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he becomes the first Indian to win a scholarship.
It’s a match made – though not quite in heaven – but nevertheless in the higher echelons of the basketball universe for the 7-footer. The Pioneers were brimming with guards and looking for a big man; Jagshaan was keen to get regular playing time, to break the general Indian narrative of being confined to the bench.
“I chose this university because I knew they wanted me badly and would fit me into the team. Their coaches have mastered the art of playing big, and I needed a team where I got good playing time,” says the happy man, who’s maintaining his agility and strength at his personalised gym at home in Jalandhar, alongwith regular sessions of plyometrics.
While a bunch of universities had approached the 213 cm centre, what tipped the scales in Point Park’s favour was how Joe Lewandowski and Daryn Freedman, head coach and associate head respectively, had helped shape the game of another Indian-origin big, the 7’5” Sim Bhullar.
The university was thrilled to land a guy who, in Lewandowski’s words, has “great size and athleticism as well as tremendous understanding of the game.” The chief coach also noted that Jagshaan had been “coached well” and was an exciting potential.
A mix of great height and evolved skills has been tough to find amongst Indians, but Jagshaan has had the best pathways possible. An inaugural year student at India’s NBA academy in Delhi, Jagshaan proceeded to Golden State Prep (GSP), a top-five finishing school for young bigs at Napa Valley, California.
The 18-year-old recalls sunny California and some rather stormy days on the road during his six months playing for GSP. “It was 50-55 games in six months which honed my rebounding and game sense in general,” he says.
It also made him fearless. The instilling of physicality happened with literally every blow he copped. “I changed my mentality from being a non-aggressive player to an aggressive beast,” Jagshaan recalls.
“I used to be quite slow, and could see I needed to dive for the ball. I was getting smashed every game because the game’s physical and I realised I had to do something after getting hit a ton of times. I started hitting back,” he chuckles invoking Newton. “Every action has an equal reaction.”
Jagshaan is uniquely gifted: a big who can shoot accurately and seamlessly from the rim. Point Park was uniquely placed to polish his skills since they worked on a similar game when putting together the almost seven-and-a-half feet Sim Bhullar package.
Lewandowski has worked with several men’s and women’s 3on3 teams. Assistant coach Freedman, who trained Bhullar (Indian-Origin, Canadian-born) who played for Sacremanto Kings in the NBA.
Marc Pulles, Basketball Operations Team Leader, NBA India, says about Jagshaan, “He is a 7-footer who can shoot, a combination which we don’t see too often in players. I’m sure Point Park coaches will hone his skills and further sharpen his basketball IQ. During his time at the Academy, we witnessed a tremendous improvement in his physical attributes and the Point Park programme will only improve his craft each and every day with competitive game-time in the NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics).”
Pulles reckons Jagshaan’s decision to bridge over at GSP was a wise one. “Point Park is a well-known basketball programme for student-athletes. After graduating from NBA Academy India, Jagshaanbir’s decision to attend a prep school (Golden State Prep) was the right move to make him ready for the competitiveness of American basketball. Becoming the first NBA Academy India alumni to get a scholarship in a US University is a big responsibility and achievement and Jagshaanbir will keep growing and developing his basketball skills to the next level, I’m positive about that,” he adds.
At Pittsburgh, Jagshaan will study business administration and as a rarer bird, as comfortable on court as he is studying Math and Economics, he is hoping to keep up with the coursework. The importance of academics at a time when sport has an uncertain near future cannot be overstated. “I’ve always maintained good scores,” he says having been massively influenced by Tim Duncan, who finished college as an impressive student athlete.
Life itself has been imperiled by the virus devastation, and Jagshaan is mindful of how all his plans are at the mercy of things limping back to normal. “It’s an unspoken sword hanging,” says his father Tejinder.
Training at his fully-equipped gym is all he can do at the moment, having returned on February 15 – initially for 15 days and then pinned to home after all international travel halted.
“I’m working on my agility and jumps in the gym. It’s a great opportunity I have of entering the American system given I’m going from a country where basketball isn’t big enough. I have to stay prepared in this lockdown so that when things resume, I’m not unfit and can show my skills when I get the chance.”
He’s desperate to get back on court, though he admits he doesn’t know when that might happen.
The university is equally keen to get started.
“We’re really excited about our entire 2020 recruiting class, but this one is a huge pickup,” Freedman said. “We are excited to coach and work with Jagshaan.”
The Indian’s life at California also taught him the American art of building a social bond with others on the team and how to appreciate each other. “Right ,now I’m following my future teammates on social media and we are getting to know each other.”
While he learnt basics of grocery shopping on his first trip to the US and all about eating healthy (“I eat healthy but a big body like mine needs plenty of food. I do miss Indian food sometimes”), his time with GSP also saw him visit several community centres and old-age homes in the Bay Area, San Francisco and Napa Valley understanding the role of an athlete in the realms of social responsibility.
Though india witnessed a quiver of excitement when Satnam Singh was picked by the Dallas Mavericks (and let go much more quietly), the country awaits a bona fide entry into basketball’s biggest league by an Indian. “What’s the point of improving if I don’t get to play?” says Jagshaan, adding that his college stint at Point Park promises just that as the leading 7-foot recruit by Pennsylvania. The giant stride will, of course, be when he can fly into the US to start university and Jagshaan insists he’ll be ready when it’s time, hoping for max playing time on Starting Fives.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mike Black, owner of Capital Iron, was looking for a way to give back during the COVID-19 pandemic when he saw the heart flag printed in an edition of the Times Colonist.
It sparked an idea.
He decided to recreate the design on flags and sell them, with all proceeds going to the Rapid Relief Fund.
“It’s just our chance to do a little bit to help it out,” he said.
The flags sell for $20 and there are 150 available.
Flags can be purchased in person at Capital Iron’s downtown and Langford locations, by phone at 250-978-2200 or by email at shopfromhome@capitaliron.net.

Vancity has issued a matching challenge for donations, pledging to double all money received from last Wednesday to Saturday at midnight up to $100,000.
As of 6:30 p.m. Saturday, donations had reached just over 95 per cent of the goal.
More than 14,000 donations have been made to the fund.
“What seems to set this [fund] apart is just the sheer volume of individuals that have contributed,” aid Rob Janus of the Victoria Foundation. “As usual, we kind of punch above our weight. It’s amazing, once again, for Greater Victoria.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate coos over newborn baby during virtual chat with parents</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duchess of Cambridge has made a virtual bedside visit to new parents during a video call to midwives she worked alongside last year.
Kate chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted.”
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should “reach out and ask for help” if they need it.
The video call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
When the duchess, who is mother to six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, who celebrated her fifth birthday on Saturday, and two-year-old Prince Louis, began chatting with the parents of baby Max, she said: “Well firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?”
“It’s a little boy,” Ms Attwood told her, as she sat up in her hospital bed with her newborn son alongside her in a cot.
Given a closer look at little Max, the duchess cooed: “He’s so sweet. Ah, congratulations. When did you have him?”
Told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, Kate said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted,” and his mother replied “Yes. I’m pretty tired now.”
During her video chat, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents has changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
To maintain social distancing, three pairs of midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while another was filmed putting on personal protective equipment before taking the laptop in to introduce the duchess to baby Max and his parents.
From her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, the duchess watched as the hospital birth centre’s lead midwife Sam Frewin, whom she had met during her work placement last November, appeared on camera in a mask and disposable apron.
“I’m smiling, can you tell?” joked Sam.
“I know,” gasped Kate, surprised by her appearance.
Looking closer, she laughed, adding: “With your eyes, I can.”
Later Jennifer Tshibamba, an antenatal midwife who is part of a team offering ultrasound scans and blood tests for genetic conditions, said wearing masks was an added challenge when giving parents difficult news.
She said: “It’s the aspect of having that face-to-face contact and being at a distance and having your mask on and not seeing someone’s facial expressions and knowing that she might be hesitating to say something.”
During the video call, the duchess asked about the concerns of mothers and was told by Jo Doumouchtsi, a perinatal mental health midwife, there had been an increase in referrals for anxiety.
She said: “The main issues that women are having at the moment really are around coming into hospital and worries about catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.
“They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.”

Ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week which begins on Monday, Kate spoke to a group of experts last week, including Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, and Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
The duchess, who has spent much of her public work highlighting the importance of the early years development of children and parental wellbeing, said to the group: “Parents do need to go out and reach out to those who can support them, particularly those who can provide knowledgeable resource as well.
“It’s important to access and reach out for help when you do need it.”
She added: “You speak to six mums and all of you realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one who’s going through it.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the second weekend in a row, a group of people have taken to Queen’s Park to protest the lockdown measures in place to help slow the spread of coronavirus.
Over 100 people are gathering on the front lawn, holding signs that said “Fake pandemic,” and “Social distancing is fake science.”
Toronto police cars were spotted at the protest as well.
Premier Doug Ford said while he’s not against the right to protest, the people outside “are putting their lives in jeopardy.”
He added, “What just burns me up more than anything, more than them standing out there, is I see our Canadian flag being flown upside.”
He called it “disrespectful” to the Canadian military and those of the frontlines, as well Canadians who have been united through this challenge.
“If they want to fly our flag upside down and they don’t respect our country, I’ll be the first to help them pack their bags and find a country that they want.”
Last week, about 100 people gathered at Queen’s Park and carried signs calling for Premier Doug Ford to reopen the Ontario economy and that self-isolating was against their freedom of choice.
Toronto Police say no one was ticketed at the protest because they were spaced out enough to comply with physical distancing requirements.
Ford ripped into the protestors, calling them “a bunch of yahoos” and “absolutely irresponsible.”
Ontario currently has 17,119 cases of COVID-19 in the province and 1,176 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How we stay together: 'I don’t want to just be flatmates. It’s got to be more than that'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Names: Julia and Paul Miller Years together: 29Occupations: Therapist and engineer
Hearing her future husband sing The Sound of Music’s My Favourite Things sealed the deal for Julia Miller.
The couple were finalising their wedding preparations, a stressful time made worse because Julia’s father was in the final stages of cancer. She was steeling herself for the inevitable, when late one night she got a prank call. After telling the random caller exactly what she thought of him, she was upset and couldn’t get back to sleep. And so Paul sang his favourite song, about whiskers on kittens and raindrops on roses, to soothe her. “That’s the moment that I knew he was the one for me,” she says now.
The Sydney couple will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in November. Yet when they first met, the then-21-year-old Julia wasn’t interested in Paul, who was 23.
She’d just come out of a bad relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. A mutual friend decided she needed a fling to cheer her up, so she set the couple up, organising a group date on a yacht. Reluctantly Julia went along.
But Paul was keen: “I thought she was hot when I saw her. I was interested right from the first second.” He was an experienced sailor so he hoped to impress her, even feigning a dangerous moment that he skilfully navigated. Julia remained oblivious. Undeterred, the mutual friend nudged them into a second date. And this time, when just the two of them went to the movies, it was more successful. “That’s when I thought ‘I like what he looked like, but actually I really like him. He’s a nice guy.’”
At the time Paul was living in Newcastle and Julia was in Sydney, but they spent as much time together as they could. They bonded over their similar upbringings and shared values and quickly realised they were right for each other. After six months they moved in together in Sydney. They were keen to get engaged too, but were conscious that others may think they were rushing. “I’ve still got the piece of paper where Paul wrote the plan of when we were going to get engaged, because he’s like that,” says Julia. Paul adds their courtship was “pretty quick” by “2020 standards”… “but I think in the late 80s it wasn’t probably too ridiculous.”
The lead-up to the wedding was stressful. Not only was Julia’s father battling cancer, their priest was unwell with a brain tumour and a close family member died suddenly. Then three days before the wedding, Julia went to pick up her dress only to find her dressmaker was ill and not even close to finishing it, or the bridesmaid dresses. In a mad dash, Julia roped every woman she knew to finish the dresses in time for the wedding day. “I got an ulcer. I definitely got cold sores the day before. But I lost a lot of weight so I was really skinny,” she says with a laugh.
The day itself went smoothly but all the stress taught the couple an important lesson. Julia says they learned “early in the piece how we would go through bad times together.”
Young, happy and in love, the first few years of their marriage was fun. They saved hard and travelled. About four years into their marriage, they had their first daughter. Things got trickier around the arrival of their second child. “When you have just one child it doesn’t affect you so much, but when you have a second one and each of you have to share the load a little bit more, it probably separates you a little bit more than you’re first used to,” remembers Paul.
They made an effort to spend as much time together as possible. It was something Julia had learnt from her own parents. “They’re the sort of people who had to make sure that they had time to themselves so to a certain extent they pushed the kids away,” says Paul. “A lot of that rubbed off on Julia, so she made sure that our kids didn’t get in between us. So I think that’s been a positive in our relationship.”
They were always careful to maintain affection. “My mum and dad were really, really affectionate,” says Julia. “I think when I first met Paul he was affectionate, but he wouldn’t kiss me in public. It took him a little while, and now I find he’s probably worse than me,” she laughs.
Both were determined to make it work. Julia in particular wanted a great marriage, not just a mediocre one. “I thought, ‘I don’t want to just be together because of the kids,’ or, ‘I don’t want to just be flatmates.’ It’s got to be more than that.” She says if it had come to it, she wouldn’t have stuck around. “It’s just too sad. It’s too sad to be living in a loveless marriage.”
One of their biggest challenges came when Paul became very involved with sailing, spending huge amounts of time on it, to the exclusion of everything else. Julia made it clear things had to change. “That was probably our biggest hurdle, that was a couple of years and the girls were young-ish. But I remember one of my daughters saying, ‘All you do is argue’ … I just could not get him to understand how I felt about it.”
It’s something that Paul recognises in himself: “One of my problems is that I focus too much and I have blinkers. I can’t see everything else going on in my life, but that’s where we’re a good couple together because we are very good at adapting ... I don’t think either of us are really stubborn, so we tend to be able to adapt to either bring the other back onto the right path or to, when required, stay calm and live with it.”
What saved them was renovating their house, working shoulder to shoulder each weekend. It was another important lesson for the couple. “You’ve got to have projects together,” says Paul.
Over the years, their approach to conflict has evolved. Where Paul usually avoids conflict, Julia prefers to deal with it straight away. “He now is starting to say, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t realise that I was hurting you. Do you need to discuss it?’” And a lot of the time I go, ‘No, I’m fine. Because you validated it.’”
They were never afraid to disagree in front of their two girls. Both had grown up in homes where their parents didn’t appear to argue, so when there was an argument, it would cause undue anxiety. Instead they wanted their children to see them disagree, resolve and move on.
There was something else. For Julia, as a girl growing up surrounded by brothers, she had to learn to speak up for herself. She wanted her girls to learn that too. “I needed my girls to feel they could have a voice. My daughters will still say, ‘Good on you, Mum’s standing up to Dad.’ Not that Dad’s a pushover, but it’s to say, ‘Don’t let a man dominate you.’ For me that was important for the girls to see, that you can say what you think and not have to be pleasing all the time.”
These days both daughters are adults and have moved out of home. Julia and Paul are enjoying their time together, not least because they still have much in common. “We’ve got friends who go, ‘Oh, I love the way you do things together,’ I think, ‘Yeah, because we’ve kind of kept at it,’” says Julia.
“Not so long ago, [Paul] said, ‘I don’t think I’ll leave you. I’m kind of used to you now,’” says Julia. “I’ve told people that and they’ve gone, ‘Oh,’ and I thought, ‘No, it makes me laugh because that’s how I feel.’” She says they’ve settled into a more comfortable rhythm than ever before. “I never wanted to leave but you’re trying to make this perfect relationship … the kids have to be this and we have to have this perfect family. And now it’s just like, ‘Oh, I’m kind of used to you now’ … It’s not because you couldn’t find anyone else... It’s just that this life is easy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate coos over newborn baby during virtual chat with parents</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duchess of Cambridge has continued her video call meetings with health professionals and frontline workers.
The Duchess of Cambridge has made a virtual bedside visit to new parents during a video call to midwives she worked alongside last year.
Kate chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted.”
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should “reach out and ask for help” if they need it.
The video call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.
When the duchess, who is mother to six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, who celebrated her fifth birthday on Saturday, and two-year-old Prince Louis, began chatting with the parents of baby Max, she said: “Well firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?”
“It’s a little boy,” Ms Attwood told her, as she sat up in her hospital bed with her newborn son alongside her in a cot.
Given a closer look at little Max, the duchess cooed: “He’s so sweet. Ah, congratulations. When did you have him?”
Told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, Kate said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted,” and his mother replied “Yes. I’m pretty tired now.”
During her video chat, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents has changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate coos over newborn baby during virtual chat with parents</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duchess of Cambridge has made a virtual bedside visit to new parents during a video call to midwives she worked alongside last year.
Kate chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted.”
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should “reach out and ask for help” if they need it.
The video call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.
When the duchess, who is mother to six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, who celebrated her fifth birthday on Saturday, and two-year-old Prince Louis, began chatting with the parents of baby Max, she said: “Well firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?”
“It’s a little boy,” Ms Attwood told her, as she sat up in her hospital bed with her newborn son alongside her in a cot.
Given a closer look at little Max, the duchess cooed: “He’s so sweet. Ah, congratulations. When did you have him?”
Told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, Kate said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted,” and his mother replied “Yes. I’m pretty tired now.”
During her video chat, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents has changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
To maintain social distancing, three pairs of midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while another was filmed putting on personal protective equipment before taking the laptop in to introduce the duchess to baby Max and his parents.
From her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, the duchess watched as the hospital birth centre’s lead midwife Sam Frewin, whom she had met during her work placement last November, appeared on camera in a mask and disposable apron.
“I’m smiling, can you tell?” joked Sam.
“I know,” gasped Kate, surprised by her appearance.
Looking closer, she laughed, adding: “With your eyes, I can.”
Later Jennifer Tshibamba, an antenatal midwife who is part of a team offering ultrasound scans and blood tests for genetic conditions, said wearing masks was an added challenge when giving parents difficult news.
She said: “It’s the aspect of having that face-to-face contact and being at a distance and having your mask on and not seeing someone’s facial expressions and knowing that she might be hesitating to say something.”
During the video call, the duchess asked about the concerns of mothers and was told by Jo Doumouchtsi, a perinatal mental health midwife, there had been an increase in referrals for anxiety.
She said: “The main issues that women are having at the moment really are around coming into hospital and worries about catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.
“They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.”
Ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week which begins on Monday, Kate spoke to a group of experts last week, including Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, and Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
The duchess, who has spent much of her public work highlighting the importance of the early years development of children and parental wellbeing, said to the group: “Parents do need to go out and reach out to those who can support them, particularly those who can provide knowledgeable resource as well.
“It’s important to access and reach out for help when you do need it.”
She added: “You speak to six mums and all of you realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one who’s going through it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marianne Williamson’s dead campaign still spending cash, but stiffing vendors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marianne Williamson is facing a powerful new dark psychic force — campaign debt.
The New Age author’s presidential campaign committee still owes $238,180 to various election vendors, some of whom now say she is trying to renege on the payments. Williamson suspended her campaign in January 2020.
“She’s not paying us,” Jennifer Marshall, co-founder of Next Digital Connection, told The Post. “We are a very small business, and we will be totally and utterly bankrupted if she doesn’t pay her bill.”
The North Carolina family business Marshall runs with husband Jeffery provided much of the texting and phone-banking services the Williamson campaign used to raise money and build her profile during her quixotic run for the White House, when she memorably warned Donald Trump that she would defeat him with “love.”
The Next Digital Connection bill came to $72,589, Federal Election Commission filings show. After a text message to Williamson in March reminding her that the bill was “months overdue,” Marshall said she was phoned by campaign consultant Wendy Zahler.
“Wendy wanted to [re-negotiate] down to pennies on the dollar,” said Marshall, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer in May 2019. “We’re just two people who have a small company and we’re trying to do the right thing by candidates running for office and she screwed us.”
Unlike many of the other 2020 candidates, Williamson seems to be leaving some creditors high and dry while living large, burning through what remains of her campaign cash.
In January, February and March, Williamson spent roughly $490,000 — $1,930 in charges to the five-star ultra luxe InterContinental Willard hotel in Washington, D.C; and at least another $5,771 in expenditures to other high-end spots in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and New York City — almost all after she officially suspended her campaign.
There was also $1,483 to a company called “streaming for the soul” — a Netflix-style service for self-help videos.
And she maintains a coterie of at least five paid staffers who took in $30,587.
“We looked at the FEC filings and we were horrified,” Marshall said. Williamson still has $72,428 in her coffers.
A second vendor owed more than $10,000 by the Williamson campaign is not confident they will ever see the cash.
“There is very little you can do to collect on a political committee. They can’t legally shut down, but there is no one to collect on. It’s like a bankrupt business,” a rep for the company said.
“The problem with vanity runs for president is that untimely the bill comes due — and you can’t wish those away,” Democratic strategist Eric Koch told The Post. “Marianne Williamson was never a serious candidate for president, but the least she could do is pay her bills in the middle of a global pandemic and recession that’s hitting small businesses, like the vendors she’s stiffing, very hard.”
Williamson became a minor celebrity after entering the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with breakout viral performances in the first two debates. Despite having no prior experience in elected office, she managed to raise more than $8 million for her effort and hire a staff of 20 operatives spread out across Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
A self-help guru, Williamson is the author of 13 books, several of which were bestsellers. She first rose to national prominence in the early 1990s with regular appearances on “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” She has been described as the talk show host’s spiritual advisor. Williamson has long disdained in-depth policy matters in favor of “politics of love” — the title of her most recent book.
“When enough minds are vibrating on a high enough level, then all lower thought forms will fall of their own dead weight,” she opined in a 2011 tweet.
She’s lived briefly in a geodesic dome in New Mexico, been endorsed by Kim Kardashian and officiated Elizabeth Taylor’s last wedding to Larry Fortensky.
Williamson is far from alone in ending her campaign larded with debt. While some candidates like New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders owe nothing, it’s far more common to leave large debts lingering — sometimes for years.
In his brief run for the White House last year, Mayor Bill de Blasio racked up more than $100,000 in debt, which remains unpaid. California Sen. Kamala Harris, whose campaign imploded in December, still owes more than $1 million. Even former President Obama didn’t pay off his 2012 presidential campaign debt for three years.
“We asked to renegotiate; we did not propose pennies on [the] dollar. We are in [the] process of resolving all of our debts,” Williamson said in a statement to The Post when asked about the Next Digital Connection arrears. “The next report will show the debt down to $212,000. It’s a process and that’s what takes time. Some bills are settled and some will take longer.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Venture capitalists reveal the startups that changed everything in the past decade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2010s were a wild ride for startups and the investors who pumped money into them.
As the decade kicked off, smartphones were becoming ubiquitous, connecting billions of people to the internet – many for the first time – and paving the way for a wave of innovative business models.
Online marketplaces and sharing economy platforms – Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and many more – demonstrated the power of network effects, and in doing so, completely changed how people and businesses interact with each other.
Companies seized on the stream of constant, real-time, location-based, and personalized data that consumers volunteered via a growing list of smart devices to provide them with faster and more convenient services.
Entrepreneurs had the wind at their backs, thanks to a flood of venture money and access to technical infrastructure – Amazon Web Services – meaning they could spin up and scale up their startups like never before. Unicorns seemed to appear everywhere, and tech IPOs had investors excited.
But the tides began to turn in the second half of the decade as a flood of scandals chipped away at the idea that tech companies – and tech founders – are inherently good. Public investors became skeptical of the premium price attached to some tech companies, and the batch that went public in 2019 had a rough go of things.
Four months into 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has rocked the global economy and startup world, leading to at least 30,000 layoffs at venture-backed companies and even impacting unicorn tech darlings like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and Peloton as funding and sales have dried up.
After speaking with five venture capitalists about how things have evolved since 2010, some clear lessons emerged – as well as some clear examples of those lessons. While it would be impossible to include every important startup, below are the companies that investors said have had the most impact on their industry in the past 10 years.
Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Theranos’ Elizabeth Holmes, and WeWork’s Adam Neumann: All were considered charismatic and visionary founders who sought to change the world, but each was eventually forced out of their respective companies amid scandal.
When Holmes resigned in 2018 in the face of criminal charges and reports of fraud at Theranos, “everyone in venture really questioned their own diligence,” Kristin Gunther, a principal at Revolution, told Business Insider. Gunther added that it made her reflect on how she engages as a board member.
“Against a background where, for a couple years here, hot deals moved really fast and people could get funded based on two PowerPoint slides, it became even more important to say, ‘Hey, fine, this is a hot deal, but I’m going to miss it because it’s not worth it to cut the corners,'” Gunther said.
Kalanick was also forced out for cutting corners. In 2017, investors orchestrated his resignation at a time when Uber’s public image had plummeted. Once a company that every investor wanted in on, critics had started alleging that Uber enabled workplace harassment, skirted local regulations, and that Kalanick’s own behavior had put the company on a crash course.
Neumann, WeWork’s eccentric founder, stepped down earlier this year after the company’s failed attempt to go public led to reports of his extensive conflicts of interest, mismanagement, and bizarre behavior.
All three companies epitomized Silicon Valley’s obsessive focus on growth and a celebration of ambitious founders, which often ignored problematic behavior and business practices.
“I just think we abandoned values in terms of, not just how we invested, but managed companies,” Elliott Robinson, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told Business Insider.
The pervasiveness of social media and digital ads has given companies powerful new ways to connect with their target audience and helped enable the rise of direct-to-consumer brands.
Anu Duggal, founding partner at Female Founders Fund, told Business Insider that social media has “enabled brands to have a direct conversation with those consumers and have that impact their actual product design.”
Duggal highlighted brands like Warby Parker and Glossier as companies that have effectively leveraged conversations with those consumers to inform product development.
Jenny Lefcourt, general partner at Freestyle and founding member of All Raise, said another reason these brands have been so successful is that they’ve created “authentic community” among their consumers.
“Maybe you go to Glossier because you love makeup and you start connecting with the community about that and before you know it, you start becoming friends and you’re sharing travel tips,” Lefcourt told Business Insider.
These companies didn’t initially seem like sure bets, however. Gunther pointed to online retailer Jet.com and its acquisition by Walmart as an important proof of concept, and said it “showed the exit path for some of these direct-to-consumer companies where that was really a question.”
It’s no secret that venture capital firms – and, as a result, the entrepreneurs they fund – suffer from a lack of diversity. A recent survey by RateMyInvestor found that the typical founding team was a “two person, ‘all male,’ ‘all white,’ U.S. university-educated team residing in Silicon Valley.”
Over the past decade, however, with several women-led ventures reaching multi-billion-dollar valuations and Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake becoming the youngest female founder to take a company public, investors are finally taking notice.
“Venture capitalists are pattern matchers,” Lefcourt said. “Seeing these women take these companies from start to IPO and be incredibly successful enables other venture capitalists – whether they’re men or women – to change their view on what successful looks like.”
Venture capital firms still have a long way to go both in terms of who they invest in and who is doing the investing, especially when it comes to racial and educational diversity. But, at least when it comes to women-led ventures, Duggal said investors are “recognizing the fact that there are real returns to be made.”
RateMyInvestor’s survey also found that venture funds have a strong geographical bias, with nearly half of all investments in the past five years going to startups based in Silicon Valley. But in recent years, several companies have revealed the untapped potential of other markets, particularly outside of the US.
“There were always great companies and great innovation outside of the US,” Victoria Treyger, general partner and managing director at Felicis Ventures, told Business Insider. But prior to Shopify, she said, “there was a belief that VC-backed companies outside of the US exited earlier.”
Shopify, which is based in Ottawa, Canada, is notable for its outsize role in empowering small and medium businesses. Robinson, who invested in Shopify, said that by building ecommerce tools and “multiple revenue streams off of a really large user base, that just really changed the way people thought about [software as a service].”
Atlassian, an enterprise software company out of Sydney, similarly put Australia on the map. “I just see the number of [Atlassian] alums that are in that ecosystem,” Treyger said, noting how employees of pioneering companies like Shopify and Atlassian often go on to start their own ventures.
Israel has also become a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity. It has produced household names like Waze (which was acquired by Google) and, in 2018, 61 companies exited at an average deal size of $81 million.
Within the US, cities like Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Portland, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., have also seen massive increases in both investment and startups.
Fintech was another sector this decade that saw major disruption and a flurry of new companies achieving massive valuations. Startups took advantage of the rise of smartphones, digital banking, and machine learning to bring more consumers into the financial system and upend how people spend, make, borrow, and exchange money.
“When you look underneath, there is true technological innovation,” Treyger said. “It’s really exciting to see that the dollars went into companies that have truly transformed the financial service sector.”
As just a few examples, Stripe and Square helped change the way businesses get paid, Lending Club and SoFi took on incumbents in the personal loan space, and Robinhood reinvented how everyday consumers invest.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Residents of a shelter in Chennai learn a new skill during the lockdown and put it to good use</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you walked into Greater Chennai Corporation’s shelter for women with disabilities in Nungambakkam, your are likely to be witness the making of masks.
When this writer got in touch with them recently over the phone, work was going on in full swing.
Every one was at their post. Mary and Matilda were said to be cutting the cotton cloth into small workable pieces. Aswini, Kalaiselvi, Nadhiya and Lakshmi were cutting the naada (string)to be attached to the cloth; and Krishnaveni and Rajeswari were getting the folds right and snipping extra threads.
On the ground floor, Shanthi and Manimegalai were plugging away at their sewing machines.
This small team, all residents of Better World Shelter for Women with Disability, have been turning out an average of 300 cloth masks every day, over the last few weeks.
Apart from Shanthi, a tailor with loco-motor disability, none of them has any experience in sewing or making masks. The pandemic has forced them to learn the new skill.
One of Shanthi’s customers, a Corporation employee, brought her the first order. “I used to stitch blouses for her and she asked me if I could stitch masks,” says Shanthi. She was given 20 meters of cloth and asked to make 1000 masks. “We made 350 pieces with it in one-and-a-half days,” says Shanthi.
Another requirement was for Corporation’s frontline workers. “Initially, there was a shortage of masks in the city and that’s how orders started coming in, and it was always by word of mouth,” says Aiswarya Rao, director of the Centre and a paediatrician by profession. Initially, she says, Shanthi was helped by two others, but as there was a growing sense of urgency, the other residents from the shelter joined in. Some of the residents are wheelchair-basketball players and a few others are working in private firms; most of them are at the hostel ever since the lockdown began.
All those who showed interest in the work were given roles based on their ability. Manimegalai did not know how to use the sewing machine; now she stitches 50 pieces a day. Matilda Foneca, a wheelchair-basketball player, juggles a call centre job and keeping a count of the masks. The masks are priced between ₹40 and ₹ 45 and they got their first cheque recently.
“Most of us have learnt a new skill that is going to keep us economically independent in this crisis,” says Matilda. The women plan to divide the money they earn among themselves. To place an order, call 9677225069.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taapsee Pannu to receive training from Mithali Raj’s friend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the last few years putting Taapsee Pannu at the forefront of Indian cinema, this year would have been even bigger. Having had Indian Women’s cricket captain, Mithali Raj’s biopic to prepare for, apparently, the actress was all geared up to receive training from the cricketer’s own friend.
Titled ‘Shaabash Mithu’, helmed by Rahul Dholakia, Times of India reports Pannu stating, “One of Mithali’s friends, Nosheen, also a coach with the Railways Team, was going to coach me on the file. I have also met Mithali and she has a few things similar and a few character traits totally opposite of mine. Her demeanour is of a perfect team leader. She’s slightly introverted, which I guess will be a challenge for me to play.”
Despite the lockdown, the actress is ensuring she can do all she can to still gain all the information she needs to get into character. “I chat with her on messages but it’s been formal so far. I look forward to keeping in touch with her for the rest of my life because she’s an inspiration for many girls like me,” Pannu expressed.
She went on to add, ” As for the training, had everything been fine, I could have used my time to polish my game as a cricketer but that is not possible right now. I can’t watch videos to learn how to play the game. So, I will just try and maintain my health in a way that when I start training again for ‘Rashmi Rocket’ and ‘Shaabash Mithu’, things don’t take very long to fall into place.”
Though the first look of the film has already been released, there has yet to be further information about the cast that will be joining Pannu on-screen. It seems, with all shooting currently on stand-by, Dholakia and his team seem to be taking advantage of the time they have.

RateMyInvestor's survey also found that venture funds have a strong geographical bias, with nearly half of all investments in the past five years going to startups based in Silicon Valley. But in recent years, several companies have revealed the untapped potential of other markets, particularly outside of the US.
"There were always great companies and great innovation outside of the US," Victoria Treyger, general partner and managing director at Felicis Ventures, told Business Insider. But prior to Shopify, she said, "there was a belief that VC-backed companies outside of the US exited earlier."
Shopify, which is based in Ottawa, Canada, is notable for its outsize role in empowering small and medium businesses. Robinson, who invested in Shopify, said that by building ecommerce tools and "multiple revenue streams off of a really large user base, that just really changed the way people thought about [software as a service]."
Atlassian, an enterprise software company out of Sydney, similarly put Australia on the map. "I just see the number of [Atlassian] alums that are in that ecosystem," Treyger said, noting how employees of pioneering companies like Shopify and Atlassian often go on to start their own ventures.
Israel has also become a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity. It has produced household names like Waze (which was acquired by Google) and, in 2018, 61 companies exited at an average deal size of $81 million.
Within the US, cities like Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Portland, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., have also seen massive increases in both investment and startups.
Fintech was another sector this decade that saw major disruption and a flurry of new companies achieving massive valuations. Startups took advantage of the rise of smartphones, digital banking, and machine learning to bring more consumers into the financial system and upend how people spend, make, borrow, and exchange money.
"When you look underneath, there is true technological innovation," Treyger said. "It's really exciting to see that the dollars went into companies that have truly transformed the financial service sector."
As just a few examples, Stripe and Square helped change the way businesses get paid, Lending Club and SoFi took on incumbents in the personal loan space, and Robinhood reinvented how everyday consumers invest.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Divisive in Political Terms’: UK Gov’t Rejects EU’s Calls For Office in Northern Ireland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK’s Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt has written to the European Union to say that Brussels is not allowed to have an office in the Northern Irish city of Belfast post-Brexit, despite repeated requests.
Mordaunt’s stern words come on the heels of a second reported request this year from the EU asking for London’s permission to establish an office in Belfast so that it can oversee the establishment of new customs checks on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government, there will be new bureaucracy on checks and trade between different parts of the UK.
The EU has continued to call for the UK to begin the construction of new customs posts that will be needed to carry out effective and efficient trade by the time the UK leaves the EU come 1 January 2021.
Per the reporting of Irish national broadcaster RTE, the secretary general for the EU’s external action service, Helga Schmid, wrote in February of this year to the British government saying that the EU needed to see “very particular capabilities and competences on the ground, distinctive from the more traditional competences of any other EU delegation”. According to RTE, Miss Schmid was hoping to see the new regulatory system established by the summer of 2020, in time for the ending of the transition system on 1 January 2021.
Despite having their request for the establishment of an office rebuffed in the past, Schmid wrote to the UK government in March this year, making the second case for an EU office in Belfast by saying that: “At least during the initial phase of the application of the protocol, the EU will want to avail of these rights on an ongoing basis. To do so effectively, an office in Belfast staffed by technical experts is indispensable”.
Reports from Ireland, however, have suggested that under Theresa May’s prime ministership, the government said that it wished to see the EU maintain an office in Belfast after Brexit. Reportedly, in one letter, then-Permanent Secretary to the Foreign Office Simon McDonald wrote to the EU that, “the UK government supports the continued presence of EU officials in Edinburgh and Cardiff, alongside London and Belfast, given the longstanding relationship the EU has with all three devolved nations”. However, after Boris Johnson came to power in July 2019, a more hardline approach to dealing with the EU prevailed, including the rejection of establishing customs and regulations offices in Belfast.

    <h5 class="mb-1">St. Jude music therapists organize backyard jams for kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amy Love had to leave the Memphis hospital where she brings music to severely ill children — she and other support staff couldn’t take the risk of spreading COVID-19 to these frail patients.
But she was determined: The music must not stop.
So her house became a recording studio, and Love, fellow music therapist Celeste Douglas and intern Abigail Parrish became video stars for kids at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital who feed on their energy, their melodies, their love.
“Let’s get moving!” Love cries, as she sits cross-legged on a blanket in her backyard.
They play guitars and little drums, shakers and tambourines, and Love’s dog joins in on the fun — even as a lawn-mowing neighbor seems a bit puzzled.
“We’re really excited to be with you today, even if we can’t be there in person,” Douglas tells their early childhood group from afar.
No instruments? No problem. Love urges their viewers: “Just move around with us!”
Advertising
The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.
Entertainer Danny Thomas opened the pediatric treatment and research hospital for children with catastrophic diseases in 1962. Care is free for all. Since many of the patients are immune deficient, Love and other support staff are working remotely.
The hospital’s two resident therapy dogs are on hiatus off campus, as well.
“What we’re doing is finding new ways to support our kiddos and keep them safe at the same time,” Love said.
In the hospital, the team holds the early childhood music group once a week for kids up to 3 years old.
Advertising
“That’s one thing I’ve really missed,” Love said. “We’d all get together and play tons of music and were super loud.”
Switching gears was a bit of a learning curve, she said. Like the ukuleles. Asking kids to teach themselves the instrument could have gone either way, but Love was optimistic.
“It’s a really easy instrument to feel really successful with,” she said. “You can mark up different parts of the ukulele and play it pretty easy. Even with one finger you can be successful and play a chord.”
Love can’t wait for the day she can return to the hospital. In the meantime, she has a mission.
“Music is not canceled,” she said. “We’re going to continue playing music until we can all get back together again.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">

Irascible, outspoken Tesla chief Elon Musk went on another Twitter rant Friday, including saying the company’s stock was overvalued, which sent the electric carmaker’s shares tumbling.
“Tesla stock price is too high imo” (in my opinion), Musk said on Twitter.
“Now give people back their FREEDOM,” he demanded shortly after and then cited lines from the US national anthem, an apparent repeat of his complaints about stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Musk, who delivered an expletive-laden rant Wednesday night in an earnings call in which he dubbed coronavirus restrictions “fascist,” also said, “I am selling almost all my physical possessions. Will own no house.”
Shares of Tesla had risen about 85 percent this year as of Thursday’s close as production has risen and analysts praised the company as well positioned for an expected transition to electric cars.
But the share price sank 10.3 percent Friday to close at $701.32 following the latest Twitter outburst.
The tweets about stock valuation recall Musk’s controversial tweets in August 2018 when he said he had “funding secured” for a quickly-aborted campaign to take the electric car maker private.
US securities regulators ultimately charged Musk with fraud and fined him $20 million, part of a running dispute with  the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Musk agreed under an April 2019 deal with the SEC on topics he should avoid on Twitter or other social media, including statements about acquisitions, mergers, new products and production numbers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">As the lockdown lingers, keep a watch on the farm sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In our fight against Covid-19, lockdown 1.0 lasted 21 days. Lockdown 2.0, which is now nearing the end, is for 19 days. We are already gearing for lockdown 3.0, and one doesn’t know how long will falling agricultural incomes and the forced stoppage of most of our economic activity last. India has so far been successful in keeping the number of lives lost due to Covid-19 low, but our economy in terms of production, unemployment, income, etc., has suffered a setback, besides the huge outgo on medical infrastructure.
While Covid has not entered into rural India in a big way, the fallout has taken its toll in terms of loss of income flow in general and agricultural income in particular. As the authorities and leaders gather to consider the next steps, we cannot forget that the costs have, in the immediate, been borne by the weakest sections of our society.
A large number of migrant workers are from rural areas. Some of them work on a monthly basis but a large number of them work on a daily-wage basis as construction workers, footpath vendors, washer-men, plumbers, carpenters, auto-rickshaw drivers, and so on. In the case of salary earners, it is expected that for a short period of the lockdown their employers may give salaries for not attending work, but daily bread earners are without any income in urban areas.
The administration is doing its best to provide them food but reaching out to them is a difficult and costly proposition. This has caused anxiety among them. In order to manage within limited resources, they usually stay in shared accommodations. The lockdown has made their shared accommodation a crowded place as some of them are using this on shift basis.
This has caused the migrants a lot of mental stress besides higher risk of contagious disease. This apart, their emotional attachment back home has aggravated the stress and increased the risks of a severe breakdown on all fronts — economic, family, moral, mental and physical.
The exact number of migrant wage labourers is not known but it is estimated that the teeming millions of rural workers are working in various unorganised sectors. A large majority of them belong to rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Odisha.
Back home, their family members are suffering from a number of problems due to the lockdown, and important among these include:
Migration of agricultural labourers to their native places making harvesting of rabi crop a costly proposition due to non-availability of local labour and rise of wage rates.
Fall in demand for food commodities in general and no-vegetarian food items like eggs, chicken, and meat in particular. This fall in demand has resulted in consequent decline in prices of these commodities.
Higher transportation cost of vegetables and fruits has also impaired viability.
Weekly holiday in milk collection by dairy cooperatives has added fuel to fire.
In short, agricultural income has been reduced dramatically. On the top of all, the fall in urban remittances due to lockdown by causing displacement of migrant workers is a big blow to rural India. In the absence of proper transportation and marketing facilities, the prices of other agricultural commodities in rural areas are highly depressed.
In this backdrop, it should not be surprising even if we end the year with negative agricultural income. Extension of the lockdown up to May 3 has caused restlessness among rural masses in general and stranded migrant workers in urban areas in particular.
At the same time, the importance of the lockdown can’t be gainsaid. Undoubtedly, life is more important than money. However, the needy sections like migrant workers,daily bread earners, agricultural labourers, and tenant farmers should be given relief on a war footing.
In this context, the following measures are required with a sense of urgency. Extending the lockdown without taking these steps will lead to unmitigated disaster.
Arrangements should be made in each city to identify migrant workers anxious to return home. A district-wise list will help in making necessary arrangements to take them back home by rail or road. In this context, the Home Ministry recently instructed repatriation of migrant workers to their native homes, which should be undertaken on a war footing.
Therefore, the State governments concerned should monitor their safe return and, if required, the services of the Army should also be used to expedite their return. But once back home, they should be kept in quarantine as per the rules. Needless to say, the return of migrant workers will augment supply of labour at the village level to take up late harvesting and threshing operations of current rabi crops and preparing for the ensuing kharif season.
It goes without saying that as taking migrant workers back home enhances the risk of transmitting Covid in rural areas, we need to develop necessary medical infrastructure at district levels to manage the contingency of this sort.
Additional budgetary provisions are needed under MGNREGA to accommodate these additional migrant workers. Projects benefiting the community at large like watershed solar power lift irrigation should be taken up under this programme on private lands as well.
With a view to ensuring social distancing (better to call it physical distancing) and removing other bottlenecks in marketing of crops, arrangements may be made at the village level to purchase farm produce along the Amul pattern. Incidentally, the recent guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 are quite encouraging and may go a long way in increasing agricultural production but not sufficient to ensure increase in agricultural income.
Kudos to the RBI for announcing adequate refinance assistance to NABARD, SIDBI and NHB to enable commercial banks to augment financial assistance to rural masses However, the ball is now in commercial banks’ court. In this context, the RBI should not shy away from stipulating time-bound targets to enlarge credit flow.
And last, but not the least, Coid is a medical emergency that requires higher doses of nutritional intake, especially by farmers .
This is a complex issue and the government will have to apply its mind to deliver on this. In its absence, we will be incapacitating the lifeblood of our economy — the workers who build, and sow and reap — and that will put India in a downward spiral from which it will be difficult to come out soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla tumbles after Musk tweets that stock is too high</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) — Shares of Tesla tumbled 9% on Friday after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker’s high-flying stock was overly expensive. “Tesla stock price is too high,” Musk said on Twitter in one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the U.S. national anthem and saying that he would sell almost all his physical possessions.
The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla’s market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk’s stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.
More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, “No.”
Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led to a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer prescreen tweets with important information about the company.
Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them. In April 2019, Musk tweeted, “My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.”
“We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek, and it’s Elon being Elon. It’s [certainly] a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email.
Tesla’s stock has surged in recent weeks but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Musk’s latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla’s quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak “fascist.” Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.
“Musk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.
Musk’s iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla. Tesla’s recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla’s market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Large-Cap ETFs Point To “Sell In May” Sell-Off</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While April was extremely strong for equities, May 1 started off poorly in a risk-off move. The fund flow data this week of the top ETFs by AUM show that trend. “Sell in May and Go Away” is something we will likely be hearing for the next few weeks, it will be interesting to see if the flows will follow that mantra, or if 2020 can buck the trend. It will be an interesting month with plenty of shockingly poor economic numbers set to come out after a full month of stay-at-home orders in April.
The largest ETF by EUM, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) lost some more ground this week. It had over $3.2 billion in outflows, bringing its 30-day total losses to $6.7 billion. For a holding with an AUM of a still impressive $252 billion, it might not seem like a huge deal, but there is a trend to cheaper ETFs right now. SPY’s net expense ratio of 0.094% while still cheap, is higher than their direct competitors.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) also went risk off this week and lost some ground, losing $1.76 billion in net assets. After an impressive rally since March 23, it looks like investors are taking their winnings off the table. It has still gained $13.7 billion in the last 90-days, which likely reflects its net expense ratio of 0.03%.
The other stock-based ETFs that lost some flows this week were the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA). They lost $746 million, $449 million, and $159 million in flows this week, respectively. When stock markets like the S&P 500 rally 26.5% off their recent lows on March 23, it is not unusual to see investors look for safe havens.
It was not entirely a loss for stock-based funds in the top AUM category, however. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) gained $1.4 billion of inflows this week, as the returns turned positive on the year. After some notable technology companies reported earnings last week, there was likely more interest among the companies inside of QQQ. It has also amassed just under $9.6 billion in the last 90-days, impressively.
A look at where the rest of the inflows were for the week tells you how investors are eyeing up the market, and possibly repositioning for the “Sell in May” phenomenon. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) amassed almost $1.1 billion in the last week, bringing their 90-day total to $8.7 billion.
As investors looked to safe haven assets, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) also gained assets of $456 million and just under $306 million, respectively. This is despite rock-bottom interest rates across the board, with the Federal Reserve maintaining 0% interest rates on Wednesday and implying no hikes in the medium-term.
It will be interesting to see if this trend continues next week, especially after some potentially massive monthly re-balancing among pension-type assets.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla tumbles after tweet from Musk account saying stock too high</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: Shares of Tesla Inc tumbled 12 per cent on Friday (May 1) following a tweet from Chief Executive Elon Musk's Twitter account that the electric car maker's recently high-flying stock is overly expensive.
The tweet was one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the US national anthem and that he would sell almost all his physical possessions, raising questions about whether Musk's account was compromised.
"Tesla stock price is too high," Musk's Twitter account tweeted. Reuters could not immediately verify whether Musk sent the tweet.
Tesla and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether Musk's account had been hacked.
A year ago, Musk settled a dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter, agreeing to submit his public statements about Tesla's finances and other topics to vetting by the company's legal counsel.
Tesla's stock has surged in recent weeks, but is down since Wednesday when the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Including Friday's drop, the shares remain up over 40 per cent from May 1, 2019.
Musk's latest tweets follow others by the billionaire this week, as well as comments on Tesla's quarterly conference call on Wednesday, criticizing the California government's stay-at-home orders, which have forced him to shut Tesla's plant in Fremont, California.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Mescal said it has been "a very bizarre 72 hours" for him since Normal People hit screens.
The Kildare man, who plays Connell in TV series, is living on his own in London during the Covid-19 crisis.
"You put your phone down for five minutes and it's two hours worth of work trying to reply to people," he told the Late Late Show on Friday night.
"It's been amazing, there's lots of messages of love and support. It's just been a bit mad.
"People from home in Maynooth have reached out and said that they love it and that it's portraying young people in a society that they recognise. If I could have asked for that at the start of shooting, I'd definitely have taken it."
The series is being broadcast by RTÉ in Ireland, BBC Three in the UK and Hulu in the US. Following its RTÉ premiere on Tuesday, RTÉ Radio One's Liveline received a number of calls criticising the show's sex scenes involving Connell and Marianne, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones. One caller said it was like "something you'd see in a porno movie".
"I listened in yesterday and I was a bit surprised," said Mescal.
The 24-year-old, who played minor and U21 football for Kildare, added that he has watched the series with his family.
"I kind of ripped the plaster off with my family," he said.
"Once I got the episodes, I was like, 'Right, lads, we're sitting down and we're getting through this, we're getting past the embarrassing phase of it'. My dad has chosen not to binge at all and he is going to watch it again two episodes by two episodes."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moneycontrol Pro weekender | Apocalypse Postponed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dear Reader,
The markets seem desperate to rebound. April was truly the cruellest month, but only for the shorts. By month-end, the Street was littered with the corpses of bears ripped apart by the rally.
Several reasons are being cited for the resurgence of the bulls. The most obvious one is that the sky isn’t falling after all and thanks to central banks and governments rushing to the rescue, the Apocalypse has been dodged. Whether it has been dodged or kicked down the road is a debate for another day, but the markets seem to have decided that the fast and furious government and central bank bailouts and programmes will do the trick. Another reason for optimism is the ‘flattening of the curve’ in Europe and the US. A third is the lifting of the lockdowns. And the baking powder for this cake, the one that made it rise last week, was the endorsement of antiviral agent Remdesivir by US anti-covid czar Anthony Fauci.
The data on the economy continues to be uniformly putrid. US GDP for the first quarter shrank by 4.8 percent and the unemployed there are now 30 million strong. China’s economy contracted by 6.8 percent in the first quarter compared to a year ago. The International Labour Organisation says globally 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy are in danger of losing their livelihoods. The US Fed put it pithily: ‘The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term…’. And just in case we wanted to ignore the near-term, as the markets seem intent on doing, the Fed added that the crisis also ‘poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.’
Perhaps the disjuncture between the financials of companies and the markets is best illustrated by aircraft manufacturer Boeing, one of the worst affected by the pandemic. S&P Global Ratings has lowered its rating on the company’s debt to BBB-, the lowest investment grade and reports say it could even be downgraded to junk. But the company managed to raise a monster $25 billion in a bond sale and reports say it received bids worth $50 billion.
Back home, the Reserve Bank of India finally came to the rescue of the debt funds, but there are plenty of questions whether its strategy of getting the banks to lend would prove successful, especially as banks have turned not just risk-averse, but risk-phobic. The problem, after all, is not just of liquidity, but of solvency. This is clearly going to be a major issue, which is why attempts are being made to push the bankruptcy law into cold storage. It is the reason why Axis Bank has prudently made large provisions for possible bad loans.
India Inc’s profits are going to take some very hard knocks. A report by rating agency ICRA says several AAA-rated companies have also sought payment relief from lenders. Clearly, the time for a bailout is now. The question is: what on earth could be holding the Godotment Government back? We have been hearing about a bailout package for small scale industries for weeks now---an extraordinarily special package must be in the making, because if it wanted a run-of-the-mill one all it had to do was emulate the countries that have already announced such programmes.
Everybody is waiting for the much talked about staggered lifting of the lockdown, which has taken a severe toll on the weaker sections of the population. The plan is to colour code districts into green, orange and red zones and open up the green zones forthwith. It’s a better idea than opening up entire states, as is being done in the US. As one US public health official put it, reopening some states is ‘like having a peeing section in the swimming pool.’ He meant that if the virus recurs, it won’t stay where it started. Be that as it may, unfortunately in India, it is the red zones that account for the bulk of economic activity.
In spite of the strong rally, the market has not thrown all caution to the winds. The NSE realty index, for instance, is still down 44 percent in the last three months, the metals index is lower by 35 percent, the auto and bank indices by 32 percent each. The BSE Capital Goods index is down 33 percent. It is the Pharma, FMCG and IT sectors that have done relatively well.
But perhaps looking at sectors is the wrong thing to do. Instead, as Kenneth Andrade, our guest at MC Pro Masters Virtual Meet said, it may be best to pick out the most resilient companies in every sector. Our team of independent research analysts, for example, picked out this firm that can take advantage of the fact that glass-lined equipment forms around 10-12 percent of pharma capex. We compared firms in the insurance sector to find out which one investors should back. We took a look at a company that could be a potential beneficiary of a trend India is trying to take advantage of -- shifting the supply chain from China to our shores. And we also considered which equity funds came up trumps during the market mayhem.
Finally, a word about China, because it has more or less recovered from the virus and it is supposed to tell us how the recovery is going to be like. Well, China Beige Book International (CBB) said that by late April, 91 percent of Chinese companies re-opened shop, but over two-fifths of them were unable to operate at more than 50 percent capacity. The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for April came in at 49.4, compared to 50.1 in March. That indicates after massively shrinking in February, Chinese manufacturers were barely able to keep their heads above water in March and slipped back into contraction in April.
Commenting on the data, Zhengsheng Zhong, Chairman and Chief Economist at CEBM Group said, “To sum up, the sharp fall in export orders seriously hindered China’s economic recovery in April, although businesses were gradually getting back to work. Amid the second shockwave from the pandemic, the problems of low business confidence, shrinking employment and large inventories of industrial raw materials became more serious.” The lesson: Yes, there will be a bounce from the lows, but getting back to normal is going to take time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amy Love had to leave the Memphis hospital where she brings music to severely ill children - she and other support staff couldn’t take the risk of spreading COVID-19 to these frail patients.
But she was determined: The music must not stop.
So her house became a recording studio, and Love, fellow music therapist Celeste Douglas and intern Abigail Parrish became video stars for kids at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital who feed on their energy, their melodies, their love.
“Let’s get moving!” Love cries, as she sits cross-legged on a blanket in her backyard.
They play guitars and little drums, shakers and tambourines, and Love’s dog joins in on the fun - even as a lawn-mowing neighbor seems a bit puzzled.
“We’re really excited to be with you today, even if we can’t be there in person,” Douglas tells their early childhood group from afar.
No instruments? No problem. Love urges their viewers: “Just move around with us!”
The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.

    <h5 class="mb-1">10 Ways to Boost Your Emotional & Overall Energy Levels</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Have you ever underestimated the impact that your thoughts and feelings have on your overall energy levels? I bet if you went back through the last few weeks that you could draw a direct correlation to how easy or hard things were based on your overall emotional state. It always reinforces for us as leaders that if we don’t understand how we are feeling or deal with the “here and now” it results in a physical drain to our ability to be energized for our teams or deal with what is happening to us.
There are some weeks where our feelings will affect our energy levels negatively and a lot where we will benefit positively from things that inspire or humble us. When those moments of negative emotional energy creep in… there can be a tendency to dwell on them and spend more time replaying and overthinking them than finding ways to move forward.
For example… I’m not sure I have ever known anyone who couldn’t sleep at night thinking of all the things that inspired and energized them. Anyone who has ever lost sleep is usually churning through worry…anger…fear or regret.
The key is to pause…connect the dots…deal with the here and now…to feel it…and move on honestly (not fake it till you make it) because that contributes to taking longer to get your energy back…and our teams need us more than ever right now!
So what can we do about it? Here are a few suggestions to lift your spirits and to get your energy levels back. I know that none of these are “rocket science” but more of a reminder for all of us to get back to basics and to make time for things that can help us break the cycle we may be in.
Read a book that inspires or engages you. Here are few suggestions that are off the beaten path:
Find a way to laugh! Watch a funny movie, TV show, or comedy special
Pick a project around the house that will make you feel good when it is finally done
Play your favorite tunes…turn it up loud!
Pick a game you haven’t played in a while and establish a tournament
Start a blog, a vlog, a podcast or some other way to work through/share your thoughts to inspire yourself and others
Become a pen pal – reach out to check in on others
Create a family cookbook
Donate or champion a charitable effort – make a difference
Get a good night’s sleep…sleep in late once in a while
Lastly, I read an article on HBR.org a while ago by Scott Edinger titled “Three Elements of Great Communication, According to Aristotle” . How we communicate to each other effectively is not complicated and has withstood the test of time. Communication is at the core of so many things we do as leaders (verbal and non-verbal). It has the ability to inspire us (and lift our energy) or destroy us (and deplete our energy). How we communicate our changes, our initiatives, our philosophies matters. I want to be inspiring in my communication as well as authentic. It will not only affect the mood around us…but our own mood as well! How about YOU?
Leadership questions of the week for YOU:
Thanks for reading….and remember…YOU make a difference!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple’s $1.5 Billion Headwind Adds FX to Litany of Company Woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">U.S. multinational companies have begun to feel the sting of a strong dollar on their bottom lines, and there’s no guarantee the pain will go away as economies around the world attempt to reopen.
Dozens of corporations, from Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. to Harley- Davidson Inc., have warned the dollar’s appreciation is hurting foreign revenue. Even Netflix Inc., which benefited last quarter as much of the world was forced to stay at home, said overseas sales gains from rising subscriptions are being offset by a “sharply stronger” U.S. dollar.
Since the novel coronavirus began spreading in Asia early this year, broad measures of the dollar have surged to records as investors flocked to havens like the greenback and corporations hoarded cash. While the economic fallout poses more acute problems for companies, the headwinds from exchange rates could linger even as business rebounds.
“So let’s suppose we stabilize here or drop 1%,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal. “That still leaves U.S. firms facing a big headwind in their attempts to sell U.S.-produced goods overseas. Even if U.S.-based multinationals produce in-country rather than in the U.S., it still still hurts year-over-year earnings after you translate them back into U.S. dollars.”
That hypothetical drop in the trade-weighted dollar would price in improved “global disease dynamics” and a flight away from safety as governments take actions to restore investor confidence, Anderson said. While experts say a second wave of virus infections is inevitable as the world reopens for business, it’s likely to occur later on this year.
Why a Second Wave of Covid-19 Is Already a Worry: QuickTake
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of global currencies going back to 2005, rose 5.2% in the first quarter this year and ended it about 4.7% above its average level during the same period of 2019. Among the Group-of-10 currencies, the greenback has strengthened versus all but the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc this year.
Both the Bloomberg index and the Fed’s trade-weighted dollar index, which measures the currency versus 26 of America’s biggest trading partners, have inched slightly lower since peaking in March. Yet analysts expect dollar strength to linger, at least for the second quarter. With the deepest recession in generations likely unfolding, governments are introducing fiscal stimulus packages that may weaken their currencies further.
While the currency’s strength is just one of a myriad of stresses that businesses are dealing with, it’s still a material hit to sales for many. Exchange rates knocked 1% off of Apple’s $58.3 billion in sales in the latest quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the company’s earnings call. The headwind is expected to grow in the current quarter and reduce revenue by more than $1.5 billion at Apple, which on Thursday joined the growing ranks of companies refraining from providing sales and earnings guidance due to economic uncertainty.
Facebook put the quarterly hit to revenue at $275 million, while Harley-Davidson was dinged for almost $11 million.
“If it was any other quarter, besides during one amid this pandemic, what the dollar did would be a huge issue,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group Inc. in Minneapolis. “But now it’s just another residual problem on the list.”
Multinational companies also faced strong currency headwinds in early 2019 after a bout of greenback weakness in the prior year, but the dollar remained mostly range-bound last year so the effect was subsiding.
And while multinationals are often positioned to offset foreign currency volatility with hedges, the sudden strength in the dollar was as unpredictable as the extent of the virus. The widespread depreciation of foreign currencies has caught companies such as Merck & Co. off-guard.
“It’s hitting us across all of our currencies,” Robert Davis, Merck’s chief financial officer, said on an April 28 earnings call. “But importantly, what’s happening as well, and we’re not able to hedge as much as we normally would, is because we are also seeing a material impact in the emerging-market currencies, as well, where we don’t hedge today.”
Each 8% rise in the value of the dollar causes, on average, a 1% hit to corporations’ revenue, according to estimates from Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
“There was a decent strengthening of the dollar over the first quarter,” Golub said. “And it has and will be noticeable to earnings. But the real issue, for now, is that for some companies there is no business.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US and Iran are still perilously close to conflict</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A dangerous encounter between the Iranian and US navies in the Persian Gulf last month, provoked by 11 Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ speedboats, and President Trump’s threat one week later to shoot Iranian gunboats out of water if this happens again, are stark reminders of the short fuse between the two countries amid growing tensions. If they want conflict to wag the dog and deflect attention from their failures to fight the Covid-19 outbreak in their respective countries, they can easily stumble into one; but if they don’t, as they often claim, they should find a way to establish a military hotline.
Imagine that the Swiss embassy in Tehran had not communicated the end of Iran’s missile attacks on US military installations in Iraq after Tehran retaliated against the US killing of its senior commander, General Qassem Suleimani, in January, helping ensure a dangerous situation did not escalate further. Or that in 2016, when Iran’s Revolutionary Guards detained 10 US sailors travelling aboard two riverine boats drifted into Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, had no direct contacts with his Iranian counterpart, the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Within 30 minutes of learning of the incident, the two men spoke “at least five [times]… over a period of roughly 10 hours”. Iran released the boats and crew the following morning.
In the current climate of acrimonious exchanges between the two countries, competing claims that the other’s military is engaged in terrorist acts and little direct interaction between senior diplomats, as well as the US blacklisting of Zarif in 2019, Washington and Tehran need a military de-escalation channel to avoid inadvertent conflict in a moment of crisis.
Tensions emanating from the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran and Tehran’s “maximum resistance” response of escalating in the region and ramping up its nuclear programme, triggered by the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and the re-imposition of sanctions, nearly brought the two sides into full-fledged conflict three times in the past 11 months. The first was in the aftermath of Iran’s shooting down of a US drone in June 2019; then in September, when Iran stood accused of having attacked Saudi oil infrastructure; and again when the US killed General Suleimani in January, triggering retaliatory Iranian missile strikes in Iraq. The Covid-19 pandemic could have provided a window for a humanitarian ceasefire, but instead appears to have become an occasion for displaying a hardening of positions.
With neither side willing to yield, a dearth of effective communication channels, stalled diplomacy and a wide arc of regional flashpoints where the US, Iran and their respective allies are tensely poised, a single incident, even if minor, could quickly spin out of control.
While the Swiss channel proved effective for conveying high-level messages, it is designed for diplomatic, not military, communication and may not prevent an incident during a standoff between military ships from turning into a shoot-out. Twitter has provided an unusual means of direct communication and signalling between key officials on both sides. But it is hard to see such a public platform that encourages polemics and harsh rhetoric being effective in preventing inadvertent escalation.
While a US-Iran de-escalation mechanism can draw on past US experiences with military communications links with adversaries, including the Soviet Union, China, Russia and Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups, it will require some innovation. In the absence of a US-Iran Incidents at Sea agreement and diplomatic relations, as well as reciprocal designations of their militaries in the Gulf as foreign terrorist organisations, any hotline will have to go through an intermediary.
The ideal third-party candidate would combine deep expertise in Gulf navigation with experience in mediation and constructive diplomatic relations with both the US and Iran. Based on these considerations, Oman would be a particularly strong candidate. It manages security for shipping exiting the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman, and as a result has technical acumen and expertise in relaying communications. It has previously facilitated US-Iran communication. And both sides have typically considered it an honest broker. Oman has a military cooperation agreement with the US, and jointly operates a military commission with Iran.
In one possible design, a one-star general within US Central Command’s leadership would communicate by telephone with an Omani general maintaining a separate telephone line with a counterpart on the Iranian general staff.
Critics of such a mechanism may contend that, owing to high tensions and hostility between Tehran and Washington, establishing a line of contact for operational de-escalation is likely to encounter insurmountable political opposition, and that it may prove ineffectual even if established. But its potential to prevent a catastrophic miscalculation and inadvertent escalation outweighs its costs and risks, even if its remit is limited. Also being modest in scope and ambition, it would not require any significant departure from the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” approach, nor would it entail Iran endorsing a US military presence in the region, which it rejects as a matter of principle.
Overcoming obstacles facing any US-Iran channel, even a mediated one, will be difficult, especially given the wider diplomatic impasse and distrust between the two sides. But at this perilous moment, it would be important to try.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Axis Focused 25: Benchmark-beating returns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Registering a sharp fall in February and March due to Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant global economic slowdown, the domestic equity market recorded a multi-year low in late March. But since then it has been in a recovery mode.
There are signs of optimism in the global as well as thelocal market now.
Interestingly, all market-cap stocks appear to be participating in the current rally, unlike the late 2019 rally which was marked by divergence and mainly driven by large-cap stocks.
Investors looking to participate and diversify the portfolios can consider buying a quality multi-cap fund that has the flexibility to invest across the entire market capitalisation.
Axis Focused 25 is among the top performers in the multi-cap category. The fund has a good track-record. Since its launch in 2012, it has delivered annualised returns of 12.7 per cent.
Moreover, it has consistently outpaced the benchmark, Nifty 50 TRI, across all-time periods.
Over one-, three- and five-year periods, it has delivered a negative return of 8.83 per cent and positive annualised returns of 4.16 per cent and 8.23 per cent, respectively, while the benchmark returns for these time-frames are negative 19 per cent and positive returns of 1.63 per cent and 3.8 per cent.
Also, Axis Focused 25 has beaten some of its peer funds in the focussed category, such as L&T Focused Equity, DSP Focus and HDFC Focused 30, in their available track records. To mitigate market volatility, investors can take the SIP route, and those with a high risk appetite can invest lump sums as the market corrects.
 
 
As the name suggests, Axis Focused 25 invests in a concentrated portfolio of equity, to a maximum of 25 stocks across large-, mid- and small-cap spaces.
With a bottom-up investing strategy, the fund follows a high conviction investment approach in stock selection. It invests predominantly in the top 200 stocks by market capitalisation.
The fund has predominat exposure to large-cap stocks and moderately holds mid-cap stocks.
Notably, it had contained the downside well in the 2018 market correction by increasing debt allocation; similarly, the downside is limited in the current correction. It is also active in the debt segment and drastically increased its allocation recently.
Finance and banks are the top preferred sector choices — while the former witnessed a reduction in allocation over the past six months, the allocation to the latter is almost stable. There has been an increase in allocations to the software and retailing sectors. The fund recently added Infosys stock to the portfolio and upped its allocation to Avenue Supermarts that has delivered good returns over the past year.
Other recent additions are HDFC Life Insurance Company, Hindustan Unilever and SBI Cards.
On the other hand, it has slightly trimmed its exposure to Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv.
The fund had timely trimmed its exposure to automobiles and auto ancillary sectors in early 2019 as they faced challenges.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Weekly review: PSX posts smart gains</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI: A shorter trading week at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) ended on a high note as the benchmark index gained 1,305 points or 3.98% to settle at 34,112 points despite gloomy economic situation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Sentiment at the local bourse showed signs of improvement in the week as investors remained undeterred by the economic gloom caused by the pandemic, which was reflected in broadly weak corporate earnings.
The bullish trend in global oil prices and expectations of a lower inflation reading for April also fuelled optimism in the domestic equity market.
Global oil prices strengthened more than 49% in four days and crude futures traded between $11.88 and $17.80 per barrel. Traders expected oil prices to stabilise due to a reduction of 9.7 million barrels per day in output announced by OPEC+ members from May this year. The plunge in world oil demand is expected to take a breather in May after France, Spain, Germany and some US states announced an ease in lockdowns from the first week of May. Investors also became hopeful of a further hefty rate cut by the central bank, which drove the index higher.
The week kicked off on a negative note as the benchmark KSE-100 index fell where index-heavy oil stocks bore the brunt of tumbling crude prices. The development stopped investors from accumulating stocks with selling pressure weighing on sentiment.
Moreover, with the beginning of Ramazan, the stock market experienced lacklustre interest, which led to a slump in trading volumes.
However, the bearish spell did not last long and the market rebounded on hopes of a lower inflation reading. The uptrend continued for the remaining sessions with oil stocks gaining traction on the back of rising global prices. The last trading session of the week recorded a handsome rally as the index powered past the 34,000-mark with investors pinning hopes on easing of the lockdown and likely resumption of economic activities in the country.
With business activities suspended for over a month now to curtail the spread of Covid-19, the news acted as a much-needed positive trigger for the market and assisted the KSE-100 index in recording adequate gains.
On the other hand, progress on a vaccine trial against the coronavirus, reported by Gilead and Oxford University, lifted investment climate in global markets, which spilled over into the PSX.
In addition to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Rapid Financing Instrument worth $1.4 billion, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also announced $1.7 billion to help Pakistan deal with the pandemic, which helped jack up confidence in the market.
Meanwhile, the strengthening rupee and relative stability also contributed to the turnaround in investors’ confidence.
Participation slowed during the week, with average volumes dipping 32% to settle at 179 million shares while average traded value decreased 32% to $49 million. In terms of sectors, positive contribution came from oil and gas exploration companies (396 points), power generation and distribution firms (201 points), fertiliser producers (158 points), cement companies (126 points) and oil and gas marketing companies (78 points).
Meanwhile, stock-wise the positive contribution was led by Hubco (197 points), OGDC (144 points), Pakistan Petroleum (119 points), Pakistan Oilfields (92 points) and Fauji Fertiliser Company (79 points).
Foreign stock offloading during the week came in at $11.6 million compared to net selling of $2.5 million last week. Selling was witnessed in oil and gas exploration and production firms ($7.7 million), fertiliser producers and banks ($1.5 million each).
On the domestic front, mutual funds accumulated stocks worth $4.2 million while companies bought $3.6 million worth of stocks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How natural gas is withstanding the energy market collapse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Natural gas is withstanding the coronavirus-fueled economic crash in a way that its closely associated relative, oil, isn’t.
Oil prices have reached record lows, with the U.S. benchmark oil price briefly dropping below zero last month after trading at around $60 per barrel at the start of 2020.
The U.S. natural gas price, meanwhile, is stable, staying below $2 per million British thermal units, or MMBtu, a historically low level it has been hovering at for a while due to a glut produced from the shale boom.
Oil producers are shutting in their wells, prompting tens of thousands of layoffs, because the pace of the price collapse was so sudden, caused mostly by the fact that the pandemic has crushed demand for transportation fuels made with oil, as people forgo driving and flying.
“The negative impact on demand in gas markets is not as significant as it is with oil because it’s not being driven by transportation,” said Dustin Meyer, director of market development at the American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil and gas lobbying group.
U.S. natural gas production, by contrast, has remained steady as people stuck at home depend on it for power and heat. Because it’s been so cheap for so long, natural gas in recent years passed coal as the most used fuel for electricity, at 38% of the mix in 2019.
While some important uses for gas are falling, without the need to power or heat large office spaces and some nonessential manufacturing facilities, demand has picked up in other places, such as in feedstock for plastics used to make key health equipment.
“Instead of seeing a very low price market or negative pricing like we did with oil, you are seeing something that looks like price stability or even resilience with natural gas because its primary end use in this country hasn't changed all that much,” said Kevin Book, managing director of the research group ClearView Energy. “Most of America doesn't understand how much of its electric power comes from natural gas, and the masks, gloves, and gowns they are so focused on are also coming from natural gas.”
Natural gas still faces some near-term and long-term challenges.
U.S. natural gas demand is falling, just not as severely as oil. It dropped 4.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019, the International Energy Agency projected this week. While people are using more power at home, that can’t compensate for shutting down larger commercial centers.
“I don't care how many times you run the microwave each day,” Book said.
Globally, natural gas demand could decrease by 5% in 2020, the IEA said, which would be the first drop in annual consumption since 2009.
Natural gas use in the United States was already down before the pandemic because of a mild winter that meant less heating of homes and businesses.
U.S. gas production is also beginning to decline, dropping 0.3 billion cubic feet per day in the final 10 days of last month compared with April 1-20, according to S&P Global. Most U.S. natural gas is considered “dry,” meaning it’s produced alone without oil in places such as the Marcellus Formation in Pennsylvania. A smaller amount of natural gas is produced as a byproduct of oil drilling. That so-called “associated” gas production tied to oil is expected to fall as producers shut down oil wells in the Permian Basin straddling West Texas and New Mexico.
“We are expecting to see a significant decline in associated gas production because of what is happening in oil pricing,” said Erin Blanton, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy focused on natural gas.
Another key metric for the health of natural gas is demand for LNG, the chilled, liquid form to which gas must be converted for shipment in giant tanker vessels across the sea. The U.S. has become a top exporter of LNG, a significant development touted by the Trump administration after the U.S. was expected to become a big importer of gas before the shale boom. But that momentum could be threatened by the coronavirus since large consumer markets such as Western Europe and East Asia are also suffering economic slowdowns.
The research group IHS Markit expects global LNG demand to fall 3.8% in 2020 relative to its pre-pandemic outlook after LNG consumption has grown every year since 2012. Cheniere Energy, the biggest U.S. LNG exporter, has seen customers cancel cargoes.
But IHS Markit said it expects LNG demand to show “impressive resilience” given the circumstances. Prices in Europe and Asia also collapsed to record levels during the mild winter.
Those low prices could enable Asian countries such as South Korea and China that have been slower to break from coal to make the switch to cleaner-burning natural gas, said Meyer of API.
“Coming out of this pandemic, it will give a lot of countries for the first time the opportunity to look at natural gas as a viable component of their longer-term energy future,” Meyer said.
Natural gas consumption in electricity should pick up relatively quickly once offices and stores open, whereas transportation demand could still lag since people will only drive and fly when they are comfortable doing so.
“Electricity demand is clearly going to come back more strongly than transportation demand,” said Paul Bledsoe, an adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute who was a climate adviser under former President Bill Clinton. “So, the outlook for gas is much better than for oil in the near term.”
Looking farther out, natural gas prices could rise as production falls in oil basins, with the U.S. gas futures trading at more than $3 per MMBtu for January 2021.
If prices even rise slightly, that could be good for sources of renewable energy, whose prices are falling and increasingly competitive with gas. Renewable electricity generation will increase by 5% globally in 2020, the only energy source that will grow this year, the IEA projected.
“At some point, gas prices will increase,” said Dennis Wamstead with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. "When that happens, we don't turn back to coal. We move more quickly toward renewables.”
Analysts, however, expect there to be a “ceiling” for gas prices with such a glut of supply, meaning it should be able to maintain its position.
“It seems very unlikely that gas’s trajectory in the power sector is going to change significantly once the pandemic passes,” Meyer said. “The value proposition of natural gas is so persistent not just in the U.S., but around the world.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">This 16-core beast is the most powerful notebook in the world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At least on paper...
The AMD Ryzen 9 3950X is an absolute monster when it comes to sheer computing power; its 16 cores and 32 threads will power through any task you throw at it - with aplomb.
With a base clock of 3.5GHz and a staggering 73MB cache, it’s almost a miracle this CPU has a TDP (power dissipation) of 105W. It's certainly a tantalizing prospect for professionals on the hunt for a desktop alternative.
German notebook vendor Schenker has integrated this beast of a CPU into its latest XMG APEX 15 notebook, which is available for €1,958 from Bestware (around $2,130/£1,700/AU$3,300).
Unfortunately, Bestware does not deliver globally, so non-EU customers may have to use a specialist parcel forwarding service if they want to take advantage of the deal. 
The Clevo-source chassis comes with a 144Hz full HD IPS display, an Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060 with 6GB GDDR6, 8GB Kingston memory, a 250GB Kingston A2000 SSD, Bluetooth 5.0 and two-year warranty - but no operating system.
105W is quite a lot of power to dissipate, so the 3950X runs in an eco mode that drops the base speed - via the Ryzen Master software (and possibly in the BIOS) - to about three quarters of its capacity, while consuming 44 percent less power.
Have you managed to get hold of a cheaper product with equivalent specifications, in stock and brand new? Let us know and we'll tip our hat to you. 
This brings up another interesting question: would it be better to buy a cheaper 12 or 8-core CPU instead that comes with a 65W TDP by default?
In any case, the XMG APEX 15 is quite the specimen - and we encourage you to check it out for yourself.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Friday’s Market Drop Wipes $26 Billion From Fortunes Of Jeff Bezos And 9 Other Billionaires</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After the best month for stocks since 1987, markets abruptly sank on Friday as companies revealed dwindling profits squeezed by the coronavirus, and as U.S.-China trade tensions ramped up again. In a stark reminder of the pandemic's power to shift markets, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each ended the day down 3%, with declines hitting some of the world's richest tycoons especially hard. Ten billionaires’ fortunes plummeted a staggering $26 billion on Friday alone, an unraveling of their prior month’s gains.
Following days of positive quarterly earnings reports and lofty stock gains for the billionaires behind Google, Microsoft MSFT and Facebook, Amazon AMZN was among the first to turn the tide late Thursday. Shortly after closing at a record high, Amazon reported earnings that missed Wall Street estimates — despite record first-quarter revenues of $75.5 billion. Amazon's outlook also put Wall Street on edge after disclosing plans to spend an estimated $4 billion on Covid-19 related efforts, including on protective gear for employees and higher wages for hourly teams. “If you're a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we're not thinking small,” Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in the earnings announcement. "Providing for customers and protecting employees as this crisis continues for more months is going to take skill, humility, invention, and money."
Amazon shares sank 8% as a result on Friday, tanking its founder’s fortune. Bezos’ net worth fell $10.6 billion, erasing two weeks of gains from rising Amazon stock, which hit record highs amid surging consumer demand as a result of the pandemic. The firm’s second-quarter earnings forecast now includes the possibility of a net loss; the firm hasn't had a quarterly loss since 2015.
Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, was also hit. Her fortune fell $3.7 billion on Friday, the day's second-largest drop among billionaires. She's now worth $44.8 billion.
Tesla cofounder Elon Musk’s pain appears to be more self-inflicted. The tech visionary wiped $2.8 billion off his own fortune after a single midday tweet in which he declared, "Tesla stock price is too high imo." Shares of the electric carmaker plunged within minutes, ending the day down 10% and reversing more than a week's worth of gains that coincided with a Wednesday earnings report that surpassed analyst expectations. Musk, meanwhile, continued with a tweet storm, leading some to question his mental wellbeing. 
Outside of technology, noted investor Warren Buffett's net worth fell $2 billion on Friday, the fourth-largest drop of the day; his fortune is almost exclusively tied up in shares of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B , which performed in line with the broader market on Friday, falling 3%. Unlike the technology firms of his superrich peers, whose stocks were back near pre-coronavirus levels, shares of Berkshire Hathaway have languished during the pandemic as portfolio companies See's Candies and aerospace metals manufacturer Precision Castparts furloughed workers, shuttered retail outlets and halted operations; Berkshire shares are still down more than 20% from late-February highs.
The fifth-biggest loser on Friday was Oracle ORCL founder and chairman Larry Ellison, whose fortune fell $1.5 billion due to a drop in Oracle shares. Ellison's now worth $65.1 billion; before Friday, he had nearly gained back all his coronavirus losses.

    <h5 class="mb-1">President queries Tanzania coronavirus kits after goat test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Coronavirus test kits used in Tanzania were dismissed as faulty by President John Magufuli on Sunday, because he said they had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw.
Magufuli, whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away, said the kits had “technical errors”.
The COVID-19 testing kits had been imported from abroad, Magufuli said during an event in Chato in the north west of Tanzania, although he did not give further details.
The president said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits. They had randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages.
These samples were then submitted to Tanzania’s laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins.
Samples from the pawpaw and the goat tested positive for COVID-19, the president said, adding this meant it was likely that some people were being tested positive when in fact they were not infected by the coronavirus.
“There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation,” Magufuli said, adding the kits should be investigated.
As of Sunday, Tanzania had recorded 480 cases of COVID-19 and 17 deaths but unlike most other African countries, Dar es Salaam sometimes goes for days without offering updates, with the last bulletin on cases on Wednesday.
Magufuli also said that he was sending a plane to collect a cure being promoted by Madagascar’s president. The herbal mix has not yet undergone internationally recognised scientific testing.
“I’m communicating with Madagascar,” he said during a speech, adding: “They have got a medicine. We will send a flight there and the medicine will be brought in the country so that Tanzanians too can benefit.”
COVID-19 infections and fatalities reported across Africa have been relatively low compared with the United States, parts of Asia and Europe. But Africa also has extremely low levels of testing, with rates of only around 500 per million people.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian bank bad debt could double in coronavirus crisis -sources</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI/NEW DELHI — India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.
Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
“There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default,” the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
“These are unprecedented times and the way it’s going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we’ve seen in earlier quarters,” the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorized to discuss the matter with media.
India’s finance ministry declined to comment, while the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Banks’ Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
‘RIDING THE TIGER’
Bankers fear it is unlikely that the economy will fully open up before June or July, and loans, especially those to small- and medium-sized businesses which constitute nearly 20% of overall credit, may be among the worst affected.
This is because all 10 of India’s largest cities fall in high-risk red zones, where restrictions will remain stringent.
A report by Axis Bank said that these red zones, which contribute significantly to India’s economy, account for roughly 83% of the overall loans made by its banks as of December.
One of the sources, an executive director of a public sector bank, said that economic growth had been sluggish and risks had been heightened, even ahead of the coronavirus crisis.
“Now we have this Black Swan event which means without any meaningful government stimulus, the economy will be in tatters for several more quarters,” he said.
McKinsey & Co last month forecast India’s economy could contract by around 20% in the three months through June, if the lockdown was extended to mid-May, and growth in the fiscal year was likely to fall 2% to 3%.
Bankers say the only way to stem the steep rise in bad loans is if the RBI significantly relaxes bad asset recognition rules.
Banks have asked the central bank to allow all loans to be categorized as NPAs only after 180 days, which is double the current 90-day window.
“The lockdown is like riding the tiger, once we get off it we’ll be in a difficult position,” a senior private sector banker told Reuters. (Reporting by Nupur Anand and Manoj Kumar; additional reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alexander Smith)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Run on toilets leaves Japanese lavatory makers flush with orders</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak triggered twin bouts of panic buying in Japan — of toilet paper and of the toilets themselves as building wholesalers competed to secure the precious commodity.
The rapid rise in demand for lavatories and an accompanying sudden nationwide shortage of them from mid-March was the result of market participants attempting to “game” the system ahead of rivals as Chinese factories closed and supply chains dried up. 
The panic buying was prompted by a fear among housebuilders that they would be unable to declare any new property liveable without a secure supply of the vital equipment, said manufacturers.
At its peak, said Kinya Seto, the chief executive of the bathroom and building equipment maker Lixil, some wholesalers were placing orders for 10 times more product than they actually required — a tactic that spurred rivals to respond with even larger orders.
“When people began to realise that there might be a shortage, many of the customers began to order. Where they needed 100 toilets, next time they asked for 400,” Mr Seto said in an interview. “Whether it’s toilet paper or masks, it’s the same thing. People began to make bigger orders.” 
March is usually the busiest season for toilet demand in Japan with people moving houses ahead of the start of the new financial and school year. About 80 per cent of Japanese households use high-end “smart toilets” with auto-warming seats and bidet sprays, a market that generated about $790m in domestic sales in 2019, according to government data.
But this year, demand spiked as Toto, Japan’s biggest toilet maker with seven plants across China, became the first to flag potential shipment delays in mid-February, prompting some wholesalers to place large orders to secure the remaining inventory.
Global interest in Japan’s smart toilets, which have long struggled to catch on in western markets, has also increased in the coronavirus era as people seek higher standards of sanitation and hygiene.

With the shutdown of its plants, some Toto customers turned to Lixil, which was able to partially offset the disruptions in China with plants in other parts of Asia and existing inventory. Lixil boosted its manufacturing capacity by 10 to 20 per cent but it too stopped taking new orders in February till late March as production failed to meet demand. 
Toto said demand for its toilets had been particularly strong from before the outbreak due to a new product launch and it was unable to determine whether there were specific coronavirus-related new orders.
Mr Seto acknowledged the coronavirus surge was a temporary phenomenon. “Once Toto comes back, all of that demand will evaporate. That’s where many manufacturers make a mistake. People tend to anticipate it’s going to last forever but it’s not going to,” he said.
Toto has already resumed production in China but capacity has not fully recovered due to declining demand.
Last week, the company reported an 82 per cent collapse in profits for the January to March quarter. Meanwhile, Lixil delayed its earnings release as it reported a 30 per cent year-on-year decline in product shipments on average for its international housing and water businesses in April.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RIO DE JANEIRO (Sputnik) - Hundreds of Brazilians rallied in the capital's administrative district on Sunday in support of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
The march began on Sunday morning with a large column of cars blocking traffic, according to the footage shared by the O Globo news channel.
The pro-business president has been under fire from his own ministers and medical experts for resisting restrictions on public life aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
In a further blow, Moro, who resigned in April, testified to federal police on Saturday that Bolsonaro had interfered in judicial matters.
Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the virus as a "flu" and has continued to meet with the public after a trip to the United States in March, which saw 20 members of his delegation fall ill with COVID-19. He may face impeachment for breaking self-isolation rules if he tests positive.
Rio de Janeiro Governor Wilson Witzel criticized the Sunday pro- Bolsonaro march, saying on Twitter that the president was giving a bad example by participating in a demonstration at the time when local authorities were calling for self-isolation amid the spread of the coronavirus.
Bolsonaro has been calling for limited isolation only, for high-risk groups of people, such as seniors, but regional authorities have followed the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) subjecting all Brazilian residents to coronavirus restrictions.

The first delivery of COVID-19 patient here was on April 21 when a 30-year-old woman who conceived through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) was referred here from a private hospital.
The team of doctors led by Dr Parul Shah, head of the department Obstetrics and Gynaecology, who conducted the delivery said that the Caesarean section was planned in a private hospital but was referred to SVP Hospital after the woman developed some complications. “The baby is doing fine and has been shifted from the intensive care unit of the neonatal ward,” Dr Shah said adding the newborn weighs 2.4 kg. His swab sample has been taken for test, the doctor added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Advocates demand full benefits for city workers killed by coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Advocates for essential city workers are demanding the municipal employees killed by the coronavirus receive full, line-of-duty death benefits — even if it’s unclear whether they contracted the contagion on the clock or on their own.
With at least 245 city workers dead from the global pandemic so far, union leaders and elected officials are teaming up to demand that cops, firefighters and others who put themselves on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19 be treated as “line of duty” casualties.
Among those leading the charge has been City Councilman Joe Borelli of Staten Island, who is calling on Mayor Bill de Blasio to extend death benefits to the families of city workers who die of coronavirus until the state can hammer out a longer-term solution.
“Health officials made a determination that this disease was so deadly that the general public must stay home and yet we still asked certain essential workers to show up every day,” Borelli told Politico. “If they had to go to work in a dangerous situation, then they contracted it in the course of their duty.”
As of last week, 68 city Department of Education employees, 38 healthcare workers, 37 police officers, 27 social service workers, and 10 firefighters numbered among the city’s coronavirus casualties — in some cases leaving their families scrambling for economic survival.
In addition, the departments of correction and mental health have both lost 10 employees, while the Administration for Children’s Services has bid farewell to seven, city officials said.
The deaths have been particularly difficult for cops and firefighters who passed from the virus short of the 20-year threshold to qualify for a full state pension.
Under current law, the family of a police officer who dies short of 20 years of service is entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to three times the cop’s annual salary. That’s short of the line-of-duty benefit that provides survivors with continued health benefits and an annual percentage of the officer’s salary.
Politico highlighted the case of one NYPD cop killed by the coronavirus one year shy of retirement from the force.
Det. Raymond Abear, who planned on buying a waterfront home in Florida for his wife and two young children, died at age 43 last month, the outlet said.
Abear’s death left his 37-year-old wife, Catherine — a stay-at-home mom — with no income or health insurance.
“We made the decision together that he would work and support our family financially and I would stay home and raise our children,” Catherine Abear told Politico. “Right now I’m in a position where I have to immediately figure out both of those roles.”
Union officials worry that pension boards will not classify deaths like Abear’s as “line of duty” deaths, which would mean families receive far fewer benefits.
PBA President Pat Lynch likened the struggle to the lengthy fight for benefits for workers who lost their lives at Ground Zero in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks.
“We just finished an 18-year fight to secure treatment and benefits for all of our 9/11 heroes,” Lynch said. “Our elected leaders absolutely cannot put the heroes of this pandemic through the same ordeal. Police officers could not protect our health by sheltering in place.”
“We had to be out on the streets in every part of the city, interacting with both healthy New Yorkers and sick ones, without adequate protective equipment,” he said. “Those who were made ill by their service to the city — especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice — need to be guaranteed full line of duty benefits.”
In a statement Sunday, de Blasio said the burden of picking up the additional tab should fall on Washington.
“The President left New Yorkers without the tools we needed to protect ourselves; the least he can do now is support families who have suffered unspeakable loss,” the mayor said. “The federal government should provide death benefits to those eligible.”

President Magufuli later disclosed that samples from the pawpaw and the goat tested positive for COVID-19, adding it was likely that some people were being tested positive when in fact they were not infected by the Coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tanzania president questions coronavirus kits after animal test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tanzania's President John Magufuli has dismissed imported coronavirus testing kits as faulty, saying they returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw.
Magufuli made the remarks during an event in Chato in northwestern Tanzania on Sunday. He said there were "technical errors" with the tests.
The president, whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away, said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits.
They had randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages.
These samples were then submitted to Tanzania's laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins.
Samples from the pawpaw and the goat tested positive for COVID-19, the president said, adding this meant it was likely that some people were being tested positive when, in fact, they were not infected by the coronavirus.
"There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation," Magufuli said, adding the kits should be investigated. 
On Saturday, Magufuli announced that he had placed an order for a herbal treatment for the coronavirus touted by the president of Madagascar.
"I have already written to Madagascar's president and we will soon dispatch a plane to fetch the medicine so that Tanzania can also benefit from it," he said.
The herbal remedy, called "Covid Organics" and prepared by the Malagasy Institute for Applied Research, is made out of Artemisia, a plant cultivated on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar.
Despite a lack of scientific evidence, President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar claimed that the remedy has already cured some Madagascans of COVID-19. Children returning to school have been required to take it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share on FacebookShare on Twitter
The Private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 has commenced the distribution of 5,000 loaves of bread per day for the next 14 days to individuals and families in different locations in Lagos State.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the distribution started at Tinubu Square in Lagos Island and at New Market, Eti-Osa.
Bisola Dejonwo-Tokan, Chief Executive Officer, Bakehoux Limited, on Sunday in Lagos said the distribution was part of the CACOVID initiative to provide food support to vulnerable people in th, e society.
According to Dejonwo-Tokan, the distribution, which will be done in the morning and evening of each day at different locations, will alleviate the effect of the lockdown on people.
She said: “The COVID-19 pandemic is a major threat to humanity and demands that all hands must be on deck to reduce the impact on the people, most especially the vulnerable ones in our society.”
Dejonwo-Tokan said the bread distribution was a complementary effort, asides other intervention of the coalition in the health sector.
Also, Kamal Salau-Bashua, Chairman, Lagos Island East Local Council Development Area, lauded CACOVID for the initiative.
Salau-Bashua said there was a nexus between the well-being of the society and business success.
The chairman urged more corporate organisations to support CACOVID in its efforts to assist the government contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Janet Abenuma, a beneficiary, expressed appreciation to the coalition, saying the bread would help feed her family for the day.
Mohammed Tijani, another beneficiary, also appreciated the coalition for the bread, which he said would be used to break his fast in the evening.
NAN reports that volunteers from FirstBank Plc and Dangote Limited were present to support with the distribution and crowd control.
CACOVID is a Private Sector Task Force in partnership with the Federal Government, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and World Health Organisation with the aim of combating COVID-19 in Nigeria.
The coalition was tasked with pulling resources across industries to provide technical and operational support, while providing funding and building advocacy through aggressive awareness campaign.
CACOVID is providing and equipping medical facilities in the six geopolitical zones of  Nigeria, and assisting government with the creation of testing, isolation and treatment centres, and medical equipment.
Some members of the group include the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele; Aliko Dangote; Herbert Wigwe; Jim Ovia; Tony Elumelu; Segun Agbaje; Abdulsamad Rabiu; and Femi Otedola.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian bank bad debt could double after coronavirus crisis: sources</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI/NEW DELHI:  India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.
Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
"There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default," the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
"These are unprecedented times and the way it's going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we've seen in earlier quarters," the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorized to discuss the matter with media.
India's finance ministry declined to comment, while the RBI and Indian Banks' Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virus impact puts thousands of jobs risk at Rolls-Royce</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thousands of jobs could be at risk at British aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which on Sunday said it was in talks with unions about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on operations.
As many as 8,000 jobs could be affected, according to one person familiar with the matter, as the firm grappled with what it said was the "unprecedented" fall-out from the global pandemic.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reducing our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times," a spokesman said.
"But we will need to take further action," he added.
The company, which has 50,000 staff in 50 countries, including some 24,000 in the UK, is working with employee and union representatives.
Further details on job losses would be given to staff before the end of the month, the spokesman said.
The global aviation industry has been badly affected by the outbreak, forcing flights to be cancelled because of lack of demand and restrictions on travel.
According to the International Air Transport Association trade body, air traffic dropped by more than half in March compared with the same period last year.
US aerospace giant Boeing has said it expected to make thousands of job cuts because of the fall in traffic volume, with demand dropping to levels not seen since 2006.
Traffic had previously dropped 10.3 percent year-on-year in February.
Europe's Airbus last week reported a net first-quarter loss of 481 million euros ($522 million), compared to a profit of 40 million euros in the same period last year.
Airbus said in early April it had cut aircraft production by around a third as global airlines scaled back their plans because of the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">President questions Tanzania coronavirus kits after goat test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Coronavirus test kits used in Tanzania were dismissed as faulty by President John Magufuli on Sunday, because he said they had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw.
Magufuli, whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away, said the kits had "technical errors".
The COVID-19 testing kits had been imported from abroad, Magufuli said during an event in Chato in the north west of Tanzania, although he did not give further details.
The president said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits. They had randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages.
These samples were then submitted to Tanzania's laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins.

"There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation," Magufuli said, adding the kits should be investigated.
As of Sunday, Tanzania had recorded 480 cases of COVID-19 and 17 deaths but unlike most other African countries, Dar es Salaam sometimes goes for days without offering updates, with the last bulletin on cases on Wednesday.
COVID-19 infections and fatalities reported across Africa have been relatively low compared with the United States, parts of Asia and Europe. But Africa also has extremely low levels of testing, with rates of only around 500 per million people.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: World Rugby admits difficulties over planning restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The summer tour season in July looks set to be wiped out and the Scottish Rugby Union recently admitted there was "developing uncertainty" over the fate of their November Test schedule at BT Murrayfield.
The Guinness Six Nations is unfinished while the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship is due to take place in August and September, but the fate of domestic leagues and European competitions is also uncertain.
Beaumont pledged to get straight to work on dealing with the coronavirus crisis after being re-elected for a second four-year term but he added: "We don't know when we are going to come out of it. Some countries are coming out of it quicker than others.
"We still have to plan the international games, the domestic games, and already you can see there is difference of opinions from country to country whereby last week the French government said there would be no sport played at all until September 1, and in the UK there is still a desire to get some club games started before then.
"So you can imagine what that is like for us when we are trying to put international matches together.
"Everything at the moment is scenario planning: what if, what if, what if.
"You don't know if there's going to be any inter-hemisphere travel at all this year. You don't know whether you can start behind closed doors, we don't know when that will be. That will vary from country to country.
"It's extremely difficult to put a marker down and say we will start now and conclude competitions."
As Beaumont alluded, the UK Government has held talks with sporting bodies such as the Premier League in a bid to get sport back up and running as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. A best-case scenario date of June 8 is understood to have been earmarked for England's top-flight football to return at neutral venues.
Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for football's swift return if deemed appropriate, arguing it would boost the nation's finances and mental health, plus help define new ways of working for other industries.
Parish wrote in the Sunday Times: "I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments.
"Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless – but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Europe prepares for more lockdown easing as virus hopes rise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Europe on Sunday prepared for a further cautious easing of coronavirus restrictions following signs the pandemic may be slowing, after Spaniards flocked to the streets to jog, cycle and rollerskate for the first time after 48 days of confinement.
More than 242,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
With signs that the spread of the contagion has been brought under control, parts of Europe and the United States have begun to lift restrictions to try to inject life into economies crippled by weeks of closures and ease the pressure from populations wearying of captivity.
After a two-month lockdown in Italy -- with the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world -- people on Monday will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaway and wholesale stores can resume business.
And in Hungary, some stores and museums, outdoor spaces of restaurants and hotels, beaches and baths can reopen from Monday -- but restrictions will remain in the capital Budapest, which has recorded about 70 percent of the country's cases.
Germany will also continue its easing at the start of the week, with schools in some areas expected to reopen, while Slovenia and Poland will allow some businesses and public spaces to operate again.
France has said it will partially lift its lockdown on May 11.
But with health experts warning the disease could hit hard once again, they are sticking to social distancing measures, the use of masks and more testing to try to track infections.
"We must maintain social distancing, maximum hygiene levels, and masks. We've done our bit to the best of our ability. From Monday, it's up to you," Italian emergency response official Domenico Arcuri said.
Despite the lingering concerns, there was joy and relief in Spain on Saturday, where people were allowed to exercise and walk freely after the government eased seven weeks of strict lockdown in a country with one of the highest number of deaths at more than 25,000.
"After so many weeks in confinement I badly wanted to go out, run, see the world," said financial advisor Marcos Abeytua in Madrid. "Yesterday I was like a child on Christmas Eve."
'Beyond breaking point'
Across the Atlantic, the pressure to ease virus measures is intense on leaders in the United States, where the economy has been hammered with tens of millions left jobless and anti-lockdown protests erupting in many areas.
Crowds of demonstrators, some armed, denounced the lockdowns in New Hampshire and Kentucky, while at California's Huntington Beach, some surfers defied orders to stay away from the shore.
"Surfing is essential business around here, dude!" 25-year-old Todd told AFP.
The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world and President Donald Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain.
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett was optimistic, saying Saturday he's confident the American economy will bounce back because "American magic has always prevailed" -- though it is far from certain if that recovery will come in time to help Trump win reelection in November.
There are signs that the pandemic is slowing down in some parts of the United States.
In New York City, the epicenter of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close, the Christian charity running it said Saturday, as virus cases decline in the city.
But authorities are wary of letting their guard down too fast, with fears the virus could wreak havoc in the most vulnerable communities in the United States.
A massive wave of infections is sweeping through America's prison population -- the world's largest at 2.3 million -- with coronavirus deaths on the rise in jails and penitentiaries across the country.
Riots over inadequate protection and slow responses by authorities have already taken place in prisons in Washington state and Kansas.
"Things are beyond breaking point at this facility," said Brian Miller, an officer at the Marion prison in Ohio. "Right now it's hell."
Emotional toll
In addition to Europe, countries elsewhere are also relaxing some coronavirus measures.
Singapore has announced it would gradually ease some of its restrictions, while Turkey on Saturday said it would lift curbs on the export of medical supplies.
Thailand allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen Sunday so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.
But experts have warned that some countries are still in the first stages of their outbreaks and things could get worse there.
In a sign of the pandemic's emotional toll, families of coronavirus victims in the Philippines are being denied traditional death rites in favor of hurried, impersonal cremations, with virus restrictions often meaning they cannot take a last look at their loved ones.
Leandro Resurreccion IV, 26, was not allowed to visit his father as he was dying from the virus in hospital, and never saw his corpse -- just the plastic he was wrapped in.
"The fact that... my family wasn't able to say goodbye could probably be the second most tragic thing that happened after my dad's death," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Europe prepares for more lockdown easing as Spain records lowest daily death toll in seven weeks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EUROPE IS PREPARING for a further cautious easing of coronavirus restrictions following signs the pandemic may be slowing, with hard-hit Italy set to follow Spain in allowing people outside.
More than 243,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the great depression.
With signs that the spread of the contagion has been brought under control, parts of Europe, Asia and the United States have begun to lift restrictions to try to inject life into economies crippled by weeks of closures and ease the pressure from populations wearying of confinement.
After a two-month lockdown in Italy – with the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world – people on Monday will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaway and wholesale stores can resume business.
However, Italian authorities have stressed that preventative measures are still needed.
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany will continue its easing on Monday, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary will allow public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.
With health experts warning the disease could hit hard once again, governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs on movement.
Face masks will be mandatory on public transport starting Monday in Spain, where people were allowed to go outdoors on Saturday after a 48-day lockdown. 
Spain today counted another 164 coronavirus deaths, the lowest daily number in nearly seven weeks as the country begins to gradually lift its strict lockdown.
The figures from the health ministry bring the total number of fatalities from the pandemic in Spain to 25,264 – the fourth-highest after the United States, Italy and Britain.
It is the lowest daily increase since 18 March when 107 deaths were recorded but the ministry’s emergencies coordinator, Fernando Simon, said the figure had to be interpreted with “caution” as it comes on a long holiday weekend when reporting of fatalities by hospitals is usually slower.
“The figures are very good and confirm the trend we have observed. We have to see if they are consolidated in the coming days,” he told a news conference.
Confirmed cases of the virus rose by just 838 to 217,466, although the government recently began counting in its total only patients who test positive using a technique known as PCR.
It was the tenth straight day that the number of cured, at 1,654, surpassed new infections.
Health experts believe Spain’s outbreak peaked on 2 April when 950 people died over 24 hours. Since then, the toll has been gradually dropping.
Spain’s nearly 47 million people have since March 14 lived under one of the strictest virus lockdowns in the world, with only adults authorised to leave home to buy food, medicine or walk the dog.
But Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Tuesday unveiled a plan to gradually begin easing the restrictions in four phases that should be completed by the end of June.
Lockdowns ease in Asia 
With pressure growing on governments worldwide to balance public health requirements with the need to ease intense economic pain, some nations in Asia announced similar measures.
South Korea – once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -  said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures”.
Thailand meanwhile allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen today so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.
Despite the reopenings, experts have cautioned that many countries are still not through the worst of their outbreaks yet.
In the latest sign that the pandemic remains a serious threat, the Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country for a week starting today in a bid to ease the pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.
And to boost morale in what many expect to be a long fight, the armed forces of India – where the world’s biggest lockdown is in force – organised tributes to the nation’s medical workers, including helicopters showering petals on hospitals.
Elsewhere, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.
Rouhani warned, however, that while Iran would reopen “calmly and gradually”, it should also prepare for “bad scenarios”. 
‘Beyond breaking point’
Across the Pacific, the pressure to ease virus measures is intense on leaders in the United States, where the economy has been hammered with tens of millions left jobless.
The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world and President Donald Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain.
Florida is set to ease its lockdown tomorrow, as authorities in other states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators – some armed – who have protested against the lockdowns.
There are signs that the pandemic is slowing down in some parts of the United States.
In New York City, the epicentre of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close, the Christian charity running it said Saturday, as virus cases decline in the city.
But authorities are wary of letting their guard down too fast, with fears the virus could wreak havoc in the most vulnerable communities in the United States.
A massive wave of infections is sweeping through America’s prison population – the world’s largest at 2.3 million – with coronavirus deaths on the rise in jails and penitentiaries across the country.
Riots over inadequate protection and slow responses by authorities have already taken place in prisons in Washington state and Kansas.
“Things are beyond breaking point at this facility,” said Brian Miller, an officer at the Marion prison in Ohio. “Right now it’s hell.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: World Rugby struggling to plan for sport’s return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont admits planning the return of international competition is difficult with countries experiencing varying stages of the coronavirus pandemic and holding different strategies.
The summer tour season in July looks set to be wiped out and the Scottish Rugby Union recently admitted there was “developing uncertainty” over the fate of their November Test schedule at BT Murrayfield.
The Guinness Six Nations is unfinished while the southern hemisphere’s Rugby Championship is due to take place in August and September, but the fate of domestic leagues and European competitions is also uncertain.
Beaumont pledged to get straight to work on dealing with the coronavirus crisis after being re-elected for a second four-year term but he added: “We don’t know when we are going to come out of it. Some countries are coming out of it quicker than others.
“We still have to plan the international games, the domestic games, and already you can see there is difference of opinions from country to country whereby last week the French government said there would be no sport played at all until September 1, and in the UK there is still a desire to get some club games started before then.
“So you can imagine what that is like for us when we are trying to put international matches together.
“Everything at the moment is scenario planning: what if, what if, what if.
“You don’t know if there’s going to be any inter-hemisphere travel at all this year. You don’t know whether you can start behind closed doors, we don’t know when that will be. That will vary from country to country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meacham: MaxQ swiftly responds to coronavirus crisis with a pivot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Great ideas and great companies don't go away during times of crisis. Many just require a little more nurturing.
Other businesses recognize that with quick action and a bit of a pivot, they can not only survive a crisis, but that they can actually improve the situation.
MaxQ, a Stillwater company that creates sophisticated packaging systems for blood and other biologics, is one of our portfolio companies. MaxQ's packaging systems are specially designed to hold and transfer refrigerated, controlled room temperature or frozen biological materials, such as red blood cells, whole blood, platelets, or plasma, as well as tissue specimens and organs.
When the implications of COVID-19 began accelerating in February, CEO Saravan Kumar and the team at MaxQ immediately began assessing the potential impact on their business. At the time, the company was in nearly 450 hospitals in the U.S. and another 10 internationally.
"Initially, we wanted to understand the market level changes and how to adapt our plans," Kumar said. "We quickly realized the need for antibody testing, and that our product designed to move blood inside of hospitals and diagnostic labs, and across the country, could move patient specimen kits (COVID19 swabs), reagents, and (convalescent) plasma."
MaxQ is a made-in-USA company with a resilient supply chain. In the first week of February, the company reached out to suppliers. "Everyone came together to source the materials we needed," Kumar said. "We adapted our manufacturing and assembly, increased shifts, set up A and B teams for social distancing, and ramped up our inventory."
In less than two weeks, MaxQ reconfigured three products to launch specific solutions for coronavirus-positive patients. One of those is an instant activation pouch solution with an integrated temperature control that was designed to help hospitals' in issuing single-units of blood to COVID-19 patients.
COVID-19 medical teams need to collect and transport many, many temperature-controlled blood specimens rapidly from dispersed locations. The process requires an in-place inventory of transport boxes, gel packs and tons of ice.
The challenge is matching the correct number of all the components required to send the available specimens to the appropriate lab in four hours or less. It's a logistical nightmare.
With the MaxQ STAT pouch, a simple squeeze activates the cooling material, and in 15 seconds, the package is ready to go. Medical teams don't have to plan or coordinate multiple items for testing.
"They grab the bag, crack it open, and send it out on a designated transport," Kumar said. "It is a single product, designed for a STAT situation. We have relevant technical solutions, a motivated team in-house, and a company culture that is aggressively focused on solving our customer’s challenges in providing highest quality patient care."
In New York, MaxQ solutions are used to send blood to patients in more than 15 hospitals. In Seattle, MaxQ packages are used to move materials to coronavirus testing sites. Additionally, MaxQ stepped up by adapting processes and materials to make face shields with plans to supply community hospitals and first responders in Oklahoma who are having difficulty sourcing personal protective equipment.
From the first time we met the MaxQ team eight years ago as a student team competing in the Governor’s Cup (now Love's Cup) to today, this founding team's culture and vision has been to have a measurable, positive impact on patient safety and healthcare. When we began, we had no idea just how far-reaching that vision would be.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Economists warn of a zombie recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spain will be open for business this week. But, by appointment only. Having implemented one of the toughest coronavirus lockdowns in the world over the past six weeks, the Spanish authorities will gradually relax some of the restrictions, including allowing smaller non-food shops to reopen their doors.
But there is a catch: at many shops, customers will first have to book.
Daniel Moratilla, who runs Bike Brothers, a bicycle shop near Madrid’s Casa de Campo park, already has 15 appointments lined up for Monday and expects to have 30 to 40 a day thereafter. The booking system is supposed to be a temporary safeguard to limit the risk of contagion, but Mr Moratilla will keep it going because his 70-square-metre shop is too small to allow social distancing between his customers.
“What else can we do? We have to adapt,” he says.
“It’s as if we are doctors or dentists,” says Maximino Sordo, who runs a shop in central Madrid with no bookings yet for next week. “But we are a hardware store.”
Welcome to the new economic twilight zone that is likely to be a feature of the western world for several months to come. Governments in Europe, the US, Australia and New Zealand have begun to ease the extraordinary stay-at-home orders that have helped contain the spread of COVID-19.
But in most places, it will be anything but business-as-usual. Instead, the next few months are going to feel like an empty-chair economy, with new shift patterns at factories, half-full buses and trains, staggered opening hours and unusually roomy restaurants.
With no vaccine or treatment available, swathes of economic, social and cultural life will remain subject to social distancing requirements and travel restrictions. Consumers and managers are coming to terms with the need for fewer people in the workplace at any one time – potentially reducing productivity and output.
After a week in which the US and the eurozone recorded historic slumps in gross domestic product in the first quarter – and a further 3.8 million Americans filed jobless claims bringing the total since the crisis began to 30 million – economists are revising down already gloomy predictions for the second quarter of 2020.

Face masks will be mandatory on public transport starting Monday in Spain, where people were allowed to go outdoors on Saturday after a 48-day lockdown.
- Lockdowns ease in Asia -
With pressure growing on governments worldwide to balance public health requirements with the need to ease intense economic pain, some nations in Asia announced similar measures.
South Korea -- once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -- said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they "follow disinfection measures".
Thailand meanwhile allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen on Sunday so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.
Despite the reopenings, experts have cautioned that many countries are still not through the worst of their outbreaks yet.
In the latest sign that the pandemic remains a serious threat, the Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country for a week starting Sunday in a bid to ease the pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.
And to boost morale in what many expect to be a long fight, the armed forces of India -- where the world's biggest lockdown is in force -- organised tributes to the nation's medical workers, including helicopters showering petals on hospitals.
Elsewhere, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.
Rouhani warned, however, that while Iran would reopen "calmly and gradually", it should also prepare for "bad scenarios".
- 'Beyond breaking point' -
Across the Pacific, the pressure to ease virus measures is intense on leaders in the United States, where the economy has been hammered with tens of millions left jobless.
The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world and President Donald Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain.
Florida is set to ease its lockdown on Monday, as authorities in other states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators -- some armed -- who have protested against the lockdowns.
There are signs that the pandemic is slowing down in some parts of the United States.
In New York City, the epicentre of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close, the Christian charity running it said Saturday, as virus cases decline in the city.
But authorities are wary of letting their guard down too fast, with fears the virus could wreak havoc in the most vulnerable communities in the United States.
A massive wave of infections is sweeping through America's prison population -- the world's largest at 2.3 million -- with coronavirus deaths on the rise in jails and penitentiaries across the country.
Riots over inadequate protection and slow responses by authorities have already taken place in prisons in Washington state and Kansas.
"Things are beyond breaking point at this facility," said Brian Miller, an officer at the Marion prison in Ohio. "Right now it's hell."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fears Mount About Inflation Returning With a Vengeance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sign up here for our daily coronavirus newsletter on what you need to know, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis.
Even a calamity of disease, death and economic destruction afflicting the world all at once isn’t enough to suppress the notion in some quarters that inflation could return with a vengeance.
The coronavirus crisis has killed hundreds of thousands, incapacitated millions and affected the livelihoods of billions -- prompting policy makers to fear a deflation spiral reminiscent of the Great Depression. But economists including former Bank of England official Charles Goodhart, and investors such as BNP Paribas Asset Management, are asking if a different phenomenon lurks in the wreckage of global growth.
Such contrarians wonder if an environment of ultra-loose monetary and fiscal easing, commodity shortages, frayed supply chains and braking globalization might be fertile ground for surging consumer prices. Reinforcing that shift, monetary authorities could face pressure to keep interest rates low, capping the cost of servicing ballooned government debt while allowing inflation to erode it too.
Even some traditionally deflation-wary thinkers have begun pondering that outcome. Former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard recently wrote that high inflation is “unlikely but not impossible,” a sentiment echoed by former European Central Bank policy maker Peter Praet.
“I wouldn’t say that it’s a given that we’re going to be in a longer-term inflationary environment,” said Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management. “But I wouldn’t say it’s going to be a negligible probability either.”
A limited dose of inflation might be welcome to central bankers who have spent trillions of dollars over the years in stimulus to achieve that. But such a prospect is far from their minds at present as they try to help economies facing eye-watering increases in unemployment. Almost half of the world’s workforce is in danger of losing livelihoods from the crisis, according to the International Labour Organisation.
“The deflationary shock is dominating, that’s absolutely clear,” Praet said in an interview. “There’s a collapse of demand.”
Markets reflect that view, in tune with the oil slump and the prevailing perspective of weak prices sapped by adverse demographics, new technologies and globalization. Inflation expectations, as proxied by five-year, five-year forward swap rates, are near record lows in the U.S. and Europe. The U.K. 10-year breakeven rate is down nearly three quarters of a point below last year’s peak.
Some investors see things differently. BNP Paribas Asset Management, which oversees more than $450 billion, has started building an overweight position in commodities for the first time in four years, while going underweight bonds. Ardea Investment Management, a Sydney-based fixed income asset manager, said it “materially” added inflation exposure from late March after the collapse in market expectations of price growth.
“In terms of tail risks not being focused on, inflation is definitely one of them,” said Gopi Karunakaran, a money manager at Ardea.
That narrative diverges from another argument over the years -- for example from Germany’s Bundesbank -- that underlying conditions in some economies have long supported a pickup in prices.
One strand emphasizes the synchronized stimulus -- with monetary easing supercharged by fiscal largess -- as opposed to the asymmetric response during the financial crisis, when central banks cut rates and started quantitative easing, but governments reined in budgets.
“What we are doing is creating a policy framework that has an inflation bias in it, which is the first time we’ve had that in generations,” said Dario Perkins, chief European economist at TS Lombard in London and a former U.K. Treasury official. “The policy response is a war-time policy response.”
That conflict theme is one that Goodhart finds apt. In a March 27 paper with Manoj Pradhan, founder of Talking Heads Macroeconomics, he wrote that commodity costs will rebound with an economic recovery after lockdowns are lifted and stimulus takes effect. Inflation could exceed 5% in 2021, and perhaps even reach 10% -- outcomes resembling the aftermaths of World Wars I and II.
“The monetary and fiscal expansion is aimed at, and will succeed at, putting money in the hands of people,” Goodhart, a BOE rate setter from 1997 until 2000, said in an interview. “There will be some degree of pent-up demand.”
Goods disruptions caused by the virus -- for example with Brazilian farmers unable to harvest coffee beans -- might also linger. Colin Harte, a multi-asset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, warns that the supply side “could be more damaged than we realized.”
The further consequences of a potential unwinding of globalization, and a renewed focus on local production, builds on that narrative.
“In the latter stages of the recovery, amid continued de-globalization in goods trade and less elastic global supply, fiscal policies may begin to stoke inflation,” Berenberg Senior Economist Kallum Pickering said.
Some economic data might already point to price pressures. U.S. money supply is surging, and Tim Congdon, a longtime watcher of such data, anticipates it will see its largest increase in peacetime this year -- followed by an “inflationary boom.”
For some analysts however, the prospect of inflation is seriously remote in a world where unemployment is going through the roof.
“It is naive to think everyone is going to get their jobs back when this pandemic virus goes away,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank NA. “Massive job losses mean price declines for many goods are on the way.”
For Goodhart’s thesis of “double-digit” inflation to unfold, Perkins reckons authorities would need to succeed relatively quickly in limiting deaths and shoring up growth, which isn’t a given. He isn’t worried.
Blanchard, in an April 24 article for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, also sees a far greater probability of low inflation. But a combination of swelling public debt, a jump in real interest rates, and deliberately loose monetary policy to aid government financing, could produce a different outcome.
“Inevitably there are risks, the key one being whether the huge policy stimulus under way could ultimately result in inflation either by accident or design,” HSBC Holdings Plc Global Chief Economist Janet Henry wrote in a note on Monday. “If policy makers underestimate the permanent damage to supply from the pandemic and stimulate aggregate demand too much, then inflation would follow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">In PM’s push for farm reforms, a role for Kisan credit cards, PM-KISAN scheme</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a meeting with ministers and government officials to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector in India as the country looks to rebound from the economic setback dealt by coronavirus outbreak.
The government’s focus is on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system for the farm sector and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.
A government release said that this would be achieved by further strengthening Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and by developing ‘Brand India’ in the sector that would contribute to boosting agricultural exports.
“PM Narendra Modi holds a meeting to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector; emphasises on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain,” said a release by the government.
The prime minister has been stressing on boosting exports to aid economic growth.
The meeting also discussed ways to make several government instruments for the sector including the Kisan Credit Cards, PM-KISAN and e-Nam even more effective and increase their contribution to farmer welfare.
Kisan Credit Cards offer short-term credit limits for crops and term loans to holders by participating banks including cooperatives. This initiative grants farmers access to formal banking networks. KCC credit cardholders are also eligible for personal accident insurance for death and permanent disability.
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a scheme started by the Narendra Modi government in 2018 that provides income support of Rs.6000/- per year to all farmer families across the country. The sum is paid in three equal installments of Rs.2000/- each every four months.
National Agriculture Market or eNAM is another initiative to modernize the farming sector with a tool that helps farmers in discovering the best price for their produce. It (eNAM) is an online trading platform for agricultural commodities that brings farmers, traders and buyers at one place.
Saturday’s meeting, which also discussed ways to invigorate the agriculture sector with modern technology, comes in the backdrop of appeals by the prime minister for self-reliance in a post-coronavirus world and for attracting foreign investments by offering a favourable environment aided by government policy, infrastructural and technological advancement.
India readies to enter the third phase of nationwide lockdown from May 4, which will see a graded resumption of economic activities across the country. The government has given total exemptions to the agriculture sector in all zones.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tanzanian president, John Magufuli on Sunday ordered a probe on the country’s coronavirus testing kits after samples taken from a goat and pawpaw tested positive. Speaking at an event in Chato in the northwest of Tanzania, Magufuli said the COVID-19 testing kits which had been imported from abroad had “technical errors”. The president said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits, who then randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat, and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages. According to him, these samples were then submitted to Tanzania’s laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins. President Magufuli later disclosed that samples from the pawpaw and the goat tested positive for COVID-19, adding it was likely that some people were being tested positive when in fact they were not infected by the Coronavirus. “We extracted a sample from a goat which turned positive. This tells you that something is not adding up,” he stated. “Are we now supposed to quarantine goats and fruits?” President Magufuli questioned. Featured Video

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virus impact puts thousands of jobs risk at Rolls-Royce</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - Thousands of jobs could be at risk at British aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which on Sunday said it was in talks with unions about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on operations.
As many as 8,000 jobs could be affected, according to one person familiar with the matter, as the firm grappled with what it said was the "unprecedented" fall-out from the global pandemic.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reducing our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times," a spokesman said.
"But we will need to take further action," he added.
The company, which has 50,000 staff in 50 countries, including some 24,000 in the UK, is working with employee and union representatives.
Further details on job losses would be given to staff before the end of the month, the spokesman said.
The global aviation industry has been badly affected by the outbreak, forcing flights to be cancelled because of lack of demand and restrictions on travel.
According to the International Air Transport Association trade body, air traffic dropped by more than half in March compared with the same period last year.
US aerospace giant Boeing has said it expected to make thousands of job cuts because of the fall in traffic volume, with demand dropping to levels not seen since 2006.
Traffic had previously dropped 10.3% year-on-year in February.
Europe's Airbus last week reported a net first-quarter loss of 481 million euros ($522 million), compared to a profit of 40 million euros in the same period last year.
Airbus said in early April it had cut aircraft production by around a third as global airlines scaled back their plans because of the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veteran online poker players cash in during lockdown surge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Drew Layton dropped out of college in 2006 to play online poker full-time, it was a hard sell to his parents: “They were not thrilled,” he said.
But 14 years later, as coronavirus and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders have shut businesses around the globe and forced people to stay inside, some jobs have proven more stable than others. For Layton, online poker seems to be a good bet.
Layton said he had seen a marked increase in traffic to websites where he plays and thus a rise in his income. “I wouldn’t say I’m thriving because of the pandemic, but one area of my life has gotten a little better,” he said. “All of a sudden, being self-employed is a huge benefit.”
The four US states with legal online poker sites – New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware, and Pennsylvania – reported record revenues in March. Operators in New Jersey, for example, took in a combined $3,629,112 that month – an increase of 90.9% year over year, according to numbers reported by the New Jersey division of gaming enforcement, and more than double February’s online poker revenue.
With more time being spent at home, the number of people turning to online poker is increasing, said Donnie Peters, managing editor of online poker news site and forum PocketFives.com. Meanwhile, in states like New Jersey and Nevada where gambling is big business, many avid poker players unable to go to casinos may be migrating online. According to the American Gaming Association, a trade group, 987 of the US’s 989 casinos were closed by early April to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Veteran players are making more money for two reasons, according to Peters. The influx of online players are generally newer to poker and more inexperienced, making it easier for professionals to win. And when the number of players increases, so does the pot – the money players wager.
On Sunday, the online poker tournament GGPoker beat its $500,000 guarantee pot for the first time after 3,662 players joined. The recent WSOP.com Super Circuit Series, which was launched to replace a live event in Las Vegas, increased its prize money from $1.24m to $4m after a higher-than-expected turnout of players.
“What this means is that not only are those who make their income from poker able to do so more efficiently because they’re playing against a larger population of weaker competition, but the money that can be won from online poker tournaments has grown,” Peters said. “In short, professionals are able to win more money more often.”
“As unfortunate as a situation as this has been for so many, online poker is an industry that is flourishing right now,” Peters said.
But the rise in online gambling has also sparked concern. Those who already gambled online are doing so more often, a survey published in the UK on Friday found. Since the beginning of the Covid outbreak, 25% of gamblers said they were continuing to bet at least once a week while 28% had increased their activity, the survey showed. This has worried anti-gambling advocates in the UK, who are calling for legislation to protect people from gambling their money away while on lockdown. UK betting firms have stopped advertising on TV and radio.
No similar research has been published yet in the US, but advocates there too are calling on states to take measures. The anti-gambling group Stop Predatory Gambling on 20 April called on states to halt to state lotteries.
Although there is no federal law banning online poker, regulations bar it most states and many online poker sites block users based on their computer location. So-called “social poker sites” do not allow betting and thus are legal across the country. Instead of betting on each hand, users participate in sweepstakes and get cash prizes. One such site, National League of Poker, saw a 30%-50% increase in new players in March alone and a 131% increase in revenue, a spokesman said.
Some worry that the restrictions on online poker sites may cause novice online gamblers to turn to unregulated and dangerous offshore poker sites. “The Covid-19 pandemic has magnified this issue,” said Jed Hoffman, who has been playing online poker for 12 years but does not play full-time. “One thing we don’t need right now, as individuals or as communities, is any more risk, especially at the precipice of a serious recession.”
Hoffman said he has noticed about four times as much activity in the past month on his go-to poker site, which is legal and based in Nevada. On Monday, he took home $4,259 in a tournament on Monday he only paid $75 to join.
“I do hope people stuck in lockdown don’t injure themselves economically by playing too much or too high,” Hoffman said. “That is bad for society, and bad for the viability of long term growth in the online poker community.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three quarters of British truckers expect to go out of business within just 2 months due to the coronavirus outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UK truckers are warning Boris Johnson's government that they could go out of business in weeks without more financial support for dealing with the impact of the coronavirus on their industry.
The truckers are playing a vital role in transporting essentials like food and PPE around Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, but their futures still look bleak. Three-quarters say they don't expect their jobs to survive beyond two months, a stark new survey, conducted in the latter part of April and published this weekend, has found.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA), the trade body representing the trucking industry in the UK,  asked its members a series of questions about how the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus had affected their trade.
When asked by the RHA how long they expect their livelihoods to survive at current volume, 75% said two months or less, while 52% said no more than a month. 13% said they expected to go out of business within two weeks.
Richard Burnett, the RHA's Chief Executive, this week, wrote to the government asking for five emergency measures to help the truckers whose cashflow has been torpedoed by the outbreak of the virus and subsequent nationwide lockdown.
They included a temporary suspension of business rates and fuel tax, plus a retention scheme to cover the cost of trucks not in action.
Industry figures have warned the UK government that most haulage operations in the UK are small-to-medium sized companies that will struggle to survive for much longer if their cashflow problems continue. Many already have small profit margins and are reluctant to apply for government loans, as they don't want to take on more debt.
The pain being inflicted on the industry is particularly acute for truckers moving loads, which aren't food and PPE.
Demand for other goods like clothing has plummeted amid the COVID-19 outbreak, while the UK government's strict social distancing measures have forced shops, restaurants, and factories across the country to close.
"If the economy is to recover from this, it is important that we can switch on the supply chain as individual sectors begin their recovery," Burnett said this week.
"No-one knows for sure when that will be, but we must make sure that the industry is up and ready to go at very short notice. We recognize that we need to play the fullest role possible in the UK's recovery and these measures would ensure we can do just that."
The RHA findings published this weekend illustrate the scale of the challenge facing the trucking sector.
LoadingSomething is loading.
73% of respondents said their cash flow had significantly reduced or worsened, with 13% saying they have no cash flow whatsoever. 56% have applied to the UK government's furlough scheme to cover the wages of out-of-work staff.
A figure in the logistics industry, who wished not to be named, told Business Insider: "The situation is dire.
"Ports are suffering, hauliers in non-food or PPE segments are really struggling and facing collapse really struggling, and even those carrying food are facing increasingly tough competition."
A UK government spokesperson told Business Insider:"Hauliers are vital to the nation's battle against Covid-19, and to help support the sector we have made changes to road transport operator licensing, vehicle testing, driver medical renewals, driver training and drivers hours.
"We continue to work with the sector and encourage all firms to make use of the unprecedented package of measures announced by the Chancellor, including £330bn of government backed loans, cash grants and support with tax bills, to help businesses through this difficult time."
However, opposition parties said ministers needed to give industry more support.
Responding to the RHA findings, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said: "Our lorry drivers are essential workers who are keeping the supermarket shelves stocked and delivering other vital supplies.
"Much of this is imported but there are fewer goods going in the opposite direction, putting a big strain on the viability of road hauliers.
"There are real concerns that the furlough scheme needs to have greater flexibility in sectors like road transport. The government should listen to industry and the trade unions and give them the support that employers and workers need to survive the crisis."
Bill Esterson, Labour MP and shadow trade minister, said: "We have to keep this essential industry going to maintain our food supply and viable for us to restart international trade when we eventually emerge from the crisis."
Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Transport and International Trade spokesperson, told Business Insider "the Government must do whatever is necessary to support haulage companies.
"This is about protecting vital supply lines for food and medicine as the coronavirus crisis continues."
She added: "Liberal Democrats are also calling on Ministers to listen to business and find an urgent fix to the business loans scheme, so that small businesses can access the finance they need. Otherwise, people's livelihoods are at risk."

    <h5 class="mb-1">IMF approves emergency loan for Ecuador</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON, USA – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a $643-million emergency loan for Ecuador, as the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices hit the South American nation.
The Ecuadorian Ministry of Economy and Finance said on Friday, May 1, the 5-year loan came with "favorable conditions" at 1.05% interest.
The country faces a double crisis in the form of the virus and a fall in oil prices, with the IMF forecasting a drop of 6.3% in the country's gross domestic product in 2020.
Ecuador has so far reported more than 25,000 COVID-19 infections and 1,000 deaths linked to the disease.
"This financing will provide the necessary liquidity to support the reactivation of production and the protection of jobs," the ministry said in a statement.
The credit offering joins a 3-year economic assistance program signed by Lenin Moreno's government with the international body in 2019.
That $4.2-billion loan involved a raft of cuts and fiscal adjustments that led to a wave of protests in October 2019 when the government raised fuel prices. – Rappler.com

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Raghava Lawrence showed his big heart when he announced the various charity activities he took up for helping people in this ongoing crisis. Here, we have another incident reflecting how he always comes forward to help the needy.
Lawrence helped in the delivery of a pregnant woman when he got a call from the woman’s husband. Immediately, the choreographer turned actor and director informed the same to Tamil Nadu’s Health Minister’s PA who in turn helped the pregnant woman’s admission into KMC Hospital.
After the safe delivery of the child, Lawrence took to his Facebook wall to thank all the doctors who helped in the delivery and ensured that both the mother and the child are safe. The child is said to be healthy and the mother is under treatment.
Like Lawrence said, “Service is God’. Those celebrities who have been doing whatever they can in their ability are inspiring many others to come forward to help the people who need help during the current crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IMF approves $91 mln loan to Malawi for COVID-19 trade balance woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BLANTYRE — The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a $91 million loan for Malawi to help fund a balance of payments deficit exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fund said in a statement.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is having a severe impact on Malawi, creating an urgent balance of payments need,” Tao Zhang, deputy manager of the IMF, said in the statement.
“The authorities have been proactive in mitigating the impact of the pandemic, including through increased spending on health care and social assistance … and ensuring food security through purchase and storage of agricultural harvests,” he added.
The low-income southeast African country, which so far has reported 37 coronavirus cases and three deaths, was already suffering from economic stagnation linked to drought, leading to increasing unrest over falling living standards.
Malawi’s main export is tobacco, which makes up about half of export earnings, alongside other crops such as tea and sugar.
The World Bank said last month it had approved a $37 million funding package to help Malawi respond to the coronavirus. (Reporting by Frank Phiri Writing by Tim Cocks Editing by Helen Popper)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistan’s exports in the post-Covid global marketplace</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Covid-19 contagion has not only created a human crisis of unprecedented scale but rattled the global economic order, quicker than anyone could have visualised a few months ago. The crisis is fast transforming the socio-cultural life, which, in turn, determines the economic activity and consumption patterns. The initial trends indicate the direction of transition — social distancing, premium on personal hygiene, flexibility of workplace, nationalistic self-sufficiency in critical supplies and consumables. The consumption patterns are being redefined in terms of type, time and place of consumption. The frontiers of production and supply are being redrawn. The exact configuration of the new order is uncertain, but it is evident that the global economic order will have a reboot on the other side of the crisis, with a new set of economic challenges and opportunities for Pakistan.
The pandemic has put the global economy in a tailspin. According to initial estimates, the crisis is going to shave more than $9 trillion off the world GDP in 2020 and 2021. IMF forecasts the global economy to contract by 3% and WTO expects the world trade to fall by 13% to 32% in 2020. Eight out of the 10 largest economies, constituting 45% of the global GDP and 40% of Pakistan’s export markets, are expected to contract at an accelerated pace — US (6.1%), UK (6.5%), Germany (7%), France (7.2%), Spain (8.0%), Italy (9.1%), Japan (5.2%), and Canada (6.2%). Pakistan’s exports will have to navigate in these contracting markets.
The disruption of global supply chains during the pandemic outbreak has forced a rethink of the ideals of market economies and integration into global value chains. Nation after nation, even the most strident advocates of free trade, have baptised the taboos of export bans and import restrictions, without a whimper. The import restrictions and protectionism are being unapologetically resorted to, on the pretext of national self-sufficiency.
The lockdowns have resulted in mass closures of retail outlets in the export markets and factory shutdowns in Pakistan. With the clogging supply line, exports would inevitably slide downwards in the coming months. The glimmer of hope, however, lies in the forecast that some of the product categories of Pakistan’s export interest, especially apparel and bedwear, have a high potential of bouncing back in the medium to long term.
The above-mentioned challenges, notwithstanding the crisis, has also created opportunities for Pakistan in the short, medium and long term. Firstly, with the global recession and mass unemployment becoming a reality, the disposable incomes will shrink, and consumption patterns will change, creating new winners and losers. In the face of economic crisis, the consumers are willing to buy less expensive luxury goods, what is termed as the “lipstick effect”. It will create sustained opportunities for Pakistani suppliers, since their traditional strength has been the lower to lower-middle product segment.
Secondly, due to the disruption in global supply chains during the Wuhan phase of the pandemic, companies across the globe have realised the risks of over-reliance on limited nodes of supply chain, especially China, for essential supplies. The enterprises will diversify their supply chains, creating opportunities for Pakistani enterprises to penetrate some of the hitherto-impermeable global supply chains. Agility and competitiveness will be the critical success factors to tap these opportunities.
Thirdly, the FAO forecasts disturbance of global food systems, disruption in regional agricultural value chains, and shortages of food supplies in the world, escalating the global prices of food commodities. Rice being the second largest export item of Pakistan and primarily an export-oriented crop in Pakistan (with more than four million tonnes exportable surplus) is likely to get a positive impact on the average unit price, increasing the dollar yield.
Fourthly, the social distancing and other lifestyle adjustments of consumers are creating new winners and losers in the product and services domain. In the short term, sanitisers, soaps, toilet paper, protective masks, home office furniture and equipment remain high in demand. In the medium to long term, selfcare products and apparel can have sustained growth. Pakistan can benefit from its comparative advantage in textiles and leather products to diversify into new product range — fabric masks, protective gear, footwear and personal care products. Besides, Pakistan can venture into new products, e.g. paper products and sanitisers, leveraging the indigenous raw material base of ethanol.
Fifthly, with social distancing becoming the new social norm, physical retailing is conceding its ground to online retailing. The traditional privilege of physical retailing, i.e. sensory testing of the product would be abated since touching and trying the product in store would be considered ‘unhygienic’. Besides, the social distancing compliance multiplies the space requirement of retail outlets, making it uneconomical. Consumerism, both essential and discretionary, will have no option but to be fulfilled through online retailing. With the advantage of physical retailing being offset, the overseas exporting enterprises (e.g. Pakistani exporters) can swiftly carve out their share in e-commerce provided they are able to develop functional shopping platforms, convenient payment solutions and agile delivery mechanisms.
Sixthly, being forced into the work-from-home model, enterprises in developed countries are realising the benefits of reducing office and operational costs by allowing employees to work from home. With the transformation of workplace, the home-office equipment and outsourcing of functions overseas will become more viable than before. Coming from a reasonably sound production base, Pakistan’s ICT industry, especially fintech, business process outsourcing, consultancy and software development can claim a significant share in the post-corona marketplace.
The most critical factor in Pakistan’s ability to capitalise on these opportunities is the agility of enterprises to quickly transform their production lines to grab the immediate demand of new product categories. As is the nature of the crisis, the immediate market demand is in the same products, which are needed at home. The real challenge for public policy lies in accurately determining national demand, imposing ‘smart’ import restrictions wherever necessary, resisting the temptation of overprotection and allowing the exportable surplus to gain the first-mover advantage in export markets.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cop reveals he stopped Celtic and Rangers 1980 Scottish Cup riot from becoming Scotland's Hillsborough</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A police officer on duty at the 1980 Scottish Cup Final has revealed he prevented a Hillsborough-like crush which could have killed hundreds of fans, including children.
PC Tom McLeod – a Rangers supporter – opened a gate at the Celtic end of Hampden to free trapped kids minutes before the infamous riot broke out.
The former officer is convinced his actions stopped lives being lost, even though it unwittingly led to part of the pitch invasion that sparked shameful scenes which were beamed around the world on TV.
Tom said: “The youngsters right down at the front were being pressed against the 10ft-high fence that had been put up around the track. I began to get concerned about that. After the Celtic players had come up close, the kids at the front were being pressed against the fence and I could see the panic in their faces. I decided to open the gate beside me or there could have been some serious damage done.
“I dragged out one kid after another, maybe about a dozen or so, but down came another surge and scores of people began to get through.
“It was then I noticed that another officer, further round the track, had taken his cue from me and did the same. Then the invasion was unstoppable.”
The revelations come in a new book by veteran broadcaster and journalist Archie Macpherson serialised in the Daily Record today.
Supporters of both sides had already started fighting in Hampden’s main stand after George McCluskey had scored a late goal to win the cup for Celtic.
Captain Danny McGrain and his team ran to the Celtic end with the trophy to celebrate but McLeod became concerned the celebrations could turn deadly.
He feared young fans would be killed if he didn’t open the gates while fighting was going on elsewhere in the ground.
Archie hailed the cop as a hero for his actions.
The broadcaster, who was commentating on the match for the BBC, said: “PC McLeod is adamant the action he and his colleague took – which while making it easier for the ultimate invasion – prevented something potentially much worse.
“You need only look at two simple but crucial sentences from the Hillsborough report 32 years later, on the deaths at that FA Cup semi-final, to comprehend the validity of his action that day. It said, ‘There was a small locked [sic] gate at the front of each pen. The crush became unbearable and fans collapsed underfoot’.”
The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 saw 96 fans tragically killed when Liverpool supporters became trapped in a pen at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.
Archie said: “It is conceivable a serious accident might have occurred had McLeod not opened that gate. The instant decision he made to open it and then help drag kids out was almost a heroic act.
“I was puzzled as to why the invasion could not have been stopped, little realising that one humane act of a single constable had coincidentally eased their passage.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spikes: Lesson learned after infamous Disney World theft</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Sometimes, people recognize Patrick Spikes out in public and stop to ask, “Aren’t you that guy who stole stuff from Disney?”
Spikes’ legal troubles were an internet sensation after the 25-year-old was accused of taking items from the theme parks and selling them on the Internet. One of his high-profile customers, court records revealed, was NBA player Robin Lopez.
“I don’t think I’m as bad a guy as people think I am,” the former Disney World employee said in a recent phone interview with the Orlando Sentinel, the first time he has talked with the newspaper since his Feb. 4 plea deal.
The first thing strangers usually ask is “How did you get away with it?”
“I really didn’t,” Spikes said.
Under the plea deal, Spikes pleaded no contest to dealing stolen property. He has already paid his required $25,308 in restitution, which includes $10,700 to Lopez and $6,703 to Disney, court records show. He also performed 250 hours of community service.
The state attorney’s office originally had charged Spikes with burglary at Epcot and the Magic Kingdom as well as grand theft and trafficking in stolen Haunted Mansion costumes, according to court records.
LOPEZ ON TAPE
Lopez, who has stayed silent during the criminal proceedings and declined previous requests for comment, talked about how he first connected with Spikes during a 15-minute interview recorded in May 2019 with the Orange County Sheriff’s office with his attorney listening in. The Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s Office released the audio after a Sentinel public records request.

    <h5 class="mb-1">An Impressive April, Followed By Sell In May For US Stocks?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite the deluge of, frankly, terrible economic numbers throughout April, the stock markets took more notice to the fiscal and monetary boosts throughout the month. April’s return of 12.7% for the S&P 500 was the third best month since World War II. Of course, as the adage goes, Sell in May and Go Away started with a bang. Friday May 1 had a plunge of 2.8% as traders took profits and cut losses after some big tech earnings.
A look at the flows for the week had a few strong stories, and a few weak ones. Let us start with the bad. In the consumer industry, PepsiCo, Inc. and Starbucks Corporation SBUX closed with losses of 3.14% and 2.37%, respectively. This was on big volume, as PepsiCo Inc. PEP had 4.49 million shares traded to Starbucks Corporation’s 11.22 million shares. Given the recession and loss of income from places like restaurant sales, it makes sense to have a pullback in the industry. They both also reported quarterly earnings on April 28
One of the biggest drops this week in the trending stocks was the General Motors Company GM . The stock closed down 4.8% on heavy volume of 17.7 million shares. General Motors Company has had a tough year amid the pandemic, as U.S. the annualized rate of auto sales have dropped to levels not seen since 2010. The stock has lost 42.7% year-to-date.
A surprising winner this week was The Boeing Company BA , which gained 3.4%, after they secured massive corporate debt financing of $25 billion, at a significantly lower cost than investors expected. The gain would have been much bigger on the week had it not been for Friday’s plunge of over 5.4%. The share traded hands at a significant rate this week, with a volume of 36.5 million shares traded. The Boeing Company has had its fair share of issues this year, with a year-to-date loss of 58.8%.
Advanced Micro Device AMD s also had a tough week, closing down 11.2% on volume of 69.5 million shares. The company reported pretty strong earnings, but guidance going forward was disappointing leading to the pullback.
Facebook, Inc. FB came out with very impressive quarterly numbers, adding $44 billion in market cap after announcing a strong jump in daily active users. Not surprising, given that everyone is at home and looking for social connections elsewhere. The stock closed up 6.4% on the week with volume of over 30.4 million shares but remains down 1.45% on the year. It has had an impressive bounce off the lows to the company’s credit.

    <h5 class="mb-1">April Makes More Market History</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
While the March sell-off broke records, April was historic in its own right, as stocks posted a stunning recovery to finish the month more than 30% off the March lows.
Although the coronavirus pandemic continued to command the world’s attention, focus gradually shifted to reopening the economy as the virus began to slow in major European and US hotspots. Meanwhile, economic data and corporate earnings previewed the extent of the damage from the virus-driven lockdown. Unemployment claims in the US soared and initial first-quarter GDP took its biggest hit since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. But renewed hope for a potential coronavirus treatment and plans to ease stay-at-home orders in several states helped close out an exceptionally strong month for the market.
US equities
Although still negative year-to-date, the S&P 500® and Dow Jones Industrial Average had their best month in decades, returning 12.8% and 11.2% respectively. It was small caps, though, that really shined, rebounding significantly after investors abandoned them in March in favor of presumably stronger mega-cap stocks.
FactSet Research Systems
All 11 S&P sectors finished higher, led by energy, which rallied remarkably despite collapsing oil prices. Growth stocks performed relatively better than their value peers, as larger tech companies drove profits in the new “stay-at-home” era.
FactSet Research Systems
International equities
International equities were also positive but lagged well behind the US market as the virus slowed in China and European hotspots. Latin American stocks were among the worst performers as those countries are highly geared toward the oil market, which fell to unprecedented levels last month.
FactSet Research Systems
Fixed income
Interest rates fell modestly, resulting in positive returns for US Treasuries, especially those with long durations. Taxable bonds were somewhat stronger in April, led by investment-grade corporates. Munis were in the red, well behind their taxable counterparts amid Senator Mitch McConnell’s comments about allowing states to declare bankruptcy.1

Looking ahead
While April’s market recovery was robust, the pandemic is just beginning to make itself felt in US economic data, and the road to recovery will undoubtedly be marked by fits and starts.
Following the Federal Reserve’s first regularly scheduled meeting since issuing two emergency rate cuts in March, Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy would “likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter.” But he doubled down on the Fed’s “whatever it takes” stance and pledged to keep interest rates near zero until full employment and inflation return.2
We’re not out of the woods just yet, but we are making positive strides. Here are some themes for the weeks ahead:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway lost $49.7 billion in first quarter stung by coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not even Warren Buffett was spared financially from the coronavirus, as his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a $49.7 billion loss in the first quarter Saturday, reflecting the outbreak’s toll on an investment portfolio that includes big stakes in major airlines and financial firms.
The loss was Berkshire’s biggest ever and a sharp swing from a $21.7 billion profit in the same quarter a year earlier. The conglomerate’s vast array of investments exposed it — and Buffett, long considered one of the world’s top investors — to huge swaths of the battered US economy.
Its total investment loss for the quarter, without accounting for operating earnings, was $54.5 billion. By comparison, its investment gain in all of 2019 was $56.3 billion.
Berkshire said it continued to sell stock in April, totaling $6.5 billion, ploughing that money primarily into supersafe Treasury bills. Later Saturday, at his annual shareholders meeting, Buffett suggested that some of those sales involved Berkshire’s reversing its roughly 10% in the four largest US airlines.
Berkshire’s investment loss tracked the overall slide in stock markets: The S&P 500 dropped 20% in the first quarter. (The company’s biggest holdings are also mainstays of the S&P 500: American Express, Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo, with those stakes amounting to nearly $125 billion.)
The loss overshadowed a 6% rise in Berkshire’s operating earnings, which track the performance of the company’s owned-and-operated businesses like insurer Geico. Buffett regards that as a better measure of the company’s overall performance and has long argued that quarterly paper gains or losses on its investments “are often meaningless” in understanding its overall health.
But it is hard to ignore the damage to a portfolio that includes stakes in financial firms like Bank of America and American Express, both of which reported steep drops in earnings for the first quarter, and four of the biggest US airlines. (Berkshire also disclosed that the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz on its books exceeds the market value of that holding by about 40%, and warned that it might have to take a write-down on the investment in the future.)
Even some of the conglomerate’s wholly owned businesses, like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and retailers like See’s Candy, were hurt by the lockdowns that have shaken the US economy. Still, Geico reported a 28% gain for the quarter, to $984 million, while Berkshire’s overall insurance investment profits rose modestly because of increased dividend income for the company.
The first-quarter results, in which Berkshire reported having $137.3 billion in cash, were released before its first online-only shareholder meeting. Sometimes described as a kind of Woodstock for capitalists, the meeting is usually a weekendlong Omaha, Nebraska, extravaganza celebrating all things Buffett and Berkshire.
This year, it was a decidedly more subdued affair, reflecting the limits on mass gatherings and travel of the COVID-crisis era. Buffett’s longtime business partner, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not attend, staying at home in Los Angeles.
“It just didn’t seem like a good idea to have him make the trip to Omaha,” Buffett said, adding, “Charlie is in fine shape, and he’ll be back next year.”
Buffett was joined instead by Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman overseeing all of the company’s non-insurance companies, who sat at a separate desk some distance from Buffett.
Instead of facing thousands of adoring and affluent shareholders, Buffett, noting that he hadn’t had a haircut in seven weeks, held forth in an almost completely vacant Omaha arena that seats more than 17,000, as his comments were livestreamed.
Discussing the breakdown in the financial markets that prompted the Federal Reserve to drastically ramp up efforts to pump in fresh cash, he said, “We came very close to having a total freeze of credit.”
When it came to Berkshire’s stake in the airlines, Buffett said, “I just decided that I’d made a mistake.”
He added that because of the pandemic’s impact on travel, “the airline business — and I may be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong — but I think it, it changed in a very major way.”

As the video description points out, this performance uses a different backing track for him to sing to than the one found on the record, also making it extra special.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus scrambles 2020 expectations for Trump in must-win Florida</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Before the coronavirus pandemic, Desi Marinov considered herself “apolitical.” The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, flight attendant didn’t even bother to vote in the 2016 presidential election.
Losing her job due to lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus and then waiting weeks for unemployment benefits has changed all that. Now she is determined to make sure President Donald Trump is not re-elected in November.
“I will go and vote and will convince as many people as I can … that this is the wrong type of leadership,” she said.
Marinov, 42, is the kind of voter that keeps the Trump campaign up at night. Of all the battleground states he won in 2016, Florida is the biggest prize with 29 Electoral College votes.
Trump had been considered the favorite to win Florida again over the prospective Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, despite edging out Hillary Clinton there by just 1.2%.
But two months into the biggest crisis of his presidency, the Republican has received mixed reviews for his response. Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally, meanwhile, has been criticized for being slow to close beaches and blamed for a faulty unemployment compensation system that locked hundreds of thousands out of benefits.
Recent polls now show Biden neck-and neck or slightly ahead of Trump in Florida as well as nationally. Trump’s internal polling shows the same, according to a Republican source close to his re-election campaign.
One in five Floridians are aged 65 and older, the age group most vulnerable to the coronavirus, compared with one in six nationally, according to U.S. census data from 2019.
“It’s much more competitive than it was. He doesn’t have the edge with seniors that he had before,” the source said, asking not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. “Florida... is in play.”
According to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll from mid-April, only about a third of Americans 55 and older think the country is headed in the right direction, down 6 percentage points from a similar poll in February.
Their preference in November’s election showed a small improvement for Biden, who drew 44% support from older Americans, about the same amount as Trump, who had 45%, according to the poll.
Biden’s strength with independent voters such as Marinov also appears to be growing, albeit marginally. He had a 4% lead among self-identified independents in April, compared to his 2% advantage in February.
Trump has been frustrated by the recent polls, at one point sharply questioning his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, over the numbers, according to a source familiar with the matter.
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said he did not believe his lock on the state was in jeopardy.
“I don’t think so,” Trump said, but added, “Look, I haven’t been looking at polls for a while.”
RE-OPENING FLORIDA
Of the major battleground states in the general election - also including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona - DeSantis has been the most aggressive about re-starting his state’s economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism and services.
About one million of Florida’s estimated 10 million-strong workforce lost jobs during the pandemic. State government data as of Thursday shows that about half of them have not been able to claim benefits after its automated compensation system crashed.
“We’re on the path to economic suicide,” said Ford O’Connell, a former Republican congressional candidate in Florida who regularly consults with the Trump re-election campaign on strategy. “The sooner DeSantis is able to return Florida to a sense of safety, the better Trump is.”
Florida plans to partially reopen on Monday, despite concerns among public health experts including on Trump’s team about the possibility of a spike in new cases should states ease social distancing measures too quickly.
“That might not go over well either,” the Republican source close to the campaign said.
Russell Green, 61, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is one of those who worries he and others will be at risk if the state opens too quickly. He believes Trump failed to take the spread of the virus seriously.
An independent who voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, the Naples resident plans to vote for Biden this time.
Economists say that with summer generally the slowest season for Florida’s industries, any economic rebound from a successful re-opening may not be apparent by November.
Trump’s allies say even a small uptick will benefit Trump’s re-election odds.
“Three months after this, people are going to say (DeSantis) handled it right and the president handled it right,” said Brian Ballard, a top Florida lobbyist and Republican power-broker.
Sensing a possible opening in the state but with all in-person campaigning stopped due to the pandemic, Biden and his allies are doing what they can to reach voters in Florida.
This week, he gave an interview to local media in Miami, criticizing Trump’s handling of the pandemic, and local Democrats such as U.S. Representative Val Demings of Orlando, who is considered a possible vice-presidential pick, have been arguing his case for the presidency.
Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA plans to spend at least $13 million airing ads in Florida between now and Election Day, said Daniela Martins, the group’s Florida outreach director.
But Biden will need to raise much more money to stay visible in the state, which has several expensive media markets, analysts say. By the end of March, Biden trailed Trump in cash on hand by more than $180 million.
Mary Jane Lukas, 45, of Gainesville, Florida, an independent voter who supported a third-party candidate in 2016, remains unconvinced. She said she was leaning toward Trump, largely because she thinks Biden has kept too low a profile during the crisis.
“I don’t want to vote for (Trump),” Lukas said, “but I feel like I have to.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett Stays on Sidelines With Cash Rising to $137 Billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Warren Buffett has been waiting years for stocks to look more attractive. He apparently didn’t think the first-quarter plunge was that opportunity.
As the coronavirus slowdown started to grip the U.S., the famed investor’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was building its massive cash pile to a record $137 billion by the end of March. The company said that figure climbed even higher as it dumped more than $6 billion of stocks in April, making Buffett a net seller of equities so far this year.
Buffett, who will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually later Saturday, has largely stayed in the shadows as the pandemic hammered the global economy and stock markets. That’s a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when his Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse. While Berkshire’s operating earnings climbed in the first quarter, Buffett warned of pain from the virus’s fallout.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” the company said in a regulatory filing Saturday.
The sharp drop in stocks sparked a debate over whether the slide was overblown, with some financial leaders highlighting buying opportunities and others predicting more pain to come. Those looking to Buffett for bullish signs would be left wanting. Berkshire reduced its stock buybacks even as its shares saw their biggest quarterly decline in more than a decade, while the $6.1 billion of net equities sales in April far outstripped the $1.8 billion of net purchases in the year’s first three months.
“Historically, he’s been pretty visible in the marketplace, encouraging investors to take advantage of market downturns and being greedy when others are fearful,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “But if Buffett himself isn’t seeing opportunities, even in his own stock, what are we to think about the recent market selloff? Is it not a buying opportunity for long-term investors?”
Berkshire’s Class A shares have dropped about 19% this year through Friday’s close, worse than the 12% decline in the S&P 500 over the same time period.
Berkshire repurchased just $1.7 billion of its own stock, less than it did in the last three months of 2019. The company recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as airlines have been pummeled by travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders worldwide.
Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices. That has prompted a range of questions about whether he can continue the market-beating run that turned Berkshire into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
“He’s really careful about taking on risks that he can’t really ascertain, and I think that’s what’s happening now,” said Paul Lountzis, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Lountzis Asset Management.
The conglomerate’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by $55.5 billion in unrealized losses in the huge stock portfolio. Gains in the insurance unit’s investing portfolio helped push operating earnings up almost 6% to $5.87 billion.
Berkshire started to see the Covid-19 pandemic affect units including its railroad, BNSF, which reported a 5.2% decrease in volume in the first quarter. Precision Castparts, which makes products for industrial and energy companies, reported lower sales across all of its major markets, partially because of the pandemic and Boeing Co.’s 737 Max issues. The company’s footwear and apparel businesses were also hit, reporting a 34% decline in earnings.
The company said its essential businesses that have remained open saw revenue slow “considerably” in April, while many of those that had to close are being “severely impacted.” Berkshire didn’t record any goodwill impairments in the quarter, but said it may have to write down the value of some of its businesses at its next review in the fourth quarter. Still, the company called its liquidity and capital “extremely strong.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“Berkshire Hathaway should still produce solid earnings and remain a bastion of financial strength, but stark 1Q declines bode poorly for 2020 comparisons.”
— Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst
Buffett will host the annual meeting starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
Here are other details from Berkshire’s earnings report:
Berkshire’s businesses have implemented business-continuity plans to help weather the crisis and are “preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of Covid-19.”Some operations have had to furlough employees, reduce wages and salaries, or cut back on capital spending to help mitigate the losses, Berkshire said in the report. See’s Candies, which Buffett bought in 1972, announced in early April that it would furlough retail workers and said more recently that it was testing reopening a few stores.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett stays on sidelines with cash rising to $137bn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett has been waiting years for stocks to look more attractive. He apparently didn’t think the first-quarter plunge was that opportunity.As the coronavirus slowdown started to grip the U.S., the famed investor’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was building its massive cash pile to a record $137 billion by the end of March. The company said that figure climbed even higher as it dumped more than $6 billion of stocks in April, making Buffett a net seller of equities so far this year.
Buffett, who will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually later Saturday, has largely stayed in the shadows as the pandemic hammered the global economy and stock markets. That’s a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when his Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse. While Berkshire’s operating earnings climbed in the first quarter, Buffett warned of pain from the virus’s fallout.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” the company said in a regulatory filing Saturday.
The sharp drop in stocks sparked a debate over whether the slide was overblown, with some financial leaders highlighting buying opportunities and others predicting more pain to come. Those looking to Buffett for bullish signs would be left wanting. Berkshire reduced its stock buybacks even as its shares saw their biggest quarterly decline in more than a decade, while the $6.1 billion of net equities sales in April far outstripped the $1.8 billion of net purchases in the year’s first three months.
“Historically, he’s been pretty visible in the marketplace, encouraging investors to take advantage of market downturns and being greedy when others are fearful,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “But if Buffett himself isn’t seeing opportunities, even in his own stock, what are we to think about the recent market selloff? Is it not a buying opportunity for long-term investors?”
Berkshire’s Class A shares have dropped about 19% this year through Friday’s close, worse than the 12% decline in the S&P 500 over the same time period.
Berkshire repurchased just $1.7 billion of its own stock, less than it did in the last three months of 2019. The company recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as airlines have been pummeled by travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders worldwide.
Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices. That has prompted a range of questions about whether he can continue the market-beating run that turned Berkshire into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
“He’s really careful about taking on risks that he can’t really ascertain, and I think that’s what’s happening now,” said Paul Lountzis, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Lountzis Asset Management.
The conglomerate’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by $55.5 billion in unrealized losses in the huge stock portfolio. Gains in the insurance unit’s investing portfolio helped push operating earnings up almost 6% to $5.87 billion.
Berkshire started to see the Covid-19 pandemic affect units including its railroad, BNSF, which reported a 5.2% decrease in volume in the first quarter. Precision Castparts, which makes products for industrial and energy companies, reported lower sales across all of its major markets, partially because of the pandemic and Boeing Co.’s 737 Max issues. The company’s footwear and apparel businesses were also hit, reporting a 34% decline in earnings.
The company said its essential businesses that have remained open saw revenue slow “considerably” in April, while many of those that had to close are being “severely impacted.” Berkshire didn’t record any goodwill impairments in the quarter, but said it may have to write down the value of some of its businesses at its next review in the fourth quarter. Still, the company called its liquidity and capital “extremely strong.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence says
“Berkshire Hathaway should still produce solid earnings and remain a bastion of financial strength, but stark 1Q declines bode poorly for 2020 comparisons.”
– Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst
Buffett will host the annual meeting starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's firm plans online event after reporting US$50B loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, NEB. -- Warren Buffett is planning to lead an unusual annual meeting Saturday afternoon without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend, but the investor will offer some of the commentary that draws the huge crowds.
Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting will be livestreamed and will include an abbreviated version of the question-and-answer session Buffett normally leads. All of the surrounding events, including a trade show where Berkshire companies sell their products, were cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Buffett will have a different partner for the question session.
"It's going to be a strange annual meeting," said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker who wrote a Buffett biography and has attended every annual meeting since 1985.
Instead of sitting next to business partner Charlie Munger in an arena filled with shareholders, Buffett will be joined this year by Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who oversees all of the company's non-insurance businesses, to answer questions in front of a camera.
The two men likely will be asked about the nearly US$50 billion loss that Berkshire reported Saturday morning and the huge pile of cash the company is holding.
Berkshire said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That's down from last year's profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire's investments added $15.5 billion to the company's profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.
Berkshire's revenue grew 1 per cent to $61.27 billion. The company said revenue slowed considerably in April as the virus outbreak negatively affected most of its businesses. Berkshire closed several of its retail businesses, such as See's Candy and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, this spring while BNSF railroad and its insurance and utility businesses continued operating.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it was striking that Buffett didn't find any bargains to invest in at the end of the first quarter.
"The lack of investment activity really sticks out," Shanahan said.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slumps to $50bn loss in first quarter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway swung to a $49.7 billion (€44.8 billion) loss in the first three months of the year, as the sharp sell-off in global stock markets hammered its investment portfolio.
The sprawling industrial conglomerate disclosed on Saturday that its stock portfolio, which includes shares in blue-chip groups such as Apple and Bank of America, declined by $55.5 billion in value in the quarter alongside the 20 per cent drop in the S&P 500.
That decline more than offset the improvement in underlying earnings at Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See’s Candies. Operating profits rose 5.7 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9 billion, as investment gains from its insurance business climbed.
“The amount of investment gains [AND]losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in a statement.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled to a record $137 billion and the group shifted a large portion of that into US Treasuries in the first quarter, a filing with US regulators showed.
Mr Buffett has for more than four years struggled to invest that cash in one of the major acquisitions for which the company is known. The so-called Oracle of Omaha has blamed high equity valuations in previous letters to investors as one of the main reasons the company has remained on the sidelines, as other large publicly traded groups went on acquisition sprees in recent years.
Shares of Berkshire have fallen 19 per cent this year to $273,975.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stock market slide pushes Berkshire Hathaway to $50bn loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $49.7bn loss in the first three months of the year, as the sharp sell-off in global stock markets hammered its investment portfolio.
The sprawling conglomerate disclosed on Saturday that the decline in value of its stock and derivative portfolio, which includes shares in blue-chip groups such as Apple and Bank of America, generated a $55.6bn loss in the quarter. Multibillion-dollar mark-to-market losses in the quarter accompanied a 20 per cent drop in the S&P 500.
That decline more than offset the improvement in underlying earnings at Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See’s Candies. Operating profits rose 5.7 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9bn, as investment gains from its insurance business climbed.
“The amount of investment gains [and] losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in a statement.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled to a record $137bn and the group shifted a large portion of that into US Treasuries in the first quarter, a filing with US regulators showed.
Mr Buffett has for more than four years struggled to invest that cash in one of the major acquisitions for which the company is known. The so-called Oracle of Omaha has blamed high equity valuations in previous letters to investors as one of the main reasons the company has remained on the sidelines, as other large publicly traded groups went on acquisition sprees in recent years.
Berkshire instead purchased $1.7bn of its own common stock during the quarter, with much of that buying occurring in late-February and early-March as the price of its own shares were sliding alongside the broader market. But those purchases did not continue into the start of April, according to James Shanahan, an analyst who follows Berkshire at Edward Jones.
“If Buffett is not seeing opportunities in his own stock should we conclude the recent market sell-off isn’t a buying opportunity,” Mr Shanahan asked. “I don’t know what if anything is more important to ask Buffett today.”
The quarterly disclosure on Berkshire’s many subsidiaries showed only the early impact from the coronavirus outbreak, which is known to have killed more than 200,000 people and has sparked a severe economic downturn.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” Berkshire said.

The group’s BNSF railroad reported a 6 per cent decline in revenues in the period, led by a drop-off in shipments of consumer products. Sales at aerospace-parts manufacturer Precision Castparts slid as Boeing suspended the manufacturing of its 737-Max jet and shipments to covid-affected businesses declined. NetJets suffered from lower demand while Clayton Homes, which makes and sells mobile homes, increased its provisions for loan losses related to the virus.
Insurer Geico was one of the bright spots for the company, as shelter-in-place guidelines across the US led to a drop in auto-related claims.
Berkshire said it was taking measures to cut costs and that some of its business lines had furloughed employees and reduced staff salaries. Shares of Berkshire have fallen 19 per cent this year to $273,975.
Investors will get a fuller update from Mr Buffett later on Saturday through a live video-cast. The company, which remains among the most highly valued publicly traded groups in the world, cancelled the festivities that normally surround its annual meeting due to the health crisis.
The tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders who traditionally descend on downtown Omaha for the company’s annual meeting will instead hear his missives and those from Berkshire vice-chairman Greg Abel this year from their own homes.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $US6 billion worth of stocks in April,according to first-quarter earnings released on Saturday ahead of its annual meeting.
The famed investor’s conglomerate holds stakes in Apple, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and other companies. It was widely expected to capitalise on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap, but instead netted about $US6.1 billion from stock sales last month.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled from $US128 billion on December 31 to $US137 billion at the end of March, despite it spending $US1.7 billion on share buybacks in the period.
The group’s first-quarter figures fell short of the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Here are the key numbers:
Berkshire posted a net loss of $US49.7 billion last quarter, a sharp swing from its net earnings of $US21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The shift reflected $US54.5 billion in investment losses, compared to a $US15.5 billion gain in the same period last year.
However, Berkshire warned investors against reading too much into its earnings.
“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in its earnings release.
Berkshire’s operating earnings grew 6% to $US5.9 billion as insurance investment income and “other” earnings rose, offsetting lower insurance underwriting profits due to expected pandemic payouts and less income from its railroad, utilities and energy segment.
The conglomerate had $US113 billion invested in equity securities at the end of March, a slight increase from $US110 billion at the end of December. It raked in $US965 million in after-tax gains from sales of investments last quarter, a sharp increase from $US392 million in the comparable period.

Like many other companies, Berkshire warned that the coronavirus outbreak has “negatively affected” most of its businesses, with the effects ranging from “relatively minor to severe.”
Several of its businesses including railroads, utilities, and insurance have been deemed essential and allowed to continue operating, but their revenues “slowed considerably” in April. Other Berkshire companies including retailers, and some manufacturing and service businesses are being “severely impacted” by closures.
Berkshire added that the fallout will likely continue in the current quarter.
“The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March and will likely adversely affect nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly,” the company said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Says Lost $50 Bln in Q1 Due to COVID-19 Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Sputnik) - US business tycoon Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding has reported a loss of $55 billion in Q1 amid COVID-19 pandemic, compared to $21 billion in profits over the same period last year, the company said in a press release on Saturday.
The published financial statements say the conglomerate lost $49.7 billion in the first quarter. The holding's revenue in 2019 amounted to $254.6 billion.
Meanwhile, the company's operating profits were 6 percent higher than those of 2019, amounting to $5.87 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
Berkshire owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See's Candies.
The businesses were rocked in mid-April due to numerous restrictive measures and lockdowns, which halted many industries across the world.
According to the Johns Hopkins University count, the new coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 3,402,400 people and has claimed the lives of at least 242,000 worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 tally has surpassed 183,400, with over 28,200 fatalities, the university says.

“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in its earnings release.
Berkshire’s operating earnings grew 6% to $5.9 billion as insurance investment income and “other” earnings rose, offsetting lower insurance underwriting profits due to expected pandemic payouts and less income from its railroad, utilities and energy segment.
The conglomerate had $113 billion invested in equity securities at the end of March, a slight increase from $110 billion at the end of December. It raked in $965 million in after-tax gains from sales of investments last quarter, a sharp increase from $392 million in the comparable period.

Like many other companies, Berkshire warned that the coronavirus outbreak has “negatively affected” most of its businesses, with the effects ranging from “relatively minor to severe.”
Several of its businesses including railroads, utilities, and insurance have been deemed essential and allowed to continue operating, but their revenues “slowed considerably” in April. Other Berkshire companies including retailers, and some manufacturing and service businesses are being “severely impacted” by closures.
Berkshire added that the fallout will likely continue in the current quarter.
“The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March and will likely adversely affect nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly,” the company said.

Dubai: Malls in the United Arab Emirates' capital Abu Dhabi began reopening to a restricted number of customers this weekend as the UAE eases lockdown measures imposed more than a month ago to combat the novel coronavirus. Three Abu Dhabi malls reopened on Saturday at 30% customer capacity after adopting safety measures, including installing thermal inspection devices, the government media office tweeted and Sharjah emirate said it would reopen malls on Sunday.
Malls, dine-in restaurants and cafes in Dubai, the UAE's business and tourism hub, had earlier resumed operations with limited capacity. Shoppers must wear face masks and gloves and keep their distance. Sharjah emirate's media office said malls, salons and dine-in restaurants could resume operations on Sunday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stores, schools and regions reopen gradually in Quebec</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL -- After seven weeks of shutdowns and closures, Quebec has begun to gradually restart and reopen economic, educational and social activities across the province.
Essential services remained open throughout the pandemic with construction, mining and landscaping added to the list in mid-April.
Starting Monday, the Quebec government is lifting restrictions on a number of sectors of the province.
Monday, May 4
Schools, daycare services and educational childcare services are open for staff to prepare for reopenings.
Retail stores with an exterior entrance (not shopping malls) can resume activities except those in the Communaute metropolitaine de Montreal (CMM), which can open a week later. Supply chain businesses for these retailers can also resume activities.
Cottage country will begin to reopen and travel restrictions will be removed. Checkpoints have been lifted in regions for non-local traffic. For a full list of territories where access is now granted, visit the government of Quebec’s website.
Monday, May 11
Preschools and elementary schools in “cold” regions, with the exception of those in Montreal, will be gradually reopened.
Non-subsidized daycares, recognized and non-recognized family daycare centres will be reopened except for those in the MMC.
Montreal retailers with an exterior entrance can reopen.
All construction industry (residential, civil engineering and roads, institutional, commercial and industrial) worksites can resume work, as can their supply chains.
The construction administrative sector, however, must continue teleworking.
Manufacturing companies in all regions of Quebec can resume work with a limited staff. A maximum of 50 workers, and 50 per cent of the employees exceeding the 50-worker limit is permitted. For example, a manufacturer who employs 60 workers per shift regularly can operate with a maximum of 55 employees.
Checkpoints will be lifted with access permitted in Outaouais except for trips from Ottawa to Gatineau, and access to the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Abitibi-Temiscamingue regions will be permitted. The La Tuque populations centre for the Mauricie and Centre-du-Quebec regions is also opened.

Checkpoints will be lifted to access the Bas-Saint Laurent, Gaspesie-Iles-de-la-Madeleine and Cote Nord regions except for the Minganie and Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent MRCs. Charlevoix and Charlevoix East will be reopened.
Tuesday, May 19
Montreal preschools and elementary schools will be reopened.
Childcare services in Montreal will reopen if the situation allows.
Monday, May 25
Restrictions on number of employees in the manufacturing sector will be lifted, and full operations may resume.
Though activites are permitted to resume, compliance with physical distancing measures must be maintained with handshakes, hugs and double kisses to be avoided.
The government is asking all employees who can telework to continue to do so. 
Those employers looking for assistance properly equipping staff and workplaces with preventative measures can visit CNESST's website which includes toolkits and guides to preventing COVID-19 spread.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Public transport unlikely to run from Monday in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM: Both Vizianagaram and Srikakulam district administrations made it clear that COVID-19 protocol would be in force even if a few relaxations are given from May 4. Social distancing, wearing masks and other rules would continue to be inforce in the two districts.
Senior officials indicated that inter-district movement and public transport system within the districts would not be allowed to prevent spread of Coronavirus. Currently, Vizinagaram is under Green Zone with no COVID-19 cases reported, and Srikakulam has come under Orange Zone with five positive cases. Officials fear that both districts would turn into Red Zones within no time if public transport is allowed.
As per the Union government rules and regulations with regard to lock down-3, many relaxations such as opening of shops and public transport are indicated. However, the Union government has allowed State governments to frame its own set of guidelines. So, the State government has allowed District Collectors to take a decision independently after observing the local conditions.
Speaking to The Hindu, Srikakulam District Collector J.Nivas hinted that public transport would not be allowed although the APSRTC was making its own arrangements. “People, including migrated labourers who are stranded in other districts and States would be allowed into Srikakulam district. That is also being done only with the prior correspondence between the Joint Collectors of the respective districts,” he said.
Vizianagaram Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal told The Hindu that people’s unnecessary movement would not allowed from Monday when lock down-3 rules would come into force. “We will take up awareness programmes through digital media platforms to highlight the importance of personal hygiene and importance of immunity. COVID-19 continues to pose danger to the people if they ignore its protocol,” he said.
Moreover , people have to download Arogya Setu app on their personal mobiles and follow the rules and regulations to protect themselves from Coronavirus. “They should not move out of home without any valid reason. This is the only option to control the spread of COVID-19 in Vizianagaram district,” Mr. Jawaharlal added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(This May 2 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of “towel” in second paragraph)
By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O).
Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co (AXP.N), to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett: 'American magic' will spur US economic recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said on Saturday (May 2) he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed".
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly US$50 billion.
Buffett also announced on Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 per cent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid US$7 billion to US$8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that", he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for US$25 billion in relief funds.
"AMERICAN MIRACLES, AMERICAN MAGIC"
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem - in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again."
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789 ... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of US$72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists".
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
GROWTH BY ONE MEASURE
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to US$5.9 billion from US$5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net - to a loss of US$49.75 billion from a profit last year of US$21.7 billion - resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha". Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on Aug 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies - including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses - are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary", it said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">
Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, arrives at the May 2019 shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. AFP/File/Johannes EISELE
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world’s largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
“It turns out I was wrong,” he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and “we did not take out anything like that,” he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, “the airlines business I think changed in a very major way” and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett’s announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
‘American miracles, American magic’ 
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback “temporary” but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
“We’ve faced great problems in the past, haven’t faced this exact problem — in fact we haven’t really faced anything that quite resembles this problem,” Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country’s economic history.
“But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again.”
“We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789… We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction,” he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women’s suffrage.
“Never bet against America.”
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company’s annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a “Woodstock for capitalists.”
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway’s wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Growth by one measure 
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company’s bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company’s performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net — to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion — resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated “Oracle of Omaha.” Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting “comparative revenue and earnings increases” over the same 2019 period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'American magic' will spur US economic recovery: Warren Buffett</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed."
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
- 'American miracles, American magic' - Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again."
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
- Growth by one measure - Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's Berkshire posts nearly $50 billion loss as coronavirus causes pain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing “relatively minor to severe” negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed “essential.”
The BNSF railroad saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See’s Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Buffett also allowed Berkshire’s cash stake to rise to a record $137.3 billion from $128 billion at the end of 2019.
That reflected the 89-year-old billionaire’s inability to make large, “elephant” size acquisitions for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, and caution in buying stocks.
Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock, but that was less than in the prior quarter.
“Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn’t see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.
Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is “as well positioned as it can be,” reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire “buy.”
Berkshire released results before its annual meeting, where Buffett said Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest U.S. airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.
Buffett said Berkshire “made a mistake” investing approximately $7 billion to $8 billion in the sector, which was changed “in a very major way” as the pandemic shut down most air travel, through no fault of the airlines.
The meeting was streamed on Yahoo Finance. It was held without the usual “Woodstock for Capitalists,” a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, and which Buffett canceled because of the pandemic.
Berkshire’s first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire’s businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500, despite Buffett’s prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire’s stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the four airlines.
Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's Berkshire posts nearly $50 bln loss as coronavirus causes pain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing "relatively minor to severe" negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed "essential."
The BNSF railroad saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See's Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3 billion from $128 billion at the end of 2019.
That reflected the 89-year-old billionaire's inability to make large, "elephant" size acquisitions for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, and caution in buying stocks.
Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter, and sold a net $6.1 billion in April. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, but that was less than the prior quarter.
"Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn't see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.
Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is "as well positioned as it can be," reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire "buy."
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel will likely discuss the pandemic at Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday afternoon, which will be streamed on Yahoo Finance.
The pandemic forced Buffett to cancel "Woodstock for Capitalists," a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha.
 
Berkshire Stock Underperforms
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire's businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders.
Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, despite Buffett's prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire's stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and four US airlines.
Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire, whose stock price lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
While Buffett has said Berkshire's own stock would outperform in down markets, it hasn't this year. Through Friday, its shares were down 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500.
U.S. gross domestic product fell at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the Department of Commerce said this week in its advance estimate of economic growth.

Many economists expect a large double-digit percentage drop in GDP the second quarter. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
The S&P 500 slid 20% in the first quarter, but many of Berkshire's common stock investments fared worse, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and four airlines -- American, Delta, Southwest and United.
Berkshire was not a large net buyer of equities in the quarter, purchasing $4 billion and selling $2.2 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Japan indicates could ease some coronavirus-related curbs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan could ease some of the current coronavirus-related curbs on economic activity by allowing places such as parks and museums to reopen, provided proper preventive measures were in place, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Sunday.
The remarks come a day before the government is set to announce the extension of its state of emergency after struggling to suppress the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected 15,589 people and killed 530 in the country.
“As long as the proper preventive measures are in place, it could be possible to ease some of the current restrictions on economic activities,” Nishimura said at a news conference held on Sunday morning.
Places like parks, museums, art galleries, and libraries could reopen even in the 13 prefectures where the coronavirus has spread rapidly, if they take steps to disinfect their premises and ensure visitors maintain their distance, he added.
Further details on how restrictions might be eased would be discussed at an expert’s meeting on Monday, Nishimura said.
The government-issued state of emergency in Japan is set to expire on Wednesday, the last day of a week-long national holiday. The government is preparing to extend the state of emergency for another month.
Under the state of emergency, the government has asked people to stay at home, avoid unnecessary outings, and refrain from going to crowded areas.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK lockdown must not be lifted until Covid-19 transmission is understood, say scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British scientists are racing to try to answer fundamental questions about the Covid-19 virus and its transmission before the lifting of the current national lockdown is approved by the government in the near future. Researchers say relaxing social distancing should occur only once it is understood why new infections of the disease are still being diagnosed in their thousands every day.
Such a rate means efforts to test and trace infected contacts – a key plank in the government’s anti-Covid strategy in coming months – would be quickly overwhelmed. Far more information is needed about the way the coronavirus is transmitted, they say. The new data will feed into the debate about the settings in which lockdown will be lifted first – for instance, whether it’s relatively safe to stage outdoor events.
And last week, several groups launched studies aimed at providing answers. These include projects to analyse how virus-laden aerosols behave in the air in a bid to understand how the disease is passed between humans. In addition, other schemes will target healthcare workers to investigate how the virus is being spread to them from patients and then on to others.
The importance of this latter approach was revealed in recent figures for cases of Covid-19 which have shown a drop in numbers of new cases in hospitals but reveal significant rises among health and social care workers.
This point was stressed by epidemiologist Anne Johnson at University College London. She said cutting transmissions of Covid-19 to health and social care workers had now emerged as a major priority. “Half of all new infections reported last week were among healthcare workers,” she told the Observer. “This has now become the leading edge of the spread of the disease.”
Lack of protective equipment and clothing may have worsened the situation, she added. “However, what is certain is that care workers are still at risk from their patients from whom they can pick up the virus and, in turn, pass it on to their colleagues, to their own families and possibly to other patients. We need to focus on limiting the spread of Covid-19 among health and social care workers as an absolute priority if we want to have a chance of bringing this epidemic to a halt.”
This view was backed by infectious diseases expert Tom Wingfield of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “The numbers show that the rate of decline of new cases is slower in the UK than other European countries and that is likely to be down to transmission occurring within health and social care settings, transmission in the community despite social distancing and, to a lesser extent, chains of transmission that are still occurring within households, especially in larger households or shared accommodation.”
Last week, researchers at Bristol University launched a major study aimed at finding out precisely how health workers are being infected by the Covid-19 virus. “We have taken a group of 130 health workers and we are going to test them intensively over the next three months,” said Professor Adam Finn, the leader of the project.
“We will take swabs from them twice a week, take blood samples regularly, and catalogue their symptoms – in the expectation that some of them will become infected. Then we will be able to find out when they became infected; how that relates to their symptoms at the time; and how it relates to their immune response. We are going to uncover details of the disease’s natural history because none of this information is known in detail. On the other hand, it is vitally important if we are to understand how this disease behaves.”
Finn said current modelling of the disease – although superb – was based on assumptions. “Essentially, the models are guesswork about the way the virus behaves. To get rid of the guesswork we need to supply evidence about how the virus actually behaves.”
A different approach is being taken by another Bristol University group, led by chemist, Professor Jonathan Reid. His team is studying the way the Covid-19 virus is passed from one person to another. This happens when fairly large droplets are coughed up or sneezed out by infected people. However, it is also possible viruses may be spread by much smaller aerosol particles – although it is unclear if they can carry enough virus to be infectious.
“It is clearly important to find out because aerosols can travel much further than heavier droplets,” said Reid. His team has just constructed a high-containment, automated laboratory containing a device in which clouds of virus-laden aerosol particles can be suspended while researchers alter temperature, humidity, ozone, levels of sunlight and other variables.
“In this way we can study how the virus’s infectivity changes,” added Reid. “That might tell us if it is affected by heat. If it is there might be some seasonality to this epidemic. We could also get a better idea of how to run air conditioning in hospitals, care homes and public spaces – in terms of temperature or humidity – in order to reduce the lifetime of the virus so that exposure to it is reduced.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week:
AIR CANADA EARNINGS
Air Canada will hold a conference call to discuss its first-quarter results on Monday. The airline announced on April 8 that it planned to rehire 16,500 laid-off workers via Ottawa's emergency wage subsidy, though the vast majority would remain at home amid the collapse of global travel triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
LATEST FROM THE OILPATCH
Thursday is a big earnings day in the oilpatch, with results expected from Enbridge, Canadian Natural Resources, Inter Pipeline, Pembina Pipeline and more. Results last week from Husky Energy, Cenovus, Imperial Oil and Precision Drilling portrayed an industry in crisis amid plummeting demand and sinking oil prices.
SHOPIFY UPDATE
Shopify Inc. will release its first-quarter results and hold a conference call with financial analysts on Wednesday. The Ottawa-based technology company recently began offering interest-free cash advances to help companies that use its e-commerce products cope with the impacts of COVID-19. The initiative is meant to provide fast relief to cash-strapped businesses without having to take on debt.
BCE EARNINGS
BCE Inc. will release its results Thursday. Rival Rogers Communications recently revealed that it felt the first financial bite from the COVID-19 pandemic during the tail end of its first quarter and senior executives said they expect conditions will get worse in months to come.
APRIL JOB NUMBERS
Statistics Canada will release the findings of its labour force survey for April on Friday. More than one million Canadians lost their jobs at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March, pushing the national unemployment rate up 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent, the highest it has been since October 2010. Economists are expecting the April numbers to be even worse, with up to three million jobs lost.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bowler hat that featured in Bond film Goldfinger valued at £30k on the Antiques Roadshow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The iconic bowler hat from the James Bond film Goldfinger has been valued at up to £30,000 on the Antiques Roadshow.
The steel-rimmed hat and weapon belonged to hitman Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata, in the 1964 film.
The Bond item was part of a collection of 007 memorabilia brought to Antiques Roadshow when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
The owner said he was a big 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia.
The studio gave him Oddjob's bowler hat but removed the metal rim.
"As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it's absolutely in pieces because it didn't have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it," the owner said.
It was previously revealed that the hat appears on the BBC One show, leaving Roadshow expert Marc Allum "shaking with anticipation and excitement."
A signed clapperboard for the new James Bond film went under the hammer in April.
The piece of No Time To Die memorabilia – which was signed by stars including Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas – raised £13,000 for the NHS.
The item was one of 61 lots sold by the Bonhams auction house in aid of the NHS Charities Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fast-food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell are betting traumatized Americans will flock to familiarity as restaurants reopen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As states reopen for business during the coronavirus pandemic, fast-food giants are betting Americans seeking comfort will flock to old favorites. 
Executives of chains, including McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, and Checkers and Rally's, have all said that customers' desire for normalcy and familiarity will help boost sales as restaurants recover. 
David Gibbs, the CEO of Yum Brands, said on Wednesday that the company's chains — which include Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell — stand out for their "convenience and normalcy, all of which are highly sought out in these uncertain times and beyond." 
Frances Allen, the CEO of Checkers and Rally's, told Business Insider in a webinar that she expects people are going to want to return to comfort food and comfort brands.
"There is going to be this cocooning going on, a sort of a relief that we survived, but at the same time, wanting to embrace the things that give them comfort," Allen said. "And there's nothing like burgers and fries as comfort food. From a selfish point of view, we're also excited to be able to lean back into that."
McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with investors on Thursday that familiar brands thrived in grocery stores as people stayed home. Earlier in the week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company was seeing impressive sales from large brands that customers trust. 
"I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands," Kempczinski said Thursday. 
Fast-food companies, including McDonald's, Yum Brands, and Restaurant Brands International, that reported earnings this week said that sales are beginning to recover after plummeting in late March. Drive-thru business helped chains outperform the rest of the struggling restaurant business as customers sheltered-in-place across the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This chart shows just how many jobs can be done from home in other countries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A lot of people find themselves working from home during the novel coronavirus. However, not every job can be done remotely, and the number further varies by country.  
A recent report by Jonathan I. Dingel and Brent Neiman from The University of Chicago analyzed the share of jobs that can be done at home in different countries. This builds off their previous research of which US cities have the highest share of occupations that can be done at home.
To find the percentage of jobs that can be done at home around the world, Dingel and Neiman mapped the Standard Occupational Classification system from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to the International Labour Organization's International Standard Classification of Occupations. The researchers found these two codes didn't always map to one unique code, so they adjusted by a weighted average for each country.
LoadingSomething is loading.
It is important to note their classification of telework jobs was based on their US classification from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The researchers wrote "the nature of an occupation likely varies across economies with different income levels."
Their results show that the lower a country's GDP per capita, the lower the share of jobs that can be done at home. The researchers note in the paper this means "developing economies and emerging markets may face an even greater challenge in continuing to work during periods of stringent social distancing."
The following chart shows the share of jobs that can be done in 12 countries with the highest GDP per capita. Of these countries, Luxembourg had the highest share of jobs that can potentially be done at home at 53.4%. That is 11.8 percentage points higher than the share of jobs that can be done at home in the US, 41.6%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This chart shows just how many jobs can be done from home in other countries, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A lot of people find themselves working from home during the novel coronavirus. However, not every job can be done remotely, and the number further varies by country.
A recent report by Jonathan I. Dingel and Brent Neiman from The University of Chicago analyzed the share of jobs that can be done at home in different countries. This builds off their previous research of which US cities have the highest share of occupations that can be done at home.
To find the percentage of jobs that can be done at home around the world, Dingel and Neiman mapped the Standard Occupational Classification system from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to the International Labour Organization’s International Standard Classification of Occupations. The researchers found these two codes didn’t always map to one unique code, so they adjusted by a weighted average for each country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘World has changed,' Buffett says, as Berkshire sells all holdings in largest U.S. airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting, saying “the world has changed” for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11-per-cent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 per cent of American Airlines Co., 10 per cent of Southwest Airlines Co. and 9 per cent of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near-collapse of U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and parking thousands of planes. U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95 per cent and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at precrisis levels.
Mr. Buffett said the airline industry’s outlook changed rapidly.
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,” Mr. Buffett said. “We will not fund a company ... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.”
Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18 per cent of its Delta stake and 4 per cent of its Southwest shares.
Mr. Buffett said Berkshire had invested between US$7-billion and US$8-billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7- or $8-billion and that was my mistake,” Mr. Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
Southwest, American and United declined comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has “tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team.” The airline added it remains “confident that the strengths that are core to Delta’s business – our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability – will endure and position Delta to succeed.”
Mr. Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up ... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Mr. Buffett added.
Mr. Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down,” Mr. Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. “Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells entire stake in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sold its stakes in the four largest U.S. airline companies, Warren Buffett, the owner of the conglomerate holding company, told shareholders on Saturday. 
Berkshire Hathaway held an 11 percent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 percent of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, and 9 percent of United Airlines, making it one of the largest holders in those companies, according to Reuters. The company had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion in the four companies, Buffett said. 
Citing the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and what it's done to demand for air travel, Buffett said that he decided to sell those stakes because he concluded he'd made a "mistake in valuing." 
"We took money out of the business, basically, even at a substantial loss," Buffett said. "We will not fund a company ... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
"The airline business — and I may be wrong, and I hope I'm wrong — I think it changed in a very major way, and it's obviously changed in the fact that their four companies are each going to borrow perhaps average of at least $10 [billion] or $12 billion each," he added. 
Airlines around the world have experienced a substantial financial hit in recent months as planes stay grounded due to a rapid drop in demand. American Airlines reported a first-quarter net loss of $2.2 billion. United Airlines said its net loss was $1.7 billion. 
Buffett's holding company also reported a loss of nearly $50 billion during the first quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He expressed optimism about the U.S.'s ability to recover economically during the shareholder meeting, saying, "The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed, and it will do so again."
At the same time, he voiced concerns about the U.S. airline industry and its ability to recover to pre-pandemic levels. 
"I don't know whether two or three years from now that as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did," he said. 
The Trump administration and the major U.S. airlines reached an agreement last month on a $25 billion bailout to help companies weather a sudden drop in revenue. The program, which was created as part of the coronavirus stimulus package signed by President Trump in March, is intended to help the airlines pay staff.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett announces Berkshire's decision to sell entire stake in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc sold its entire stakes in the four largest US airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company's annual meeting, saying "the world has changed" for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11 per cent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 per cent of American Airlines Co, 10 per cent of Southwest Airlines Co and 9 per cent of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse US travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
US airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights, parking thousands of planes as US travel demand has fallen by about 95 per cent and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at pre-crisis levels. Buffett said the airline industry's outlook rapidly changed.
"We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss," Buffett said. "We will not fund a company that - where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18 per cent of its Delta stake and 4 per cent of its Southwest shares. Buffett said Berkshire had invested around USD 7 billion or USD 8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
"We did not take out anything like USD 7 or USD 8 billion and that was my mistake," Buffett said at the company's annual meeting which was live-streamed. "I am the one who made the decision."
Southwest, American and United declined to comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has "tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team." The airline added it remains "confident that the strengths that are core to Delta's business - our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability - will endure and position Delta to succeed."
Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
"It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," Buffett added.
Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in US Air in 1989.
"If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down," Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. "Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it."

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (N:BRKa) sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company's annual meeting, saying "the world has changed" for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), 10% of American Airlines Co (O:AAL), 10% of Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and 9% of United Airlines (O:UAL) at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway reports record quarterly loss thanks to pandemic, but Warren Buffett likely isn't too worried</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway took a hit during the coronavirus pandemic, reporting a record net loss of $49.75 billion in the first quarter. But CEO Warren Buffett likely isn't too concerned, CNBC reports.
That's because Buffett considers the company's operating profit, which actually rose 6 percent in the first quarter, to be a better performance measure. Berkshire's losses mainly reflect losses from investments in common stocks, which the company had loaded up on recently because Buffett hasn't been able to settle on any large companies to buy outright over the last four years. Some of those stocks include four major airlines — American, Delta, Southwest, and United — which have plummeted due to the decline in travel.
While the net loss was record-setting for Berkshire, Buffett is never immune to swings like this since an accounting rule requires the company to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. That leads to booms and busts that the CEO considers meaningless, per CNBC.
Still, many of Berkshire's operating businesses were indeed hurt by the pandemic, and revenues deemed "essential" slowed "considerably" in April. Read more at CNBC.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pot Job Seekers Surge as Sector Is Still Hiring: Cannabis Weekly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unlike many industries, the cannabis sector is still hiring during the pandemic. Yet the number of open positions has dwindled as layoffs become more common and many of the jobs that do exist are temporary.
Vangst, which runs the Gigs site for temporary pot jobs and recently launched a platform for full-time positions, is filling about 600 jobs a week. That’s a slight decrease from pre-Covid 19 levels earlier this year, mostly because companies are employing fewer in-store staff as they switch to delivery or curbside pickup. Meanwhile, the number of job candidates on the platform surged by 300% between March and April, according to Karson Humiston, founder and chief executive officer of Vangst.
“We’ve seen a huge uptick in candidates, and we’re seeing a large number of candidates coming from hospitality and retail,” Humiston said in a phone interview. “When our clients do pick up hiring again, they’re going to have access to a really strong talent pool.”
Of the temporary jobs that are being filled on Vangst’s Gigs platform, about half are replacements for employees who are unable to work and the other half are for normal seasonal work related to harvests or packaging, she said.
The cannabis sector employed 243,700 people at the beginning of 2020, up 15% from the prior year and nearly double the number of jobs in 2017, according to data from cannabis information firm Leafly. However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.
Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it’s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about 5% of its total workforce. That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.
“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then Covid-19 came and exacerbated it.”
Not everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.
The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call center volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.
At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.
Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.
“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.

Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.
Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.
“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. processes over $500 billion in small business loans to stem coronavirus fallout</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - The United States has made over $500 billion in loans to small businesses hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, and about $145 billion remains in the congressionally approved fund, the U.S. Small Business Administration and Treasury Department said Sunday.
The SBA has processed about 2.2 million loans worth more than $175 billion since Congress last month authorized more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, part of almost $3 trillion in spending to fight the heavy economic toll of the pandemic, which has thrown about 30 million Americans out of work.
The second round of funding was launched on Monday, allowing lenders to issue forgivable, government-guaranteed loans to small businesses shuttered by the outbreak.
The average loan size in the second round of the PPP loan processing has been $79,000, according to the statement released on Sunday.
The U.S. government’s $660 billion small business rescue program has stumbled on missing paperwork, technology failure, and the misdirection of funds to big corporations. It also faces the hurdle of forgiving those hastily arranged loans.
The latest data released by the government does not address complaints around the transparency of the program. For example, it not include a breakdown of industries that have received loans.
The pandemic, which has killed more than 66,000 people in the United States, has shuttered wide swaths of American life, closing many businesses and schools and leaving hundreds of millions largely sheltering at home. Over the past week some U.S. states have begun to allow some businesses to reopen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NY Health Dept. probing over 2,500 nursing home complaints amid coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The state is investigating more than 2,500 nursing home complaints launched while the coronavirus has run roughshod over the facilities, the Health Department revealed Friday — as Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened to prosecute homes that under-report COVID-19 tolls.
The State Health Department said it opened 2,502 complaints about nursing homes, including 514 in New York City, from March 1-April 28. 
Complaint volume during that time increased about 62%, from an average of 26 per day in the four years prior, up to 42.
The agency refused to divulge details of the complaints, but said it has not revoked any homes’ licenses since March 1. 
Cuomo threatened the penalty, along with $10,000 fines, to nursing homes who violate executive orders related to the pandemic, including requirements to report deaths and cases to the state. He has also urged loved ones of nursing home residents to blow the whistle on violators. 
Many nursing homes deaths are left off the state’s publicly available list of facilities with COVID-19 fatalities.
Among them is the Isabella Geriatric Center in Washington Heights, where 98 have reportedly died. The state database lists 13 deaths. 
The Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn, where there have been more than 50 deaths, has been the subject of 94 complaints in the past four years. It’s unclear how many of them were filed during the pandemic.
Cuomo turned up his nursing home rhetoric when the toll at Isabella was revealed Friday. 
“They submit those numbers under penalty of perjury. You violate, you commit fraud. That is a criminal offense. Period,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil's Recovery Could Take Decades, Not Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Who knows what the new normal for oil demand will be once Covid-19 is firmly in the rear view mirror? Not me, that's for sure. But it is likely to be lower than it was in 2019, and it could be that way for many years. That’s going to create overcapacity throughout the oil supply chain and weigh on prices.
While signs are emerging that we might have passed the worst of this historic oil demand rout, they’re very tentative. No one is predicting a swift recovery to where we were before the pandemic struck. Some, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s chief executive officer, Ben van Beurden, suggest that oil demand may never recover fully.
Citigroup analysts don’t see jet fuel consumption back at last year’s level until well into 2022, and they’re at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Boeing’s CEO suggests passenger traffic might not get back to 2019 levels for three years, and even when the flying public does return, airlines will use their newest and most efficient planes to carry them, as my colleagues Liam Denning and Brooke Sutherland note here.
So let’s make a guess about the loss in future demand, and let’s make a fairly small one. Let’s assume it’s about 5 million barrels a day. That doesn’t sound like too much; it’s about 5% of last year’s global oil demand. The drop in worldwide oil consumption in April has been put as high as 35 million barrels a day, and forecasts estimate 2020 oil use will be about 10 million barrels a day (or 10%) lower than in 2019.
Sure, many of us will return to our pre-Covid-19 ways of life just as quickly as we can, but others will gladly give up the daily commute in favor of working from home more often — and employers may be happy to accommodate their wishes. After months of successful teleconferencing, those business trips that helped keep planes full of high-paying travelers may also come under more scrutiny. These changes may push up electricity use while they dampen fuel demand, but that will do little to help the oil industry, which is increasingly struggling to hold onto its fragments of the power-generation sector.
Of course, we could collectively shrug off this latest crisis, just as we did the financial crash of 2008-09, which was consigned to history with barely a backward glance. But the global pandemic feels very different from the financial crisis. It hits at our physical well-being as well as our financial health, and it has forced us all, to one degree or another, to adopt new ways of living and working, whether we like them or not. 
The industry can survive a 5% drop in long-term demand, but it will find it much harder to thrive.
A loss like that will cause structural overcapacity, right through the oil supply chain. There will be too many wells to get oil out of the ground, too many ships to move it, too many refineries to process it.
Even before the pandemic, we were looking at a world where oil demand growth was increasingly concentrated in plastics, rather than fuels. That was already darkening the outlook for refiners in Europe and North America, which were also facing growing competition from newer plants in the Middle East and Asia that were more efficient and had beneficial long-term oil supply deals. A prolonged drop in demand will only make that competition stiffer, as more plants seek markets for their excess products.
The upstream part of the business — the bit that’s concerned with finding the crude and getting it out of the ground — may face fewer problems. Oil fields naturally go into decline once they’re brought into operation, requiring producers to create new capacity elsewhere. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the U.S. shale patch.
But the second U.S. shale boom was driven by, among other things, several years of robust growth in global oil demand. This led to most of the world’s oil producers, including almost all of the OPEC countries, pumping as hard as they could, and helped to keep oil prices at around $50 a barrel.
But those OPEC producers are now cutting production by more than 20%, and non-OPEC countries are seeing their output fall by similar percentages. True, some of the wells that get shut will never be reopened, but most will sit waiting for their owners to see an opportunity to get them back to work. That overhang of spare production capacity will put an effective cap on oil prices, just as it did throughout the 1990s.
No amount of Saudi-led supply management, or U.S. presidential bullying of foreign oil producers, will be able to remove that spare capacity. And once the current crisis is past, Riyadh may be less willing to play the role of swing producer, restraining its output while everybody else reopens the taps.
Every time oil prices rise, producers will rush to use their idled capacity, undermining the recovery. After the oil-price slump of the mid-1980s, it took two decades for prices to return to their previous levels — longer if you build in the effects of inflation. This time the wait could be even more protracted.

But it is likely to be lower than it was in 2019, and it could be that way for many years. That’s going to create overcapacity throughout the oil supply chain and weigh on prices.
While signs are emerging that we might have passed the worst of this historic oil demand rout, they’re very tentative. No one is predicting a swift recovery to where we were before the pandemic struck. Some, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s chief executive officer, Ben van Beurden, suggest that oil demand may never recover fully.
Citigroup analysts don’t see jet fuel consumption back at last year’s level until well into 2022, and they’re at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Boeing’s CEO suggests passenger traffic might not get back to 2019 levels for three years, and even when the flying public does return, airlines will use their newest and most efficient planes to carry them, as my colleagues Liam Denning and Brooke Sutherland note here.
So let’s make a guess about the loss in future demand, and let’s make a fairly small one. Let’s assume it’s about 5 million barrels a day. That doesn’t sound like too much; it’s about 5% of last year’s global oil demand. The drop in worldwide oil consumption in April has been put as high as 35 million barrels a day, and forecasts estimate 2020 oil use will be about 10 million barrels a day (or 10%) lower than in 2019.
Sure, many of us will return to our pre-Covid-19 ways of life just as quickly as we can, but others will gladly give up the daily commute in favor of working from home more often — and employers may be happy to accommodate their wishes. After months of successful teleconferencing, those business trips that helped keep planes full of high-paying travelers may also come under more scrutiny. These changes may push up electricity use while they dampen fuel demand, but that will do little to help the oil industry, which is increasingly struggling to hold onto its fragments of the power-generation sector.
Of course, we could collectively shrug off this latest crisis, just as we did the financial crash of 2008-09, which was consigned to history with barely a backward glance. But the global pandemic feels very different from the financial crisis. It hits at our physical well-being as well as our financial health, and it has forced us all, to one degree or another, to adopt new ways of living and working, whether we like them or not.
The industry can survive a 5% drop in long-term demand, but it will find it much harder to thrive.
A loss like that will cause structural overcapacity, right through the oil supply chain. There will be too many wells to get oil out of the ground, too many ships to move it, too many refineries to process it.
Even before the pandemic, we were looking at a world where oil demand growth was increasingly concentrated in plastics, rather than fuels. That was already darkening the outlook for refiners in Europe and North America, which were also facing growing competition from newer plants in the Middle East and Asia that were more efficient and had beneficial long-term oil supply deals. A prolonged drop in demand will only make that competition stiffer, as more plants seek markets for their excess products.
The upstream part of the business — the bit that’s concerned with finding the crude and getting it out of the ground — may face fewer problems. Oil fields naturally go into decline once they’re brought into operation, requiring producers to create new capacity elsewhere. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the U.S. shale patch.
But the second U.S. shale boom was driven by, among other things, several years of robust growth in global oil demand. This led to most of the world’s oil producers, including almost all of the OPEC countries, pumping as hard as they could, and helped to keep oil prices at around $50 a barrel.
But those OPEC producers are now cutting production by more than 20%, and non-OPEC countries are seeing their output fall by similar percentages. True, some of the wells that get shut will never be reopened, but most will sit waiting for their owners to see an opportunity to get them back to work. That overhang of spare production capacity will put an effective cap on oil prices, just as it did throughout the 1990s.
No amount of Saudi-led supply management, or U.S. presidential bullying of foreign oil producers, will be able to remove that spare capacity. And once the current crisis is past, Riyadh may be less willing to play the role of swing producer, restraining its output while everybody else reopens the taps.
Every time oil prices rise, producers will rush to use their idled capacity, undermining the recovery. After the oil-price slump of the mid-1980s, it took two decades for prices to return to their previous levels — longer if you build in the effects of inflation. This time the wait could be even more protracted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bajaj Auto Exports 1.8 Million 2-Wheelers Last Fiscal From India</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the Financial Year 2020, the exports in the two-wheeler industry grew by an appreciable 7.3 per cent when compared to the same period the previous FY. The Indian motorcycle and scooter manufacturers had endured a troublesome tenure in FY2020 in the domestic market with YoY negative sales growth being prevalent almost everywhere. However, it was a whole different story on the export side.
The two-wheelers produced in India are mainly shipped to LATAM and African markets and Bajaj’s expertise in grabbing hold of such marketplaces has been evident in its sales tally. So much that the Chakan-based brand’s volumes had attributed to more than 53 per cent of the total exports from Indian production facilities.
Bajaj and TVS had contributed to nearly three-fourth of the total exports last FY. Bajaj posted a total of 18,69,220 units as against 16,95,553 units with YoY growth of 10.2 per cent while TVS Motor Company recorded 6,78,841 export units as against 6,22,019 units with 9.1 per cent growth.
Honda, on the other hand, stood third with a negative growth of 14.1 per cent as 3,26,369 units were shipped from India in the period between April 2019 and March 2020 as against 3,80,052 units during the same time in FY2019. Its fellow Japanese compatriot, Yamaha, put on a good show with 22.5 per cent YoY increase in export volumes.
Yamaha posted 2,98,034 units as against 2,43,205 units in FY2019. The country’s largest domestic two-wheeler seller, Hero MotoCorp, could only settle for fifth position as 1,78,261 units were exported in the last financial year as against 2,08,056 units with YoY negative growth of 14.3 per cent.
Just as in domestic sales, Suzuki recorded volume growth on the export side of affairs as well. It sent out 1,05,164 units from India last FY as against 78,694 units with 33.6 per cent growth. Royal Enfield’s strategy to increase its footprint in the international markets is certainly paying off as it endured 88.2 per cent growth. Piaggio slotted in at eighth ahead of Harley Davidson and Mahindra.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa is hopeful its bailout talks with the German government can be concluded soon, the airline’s board told staff in a letter seen by Reuters, adding that it is also considering alternatives such as creditor protection.
Travel bans have forced the German group to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99% drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, to lose about one million euros ($1.1 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.
“We estimate that these talks can lead to a conclusion soon,” Chief Executive Carsten Spohr and board members wrote in the letter, adding that they are also checking alternative options but do not expect to need them.
“We remain nevertheless convinced that we will not have to fall back on alternatives given the talks with Berlin.”
Lufthansa is negotiating a 10 billion euro bailout that would result in the government taking a 25.1% stake in the airline, weekly paper Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Of that, 5.5 billion euros would be in the form of non-voting capital, for which the government wants a coupon of 9%, the paper said.
A further 3.5 billion euros in loans would be provided by state bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KFW), the paper said, adding that Belgium, Austria and Switzerland might contribute towards the bailout.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lufthansa is negotiating a 9 billion euro bailout, with loans from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, citing a source close to the matter.
The slump in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a sweeping restructuring of the airline industry, with other carriers also seeking state bailouts.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper at the weekend that “taxpayers can count on us not to conduct these talks naively.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trump Donor Whose Hotels Won Small-Business Loans Returns Money</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">U.S. Small Business and Coronavirus:What you need to knowNewFollow this Storyi
A major donor to President Donald Trump whose companies are among the biggest known recipients of rescue loans for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus outbreak said he will return the money.
Texas hotelier Monty Bennett, whose companies own 130 properties across the country, said Saturday that he will return the loans provided under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which is intended to help keep workers employed. Bennett said new restrictions meant those companies may no longer qualify.
“We are disappointed that, in an abundance of caution to avoid any risk of non-compliance with the changed PPP rules, our actions mean that our employees, vendors, communities and others in need will not benefit from the PPP as Congress intended,” he said in a statement.
The move follows criticism that public companies like Bennett’s were able to secure millions of dollars in funding from the program while some mom-and-pop businesses were left with nothing. On Friday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called on the SBA to review the loans made to Bennett’s companies.
“This runs against the spirit of the law to provide much needed funds to truly small or family-owned businesses around the country that are in dire need of assistance,” the New York senator said.
Bennett is the chairman of three interrelated companies: Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc. and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc., which own the hotels, and Ashford Inc., which provides asset management and hotel management services in exchange for advisory fees. The three together disclosed receiving about $70 million in PPP loans, according to regulatory filings.
Luxury Hotelier Who Backed Trump Wins Big in Small-Business Aid
The companies were able to secure loans because of a loophole that allowed big restaurant chains and other large companies to rake in millions in low-interest loans. On Thursday, the Trump administration announced a new rule that single corporate groups shouldn’t get more than $20 million in total loans, which applies if businesses are “majority owned, directly or indirectly, by a common parent.”
As Congress was rushing to rescue small businesses in March, Ashford hired two Trump-linked lobbyists to advocate for a hotel-industry rescue, according to disclosures filed with Congress. One was Roy Bailey, the Republican fund-raiser in Texas who served as the 2016 co-chairman of the Trump campaign’s fund-raising arm and raised money for Trump’s preferred super-PAC. The other was Miller Strategies LLC, whose chief executive officer, Jeffrey Miller, is also bundler for his 2016 campaign.
Bennett is also a Trump donor. He gave $150,000 in the last six months to a fund-raising committee for the president’s reelection campaign and for Republicans, according to Federal Election Commission records, and donated more than $200,000 during the 2016 presidential campaign.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus has put a lot of stress on state economies.
Because of stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses, many workers have been laid off or furloughed and demand in some industries has declined, such as in travel and hospitality.
The response to the coronavirus has already put a strain on state budgets as states have to find money to cover the unprecedented number of people filing for unemployment benefits after major layoffs across industries. Sales and income taxes, which make up a large percentage of a state’s tax revenue, are also affected by more people facing layoffs, staying at home, and spending less.
According to the Brookings Institution, states also have to spend more to meet the demand for Medicaid and other healthcare spending during the pandemic, and some states have enacted or have pending money transfers from their general funds to help with different needs in their state.
“When expenses go up, policymakers have to either cut spending or find revenue from raising taxes or withdrawing from their rainy day funds,” Justin Theal, research officer at Pew Charitable Trusts, told Business Insider. “That’s why having robust savings is so important….Whether a state cuts spending or increases taxes to balance their budget – that ultimately takes money out of the economy and makes it harder for a nation as a whole to recover.”
During the last recession, Theal said states had to make cuts to their budgets in areas like higher education, infrastructure, or state aid to local governments. Some states have caught up in these areas since the recession, but others have not.
“The areas of the budget that the policy makers would typically look to cut, to help balance their budgets during economic downturns, like higher education, in many states there’s not that much flexibility in that area because they hadn’t caught up on the cuts that they had made during the Great Recession,” Theal said.
States can also get aid from federal funding to help budget shortfalls and expenses.
The recent CARES Act has provided some economic relief to help states, businesses, and individuals around the country during the pandemic, but some economists believe that state and local governments will still fall short in their budgets, even with up to $150 billion relief from the CARES Act.
The latest approved federal aid will provide more assistance to small businesses but not state and local governments who need it to cover budget shortfalls. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he would rather have states go bankrupt than give them federal funding.
According to a recent blog post from the Economic Policy Institute, based on already existing predicted budget shortfalls and recent data projections, state and local governments will need another stimulus package of $500 billion.
Amid closures, layoffs, and the need for more federal aid, one positive is that many states have money reserved in rainy day funds, or budget stabilization accounts, to help with economic downfalls. Rainy day funds help states cover budget shortfalls, as most states must balance their budgets each year, so that they can reduce the need for budget cuts or tax increases, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.
Rainy day funds are so important because they could be used to help shortfalls during and after the coronavirus. According to the Associated Press, financial experts said without this financial “cushion” states would have been “in much worse shape” for handling the economic impacts from the pandemic.
“The present crisis should just be another reminder of how important it is to fund these reserve accounts when times are good so that they can help states in difficult times in the future,” Janelle Cammenga, policy analyst at Tax Foundation, told Business Insider.
Although the current situation is an example of the perfect time to dip into reserves, rainy day funds are not unlimited. If a state uses all their money in this account “then they just can’t take anymore money out of it and they have to find another way to balance their budget,” Cammenga said.
The total in rainy day funds across all 50 states was $74.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, using figures from Pew Charitable Trusts. The median number of days a state could run on rainy day funds was 27.9 days, which was 10.6 more days than the median during the Great Recession, according to Pew.
However, the current conditions of those funds vary widely from state to state.
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 34 states have built up their rainy day funds to be better equipped for economic crises than they were going into the last recession. Four states – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Illinois – have less than a week’s worth of rainy day funds. Kansas cannot operate at all on just rainy day funds because although it opened up its rainy day fund in 2016, the state hasn’t put any money in the account yet. It was planning to start adding money in its account in fiscal year 2020, according to Tax Foundation.
It is important to note that 12 states have limits on how much can be withdrawn in a year. For instance, North Carolina can only take out 7.5% of last year’s general fund, which works out to around $1.25 billion, and Idaho can use 50% of its rainy day balance in a year, or about $373 million.
Every state has legal limitations on how they can spend rainy day funds, except for six states that can use the money for any reason.
There are also differences in who authorizes the withdrawals. The Tax Foundation wrote in a recent report on rainy day funds that it might be easier to use rainy day funds in states that require approval from executive agencies or governors than in those who need approval from legislators. This is because stay-at-home orders and other responses amid the pandemic might make it harder for legislators to come together.
The Tax Foundation compiled a full list of how much of a rainy day fund a state can use, what purposes those funds can be used for, and who authorizes it. Some state governors have already planned on using money from their reserves amid the coronavirus, such as in Washington and Maryland.
Theal said when looking at the rainy day funds, it is important to look at a state’s sources of revenue and the diversity of its economy. According to an article from Vox, 70% of state tax revenue is from sales and income taxes, which have been collapsing as businesses shutter and workers are laid off or furloughed.
Theal said because tax day was delayed this year to July 15, after most states’ budget years finish at the end of June, “you’re shifting this huge influx of personal income tax collections from the current fiscal year to the next one” which will create more stress on balancing budgets.
“The pandemic and its fiscal impacts will linger for months if not years within states,” Theal said. “And so a lot of states are convening emergency sessions to bring the legislators back and have to adjust their 2021 budgets based on the new forecast of how revenue will be impacted and the additional strains on spending and what they ultimately mean to each state’s budget.”
To get a sense of where states and their rainy day funds stand, we looked at Pew’s estimates for how many days they could pay their bills using those funds alone. The following six states represent examples of where places with different financial situations and impact from the coronavirus all sit today.
New Jersey has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, and its finances were already in dire condition before the crisis.
New Jersey used up all of its funds during the last recession and had a hard time rebuilding this reserve, according to NJ Spotlight.
According to Pew Trusts, New Jersey had 3.9 days to operate alone on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $401 million, or 1.1% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
Although the amount is small compared to other states, it is significant because 2019 was the first time in over a decade that money was added to the emergency fund account, according to Politico.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, New Jersey is one of the states “least prepared” for an economic downturn.
“While their economies are not so volatile, they have exceptionally small reserves, partly because they failed for many years to adequately fund their public employee pension systems and now are struggling to restore those systems’ long-term health,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus in the US, with over 156,000 cases in New York City alone, as of April 27, and its major sources of revenue have taken a hit as the tourism industry and businesses temporarily close.
According to data from Pew Trusts, New York had 10.3 days to operate just on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $2 billion, or 2.8% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The state already had a budget gap of $6 billion before the pandemic. One reason for this was due to Medicaid costs and demand. Six million New Yorkers are enrolled in the program and spending for this healthcare program was about $75 billion in fiscal year 2018 in New York, according to The New York Times.
In 2012, “the state froze Medicaid contributions paid by county governments” to help local New York governments, meaning the state then had to help with any Medicaid cost increases, according to Syracuse News. To help with the high costs of the healthcare program and to address the budget gap, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently proposed that counties control increases in the cost of Medicaid locally to no more than 3%, according to The New York Times article.
Theal said with unemployment numbers rising, more people will be looking to “draw upon Medicaid health benefits.” The state’s unemployment rate in March 2020 was at 4.5%, which is most likely lower than the actual rate as this is a preliminary reported figure from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that does not include the subsequent weeks of layoffs and furloughs.
In contrast to New Jersey and New York, Wyoming is better prepared for an economic emergency.
According to figures from Pew, Wyoming can operate for over a year on just their rainy day funds, with 397.7 days worth of funding.
One reason their rainy day fund account of $1.7 billion, or 109.0% of its annual spending, was so high is because the state does a good job of saving money when times are good since its main revenue source of oil and fossil fuels fluctuates, Theal said.
Although Wyoming has a robust rainy day fund, it is one of the states that requires repayment quickly and has to repay the full amount the following fiscal year, according to Tax Foundation.
“I think that when given the choice between cutting more costs and dipping into rainy day funds, I think a lot of states are going to end up relying on their rainy day funds for some relief there,” Cammenga said. “But I think it will be largely the states that don’t have those really stringent requirements.”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, Wyoming is “best prepared” for an economic downturn.
However, its reliance on one source of revenue could be an issue, especially during recent declines in oil prices.
According to Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming, interviewed by Sierra Magazine, he said “Wyoming has to make fundamental changes to move beyond its dependence on falling energy revenues. That could mean hiking property or other taxes or introducing an income tax.”
Nevada has a large tourism industry that has been impacted by the state lockdown and is projected to have the most job losses by this summer among states and DC.
According to Pew Trusts, Nevada can run for 27.3 days on just its rainy day fund, which is close to the median across the states in fiscal year 2019. The state had $332 million, or 7.5% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The amount in its account has gone up and down over the years, including during and after the Great Recession.
The state had $268 million in fiscal year 2007, which decreased to $72.6 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the state only had $600,000, enough for less than a day.
According to a Brookings Institution report in 2017, “Nevada policymakers, assuming that the gaming and tourism industry was less vulnerable to swings in the business cycle, did not build up reserves during the early 2000s when revenue was soaring.” As a result, Nevada’s revenue was negatively affected by the Great Recession as its main sources of revenue fell.
But dipping into its reserves, “did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money,” according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic.
According to Pew, Michigan has enough money in its rainy day account to operate for 40.2 days based on its $1.1 billion in reserves, or 11.0% of its spending. Their budget stabilization fund has been rising since fiscal year 2014.
However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.
According to a report by, Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan in 2017, Michigan is only prepared for a “mild economic downturn.”
The state holds a better financial cushion than it did during the Great Recession, when the state had no money saved in its rainy day funds after using them to cover budget shortfalls from Michigan’s “single-state recession”, a term used in Michigan after the state spent almost a decade in a recession even after other states started to recover from a national recession in 2001, according to Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan.
Pew notes that Michigan is one of the states that spends “considerable amounts” outside of their rainy day funds that also might add to aid the state in economic downfalls.
Although California has been building up its rainy day funds since it depleted its account in the Great Recession, the state is already predicting budget shortfalls.
According to Pew, California can run on rainy day funds for 52.8 days, more than double the median among states and among the top 10 states with the highest number of operating days.
Since 2014, the state requires 1.5% of its General Fund be put into its rainy day funds, according to California Legislative Analyst Office. The state had $20.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, or 14.5% of its spending, in its budget stabilization account.
But because of the nation’s response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state’s major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state’s economic shortfalls.
The state heavily relies on personal income taxes for revenue, where 67% of the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 comes from personal income taxes, according to The Sacramento Bee. A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

But dipping into its reserves, "did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money," according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic. 
According to Pew, Michigan has enough money in its rainy day account to operate for 40.2 days based on its $1.1 billion in reserves, or 11.0% of its spending. Their budget stabilization fund has been rising since fiscal year 2014.
However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.
According to a report by, Citizen's Research Council of Michigan in 2017, Michigan is only prepared for a "mild economic downturn."
The state holds a better financial cushion than it did during the Great Recession, when the state had no money saved in its rainy day funds after using them to cover budget shortfalls from Michigan's "single-state recession", a term used in Michigan after the state spent almost a decade in a recession even after other states started to recover from a national recession in 2001, according to Citizen's Research Council of Michigan.
Pew notes that Michigan is one of the states that spends "considerable amounts" outside of their rainy day funds that also might add to aid the state in economic downfalls.
Although California has been building up its rainy day funds since it depleted its account in the Great Recession, the state is already predicting budget shortfalls.
According to Pew, California can run on rainy day funds for 52.8 days, more than double the median among states and among the top 10 states with the highest number of operating days.
Since 2014, the state requires 1.5% of its General Fund be put into its rainy day funds, according to California Legislative Analyst Office. The state had $20.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, or 14.5% of its spending, in its budget stabilization account.
But because of the nation's response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state's major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state's economic shortfalls.
The state heavily relies on personal income taxes for revenue, where 67% of the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 comes from personal income taxes, according to The Sacramento Bee. A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">We surveyed the ‘rainy day’ funds of 6 states to see how prepared they were for a major emergency. The results paint a grim picture for the country’s economic recovery.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus has put a lot of stress on state economies.
Because of stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses, many workers have been laid off or furloughed and demand in some industries has declined, such as in travel and hospitality.
The response to the coronavirus has already put a strain on state budgets as states have to find money to cover the unprecedented number of people filing for unemployment benefits after major layoffs across industries. Sales and income taxes, which make up a large percentage of a state’s tax revenue, are also affected by more people facing layoffs, staying at home, and spending less.
According to the Brookings Institution, states also have to spend more to meet the demand for Medicaid and other healthcare spending during the pandemic, and some states have enacted or have pending money transfers from their general funds to help with different needs in their state.
“When expenses go up, policymakers have to either cut spending or find revenue from raising taxes or withdrawing from their rainy day funds,” Justin Theal, research officer at Pew Charitable Trusts, told Business Insider. “That’s why having robust savings is so important….Whether a state cuts spending or increases taxes to balance their budget – that ultimately takes money out of the economy and makes it harder for a nation as a whole to recover.”
During the last recession, Theal said states had to make cuts to their budgets in areas like higher education, infrastructure, or state aid to local governments. Some states have caught up in these areas since the recession, but others have not.
“The areas of the budget that the policy makers would typically look to cut, to help balance their budgets during economic downturns, like higher education, in many states there’s not that much flexibility in that area because they hadn’t caught up on the cuts that they had made during the Great Recession,” Theal said.
States can also get aid from federal funding to help budget shortfalls and expenses.
The recent CARES Act has provided some economic relief to help states, businesses, and individuals around the country during the pandemic, but some economists believe that state and local governments will still fall short in their budgets, even with up to $150 billion relief from the CARES Act.
The latest approved federal aid will provide more assistance to small businesses but not state and local governments who need it to cover budget shortfalls. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he would rather have states go bankrupt than give them federal funding.
According to a recent blog post from the Economic Policy Institute, based on already existing predicted budget shortfalls and recent data projections, state and local governments will need another stimulus package of $500 billion.
Amid closures, layoffs, and the need for more federal aid, one positive is that many states have money reserved in rainy day funds, or budget stabilization accounts, to help with economic downfalls. Rainy day funds help states cover budget shortfalls, as most states must balance their budgets each year, so that they can reduce the need for budget cuts or tax increases, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.
Rainy day funds are so important because they could be used to help shortfalls during and after the coronavirus. According to the Associated Press, financial experts said without this financial “cushion” states would have been “in much worse shape” for handling the economic impacts from the pandemic.
“The present crisis should just be another reminder of how important it is to fund these reserve accounts when times are good so that they can help states in difficult times in the future,” Janelle Cammenga, policy analyst at Tax Foundation, told Business Insider.
Although the current situation is an example of the perfect time to dip into reserves, rainy day funds are not unlimited. If a state uses all their money in this account “then they just can’t take anymore money out of it and they have to find another way to balance their budget,” Cammenga said.
The total in rainy day funds across all 50 states was $74.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, using figures from Pew Charitable Trusts. The median number of days a state could run on rainy day funds was 27.9 days, which was 10.6 more days than the median during the Great Recession, according to Pew.
However, the current conditions of those funds vary widely from state to state.
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 34 states have built up their rainy day funds to be better equipped for economic crises than they were going into the last recession. Four states – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Illinois – have less than a week’s worth of rainy day funds. Kansas cannot operate at all on just rainy day funds because although it opened up its rainy day fund in 2016, the state hasn’t put any money in the account yet. It was planning to start adding money in its account in fiscal year 2020, according to Tax Foundation.
It is important to note that 12 states have limits on how much can be withdrawn in a year. For instance, North Carolina can only take out 7.5% of last year’s general fund, which works out to around $1.25 billion, and Idaho can use 50% of its rainy day balance in a year, or about $373 million.
Every state has legal limitations on how they can spend rainy day funds, except for six states that can use the money for any reason.
There are also differences in who authorizes the withdrawals. The Tax Foundation wrote in a recent report on rainy day funds that it might be easier to use rainy day funds in states that require approval from executive agencies or governors than in those who need approval from legislators. This is because stay-at-home orders and other responses amid the pandemic might make it harder for legislators to come together.
The Tax Foundation compiled a full list of how much of a rainy day fund a state can use, what purposes those funds can be used for, and who authorizes it. Some state governors have already planned on using money from their reserves amid the coronavirus, such as in Washington and Maryland.
Theal said when looking at the rainy day funds, it is important to look at a state’s sources of revenue and the diversity of its economy. According to an article from Vox, 70% of state tax revenue is from sales and income taxes, which have been collapsing as businesses shutter and workers are laid off or furloughed.
Theal said because tax day was delayed this year to July 15, after most states’ budget years finish at the end of June, “you’re shifting this huge influx of personal income tax collections from the current fiscal year to the next one” which will create more stress on balancing budgets.
“The pandemic and its fiscal impacts will linger for months if not years within states,” Theal said. “And so a lot of states are convening emergency sessions to bring the legislators back and have to adjust their 2021 budgets based on the new forecast of how revenue will be impacted and the additional strains on spending and what they ultimately mean to each state’s budget.”
To get a sense of where states and their rainy day funds stand, we looked at Pew’s estimates for how many days they could pay their bills using those funds alone. The following six states represent examples of where places with different financial situations and impact from the coronavirus all sit today.
New Jersey has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, and its finances were already in dire condition before the crisis.
New Jersey used up all of its funds during the last recession and had a hard time rebuilding this reserve, according to NJ Spotlight.
According to Pew Trusts, New Jersey had 3.9 days to operate alone on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $401 million, or 1.1% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
Although the amount is small compared to other states, it is significant because 2019 was the first time in over a decade that money was added to the emergency fund account, according to Politico.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, New Jersey is one of the states “least prepared” for an economic downturn.
“While their economies are not so volatile, they have exceptionally small reserves, partly because they failed for many years to adequately fund their public employee pension systems and now are struggling to restore those systems’ long-term health,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus in the US, with over 156,000 cases in New York City alone, as of April 27, and its major sources of revenue have taken a hit as the tourism industry and businesses temporarily close.
According to data from Pew Trusts, New York had 10.3 days to operate just on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $2 billion, or 2.8% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The state already had a budget gap of $6 billion before the pandemic. One reason for this was due to Medicaid costs and demand. Six million New Yorkers are enrolled in the program and spending for this healthcare program was about $75 billion in fiscal year 2018 in New York, according to The New York Times.
In 2012, “the state froze Medicaid contributions paid by county governments” to help local New York governments, meaning the state then had to help with any Medicaid cost increases, according to Syracuse News. To help with the high costs of the healthcare program and to address the budget gap, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently proposed that counties control increases in the cost of Medicaid locally to no more than 3%, according to The New York Times article.
Theal said with unemployment numbers rising, more people will be looking to “draw upon Medicaid health benefits.” The state’s unemployment rate in March 2020 was at 4.5%, which is most likely lower than the actual rate as this is a preliminary reported figure from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that does not include the subsequent weeks of layoffs and furloughs.
In contrast to New Jersey and New York, Wyoming is better prepared for an economic emergency.
According to figures from Pew, Wyoming can operate for over a year on just their rainy day funds, with 397.7 days worth of funding.
One reason their rainy day fund account of $1.7 billion, or 109.0% of its annual spending, was so high is because the state does a good job of saving money when times are good since its main revenue source of oil and fossil fuels fluctuates, Theal said.
Although Wyoming has a robust rainy day fund, it is one of the states that requires repayment quickly and has to repay the full amount the following fiscal year, according to Tax Foundation.
“I think that when given the choice between cutting more costs and dipping into rainy day funds, I think a lot of states are going to end up relying on their rainy day funds for some relief there,” Cammenga said. “But I think it will be largely the states that don’t have those really stringent requirements.”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, Wyoming is “best prepared” for an economic downturn.
However, its reliance on one source of revenue could be an issue, especially during recent declines in oil prices.
According to Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming, interviewed by Sierra Magazine, he said “Wyoming has to make fundamental changes to move beyond its dependence on falling energy revenues. That could mean hiking property or other taxes or introducing an income tax.”
Nevada has a large tourism industry that has been impacted by the state lockdown and is projected to have the most job losses by this summer among states and DC.
According to Pew Trusts, Nevada can run for 27.3 days on just its rainy day fund, which is close to the median across the states in fiscal year 2019. The state had $332 million, or 7.5% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The amount in its account has gone up and down over the years, including during and after the Great Recession.
The state had $268 million in fiscal year 2007, which decreased to $72.6 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the state only had $600,000, enough for less than a day.
According to a Brookings Institution report in 2017, “Nevada policymakers, assuming that the gaming and tourism industry was less vulnerable to swings in the business cycle, did not build up reserves during the early 2000s when revenue was soaring.” As a result, Nevada’s revenue was negatively affected by the Great Recession as its main sources of revenue fell.
But dipping into its reserves, “did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money,” according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic.

However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBCUniversal weighs layoffs at media, entertainment units: WSJ</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) owned NBCUniversal is evaluating a significant reduction of staff across its portfolio of media and entertainment properties as part of a cost-cutting effort, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Discussions began this week regarding cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, according to the report.
Along with its industry peers, NBCUniversal is taking a financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak which has shuttered movie theaters and theme parks. The company has temporarily closed its theme parks and suspended its sports productions and most of its film and TV production.
Although all divisions are being looked at, some areas likely to be under a microscope at NBCUniversal are the theme-parks division and Universal Pictures, the WSJ reported.
NBCUniversal declined to comment on the report.
The company, which reported its results earlier this week, said its quarterly revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 22.5% this quarter from a year earlier, while revenue at theme parks fell 31.9%.
Last month, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said it will start furloughs of non-essential U.S. employees across the company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hanoi hotels lose 49 pct of revenue in Covid-19 impact - VnExpress International</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a new Savills Vietnam report, the average occupancy rate of three to five star hotels in Hanoi fell by 30 percent in the first quarter as a result of the steep fall in foreign tourist arrivals as the country imposed strict entry restrictions and also suspended all international flights. The average room rate in the first quarter for these hotels was down 13 percent year-on-year, the report said.
It said the four-star and three-star segments were heavily affected with average revenues plunging 60 percent, forcing many to temporarily suspend operations and let their staff take unpaid leave.
Data from the city’s Department of Tourism show 153 hotels in Hoan Kiem and Dong Da Districts in the downtown area have shut down between February and March.
The capital has approximately 9,950 rooms in 66 hotels, 16 of which are five-star, 19 are four-star and 31 are three-star.
The occupancy rate is unlikely to recover in the second quarter as Vietnam continues restricting entry of foreign nationals and requiring those few who are allowed to enter to be quarantined for 14 days.
Hospitality and tourism have been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis. Foreign tourist arrivals in Hanoi in the first quarter has been estimated at 756,000, down 37 percent year-on-year. Totally, Hanoi tourist arrivals in the first quarter dropped to a five-year low at 3.85 million and revenues fell 40 percent to VND15.6 trillion ($668.5 million), according to the city’s department of tourism.
Hanoi last year welcomed 29 million tourists and related revenues hit VND103.8 trillion ($4.5 billion) for respective year-on-year increases of 10 percent and 34 percent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everything we learned from the Downing Street coronavirus briefing today</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new trial to trace the spread of coronavirus in Britain is due to begin on the Isle of Wight next week, the government has confirmed.
Cabinet minister Michael Gove announced the measure at the latest Covid-19 briefing at Downing Street on Sunday afternoon.
He said the Prime Minister Boris Johnson will offer more detail next week on how Britain will begin returning to work as the number of deaths continues to fall.
Mr Gove also addressed a number of other issues such as easing lockdown restrictions, helping the most vulnerable and providing PPE for the NHS.
It comes as a further 15 people have died in Greater Manchester hospitals having contracted coronavirus.
It means the total number of deaths in the county's hospitals now stands at 1,366.
NHS trusts in Greater Manchester today (Sunday) confirmed 15 more people have died in their hospitals, a fall from 25 in the previous 24-hour period.
This reflects a general downward trend with a fall in the number of deaths recorded in each of the last four days.
However, experts and politicians say figures must be treated with caution as there are fewer NHS staff working at weekends and so fewer deaths tend to be recorded.
Here's what Mr Gove had to say about the government's response to the crisis:
Britain will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, as the government looks at how to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection.
"This week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having that in place more widely later this month," Mr Gove told a news conference.
Mr Gove said that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been given an offer of accommodation since the end of March,
Providing an update on work that was being done to help vulnerable people, he said the Government was nearing delivering its one millionth parcel of essential food.
In terms of NHS volunteers, he told the briefing that more than 600,000 people have been verified "and are helping with the daily errands that make such a significant difference".
He also said officials were "working with supermarkets to make sure that a greater number of delivery slots are made available to those most in need".
Mr Gove detailed the Government's current and proposed provisions for disadvantaged children.
He said the Government has committed £100 million for remote learning for "those who need it most" and 180 video lessons per week were being supplied through the newly launched Oak National Academy.
"We're particularly keen to help vulnerable and disadvantaged children to carry on with their education during the pandemic," he said.
Mr Gove said the Government has ordered laptops for disadvantaged children sitting exams next year and for children with social workers to help them stay in touch with vital services.
The coronavirus outbreak has left many people across Greater Manchester struggling for access to food, basics and other support. Many of them are self-isolating, often in fragile health and alone.
Public services have been working hard to find and help them, but we know they are over-stretched and working round the clock.
So the Manchester Evening News and the Greater Manchester Mayor's Charity have launched Covaid-19 - a fundraiser aimed at supporting those who most need help, from elderly people with no support network to homeless families living in hotels.
The money will be distributed via the mayor of Greater Manchester's charity.
You can donate by visiting our JustGiving page here.
He added free internet routers and free school meal vouchers are being provided for those who need them.
According to Mr Gove, more than 49,000 children were classed by schools as vulnerable on April 24, "more than double" the figure from a week earlier.
He said 15,500 schools have placed orders for free school meal vouchers, and more than £35 million worth have been redeemed.
Talking about PPE, Mr Gove said: "On personal protective equipment for key workers, we are increasing the spread of distribution and supply.
"From February 25 to May 2 we had delivered over 1.08 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England.
"And tens of millions more have been distributed by our colleagues in the devolved administrations.
"This overall figure includes 149 million masks, 173 million aprons, two million gowns and 614 million gloves.
"On May 2 alone we delivered an additional 20 million items of PPE within England."
He said there is "much more to do".
Mr Gove said: "We've all learned to adapt, and we must carry on doing so after the Prime Minister sets out how we will get back to work later this week.
"His comprehensive plan will explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, how we can travel to work more safely, and how we can make life in the workplace safer.
"But before we can ease the existing restrictions we must ensure the government's five tests are met - that the number of cases are falling, that death rates are declining, that the NHS has what it needs, and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the NHS."
He said he is "particularly conscious" that those in the frontline of our public services will need "clear guidance on safe working".
He added: "They'll need the right personal protective equipment and appropriate access to testing if we are to make all the progress that we want in the weeks ahead.
"We're consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the Prime Minister will be saying more later this week."
Mr Gove said more than 200,000 key workers and their families had been tested for coronavirus.
He said criteria for testing had been extended beyond key workers to anyone over 65 displaying symptoms and anyone who has to travel to get to work.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AP report: MLB draft still likely to begin on June 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — Major League Baseball owners will discuss a length for the amateur draft next week and are likely to start the selections on the original date of June 10, a person familiar with the deliberations told The Associated Press.
Teams and the players’ association agreed March 26 to a deal that allowed MLB to cut the draft from 40 rounds to as few as five this year and 20 next year, part of a plan to deal with the new coronavirus pandemic that delayed the start of the season and slashed revenue. As part of the agreement, the sides agreed to leave the assigned slot values of draft signing bonuses at the same level in 2020 and 2021 as they were last year.
That left the total of slot values for a 10-round draft this year at $265.5 million, including $29.6 million for rounds six through 10.
MLB proposed to the union that it would guarantee a 10-round draft in exchange for the slot values for rounds 6-10 being cut by 50%. The union rejected that plan, a person familiar with the decision said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the move was not announced.
The union’s decision to reject the plan was first reported by The Athletic and the move to keep the draft on June 10 by the New York Post.
Rather than resume negotiations, teams intend to debate the size of the draft and make a decision, the person said.
Signing bonus pools started in 2012 and limit the amount of money teams can spend. Each slot in the first 10 rounds is a signed a value — the range last year was $8,415,300 down to $142,200 — and each team’s values are added to a form a pool. Signing bonuses in the first 10 rounds count against the pool along with the amounts above $125,000 of players selected after the 10th round or who were bypassed in the draft and then signed.
A team that exceeds it pool is taxed, and a club more than 5% above loses a first-round draft pick the next year — a threshold never reached.
As part of the March agreement, players and teams agreed that any draft-eligible player not selected this year or next would be limited to a signing bonus of no more than $20,000.
MLB’s offer that the union rejected included an additional limit of only five bypassed players at up to $20,000, with the rest held to a maximum of $5,000.
The union agreed in March that signing bonuses can be deferred: up to $100,000 will be due within 30 days of approval, and 50% of the rest payable on July 1 in each of the following two years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bangladesh minister sends dire message to factory owners as workers face contagion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Health Minister Zahid Malik has urged clothing factory owners to ensure the safety of workers, sending a warning that a surge in coronavirus cases due to the reopening of the plants will leave their employees untreated.
The minister’s dire message on Sunday underlines workers’ vulnerabilities to infections in an industry that tends to disregard safety protocol.
Many workers have headed back to Dhaka and other areas to join work since apparel factories reopened in the last week of April amid the shutdown.
Following a meeting over the reopening of factories at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Sunday, Malik said: “The topic of today’s meeting was how the clothing industry will follow the health regulations we provided.”
“The virus spreads mostly through transports. So we’ve asked them [industry owners] to maintain safe transportation. The owners will take responsibility for the workers’ transportation. We’ve advised them to pay special attention to safety at their homes and the places where they eat.”
The failure to ensure safety for workers means the government will be unable to ensure treatment if they get infected.
The minister mentioned that workers who had already arrived in Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur must remain in the areas until cases of infections drop.
“To keep track of those who depart for some reason, we have instructed owners to list the workers who have travelled to Dhaka, Narayanganj and other places. Lists will be created in individual districts and if someone does depart, he or she will be quarantined,” the minister said.
Bangladesh confirmed two more deaths from the coronavirus in a daily count, taking the total to 177 on Sunday.
The tally of COVID-19 infections spiralled to 9,455 in the same period after another 665 people tested positive from 5,368 samples in the biggest single-day spike.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TTC responds to coronavirus with historic service cuts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Effective May 10, the TTC will make cuts across its system at a level that has no precedent.
Much of the service Toronto now has will remain in place, but trains, streetcars and buses will not show up as often.
Overall, the cuts, announced this week in the aftermath of layoffs of some 1,200 staff on April 23, amount to a 16 per cent reduction in the total weekly hours of service.
However, the effect will not be felt equally across the system. The lion’s share of changes will take place during peak periods reflecting the fact that a “peak” no longer exists on many routes. There are fewer cuts on weekdays outside of the peak, and almost none on weekends. The Blue Night Network remains unchanged.
With most of Toronto staying home and avoiding crowds since a state of emergency was declared to arrest the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, demand on transit has fallen to less than a fifth of its normal level. Even so, the need to stay distant from each other has meant the need for more space on transit vehicles. Balancing the requirement for service with budget realities is a big challenge.
In many cases, the TTC has adjusted scheduled travel times to reflect the absence of congestion allowing fewer vehicles to provide service than would normally be required. Some details are not yet available (they’ll be released by May 10), although the affected routes and time periods have been published.
Weekday daytime service on lines 1 and 2 (Yonge-University and Bloor-Danforth) will operate at off-peak levels resulting in a one-third drop in trains per hour during peak periods. There is no change in service in the evening on line 1, but line 2 will see less frequent service. No change is planned on Scarborough Rapid Transit line 3 or Sheppard line 4. Weekend service remains at current levels.
Many details of service changes on streetcar routes have not been published, although changes in the peaks can be inferred from the number of vehicles in service. This will drop by about 20 per cent in peak periods, and a planned reduction in streetcar hours implies a similar level of cuts during off-peak hours.
What we know:
• 501 Queen will operate as a single route from Neville to Long Branch every 10 minutes all day. This is equivalent to a one-third cut in peak service.
• 503 Kingston Road has been operating as a shuttle in The Beach for a few weeks. It will be replaced by the 22A Coxwell bus which usually serves this area on evenings and weekends.
• All peak period trippers including 508 Lake Shore streetcars and bus trippers on 501 Queen, 505 Dundas and 506 Carlton have been dropped from the schedules.
• Peak service cuts range from just under 10 per cent on 504 King and 505 Dundas to 40 per cent on 512 St. Clair based on the number of assigned vehicles.
• A small number of spare cars will be available to add to scheduled service as needed.
TTC bus routes will see a 20 per cent drop in peak service vehicles, but only a 10 per cent cut in vehicle hours.
Many existing and planned services are suspended. Some of these changes are already in place in response to reduced demand and the availability of drivers. These include:
• All peak period tripper services (typically to handle surge loads at schools)
• All 900-series express bus routes except 900 Airport and 927 Highway 27
• All 140-series downtown premium express bus routes
• Seasonal route extensions and service improvements to the Zoo and various parks
• The 176 Mimico GO shuttle bus
Many routes with a suspended express service will see no change to local service, or in a few cases slight improvements. However, the removal of the express buses is a real cut on the 23 affected routes. (More details below).
In addition to the scheduled service, there will be a large pool of buses to be deployed as needed from garages around the city. There will be more than 100 of these during the peak periods, and they will allow the TTC to react to mismatches between the new schedules and actual demand.
A common change on many routes is the removal of one peak period bus. The effect varies depending on the route’s length where one bus can represent less than a 10 per cent reduction, or as much as half of the service. Some of these changes would occur under normal circumstances as a summer cutback, but some are deeper than usual.
Weekday service changes will affect much of the system, but many routes have no planned changes. In some cases, that’s because the routes have little service on them now and no cutback is possible except suspension. In other cases, demand justifies retaining service at current levels.
The TTC is banking on some return of demand by September, although schedules for that period will have to be planned before there is a good sense of travel demand for the fall. Further out, Toronto will face the problem of a rise in commuting and school trips when people will still be reticent to travel in close quarters.
This is not just a case of restoring the lost service, but of finding a social agreement that doing things together is actually possible and safe. Some users will shift to other modes including cars, cycling and that shortest of trips – work at home. But our city, our world is built around people gathering for work, school, entertainment and, yes, travel. There is a long road before transit can return to normal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">11 crore jobs, 30% of GDP: Small enterprises pushed to brink amid looming distress, despair</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From a Delhi-based machine-part manufacturing enterprise which can’t pay its 24 workers to a paint-maker in Pune fresh out of insolvency but facing a funds crunch, a start-up which got a Rs 90-lakh order to make masks but is waiting for banks to give credit, to a Ludhiana export unit whose bills haven’t been cleared — no other sector has been pushed so far to the edge by the pandemic and the Covid lockdown as Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).
These make up the heart of the larger industrial ecosystem, acting largely as ancillary units for the big enterprises, and employ, across 5 crore units, an estimated 11 crore persons.
At stake are not only these jobs but the future of what makes up 45 per cent of the country’s total manufacturing output, 40 per cent of exports — and almost 30 per cent of the national GDP.

No wonder then that within the government, officials said, a second stimulus will be more targeted to this sector — rather than large corporates — as the MSME sector has not quite benefited from the series of relief measures announced earlier.
Over the last fortnight, the government has been holding discussions for the last two weeks to finalise a package for MSMEs. Addressing a webinar by FICCI Ladies Organisation Saturday, Union MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari said, “We have sent recommendations for a relief package to the Finance Minister and Prime Minister and I hope it will be announced soon. We will try to give relief to the extent possible.” A week ago, Gadkari had alluded to a Rs 1-lakh-crore revolving fund for MSMEs to provide them liquidity.
As they wait for this package, MSMEs are bleeding.
An illustrative case is that of Jatinder Singh, 45, who owns three units in east Delhi’s Jhilmil Industrial sprawl that make special-purpose machine parts used in assembly lines. Just before the lockdown, Singh, who has 24 workers in these three units, wrapped up an order for Rs 25 lakh for a customer in Uttar Pradesh.
The order can’t be dispatched, his units are shut, there is no word on when and how the lockdown will ease. “I have to pay a fixed electricity cost of Rs 2 lakh, which will keep adding every month. I have eight workers who were paid in rations. Their March payment was made. I don’t know if workers will return after going through all this,” he said.
Singh’s plight reflects that of millions of others who make up India’s most economically vulnerable enterprise grouping. Their problems are multi-fold: from the break-down of the credit cycle, lack of availability of working capital to paying salaries and fixed costs even as units are shuttered, and an inability to even encash their assets to maintain solvency.
Add to this the huge question mark over labour availability as and when the lockdown opens given that most of them employ migrants who are either stranded in camps or scrambling to return home.
Many MSME promoters The Indian Express spoke to are anguished and despairing. They say the third lockdown gives no clear indications on whether MSMEs will be allowed to operate at full strength or not – and this uncertainty could wreck the sector.
“The most important thing is that now nobody will think of starting a new business, especially in the manufacturing sector. An SME or MSME does not have surplus money to take care on a rainy day,” said Chandrakant Salunkhe, founder and president of SME Chamber of Commerce.
Since a large number of state capitals have been classified in red zones, this is also a huge stumbling block for MSME owners to find the points for sales across sectors.

“Partial work resumption is not going to be helpful as one will not be able to invoice the activities, even if I keep the economic activity alive because production can happen but selling points are not open. Many state capitals are not green zones and most things happen from the capitals,” said K E Raghunathan, Chennai-based SME owner and former National President, All India Manufacturers’ Organisation.
Even those operating in the essential item segment also seem to be impacted. Despite being considered essential services, pharmaceutical MSMEs have reported facing serious issues with arranging accommodation for their workforce, as they do not have the infrastructure or money for it.
MSMEs in India are a heterogeneous group in terms of size and structure of units, products and services offered, their scales of production, and the use of technology, with a considerable number of them falling in the unorganised sector.
Even as the government is working on a new definition of MSMEs, the present classification for the manufacturing sector designates a micro enterprise as one with investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs 25 lakh, small enterprises with investment between Rs 25 lakh-Rs 5 crore and medium enterprises with investment between Rs 5-10 crore.
For service sector classification, micro enterprises have investment in plant and machinery not exceeding Rs 10 lakh, between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 2 crore for small enterprises and Rs 2-5 crore for medium enterprises.
A benchmark survey of 112 representative MSMEs conducted by the Mumbai-based SP Jain Institute of Management Research (SPJIMR) just ahead of the first lockdown revealed an across-the-board underestimation of the scale of the pandemic.
Given the unfolding distress now, all SMEs are trying desperately to cut costs, and the first casualty would be a cut in labour, said Tulsi Jayakumar, professor of Economics and Chairperson, Family Managed Business, at SPJIMR, Mumbai.
“Since the lockdown, a number of the respondents have expressed their desire to downsize, as soon as the lockdown ends. They have also been exploring legal dimensions of salary cuts, freezes, use of force majeure in their contracts.
The biggest problem is that of cash flows, as also the government directive to pay wages,” Jayakumar told The Indian Express.
The largest item constituting financial burden, the respondents said in the survey, was labour costs (34 per cent), followed by raw material (18.8 per cent) and interest on loans (18.8 per cent).
In the MSME services sector, hotels and restaurant segment is among the worst impacted, with an estimated 7.3 million jobs on the line as the third phase of the national lockdown kicks in.
The challenges for this sector range from supplies to labour, real estate to credit, overheads and utilities, delivery commissions and rental contracts. More so, when urban centres that fuelled this sector’s rapid growth are the worst hit and continue under lockdown.
Even in essential services like medicine, MSMEs are no better off.
“Under lockdown conditions, transporting our workers while maintaining social distancing is adding to our costs and this is very difficult, especially with a reduced level of production,” said Ashok Madan, ED, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA), adding that this is a burden for the 7,000 MSME pharma units across the country.
While RBI data shows that the credit outstanding to the sector has contracted, many economists said credit availability may further tighten with banks turning more risk averse now. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held a video conference with private and state-owned bankers to discuss credit flows including provision of working capital post lockdown to MSMEs.
Notwithstanding such exhortation by RBI, Milind Kamble, founder of Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI), said banks have been reluctant in extending credit to MSMEs. “A six-month startup, which got an order for supplying masks worth Rs 90 lakh was not extended credit by the bank, despite it being a maker of essential products.
Lack of adequate working capital is the biggest challenge for MSMEs and SMEs,” he said.
D K Joshi, chief economist at Crisil said that while the government in its first stimulus focused on distribution of food grain and cash transfer in bank accounts of poor and needy, the next one has to address this sector.
“We feel that the focus of the next set of stimulus should be around small and medium enterprises so as to support their survival as they are the biggest job creators,” said Joshi. He pegged the stimulus to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh crore is required, including what has already been announced by the Finance Minister.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ramadan TV series about Gulf Jews ignites controversy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JERUSALEM (AP) - A television series aired by a Saudi broadcaster during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan has sparked controversy by offering a positive depiction of a Jewish community in the Gulf at the time of Israel’s creation.
Critics say it and another series aired on the network promote normalization with Israel even as the Palestinian cause is under threat by President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, which heavily favors Israel and would allow it to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank.
Relations between Israel and Arab Gulf states have quietly improved in recent years as they have come to see Iran as a shared threat and as Arab leaders have sought to curry favor with the Trump administration. Most TV shows in the Arab world are made by private companies, but producers must heed red lines set by the region’s autocratic rulers.
“Umm Haroun,” Arabic for the mother of Aaron, is set in an unnamed Gulf country in 1948, when Israel declared its independence and fought a war with Arab states. At that time, Jewish communities, some with ancient roots, could be found across the Arab world.
The series is being aired during Ramadan, when viewership soars after Muslims break the daylong fast. It’s like the Super Bowl for advertisers - even more so this year, when many people are stuck at home because of coronavirus lockdowns.
The show portrays Jews and Muslims living together in peace and even features a romance between a Jewish woman and a Muslim man. Relations deteriorate after the creation of Israel, when some Jews rally to the Zionist cause and Muslims side with the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948.
In the years after the creation of Israel, Jews across the Middle East faced heightened persecution and hundreds of thousands emigrated to the new state. Once-thriving Jewish communities dwindled to only a handful of elderly holdouts or disappeared altogether.
Another Saudi-made series, “Exit 7,” has also struck a nerve.
A clip shared widely on social media features a debate between two main characters in which one defends the Palestinian cause while the other says he would be happy to do business in Israel. He accuses the Palestinians of being ungrateful for Saudi support and says they would attack the kingdom if they could.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stir-crazy nation starts reopening even as COVID-19 cases rise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington | Donald Trump, America’s most prominent cabin-fever sufferer, is busting out after almost two months holed up inside the White House.
The president left Washington on Friday (Saturday AEST) for Camp David in Maryland where he spent the weekend huddling with close advisers, including his daughter Ivanka, ahead of what’s expected to be a flurry of campaign stops.
On Sunday night (Monday AEST), Mr Trump will fly back to the capital for a “virtual town hall” prime-time dusk event at the Lincoln Memorial hosted and broadcast by the Fox News Channel. Two days later Mr Trump is expected to fly to Phoenix, Arizona, ahead of another trip to Ohio.
The presidential shift from home-body to restless traveller reflects a broader change of mood across the US and exacerbates the mixed messages many Americans are getting from their leaders about whether to stay locked down.
It's happening amid growing signs people are losing patience with the shutdowns and are becoming more willing to expose themselves to infection if it eases economic pain that has seen more than 30 million people lose their jobs in the past five weeks.
Risk-taking is becoming visibly more common in daily life.
The Australian Financial Review observed last week a group of men cutting down an oak tree; when the five men stopped for a coffee break they sat shoulder-to-shoulder in a circle, none wearing protective masks or making any apparent effort to socially distance. Running trails in Maryland and on The Mall in central Washington DC are as packed on weekends and evenings as they were during the pre-pandemic days.
Warm spring-time weather may be accelerating the desire among people to drop their guard, especially given the lack of enforcement. Unlike in Australia, where those caught breaking the rules face hefty fines, America’s shutdowns are largely self-regulated.
Growing COVID-19 fatigue is perhaps exacerbated by the fact that even after months of being told to “shelter at home”, official numbers don’t appear to be improving.
US confirmed cases leapt 3.2 per cent, or by 34,000 people, on Saturday, 2000 fewer than the same day a week earlier, but still a far higher rate than what other countries have experienced almost one month after reaching their peak numbers.
Worryingly for the nation’s food chains, the fastest growth in new infections are mostly in states with large meat-packing plants - Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota.
America’s expected peak in deaths has again been revised upwards, after the 2902 fatalities recorded on Friday. More lives were lost on that one day, the most deadly so far in the pandemic, than during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
A closely watched University of Washington state model predicts 72,433 will have died by August 4. Others, such as Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson, believe total deaths will hit 100,000 by about May 25, from 64,900 on Saturday.
The biggest fear is that America’s restive population will end up making that number even larger. Adding to the difficulties are the broad differences in approaches around the country, with politics increasingly clashing against the advice of scientists and health officials who want the shutdowns to continue.
At least 30 states have started easing restrictions, unveiling a confusing patchwork of business-by-business changes
Jurisdictions that have already allowed many businesses to reopen include Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, but others – like Washington DC and neighbouring Maryland and Virginia – are holding on for fear they are still on the up-slope of infections and deaths. That means America’s capital may not reopen until the summer months, in late June or early July, city officials said last week.
Meanwhile protests continue to erupt. No fewer than 10 states saw citizens take to the streets on Friday to demand and end to stay-at-home orders and business restrictions.
Billionaire Elon Musk called the stay-at-home orders “fascist” and an “outrage” and tweeted last week “Give people their freedom back!”
Gordon Flake, CEO of the Perth USAsia Centre at The University of Western Australia is a former Republican from Arizona who became an Australian six years ago. He suggests the growing divisions in the nation over the pandemic reflect the inability of “Americans to benchmark themselves against the rest of the world”.
“Normally crises bring people together," he said, citing the example of New Zealand and Australia. The former has a left-wing prime minister, Australia a conservative one, "but science has won out in both cases".
"In the US, it’s a complete divergence from reality; they cannot agree on what the science says."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Secretary-General of the Teachers' Union Yaffe Ben David sent a letter to the teaching staff ahead of the expected return to school. In her letter she mentioned three of the key issues she intended to address.
At-risk teaching staff will be provided the option of not returning to work at the expense of sick days and with medical approval from a family physician.
Teachers with at-risk nuclear family members (spouse or children) will also be allowed to refrain from attending work at the expense of sick days and upon presentation of medical certificates approved by a family physician.
Teachers with children of up to six years of age with nowhere to place their offspring for the duration of the workday flooded the Ministry of Education with their predicament. The Ministry said it would hold a discussion on the issue and provide an update later tonight.
"We understand the many difficulties you are facing these days, and will continue to accompany you in the challenging times we are all experiencing [while] safeguarding your rights," the Secretary-General wrote.
Earlier this week, Arutz Shevareported that Israeli government ministers decided to allow the first three grades of elementary schools and last two grades of high schools to resume studies starting this coming Sunday, while preschools and kindergartens are to remain closed for an additional week.
Grades 4-10 will be opened up gradually during the month of May.
In haredi schools, however, learning will resume next week for grades 6-8 and 11-12, instead of grades 1-3.
Cities where regular school studies will not be returning to normal starting this week are: Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak, Be'er Sheva, Ramat Hasharon, Tzfat, Carmiel, Kiryat Malachi, Kiryat Gat and Beit Shemesh and Jerusalem neighborhoods under lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ramadan TV series about Gulf Jews ignites controversy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JERUSALEM (AP) — A television series aired by a Saudi broadcaster during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan has sparked controversy by offering a positive depiction of a Jewish community in the Gulf at the time of Israel’s creation.
Critics say it and another series aired on the network promote normalization with Israel even as the Palestinian cause is under threat by President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, which heavily favors Israel and would allow it to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank.
Relations between Israel and Arab Gulf states have quietly improved in recent years as they have come to see Iran as a shared threat and as Arab leaders have sought to curry favor with the Trump administration. Most TV shows in the Arab world are made by private companies, but producers must heed red lines set by the region’s autocratic rulers.
“Umm Haroun,” Arabic for the mother of Aaron, is set in an unnamed Gulf country in 1948, when Israel declared its independence and fought a war with Arab states. At that time, Jewish communities, some with ancient roots, could be found across the Arab world.
The series is being aired during Ramadan, when viewership soars after Muslims break the daylong fast. It’s like the Super Bowl for advertisers — even more so this year, when many people are stuck at home because of coronavirus lockdowns.
The show portrays Jews and Muslims living together in peace and even features a romance between a Jewish woman and a Muslim man. Relations deteriorate after the creation of Israel, when some Jews rally to the Zionist cause and Muslims side with the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948.
Advertising
In the years after the creation of Israel, Jews across the Middle East faced heightened persecution and hundreds of thousands emigrated to the new state. Once-thriving Jewish communities dwindled to only a handful of elderly holdouts or disappeared altogether.
Another Saudi-made series, “Exit 7,” has also struck a nerve.
A clip shared widely on social media features a debate between two main characters in which one defends the Palestinian cause while the other says he would be happy to do business in Israel. He accuses the Palestinians of being ungrateful for Saudi support and says they would attack the kingdom if they could.
The shows have prompted online calls for a boycott of MBC, the private, Saudi-owned satellite channel airing them. The Cairo-based Union of Arab Television Producers said they should be cancelled, calling them “cheap works” meant to “brainwash” the Arab people.
The makers of “Umm Haroun” insist they have no political agenda.
“I wanted to write this drama to deliver the message that our societies were much more tolerant than they are today, and people should go back to the same values,” Ali Shams, the head writer, told The Associated Press.
“We differentiate between Jews and Israel,” he said. “Israel occupied Palestine and committed atrocities against the Palestinian people.”
Advertising
Producer Emad al-Enazy said the series was developed by MBC as well as Kuwaiti and Emirati production companies, with no governments involved.
“Our work has nothing to do with politics or normalization,” he said. “The Palestinian cause is our cause.”
For decades, Arab media have portrayed Israel and Jews as one and the same, frequently employing anti-Semitic tropes. But in recent years, show-runners have taken renewed interest in Middle Eastern Jewish communities and pushed back against perceptions of the Arab world as intolerant and close-minded.
“The Jewish Quarter,” an Egyptian series aired in 2015, offered a positive portrayal of the pre-1948 Jewish community in Cairo and featured a love story between a Jewish woman and an Egyptian army officer. The deterioration of relations was largely blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood group, which in recent years has been the target of an unprecedented crackdown by Egypt’s government. This year, Egypt has come under fire for airing a Ramadan sci-fi drama predicting Israel’s destruction.
In Syria, a number of serials aired since the onset of the civil war have portrayed Jews and Christians in a positive light and blamed any sectarian strife on Western or Israeli meddling — a view that aligns with the government’s portrayal of the 2011 uprising as a foreign plot.
“The goal was to show how a mosaic of religious life was integral to the Syrian community prior to the onslaught of the West,” says Rebecca Joubin, a professor at Davidson College who wrote a book about Syrian television dramas.
Joe Khalil, a professor at Northwestern University of Qatar and a former television producer, says the annual Ramadan line-up is always a “balancing” act.
“The programs should appeal to advertisers, respect the religious context, and often do advance political agendas,” he said.
The two series have fed into longstanding tensions between the Palestinians and their critics in the Gulf, where many never forgave the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for supporting Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Those tensions have boiled over on social media in recent days under the trending hashtags “Palestine is not my cause” and “Palestine is my cause.” Saudis have depicted the Palestinians as violent ingrates, while Palestinians have accused their Arab critics of selling them out.
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states welcomed the Trump administration’s diplomatic efforts when the plan was announced in January while insisting they remain committed to a negotiated two-state solution.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said last week that the online insults did not represent the official position of either side.

“Saudi Arabia has always stood alongside us and has always supported us in the international arena,” he said.
Prince Turki al-Faisal, a prominent member of the Saudi ruling family and a former intelligence chief, denied there was any push for normalization in a prime-time interview that also ran during Ramadan.
“The main promoters of this idea of normalization are Israel, the leftist Palestinian organizations and other movements that are hostile to the kingdom,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus | Saudi to take ‘strict, painful’ measures to deal economic with impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Arabia will take strict and painful measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV, adding that “all options for dealing with the crisis are open”.
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply”, Mr. Jadaan said in comments published on Saturday ahead of the interview’s broadcast. No details of possible measures were given.
The world’s largest oil exporter is suffering from historically low oil prices, while measures to fight the new coronavirus are likely to curb the pace and scale of economic reforms launched by Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia’s central bank foreign exchange reserves fell in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years, hitting their lowest since 2011, while the kingdom slipped to a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenues collapsed.
Mr. Jadaan noted the country had introduced stimulus measures aimed at preserving jobs in the private sector and safeguarding the provision of basic services.
Earlier this week he said Riyadh could borrow around $26 billion more this year and would draw down up to $32 billion from its reserves to finance the deficit.
On Saturday he said withdrawals from the kingdom’s cash reserves this year must not exceed a total of between 110 billion riyals ($29 billion) and 120 billion, as specified in the budget.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MLB owners to discuss draft length this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — Major League Baseball owners will discuss a length for the amateur draft thisweek and are likely to start the selections on the original date of June 10, a person familiar with the deliberations told The Associated Press.
Teams and the players’ association agreed March 26 to a deal that allowed MLB to cut the draft from 40 rounds to as few as five this year and 20 next year, part of a plan to deal with the new coronavirus pandemic that delayed the start of the season and slashed revenue. As part of the agreement, the sides agreed to leave the assigned slot values of draft signing bonuses at the same level in 2020 and 2021 as they were last year.
That left the total of slot values for a 10-round draft this year at $265.5 million, including $29.6 million for rounds six through 10.
MLB proposed to the union that it would guarantee a 10-round draft in exchange for the slot values for rounds 6-10 being cut by 50%. The union rejected that plan, a person familiar with the decision said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the move was not announced.
The union’s decision to reject the plan was first reported by The Athletic and the move to keep the draft on June 10 by the New York Post.
Rather than resume negotiations, teams intend to debate the size of the draft and make a decision, the person said.
Signing bonus pools started in 2012 and limit the amount of money teams can spend. Each slot in the first 10 rounds is a signed a value — the range last year was $8,415,300 down to $142,200 — and each team’s values are added to a form a pool. Signing bonuses in the first 10 rounds count against the pool along with the amounts above $125,000 of players selected after the 10th round or who were bypassed in the draft and then signed.
A team that exceeds it pool is taxed, and a club more than 5% above loses a first-round draft pick the next year — a threshold never reached.
As part of the March agreement, players and teams agreed that any draft-eligible player not selected this year or next would be limited to a signing bonus of no more than $20,000.
MLB’s offer that the union rejected included an additional limit of only five bypassed players at up to $20,000, with the rest held to a maximum of $5,000.
The union agreed in March that signing bonuses can be deferred: up to $100,000 will be due within 30 days of approval, and 50% of the rest payable on July 1 in each of the following two years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government has asked both private and public sector banks to keep their systems and processes ready to disburse Rs 500 to over 200 million women Jan-Dhan account holders each from Monday, which is part of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore Prime Minister Jan Kalyan Yojana package announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26, officials said.
In order to help the poor in this difficult time when livelihoods of most of them have been disrupted due to teh lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, the government had decided to give an ex-gratia of Rs 500 per month for three months from April.
The money will be released by the ministry of rural development (MoRD) directly in the bank accounts of over 200 million accounts, hence banks have been asked to provide for enough cash in their branches and ATMs so that the beneficiaries should not face any hassle and social distancing is maintained, the officials said requesting anonymity.
In order to avoid rush it is suggested to disburse money on the basis of last digit of individual accounts in a particular day, they said. The first Monday is fixed for account numbers ending with 0 and 1. Likewise for account numbers ending with 2-3 on Tuesday, 4-5 on Wednesday, 6-7 on Friday and 8-9 on the next Monday. Based on the plan, banks are advised to inform account holders through SMS, they said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Port Bell vendors, residents puzzled as Lake Victoria submerges area</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Market vendors and residents living around Port Bell, Luzira are living in uncertainty because Lake Victoria has submerged the landing site.
Speaking to Uganda Radio Network (URN), traders and residents expressed worry over their lives as their homes and stalls are all flooded by water.
During URN’s visit to the landing site, a good number of houses, retail shops and food stalls were found plunged into water.
One needs a boat to maneuver from one place to another. In some areas only those with boots can walk from one end to another. But this is more of risking life as it is difficult to determine which side is deep.
Richard Ssembatya, who has been a resident of Port Bell for the last 17 years says they need urgent help since their lives are at risk. Ssembatya says lives of children are at a greater risk as they can easily drown.
Agnes Nantongo, also a resident and vendor says the little food she is selling is rotting as people fear going to buy from them. Before the lake plunged the place, Nantongo said they would sell sweet potatoes worth 80,000 shillings and avocados valued at 50,000 shillings.
Margret Kabagambe, a Born Again pastor in the area also cries foul as her church, house and food stall have been flooded by water. Kabagambe asks government to compensate them so that she can go back to her home village in Kyenjojo district.
Nzerena Nakayizza, who travels by boat from Mukono to Port Bell to sell raw food stuffs says for the 20 years she has been doing business at the landing, she had never seen Lake Victoria immersing the entire place.
She wonders how she will feed her family of seven children as her business has been hampered by the flooding. Nakayizza says she would make between 130,000 shillings to 200,000 shillings on good days which is no longer the case.
The Executive Director of National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Tom Okurut said the affected residents including vendors must leave the place before they are forcefully evicted. Okurut said diseases such as cholera are likely to hit the place, a reason they have ordered people to leave.
National Association of Professional Environmentalist – NAPE’s, David Kureeba says the rising Lake Victoria water levels is because of degraded forests and swamps and valleys that have silted to enable construction.
Water and Environment minister, Sam Cheptoris during a media briefing on Friday said the rise in water level has gone up from 12.00 meters to the current level of 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020.
Cheptoris said there are fears that the water could rise to 13.41, the highest ever recorded. The Lake is currently only 0.08 meters away from the highest level ever recorded in May, 1964 according to the minister.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway Q1 results: Buffett's company posts record net loss on coronavirus, operating profit rises</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday posted a record net loss of nearly $50 billion as the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments, but operating profit rose even as COVID-19 hurt its businesses.
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss totaled $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totaled $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire's net results that Buffett considers meaningless.
Nonetheless, Berkshire has loaded up on stocks in part because of Buffett's inability to find large companies to buy outright, a drought that has lasted more than four years and left Berkshire with about $137.3 billion of cash.
The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 20% in the first quarter but there were steeper falls in several large Berkshire holdings including American Express, Bank of America , Wells Fargo and four airlines -- American , Delta, Southwest and United.
Berkshire's operating businesses, like much of corporate America, were not unscathed by COVID-19, which hurt volumes at the BNSF railroad and forced retail businesses such as See's Candies to temporarily close stores.
Most of Berkshire's businesses have been hurt by the pandemic, with effects so far ranging from "relatively minor to severe," and revenues of businesses deemed "essential" have slowed "considerably" in April, the company said.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that a few small Berkshire businesses might close altogether.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Businesses Are Using VR To Survive The COVID-19 Era</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COVID-19 has changed life and commerce more than many business leaders predicted. The scar of quarantining and recession will continue to be seen well into the 2020s.
Many businesses across the globe are wondering how much longer they’ll survive the pandemic. Fifty-four percent of small businesses in the U.S. have either temporarily closed or report that they could soon be closing in the coming weeks. And in China, 460,000 businesses have closed permanently within the first quarter alone.
To make it through the pandemic, businesses are embracing digitization more than ever before. Across all industries, increasing numbers of companies are adopting videoconferencing tools and project management platforms to provide their employees with remote work options. Grocery stores are seeing more downloads of their grocery delivery apps. And more universities are offering virtual learning models.
One primary type of technology is jumping back in the spotlight during the pandemic: augmented reality and virtual reality. Here are some ways businesses are using these technologies to survive and thrive during coronavirus.
Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on housing markets and the real estate industry. But with VR, real estate agents and landlords have a golden opportunity to prosper, even during the pandemic.
Chinese startup Beike (Ke.com) has developed VR to let potential buyers and renters take virtual 3D tours of homes and apartments on the market. With almost 4 million houses currently available on its VR platform and 660 million people using it, VR is now an industry disruptor.
The company’s digitization efforts have also led to other efficiencies, including a real estate database that precisely defines housing properties with 433 fields. Its platform enables homebuyers to sign contracts and complete transactions online without breaking quarantine.
The new culture of staying at home is causing unprecedented harm to the $2.5 trillion tradeshow industry. As exhibitions and conferences are being canceled worldwide, the damage is spilling over to other industries — especially hotels, restaurants, and airlines.
While hotels and airlines may have difficulty surviving without massive bailouts, the tradeshow industry can incorporate AR and VR to carry on. No, it won’t exactly be business as usual, but VR-based tradeshows could become even better than what they’ve been in person.
Many companies are using VR platforms that enable participants to join large conferences virtually. Avatars can appear over 360-degree live video feeds. All the knowledge of traditional real-world tradeshows can be shared without breaking quarantine orders.
Because VR-based tradeshows enable participants to join from other countries, this technology will likely stick around long after COVID-19 fears pass. The VR format could also encourage a larger number of experts to speak at conferences because it eliminates travel time, meal costs, and other traditional tradeshow expenses.
Even when consumers purchase products online, they often go to a brick-and-mortar retailer to see the physical products first. But these in-person trips to the store are crumbling under the weight of quarantine orders. The retail industry obviously needs to “innovate or die” as the coronavirus runs its course.
IKEA is using an AR app that lets consumers use their smartphone to see what a piece of furniture will look like in any room of their home. The app even includes a “visual search” capability. A user simply points his phone’s camera at any piece of non-IKEA furniture, and the app searches its database to show the user examples of IKEA furniture that look similar.
Other retailers are using AR to let consumers see what they’d look like wearing a particular piece of clothing or eyeglasses without trying them on in person. Many shoppers are now able to accurately preview themselves in a certain shade of lipstick or hair color before ordering these items online.
There’s no end to the possible use cases for VR and AR during the current pandemic. In healthcare, doctors and surgeons use VR to view detailed scans of a patient’s anatomy without the patient being present. In the education field, classes and labs are increasingly being conducted at a distance, as if the entire class is in the same room. And think of the travel industry, which can offer virtual tours of almost any site or attraction on earth.
The bottom line is that digitization is no longer optional. As society continually changes with new realities like quarantining, only the most innovative businesses are surviving.
It’s crucial to think of ways to bring your customer to your products, even if your customer never leaves her home. It’s also important to think of new ways to virtually bring your employees to work, conferences, and events.
If you can find new ways to deliver value and convenience, all at a distance, you’ll likely thrive as a business operating in the era of COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Smartphone sales in India hits zero in April, May too hot to handle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The extended lockdown in India has resulted in zero shipments for the smartphone players in India in the month of April as factories are shut and it will take two-four weeks time for the manufacturing units to resume normal operations once lockdown is relaxed.
The month of March saw a steep annual decline in smartphone shipments, at 19%, due to COVID-19 nationwide lockdown from March 24.
Since then, factories are closed, retail shops are shut and online sellers are busy delivering groceries and other essential items. Result: April has seen almost zero sales.
“We see zero activity on smartphone shipments part in April and lockdown now entering May amid uncertainties, the Q2 2020 is going to be real challenging for the smartphone makers in the country,” Tarun Pathak, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research, told IANS.
“We have been hearing some absolute essential sales happened behind the scenes during the lockdown but yes, those will be in hundreds as against potential 11-12 million smartphone sales which happen in a normal month,” Pathak added.
All smartphone brands — from Samsung to Xiaomi to Realme — suspended manufacturing/assembling at their respective plants in the country almost from March 20 onwards.
At Realme, there has been a complete suspension on sales and manufacturing since the first 21-day lockdown was announced.
“As per the government directives, our Greater Noida facility in Uttar Pradesh suspended operations from March 21, along with sales coming to a halt. We also postponed our Narzo series launch event and a few Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIOT) products that were scheduled for April,” Madhav Sheth, Vice President, Realme and Chief Executive Officer, Realme India, told IANS.
“The bigger uncertainty comes on the demand side. If the nation’s economy and people’s income got hampered, then the smartphone demand in 2020 may not be optimistic. We will need to evaluate further how the economy recovers post the market reopen,” Sheth added.
In a mobile-first nation, the mobile is a crucial gateway that empowers consumers with communication as well as education, retail, payments, entertainment.
According to Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR, during the lockdown, consumers with faulty phones were in a quandary as they could not replace or repair it.
“Retailers lost out on a window of over five weeks without any sales. Once we move beyond the lockdown, we will see a reset in retail strategies, with social distancing norms in place. Online channels will seek to attract consumers with discounts to clear existing inventory,” Ram told IANS.
“Over the mid- and long-term, online to offline will emerge as a sustainable strategy, with consumers placing orders online and fulfilling it at offline retail stores,” he added.
If lockdown persists for the month of May while staggered opening of the economy takes it own sweet time, smartphone makers will have no option but to write off Q2 2020 from their list — a big blow amid supply-demand uncertainty that may last for several months, usurping the all-important festival season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19 pandemic’s long-term pain is just becoming clear to markets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The best month for global equities in almost a decade has given way to a poor start to May, stoking the debate on whether the recent surge appropriately accounted for a financial landscape utterly changed by the pandemic.
The latest hit to investor sentiment came from an unlikely source — megacap tech duo Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Both reported results that demonstrated resiliency during the economic shutdown, but warned that predicting what comes next is particularly fraught. President Donald Trump also rattled markets by reviving his trade dispute with China as he seeks to blame the nation for the virus’s spread. U.S. stock futures fell 2% as of 7:43 a.m. in New York.
That news landed in an economy deeply altered by the virus. An indisputable takeaway is a massive expansion in global debt — given the more than $8 trillion in fiscal measures worldwide, according to a Bloomberg compilation. Corporate balance sheets will have changed, as CFOs seek to bolster their capital through equity and debt raisings. Millions will have lost their jobs at least for a time, and labor mobility between nations may be impaired. And supply lines will be reshaped, at least in some fashion.
Depending on how it all shakes out, there will be implications for corporate earnings and interest rates that will affect investment decisions for years if not decades to come, some analysts are now saying. Should the epidemic continue to ebb, that’s set to become the key debate in markets as the year progresses.
“The high debt levels across all sectors and large-scale nationalization of the economy will, in absence of an exit plan, restrain investment and reduce productivity in the long run, giving rise to secular stagnation or at some point stagflation,” said Commerzbank AG strategist Christoph Rieger. “Corporates will have to shoulder a large part of the bill.”
Corporate Action
Even as they cheer news about economies reopening and progress on medical solutions for the coronavirus, investors are being diluted by corporate capital raising. And the biggest source of demand for shares in recent years — companies themselves — are unlikely to return to their previous pace of buybacks for years, if ever, according to Inigo Fraser-Jenkins and fellow analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein.
A deeper change could be sustained support for payments to portions of the labor force that have been severely affected by the crisis or at the fringes of economic prosperity in recent decades. As Stephen King, senior economic adviser at HSBC Holdings Plc, put it, there could be “pressure to deliver new domestic ‘social contracts,’” not unlike occurred after World War II — when Europe built welfare systems and the U.S. enacted the GI Bill.
A new broad set of commitments “would be affordable only with a sizeable increase in the tax burden on corporations, high earners and the wealthy,” King wrote in an April 23 note. “To raise such taxes may require worldwide income-tax regimes for a country’s citizens (in line with existing U.S. tax policy) and significant restrictions on the mobility of wealth and capital.”
State Role
A stronger long-term role for the state is emerging in other aspects, as well. The long-term trend of privatizing public-sector enterprises “could now be slowed or even reversed,” Deutsche Bank AG wealth-management investment chiefs say.
“State ownership of industry will force a new debate on the role of competition and profit margins,” Christian Nolting and Markus Muller wrote in an April 29 note. “All this will create major challenges for economies and investors, but also opportunities.”
As for investors in government bonds, given how debt levels will have expanded versus GDP — the Congressional Budget Office says the U.S. government’s ratio could hit 101% by the end of this fiscal year, from 79% last year — it’s unlikely policy makers will let interest rates exceed inflation. So-called financial repression also helped major nations run down debt after WWII.
The surge in borrowing has also revived the debate about central banks directly monetizing government financing. At the end of the day, however, that simply swaps one type of obligation — government bonds — for another: reserves deposited with the central bank, as Commerzbank’s Rieger puts it.
“In the end, the asset side of central bank balance sheets will consist of giant quantities of low-yielding debt — inhibiting rate increases for decades,” he wrote.
Creative Destruction
Net-net, lower borrowing costs ought to be good for companies, and equity valuations in particular. Stephen Jen, who runs hedge fund and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital, argues it “ought to be a major tailwind” for strong firms with good balance sheets. But his take suggests not all will benefit — something Deutsche Bank AG wealth-management investment chiefs agree with.
“Those sectors better able to innovate and adapt to the new post-coronavirus world will fare better; ‘creative destruction’ could force corporate failure and defaults elsewhere,” Nolting and Muller wrote. “Corporate earnings are likely to fall further than current consensus estimates.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hyundai India has recorded an exports sales of 1341 units in the month of April and domestic sales stand nil because of the nationwide lockdown caused by Coronavirus pandemic. The export shipping process was conducted while taking all preventive measures and safety guidelines set by the government to ensure protection for everyone.
Last month, the company recorded 26300 units in domestic sales and 5979 units in exports sales. That makes a combined total of 32279 units including the domestic and export output. If we compare the April figures with March, we can see a drastic decline in the output. And the courtesy goes to the nationwide lockdown initiated to curb the spread of COVID-19. Maruti Suzuki has also recorded zero sales in the month of April and many manufacturers will be experiencing a similar situation even after the lockdown is lifted. It will be a slow and gradual curve to normalcy.
Manufactures like Ducati, Mercedes, and BMW have already launched their online portal to help customers browse and purchase vehicles by staying at home. These online services will further strengthen the social distancing initiative taken to minimize the risk of contracting the Coronavirus.
However, the lockdown has been extended by two weeks with some relaxation in the orange and green zones. Manufacturers are also launching sanitation and disinfection services for their customers after the lockdown is lifted. This will keep the customers at ease regarding their safety and protection while travelling after the lockdown is over.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Says Berkshire Is Reversing Course on Airlines—Again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett is reversing course on his airlines bet -- again.
The billionaire investor said Berkshire Hathaway Inc. completely exited its stakes in the four major U.S. airlines. The sales of shares of Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. made up most of the company’s $6.5 billion in equity sales in April.
During his live-streamed annual meeting, Buffett said the business has fundamentally changed following the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. He declined to blame the performance of the airline executives, saying they’ve done a good job of raising money to get through the crisis.
“The world changed for airlines and I wish them well,” Buffett said Saturday. He clarified that he made the decision and that he lost money on his investments. “That was my mistake.”
Buffett’s had a complicated relationship with the airline industry over the years. After a troublesome investment in USAir, Buffett joked that he would call an 800 number to declare he was an “air-o-holic” if he ever got the urge to invest in airlines again.
Then in 2016, Berkshire dove into the industry again, amassing stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines. At the end of 2019, those stakes amounted to almost $10 billion. Buffett’s renewed faith in the industry prompted speculation that he might one day own one of the carriers.
But now, he’s cut those investments again. Berkshire disclosed in April that it had at least trimmed its Delta and Southwest stakes, both of which had previously been above a 10% ownership level.
“The airline business -- and I may be wrong and I hope I’m wrong -- but I think it’s changed in a very major way,” Buffett said. “The future is much less clear to me.”
The disclosure was among the most significant at the annual meeting, which was notable for its different feel this year as the event that usually draws tens of thousands was hosted virtually. Buffett, 89, shared the stage with a top deputy, Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire’s non-insurance operating units. Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, didn’t join, though Buffett said his longtime business partner was in good health.
Buffett said he didn’t know how consumer travel habits will change after the pandemic subsides, but any reduction in travel could leave airlines with higher-than-necessary fixed costs. Any impact could filter down to suppliers like Boeing Co.
“The real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not,” he said.
Buffett said the efforts to slow the pandemic amounted to “quite an experiment,” and while the range of public health and economic outcomes has narrowed, they remain “enormous.”
“I don’t know the consequences” of shutting down large parts of the U.S. economy, Buffett said, though Berkshire’s operating earnings will be “considerably less” than if the virus hadn’t hit.
Buffett gave an extended history lesson to back up his assertion that “nothing basically can stop America.” He said he’s still bullish on the U.S. economy because it has overcome many obstacles over the past two centuries, though “we haven’t faced anything that quite resembles this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lockdown | Allow districts with high economic activity to resume all industrial, business operations: CII</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Districts with substantial economic activity should be permitted to resume all industrial and business operations with highest safety protocols for enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses, CII said on Sunday.
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) called for economic contribution of districts to be taken into consideration while classifying lockdown zones.
Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations, including in containment zones with highest safety protocols, said CII in its report titled ‘A Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Areas’, submitted to the government.
The government notification of May 1 has permitted industrial estates, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of red zones to commence operations.
The industry body said that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well.
 
It has recommended that close surrounding areas can be classified as orange zones where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.
The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart, according to CII.
“The third phase of lockdown necessitates a focused strategy to minimize economic contraction due to COVID-19, without compromising on efforts to control the contagion. Prioritising districts with heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations accompanied by strictest precautions can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses,” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
While the protracted lockdown in the country, necessitated by the rapid spread of COVID-19, has helped in controlling the spread of epidemic and given us time to augment medical capacity, it has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses, the chamber said.
CII has requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to the country’s GDP, or presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.
Instead of the current practice of classifying the entire district as a red zone, CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as Containment, Orange and Green within an industrial district.
 
Economic activities, in varying degrees of relaxation, should be permitted in all areas of those districts, but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone, the chamber suggested.
It said the containment zone may be a street, mohalla or factory building where positive cases have been detected.
In containment zones, industrial units where no positive cases exist, can be allowed to operate if workers can be restricted to the premises or within walkable distance, as per the CII note. Raw materials and finished goods should be disinfected and kept separately for 72 hours before use as permissible by the health authorities.
Maximum precautions and safety measures in the form of masks, repeated sanitation, restricted movement of people and vehicles, and group testing, among others, can be carried out regularly in such containment zones, noted CII.
“Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from Red to Orange and Green within 21 days. The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE, Masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration,” said Mr. Banerjee.
 
CII also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.
Green zones within an industrial district, on other hand, should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but following strictly the health and safety protocols prescribed by the health authorities.
There should be a real time availability of data on all types of zones within the industrial districts. The authorities may also provide updated information on Aarogya Setu app, other apps, local newspapers, radio, TV and online channels, according to the chamber.
It also prescribed standard operating procedures for offices, workplaces, factories and establishments prior to resuming operations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CII For Greater Industrial Activities In Districts With High Economic Performance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India Business
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 16:39 IST
At a time when the government has decided to provide some relaxations in restrictions during the third phase of the nationwide lockdown starting from May 4, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday called for greater industrial activities in districts with high economic performance.
The industry body also called for "economic contribution of districts to be taken into consideration while classifying lockdown zones".
"Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations, including in containment zones with highest safety protocols," CII said in a report, 'Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Area'.
The suggestions followed the notification, issued on May 1 by the government, on graded exit from the coronavirus-related lockdown.
The third phase of lockdown necessitates "a focused strategy to minimise economic contraction due to Covid-19", without compromising on efforts to control the contagion, the trade body said in a statement. "Prioritising districts with heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations, accompanied by strictest precautions, can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
The industry body also said while the protracted lockdown in the country, necessitated by the rapid spread of Covid-19, has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses.
In its strategy note, it requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to country's GDP, or the presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.
Instead of the current practice of categorising the entire district as a 'red zone', the CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as 'containment', 'orange', and 'green' within an industrial district.
"Economic activities, in varying degrees of relaxation, should be permitted in all areas of this district but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone," it said.
The containment zone may be a street, "mohalla" or factory building where positive cases have been detected, the industry body said.
It has suggested that close surrounding areas can be classified as 'orange zones' where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring. The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart, the industry body said.
"Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from 'red' to 'orange' and 'green' within 21 days.
"The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE, masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss, if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration," Banerjee said.
The government has permitted industrial estates, SEZ and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of 'red zones' to commence operations. "CII submitted that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well," the statement said.
The body also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.
'Green' zones within an industrial district, on other hand, should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but in adherence to strict health and safety protocols prescribed by the authorities.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Districts with substantial economic activity should be permitted to resume all industrial and business operations with highest safety protocols for enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses, CII said on Sunday.

Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations, including in containment zones with highest safety protocols, said CII in its report titled 'A Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Areas', submitted to the government.

The government notification of May 1 has permitted industrial estates, special economic zone (SEZ) and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of red zones to commence operations.
The industry body said that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well.
It has recommended that close surrounding areas can be classified as orange zones where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thyssenkrupp sees coronavirus cash squeeze despite elevator sale: letter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) expects the coronavirus crisis to cause a new financial squeeze, scuppering hopes that selling its elevator business would deliver a swift cash respite for the embattled firm, its management board told staff in a letter.
The elevator division was sold in February to ease financial pressure on the conglomerate which has struggled for years after ill-fated investments. But the coronavirus crisis has dealt a blow before cash from that sale arrives in June.
Sources said last week that Thyssenkrupp had secured about 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) in state aid to tide it over until sale proceeds arrive.
“In the medium term, the cash outflows caused by the corona (crisis) will in all likelihood result in the financial leeway created by the sale of the elevator business becoming much lower than what was originally anticipated,” the board wrote to staff.
“We are preparing solutions for this,” according to the April 30 letter signed by Chief Executive Martina Merz that was seen by Reuters and first reported by German daily Handelsblatt.
Thyssenkrupp agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and Germany’s RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros in February, with proceeds expected to be received in June.
A source said the loan from state development bank KfW would assist the conglomerate, which has suffered from slow demand for auto parts after carmakers shut down production because of the pandemic. The loan expires at the end of September
Car makers and suppliers have scrambled to shore up their liquidity as sales in Europe tumbled by more than 50% in March.
Thyssenkrupp has been pummelled in recent years by a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure. Its shares hit historic lows around 3.20 euros in mid-March.
As well as selling its elevator business, Thyssenkrupp’s restructuring involves seeking buyers for its Plant Technology division, which builds cement, chemicals and fertiliser plants.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A woman alleges that Joe Biden made an inappropriate comment about her breasts more than a decade ago when she was 14 years old.
The allegation, first reported by Law & Crime, surfaces on the day that the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee gave his first personal public denial of allegations from Tara Reade, who accused him of sexually harassing and assaulting her when she worked in his Senate office in 1993.
Eva Murry, now 26 with two children, is the niece of Christine O’Donnell, a Delaware Republican who ran a long-shot Senate campaign against Biden in 2008 and against Democratic Sen. Chris Coons in 2010. Murry says the encounter with Biden occurred in 2008, when she accompanied her aunt at an annual party and roast attended by Delaware politicians, journalists, and business leaders called the First State Gridiron Dinner & Show. That year, the event was sometime around May, she said, and she was in middle school at the time.
“I remember walking into the lobby and being in awe of all the people in such fancy clothes,” Murry told Law & Crime. “Our two parties of people gravitated towards each other, and everyone started saying their hellos. When it was Biden and my aunt’s turn to say hello, he quickly turned to me and asked how old I was. I replied with my age, and he replied with the comment: ‘Fourteen? You’re very well endowed for 14!’ I was confused, but it was definitely weird. He looked me up and down and hovered his eyes on my chest, so I had some clue [about] the notion of his comment but didn’t fully understand at the time. We quickly separated from his area after the encounter.”
Three friends of Murry and her older sister told Law & Crime on the record that she told them about the incident within a few years after the 2008 dinner.
Victoria Anstey, a 25-year-old who said she is a feminist and a Democrat who "can't stand Trump," said Murry told her about the incident in 2008. Katielynn Weaver said that she met Murry after the incident, but that Murry told her about it in 2010. Aileen Callaghan also said that she heard she heard the story from Eva in 2010. A fourth friend, who refused to be named, said she also heard the story around 2010 or 2011.
Jenna Murry, Eva Murry's older sister, said that Murry told her about Biden's comment “within a week or so of the dinner.”
"Eva told me about the comment in detail from her perspective, specifically that he looked her up and down and stared right at her chest and made her feel really uncomfortable. I remember being really pissed off on her behalf and thinking that she was probably more upset than she was letting on and trying to be lighthearted by that point, but seemed shook. I told basically all my friends about it at the time," Jenna Murry said.
Murry went public with her allegation in an April 8 Facebook post, deciding to share the story after noticing so many people talking about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary. Initially, she shared it on others' posts, but then, she made a larger post.
“I think I was too naive to realize exactly what it meant at the time, but I vividly remember the uncomfortable feeling I had in the pit of my stomach during the whole encounter. It wasn’t Biden’s words alone that made me so uncomfortable, it was the look, the tone, the whole general vibe was off,” Murry said.
Biden's campaign did not provide comment on the allegations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Special Report: How a corporate PR machine is trying to kill a Wall Street tax</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Democratic presidential hopefuls descended on New Hampshire prior to the state’s Feb. 11 primary, John Tackeff was busy.
The 27-year-old attended candidate events across the state to raise concerns about a proposed tax on Wall Street financial transactions that much of the field supported. Bespectacled, unshaven and casually dressed, Tackeff wasn’t shy about asking questions.
At a Dec. 22 gathering with former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, Tackeff introduced a woman he said was his mother. Reuters could not verify her identity. Any tax on stock and bond trades would hurt seniors like her and parents trying to save for their children’s college, Tackeff said.
He also raised the issue at meetings hosted by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang, according to video of the four New Hampshire political events reviewed by Reuters.
Tackeff told the candidates he was part of a group called the Partnership to Protect Our Retirement Future. He declined to comment for this story.
But he was no ordinary citizen hanging out at campaign events with his mom, rather a professional political organizer, according to his LinkedIn profile. And the Partnership to Protect Our Retirement Future was the creation of a major Washington public relations firm.
That company, Locust Street Group, tried to create the impression of widespread voter opposition to a financial transaction tax as Democratic voters considered which candidate to nominate to face Republican President Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election.
Last year, Congressional lawmakers introduced four bills that would impose a tax on financial transactions of one kind or another. Some of those bills have prominent backers, including Democratic Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Brian Schatz and Chris Van Hollen, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  
Depending on how such a tax were structured, it could hit the profits of brokers, hedge funds and high-speed traders which process millions of transactions a day.
Locust Street has presented the Partnership as a group powered by average citizens. In fact, Locust Street has been orchestrating the effort on behalf of a client or clients whose identity has not been made public, according to a Reuters examination of Partnership materials, company records, public filings, social media, emails and interviews with people involved.
A Virginia retiree told Reuters she was approached by a Locust Street employee to “become involved as a background person” and paid a “stipend” for her efforts. A South Carolina school counselor said she was recruited to join the Partnership in February and later voiced her opposition to the tax at a campaign event for candidate Tom Steyer. A community organizer hired by Locust Street in December to push the Partnership in Iowa said she quit within weeks because she felt misled about “who we were actually working for.”
None of the three were told who is funding the Partnership, they told Reuters.
David Barnhart, founding partner of Locust Street Group, would not discuss the firm’s clients or say who is paying for the campaign.
“We have various stakeholders who are extremely interested in this issue, they came together and asked us to provide the strategy and the grassroots,” Barnhart said. “This is a really diverse coalition and it is comprised of stakeholders from all walks of life.”
Locust Street’s website boasts a suite of “grassroots” services it can provide to corporate clients, including ginning up supporters for their causes. An effort to disguise an orchestrated influence campaign as a spontaneous, grassroots movement while masking its true sponsors is often described as “astroturfing.”
Industries have employed the strategy for decades to battle regulation in a variety of areas — smoking bans in restaurants and bars is one example — by claiming to represent workers who allegedly would lose jobs or consumers who would be inconvenienced.
But some people familiar with astroturfing say Locust Street’s recent efforts were the first time they’ve seen it used in an attempt to influence a presidential primary.
“Targeting Democratic voters as a wedge issue, that’s unique,” said Susan Harley, deputy director for the Congress Watch division of Public Citizen, a liberal watchdog group based in Washington D.C. “We haven’t seen those voters be a target of this work before.”
Locust Street’s Barnhart, who worked on presidential campaigns for Democrats Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, said he believed campaigns that mobilize everyday people to raise issues with their elected officials are important for public policy.
“Strategically, we wanted this to be about the people, and I wanted people to be the face of this,” he said, adding: “These are issues that affect voters. Without these types of efforts they don’t hear about it.”
Barnhart confirmed that Tackeff, the Partnership representative in New Hampshire, was a contract employee.
Locust Street also tried to shape public opinion in Iowa, whose first-in-the-nation caucus was held on Feb. 3. The Partnership attempted to recruit Democratic officials to put their names to op-ed media commentaries declaring their opposition to any financial transaction tax because it allegedly would harm mom-and-pop savers by shrinking their retirement accounts.
Democrat John Norris, past chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party and a former Iowa gubernatorial candidate, showed Reuters an email he received in December from a Partnership representative seeking his help in that effort. Norris declined to participate.
He said it was the second time Locust Street had sought his help to torpedo the financial transaction tax. Norris said that in November, Locust Street contacted his public-policy consulting firm, Iowa-based State Public Policy Group (SPPG), about working on the campaign. Norris said SPPG took a pass because Iowa labor leaders do not oppose higher taxes for Wall Street firms. He said SPPG has performed work for Locust Street in the past.
Barnhart confirmed Locust Street approached SPPG but subsequently “went in a different direction.”
A website touting the Partnership’s efforts, retirementtax.org, exhorts readers to provide their personal information and sign what appears to be an online petition: “Help Us Defeat The Retirement Tax!” The website provides no contact details, address or information about who founded the Partnership. The site champions the interests of “plumbers, electricians…teachers” and other working people who allegedly would be hurt by a financial transaction tax.
Because Locust Street is a public relations firm, not a full-time lobbying shop, it rarely has to disclose who hires it. Barnhart confirmed that Locust Street did some work for embattled e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc, which had hired the firm to drum up popular support for its product among Juul customers in anticipation of regulatory bans following a rash of vaping-related injuries and deaths in the United States. Several media outlets reported on the arrangement last year.
The company also did polling work in 2019 and 2020 for the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future, a coalition of hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies that opposes universal health care programs such as “Medicare for All,” according to a press release issued by the healthcare group.
A spokesman for the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future declined to comment. Juul Labs Inc did not respond to requests for comment. 
Public Citizen’s Harley has been tracking the Partnership since it emerged towards the end of 2019. She said its polished effort is different from that of a true grassroots movement, particularly because its website does not solicit donations or provide any information about the group’s founders and backers.
“It really is a smoke and mirrors campaign,” Harley said.
Progressive Democratic candidates Warren and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders were among the earliest and most vocal proponents of a “tax on Wall Street” to help fund social programs and close yawning deficits created by Republican-led tax cuts under Trump.
But the idea caught on with centrists too. Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg put it in his tax plan. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a former investment banker, shocked his former industry by backing the tax.
Even Joe Biden, long seen as a friend to business, has voiced support for taxing trades of stocks and bonds. The former vice president is the presumptive Democratic nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 3 election.
The prospect of a tax on financial transactions has alarmed powerful business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
“With the populism that’s out there on the campaign trail, I think people are taking this a lot more seriously,” Tom Quaadman, an executive vice president focused on financial policy for the organization, said earlier this year. The Chamber opposes the tax but is not affiliated with the Partnership, he said.
Reuters contacted four other groups that have come out publicly against a financial transaction tax: the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Modern Markets Initiative, the Managed Funds Association and the American Retirement Association. All said they had no involvement with the Partnership. 
Brian Parks works as a “grassroots advocacy professional” for Locust Street. His job is to “identify and empower key activists” for the company’s clients, according to his biography on the Locust Street website.
Virginia retiree Eileen Greenberg said Parks, an acquaintance from her synagogue, approached her last year about becoming the director of a new venture that would fight the so-called retirement tax. Greenberg agreed, she told Reuters.
Company records show the Partnership was formed on Nov. 14 with Greenberg as its director. Greenberg said she had been helping with administrative tasks like going to the post office and collecting paperwork, for which she receives a “small stipend.” She declined to say how much.
“They have professionals that are going to be doing all of the political stuff,” said Greenberg. “There’s more to come but I’m not exactly sure…what exactly I’m doing,” she told Reuters earlier this year.
Parks confirmed that Greenberg had been paid for her work on the Partnership. He told Reuters that Locust Street hired a handful of staff for the Partnership in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — states whose early Democratic contests gave its voters significant influence in picking the nominee.
In such crucial early races, candidates compete for support at gatherings as small as a few dozen people. These intimate settings allow voters easy access to ask candidates questions and share their concerns with others present.
Tackeff, the face of the Partnership in New Hampshire, said in a Jan. 9 Twitter post that he had attended campaign events for every Democratic candidate. He has worked on a variety of political campaigns in the state, according to his LinkedIn profile.
As Tackeff was voicing his worries about a financial transaction tax in New Hampshire, Michele Dickerson, another political organizer, was airing hers in Iowa with a group called the West Des Moines Democrats. Representing the Partnership, she spoke about a “retirement tax” at the group’s Dec. 21 meeting, according to a post on the organization’s Facebook page.
Victor Dutchuk, president of the West Des Moines Democrats, told Reuters he had not heard of such a tax before that meeting. He said Dickerson’s presentation raised “a lot of concern” among members about potential harm to their retirement accounts.
Dickerson said she applied for her paid role as a “community organizer” through an online job advertisement placed by Locust Street. The ad, seen by Reuters, said it was seeking a registered Democrat in Iowa “to inject a key policy issue into the campaign dialogue surrounding the Democratic caucus.”
Dickerson said she resigned that contract job within roughly a month after growing suspicious as to the true nature of the Partnership.
“When I began, I felt great about what we were doing,” she said. “But the further along I got into the campaign, I became concerned that perhaps we were no longer attempting to influence policy, but rather influence an election outcome.”
Barnhart said that Dickerson had not understood that the purpose of the campaign “was to educate candidates on how damaging the tax would be to millions of Americans.”
Locust Street also hired Cornerstone Government Affairs to support the Partnership in Iowa by helping it to “navigate” events surrounding the caucus, Parks said.
Cornerstone is a Washington lobbying giant whose clients have included Google Inc, Boeing Co and Exxon Mobil Corp, according to federal lobbying disclosures.
David Adelman, a Cornerstone director at the firm’s Iowa office, wrote in an email to Reuters that the company had been working on the tax “as part of a campaign organized by the Partnership.” He would not elaborate on his role.
“We’ve seen a tremendous response here on the ground,” Adelman wrote.
Locust Street’s Parks would not say how many citizen volunteers had signed on to work with the Partnership. 
In response to a request from Reuters, he provided contact details for a school counselor in her early 20s from Charleston, South Carolina, who asked to be identified only by her first name: Danya.
Danya said she volunteered for the Partnership in February after being recruited by an acquaintance named Matthew Miller whom she met while both were in college. Miller works for a South Carolina PR and advocacy firm called SPEAK Strategic that does work for Locust Street, Parks confirmed.
Neither Miller nor SPEAK Strategic responded to requests for comment.
Danya said she attended several campaign events in her area, including a February gathering for candidate Steyer, the billionaire philanthropist, where she voiced her worries about the financial transaction tax. She told Reuters she had become “passionate” about the issue and was not paid for her efforts.
She said she was not aware of Locust Street’s involvement with the Partnership or who was funding it, but acknowledged it would be worthwhile to know that.
“I think it’s important to know…who is pushing for it for sure,” she added.
Parks also provided Reuters with contact details for a Nevada culinary worker named Shamar, who did not return calls.
In Iowa, Norris, the former state Democratic party chair, said a local PR firm also tried to recruit him to the effort.
He said he got a “cold call” in December from a Des Moines-based firm named LS2Group. Norris said an employee of that firm, Jordan Goode, told him she represented the Partnership and asked him to put his name to an op-ed her firm was drafting in opposition to the financial transaction tax.
In a follow-up email to Norris seen by Reuters, Goode said she hoped they could “work together to make this issue known among Iowans, community leaders, and presidential candidates.” The email did not mention Locust Street.
Goode did not respond to a request for comment. Joe Shannahan, Partner at LS2Group, confirmed that Goode approached Norris but did not respond to further requests for information.
Barnhart and Parks confirmed that LS2Group was providing Iowa-level expertise to Locust Street, including identifying people to write op-eds.
Reuters found nine op-eds opposing the tax, including several penned by current and former Democratic officials from Iowa and South Carolina. All echoed the Partnership’s talking points about how the tax could hurt retirees and pensioners.
Among them was a Jan. 5 piece by Phil Wise, a former Iowa Democratic state representative, that appeared in The Gazette, a Cedar Rapids newspaper.
Wise said he decided to write the piece after hearing through political colleagues that the transaction tax was stirring up voters in candidate town halls.
“It’s bubbling up,” he told Reuters in January.

    <h5 class="mb-1">For Fed Chair Powell, March was intense as response to Covid-19 intensified</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A half-hour staff meeting in a secure location.
A 40-minute consultation with an infectious disease specialist.
Multiple days of "unscheduled telephone calls from home with staff and other government officials," including Saturdays and Sundays.
These are just a few of the items on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's March calendar, released on Friday, that chronicle a dramatic shift from warily watching the coronavirus to an all-out effort to bring policymakers, government officials and lawmakers on board for an economic support effort of unprecedented size and scope.
Though the calendar gives no details on what was discussed, it suggests an explosion of activity at the US central bank unseen since the darkest days of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
Powell's sudden ramp-up in activity began on February 28, with a flurry of calls to his central banker counterparts at the European Central Bank, among others. Those calls - including a 17-minute one with the head of the central bank in China, where the coronavirus outbreak had begun - continued for another two days as the Fed prepared its first concrete response to the coronavirus crisis: an emergency interest rate cut on March 3.

But that was only the beginning of a month packed with an exceptional number of meetings, some of which were quite unusual by the standards of Fed chair calendars, published monthly with a lag of four to six weeks.
Take, for instance, a Friday, March 6, late-afternoon phone call with someone identified only as an "outside expert."
A Fed spokeswoman later said it was a telephone briefing with University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's infectious disease chief, Trish Perl.
Two days later, Powell held an hourlong Sunday morning meeting with fellow central bankers, and a second hourlong call that evening with staff.
The next day he and the staff met for a half hour in a "sensitive compartmented information facility," a secure room usually reserved for classified information.
Fed policymakers met the following Sunday, conferencing by video their far-flung colleagues who participated from Fed regional banks across the country.
They slashed interest rates to zero and launched the first of nearly a dozen lending and other programs designed to keep financial markets from imploding.
They also aimed to cushion the economy from the oncoming shock of mass layoffs and business closures as the country began to shut down to slow the spread of the virus, the extent of which has only lately become clear as states report 30 million people sought unemployment insurance over the past six weeks.
Over the course of March, as cases of the coronavirus mounted and policymakers began to express more public concern, Powell spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at least 11 times, the calendar shows. That is surely an undercount as the two worked out a range of corporate lending programs, some of which had never before been tried, to keep previously healthy businesses afloat.
Mnuchin told CNBC on March 26 that he had been speaking with Powell 30 times a day.

Powell met with two titans of markets: Larry Fink, chief executive of Blackrock and Ron O'Hanley, CEO of State Street. Both firms later were assigned roles helping to administer emergency Fed programs to help financial markets.
And he spoke with several lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who later said he had told her to "think big fiscally."
Congress passed a $2.3 trillion rescue package in late March that included grants to small business and loans to firms in critical industries, as well as cash payments to American households and for the newly unemployed.
Powell also spoke once with President Donald Trump on March 23, during which it was reported that Trump, usually a vociferous Powell critic, gave him rare praise.
Powell's calendar also shows how he personally adapted to stay-at-home orders that by the end of the month covered most of the US population.
Powell's last engagement that took place at the Fed's Washington headquarters was the March 15 policy-setting meeting. After that he worked from home every day that month, his calendar shows, including weekends.

Powell's calendar also shows how he personally adapted to stay-at-home orders that by the end of the month covered most of the U.S. population.
Powell's last engagement that took place at the Fed's Washington headquarters was the Mar 15 policy-setting meeting. After that he worked from home every day that month, his calendar shows, including weekends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Making right choices (1) - The Nation Nigeria News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
DEAR reader, Welcome to yet another time of refreshing in God’s presence. Many life changing events has taken place the last few months that have shaped the course of history around the world.
Thank God you are still standing strong; this goes to show that God has so much in store for you. This month, I shall be teaching on Making Right Choices.
I pray that your life will not remain the same after this teaching, in Jesus name! Henceforth, grace to make good choices is released upon you, in Jesus name!
Choice simply means to pick or decide between two or more possibilities. God has an equal destiny of greatness for all His children (Romans 8:28-30).
Yet, our individual choices are what distinguishes one person from another.  God predestinated you and your family for glory, but your choice in life determines whether you will arrive at that predestination or not.
No matter how long you live on earth, your years are broken down into months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
That means, whatever your assignment may be on earth to fulfil, you don’t have eternity to do so; you have only a season, so handle it well and maximise your days.
According to Zig Ziglar, Every choice you make has an end result. Whatever or wherever you are today, is a product of the choices you made yesterday.
Daily, you and I are confronted with choices that have to be made – whether to pray or not, what to pray about, what to eat, what to wear, where to go, what to buy, what to give etc.
Choices make a world of difference between success and failure, joy and sorrow, peace and chaos, life and death etc. And we put this principle to work on a daily basis even as it relates to the issues of marriage, family, career and business.
Choice is one of the fundamental principles of the Kingdom of God. Your choice can either be right or wrong. Whereas, making right choices leads you to the right destination; making wrong choices leads you to wrong destinations. Whichever one, you must accept responsibility for the choices that you make.
Choice is a very powerful instrument as it relates to establishing family life and there are certain fundamental truths we must understand about the power of choice.
We live in a world of choices
Whether you are male or female, single or married, widowed or divorced, on a daily basis, life presents before you choices to make. Choice of what to eat, where to live, what to wear, how to behave, what career to choose, what business to embark upon and who to marry etc. We live in a world of choices and you must understand that there is power in your choices.
You are a creature of choice
God gave us the gift of choice. Just as God will not think for you, the same way God will not choose for you. It is His wish for you to choose life that both you and your seed may live.
We see this clearly in God’s Word, I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live (Deuteronomy 30:19).
The simply means that God will not choose for you.  This principle works in every area even in marriage. You are constantly faced with choices as regards your spouse, children etc., your ability to make the right choices will determine the overall success of your family life.
God respects your choice
God honours the choices that you make. In Genesis, God brought all the animals and every creature to Adam giving him the choice to give names to all of them because God honours the choice of man.
The Bible says, And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof (Genesis 2:19).
The blind Bartimaeus heard about Jesus and he was crying, ‘Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy upon me’, but he needed to make a choice. Bartimaeus was crying for mercy. Jesus said, ‘What do you want me to do for you?’ Meaning what is your choice? Make a choice and then I will respect it.
We also have the story of the woman with the issue of blood. She has been in that condition for about 12 years until one day she made her choice for her situation to change.
She decided that she must touch the helm of the garment of Jesus. She said, ‘If only I may but touch the helm of His garment, I know I shall be made whole’.
What is your choice today? Do you want your family situation to change? Do you want a change in your marriage, career or in any other area of your life? The power of choice has been given to you.
Even the devil respects your choice
The devil respects your choice and he cannot reject the choices you make. For instance, when you gave your life to Jesus Christ; that is, the day you got born again, you automatically made your choice. You made a choice and the devil couldn’t say, ‘No! You can’t go yet’.
He was watching you. Now you are washed in the blood, and become a child of the Almighty God; the same way, when you make any choice today as regarding any area of your life, the devil cannot resist your choice.
Choices are powerful and they are the gift of God; so, when you make right choices in life, you find out that it will affect every other area of your life.
Your ability to choose right begins with your salvation. This is the first and best choice you have to make and every other choice can follow. If you are not born again and you want to do so, say this prayer in faith: Dear Lord Jesus Christ, I come to You today. I am a sinner.
Forgive me my sins and cleanse me with Your Blood. I accept You as my Lord and personal Saviour. Make me a child of God today. Thank You for delivering me from sin and satan to serve the living God and thank You for accepting me into Your Kingdom.
Congratulations! If you prayed this simple prayer of faith with me, you are now born again and a child of God. He loves you and will never leave you.
Read your Bible daily, obey God’s Word and seek Christian fellowship (John 14:21). With this, you are guaranteed all-round rest and peace, in Jesus name! Call or write to share your testimonies with me through oyedepofaitha@gmail.com, 07026385437 or 08141320204.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says the coronavirus cannot stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(This May 2 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of “towel” in second paragraph)
By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O).
Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co (AXP.N), to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

Over more than four hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday (Sunday AEST), Mr Buffett said his conglomerate had taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units and throwing in the towel on a multibillion-dollar bet on US airlines.
He remained keen on making a big acquisition, which he had not done since 2016, but had not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, with nearly two hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year's bear market, even if the pandemic got a second wind late this year.
Mr Buffett called dealing with the pandemic "quite an experiment" that had an "extraordinarily wide" range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans had persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American "magic" prevailed before and would do again.
"Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it," Mr Buffett said. "I will bet on America the rest of my life."
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Mr Buffett and vice-chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly two hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Mr Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Mr Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $US49.75 billion ($77.41 billion) first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealised losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America and Apple during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6 per cent, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19.
Mr Buffett said operating earnings would, through at least this year, be "considerably less" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire's cash stake ended the quarter at a record $US137.3 billion, though Mr Buffett said "we're willing to do something very big", perhaps a $US30 billion to $US50 billion transaction.
But it will not be in US airlines, after Mr Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its "entire positions" in the four largest: American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines Holdings.
He said he "made a mistake" investing in the sector, which the pandemic had changed "in a very major way" with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
"It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Mr Buffett calls "Woodstock for capitalists".
Mr Abel stood in for long-time vice-chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Mr Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Mr Buffett said Mr Munger was in "fine shape" and "good health", and looked forward to attending Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting.
Vice-chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Mr Abel lives closer to Omaha than Mr Munger and Mr Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Mr Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Mr Buffett's eldest son, Howard, would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Mr Buffett as chief investment officer.
Mr Abel told investors "I don't see the culture of Berkshire changing" after Mr Buffett and Mr Munger were no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totalled 391,539 at year end, though some businesses had furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire would not be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totalled about 30.3 million, or 18 per cent of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Mr Abel nonetheless said that in five years, "we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today".
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of long-time Berkshire holding American Express, to Berkshire's board, making him the company's first African American director.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday he would not rule out anything in a new relief bill to ease the “tremendous hardships” of the coronavirus outbreak, including more money for state and local governments and small businesses.
More than 30 million Americans have joined the unemployment benefit rolls over the past six weeks and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are discussing a fourth coronavirus relief bill.
Democrats are pushing for additional aid to help cities and states cope with lost revenue from a shut-down economy and some governors have warned of massive layoffs if they fail to get it.
Some advisers to Republican President Donald Trump have said the need for another stimulus bill is not yet clear. But Kudlow said “there may well be additional legislation” as officials study how the billions included in the last bill take effect.
“We know the economy is still in a terrible, contractionary phase, tremendous hardships, everywhere,” Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“We’re trying to work through this. I don’t want to rule in or out anything right now. We are in discussions internally and with leading members of Congress.”
Congress has not met in regular session since March, though it has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $3 trillion. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said money for states and cities would be the core of the next legislative package Democrats draft.
Trump has considered linking such aid to sanctuary cities’ immigration policies, Kudlow said.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Sunday federal help to states that have taken a big revenue hit from coronavirus would make a “huge difference.”
“This is about firefighters, police, EMS, teachers at the point of attack. We’re already seeing some layoffs in New Jersey,” Murphy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We need a big slug of federal, direct cash assistance.”
All 50 states are suffering from the lack of revenue over the past two months, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in response to Trump’s argument that states with budget woes before the coronavirus outbreak should not get bailed out.
“Coronavirus has caused that. All of us are having to spend more on social services and healthcare to take care of people,” Pritzker said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Kudlow said authorities need to see the results of the previous funding efforts before deciding on the next steps.
“Then we’ll see, we will see in a couple of weeks, what needs to be done and perhaps how to do it,” Kudlow said.
Kudlow was asked whether more aid would be given to small businesses.
“It may be,” Kudlow said. “We haven’t made a decision yet.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil up 3% as countries ease lockdowns, production falls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil was up 3% on Monday as more countries announced they would begin easing coronavirus lockdowns and as crude supply cuts by the world’s top producing nations and companies take hold.
Worldwide fuel demand fell by an estimated 30% in April largely due to stay-at-home orders, and weak consumption is expected to overhang the crude market for months, even as major world oil-producers reduce output as of May 1. However, analysts have said that swift action by those parties could help reduce the supply glut more quickly.
“The market continues to price in the idea that things are improving,” Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
Brent crude LCOc1 settled at $27.20 a barrel, up 76 cents, or 2.9%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 61 cents, or 3.1%, to $20.39 a barrel.
“We’re supposed to see the production cuts start to show up... the slow restart of not only some of the states here in the U.S. but some of the countries in Europe is beginning to partially alleviate some of the demand fears,” McGillian said.
Italy, Finland and several U.S. states were among numerous governments moving to ease lockdown restrictions on Monday to resurrect their economies, but officials cautioned against acting too swiftly as coronavirus cases passed 3.5 million and deaths neared a quarter of a million globally.
In addition to fresh supply cuts that began this month by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, oil and gas output from some of the world’s top oil companies is set to drop in the second quarter of 2020 to levels not seen in at least 17 years.
Goldman Sachs said it is growing more optimistic about the rise of oil prices next year due to lower crude production and a partial recovery in oil demand.
The Wall Street bank raised its 2021 forecast for global benchmark Brent to $55.63 per barrel from $52.50 earlier. The bank hiked its estimate for WTI to $51.38 a barrel from $48.50 previously.
The re-emergence of trade tensions between the United States and China limited the rise in prices.
“Demand growth in China is good for the energy market right now, it is pretty much the only game in town” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. “Even a verbal scrap with President Trump is not good for China demand growth, considering the fragile circumstances the market is currently operating under.”
Adding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat last week to impose tariffs on China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was “a significant amount of evidence” that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory.
Oil prices recovered some of their losses after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected China to make good on its trade agreement with the United States. He also said he expected oil markets to rebound, and that the Trump administration was looking for more storage capacity.

The virus gets disintegrated by differential heating in the range of 56-60 degree Celsius.
It is cost-effective that can be operated in portable or fixed installations, and was tested for human/operator safety and has been found safe. Depending on size and shape of various objects, time of sterilisation is from 30 seconds to one minute. The approximate weight is three kg and it can be used for non-metallic objects only.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will April Pain Lead To May Gain For Commodities?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
By Jim Wiederhold
COVID-19 continued to wreak havoc across commodities markets in April. The S&P GSCI fell 9.67% in April and 47.92% YTD. Economic data continued to weaken into uncharted territory. Supply chains crucial to the flow of commodities from extraction to consumption experienced a sudden shut-off and demand collapsed. Energy and agriculture underperformed, while metals offered some green shoots.
With the collapse of front-month oil prices on April 20, 2020, the full effect of the oil supply glut was revealed. Market historians can now add negative oil prices to the list of unprecedented market events of 2020. Demand disappearance, diminishing storage capacity, and physically settled May WTI crude oil contracts produced a perfect storm for energy-related commodities. Global energy demand could slump by 6% in 2020 due to the restrictions placed on transport and industrial activity in what would be the largest contraction in absolute terms on record, according to the International Energy Agency. Compounding the hit to price levels that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on demand, oil output from OPEC was the highest since March 2019. OPEC+ production cuts are expected to take effect from the start of May 2020. After falling 54.72% in March 2020, the S&P GSCI Crude Oil dropped another 40.69% in April 2020. Crude oil volatility spiked to all-time highs as the weakness was felt across all oil products.
The S&P GSCI Industrial Metals rose 0.96% in April, reversing some of the downside seen in March. Copper and nickel were both supported by China restarting production facilities that had been on lockdown, as well as supply chain disruptions.
With elevated levels of volatility across assets, the S&P GSCI Gold rose 6.03%, outshining all other commodities and demonstrating its safe-haven status during times of market uncertainty. According to the World Gold Council, investment demand for the yellow metal rose 80% in Q1 2020 compared to the same quarter last year, which offset a 39% fall in jewelry demand.
The S&P GSCI Grains fell 6.25%, with weakness seen across the board. The S&P GSCI Corn underperformed the most (-7.60%) due to its correlation to energy in the ethanol space. The dramatic increase in demand for grocery store food items could not offset the historic lack of demand for ethanol. Cocoa, cotton, and coffee reversed their divergent performance from the prior month. After a strong March, the S&P GSCI Coffee dropped 11.87% in April. After double-digit declines in March, the S&P GSCI Cotton and S&P GSCI Cocoa both advanced 11.56% and 7.12%, respectively.
The S&P GSCI Livestock dropped 5.15% in April. Millions of pounds of meat are expected to be missing from the U.S. supply chain as several major meat producers shut down plants and slaughterhouses. Meat shortages at grocery stores are expected in the near term, as farmers face the likely culling of herds because they will not have anywhere to sell their livestock to be processed. In April, it was estimated that nearly a third of U.S. pork processing capacity was offline.

    <h5 class="mb-1">More funds for universities the fairest option</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The oldest universities in Australia – Melbourne and Sydney – were established to provide an education to any person who aspired to one. Once they were founded, on principles of equality and civic duty, the colonies no longer needed to send their brightest back to England to learn how to lead.
William Wentworth, who helped set up the University of Sydney in 1851, hoped the institution would allow "children of every class to become great and useful in the destinies of this country".
Fast forward 169 years and today's children have suddenly seen their road to greatness become so much more difficult. They have had their schooling interrupted, their pathways to university thrown into doubt and their social development curtailed by isolation. They will inherit a massive national debt by the end of the COVID-19 crisis which will take them years to pay off. And we now face having to add to that debt to help those very universities they want to attend, after funding from international students fell significantly as a result of the pandemic.
Universities perform a critical public service role through research and education; we benefit as a society from their discoveries and from their graduates. They must survive. But with international students now barred from entering Australia, their financial health is at risk, particularly if the ban stretches into next year.
Today, the federal government accounts for about 30 per cent of university funding, down from over 80 per cent in the 1990s. Coalition and Labor governments have actively encouraged universities to grow their revenue from international students. And grow it they did. International students now account for 46 per cent of enrolments at the University of Melbourne and 39 per cent of enrolments at the University of Sydney.
Their fees have provided for teaching, research and campus upgrades – but that income stream turned into a trickle when the government closed the borders to stop the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in Australia. Universities expect international enrolments to fall further next semester. They have flagged their own significant measures to save costs, including cutting capital works and casual jobs.
Meanwhile, domestic student numbers are set to soar, as the Costello baby boom children of the mid-2000s reach adulthood and the economic downturn triggers a rise in people wanting to retrain. The larger number of students will attract more government funding, but that funding often doesn't cover the cost of running a course.
The options to help Australian universities if their financial difficulties worsen all seem to carry a cost. Allowing international students to enter Australia again will restore a plentiful funding stream and produce other economic benefits in the way of retail spending and jobs, but until there is a vaccine, it risks a resurgence in cases of COVID-19.
We risk suffering as a society if we cut back on research, particularly at a time when we are so reliant on our medical scientists to find that vaccine. Pursuing further partnerships with the private and philanthropic sectors would allow various fields of research to continue, while reducing the strain on the public purse and allowing money to be redirected to teaching Australian students – but that only goes so far.
We cannot allow the government to use the COVID-19 pandemic to revisit their scotched plans of 2014, when they tried to deregulate the sector and allow universities to set their own fees. Under such a scenario, Australian students would have graduated with much larger debts. Such a move goes against the very principles upon which universities were founded in Australia, to afford "children of every class" an education.
While increasing government funding to universities adds to the national debt, at least it will be spread across society – a society which in turn benefits from the educated young people universities create. It is the fairest outcome – and pivots the focus of Australian universities back to the students they were set up to serve.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The oldest universities in Australia – Melbourne and Sydney – were established to provide an education to any person who aspired to one. Once they were founded, on principles of equality and civic duty, the colonies no longer needed to send their brightest back to England to learn how to lead.
William Wentworth, who helped set up the University of Sydney in 1851, hoped the institution would allow "children of every class to become great and useful in the destinies of this country".
Fast forward 169 years and today's children have suddenly seen their road to greatness become so much more difficult. They have had their schooling interrupted, their pathways to university thrown into doubt and their social development curtailed by isolation. They will inherit a massive national debt by the end of the COVID-19 crisis which will take them years to pay off. And we now face having to add to that debt to help those very universities they want to attend, after funding from international students fell significantly as a result of the pandemic.
Universities perform a critical public service role through research and education; we benefit as a society from their discoveries and from their graduates. They must survive. But with international students now barred from entering Australia, their financial health is at risk, particularly if the ban stretches into next year.
Today, the federal government accounts for about 30 per cent of university funding, down from over 80 per cent in the 1990s. Coalition and Labor governments have actively encouraged universities to grow their revenue from international students. And grow it they did. International students now account for 46 per cent of enrolments at the University of Melbourne and 39 per cent of enrolments at the University of Sydney.
Their fees have provided for teaching, research and campus upgrades – but that income stream turned into a trickle when the government closed the borders to stop the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in Australia. Universities expect international enrolments to fall further next semester. They have flagged their own significant measures to save costs, including cutting capital works and casual jobs.
Meanwhile, domestic student numbers are set to soar, as the Costello baby boom children of the mid-2000s reach adulthood and the economic downturn triggers a rise in people wanting to retrain. The larger number of students will attract more government funding, but that funding often doesn't cover the cost of running a course.
The options to help Australian universities if their financial difficulties worsen all seem to carry a cost. Allowing international students to enter Australia again will restore a plentiful funding stream and produce other economic benefits in the way of retail spending and jobs, but until there is a vaccine, it risks a resurgence in cases of COVID-19.
We risk suffering as a society if we cut back on research, particularly at a time when we are so reliant on our medical scientists to find that vaccine. Pursuing further partnerships with the private and philanthropic sectors would allow various fields of research to continue, while reducing the strain on the public purse and allowing money to be redirected to teaching Australian students – but that only goes so far.
We cannot allow the government to use the COVID-19 pandemic to revisit their scotched plans of 2014, when they tried to deregulate the sector and allow universities to set their own fees. Under such a scenario, Australian students would have graduated with much larger debts. Such a move goes against the very principles upon which universities were founded in Australia, to afford "children of every class" an education.
While increasing government funding to universities adds to the national debt, at least it will be spread across society – a society which in turn benefits from the educated young people universities create. It is the fairest outcome – and pivots the focus of Australian universities back to the students they were set up to serve.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre to stop charging cancellation fees amid criticism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre has decided to stop charging cancellation fees to customers whose travel has been impacted by COVID-19.
The travel agent had been charging a $300 per person cancellation fee for bookings from before the outbreak, with some law firms and customers considering a class action against the practice.
But in a letter sent to customers on Saturday, Flight Centre backed down from that position. The new policy applies retrospectively to cancellation fees already paid.
“The decision to waive [cancellation] fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” Flight Centre Travel Group executive general manager Allisa O’Connell wrote in the letter.
“The waiver follows ongoing discussions with customers and regulators, including the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission], and will apply retrospectively to bookings cancelled as a result of COVID-19 on or after 13 March 2020 for which a Flight Centre Cancellation Fee was charged. Please note this waiver applies to our fees – we cannot waive fees or conditions that airlines and other third party suppliers impose.”
The ACCC welcomed Flight Centre's move and said it would have taken legal action if the travel group had not made the decision.
“This is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre today for thousands of customers impacted by COVID-19 travel cancellations,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.”
Ms O’Connell also confirmed Flight Centre staff would continue to perform the “time consuming task” of processing refunds. The travel agent has come under fire for delays in getting money back to its customers.
Flight Centre will also offer customers travel vouchers of up to $200 per person for those who do not request a refund and instead take credits for future travel.
The ACCC said it had received 6000 complaints related to travel companies refund policies.
“We ask consumers to remain patient and be mindful of the significant pressures on businesses at this time and, where possible, contact the business by email or website, rather than by phone,” Mr Sims said.
“These are very complex issues and may take smaller businesses more time to respond.”
Ms O’Connor also reiterated that Flight Centre was “well placed financially to weather a prolonged downturn” in the travel industry.
The company said those who accepted a credit voucher could get a refund, without having to pay fees, at the end of December 2021, if travel still isn't possible.
Flight Centre had defended the $300 fee – which was included in its terms and conditions – saying it covers lost commissions, as well as the time and cost involved in managing the refund process.
The embattled travel group is closing 428 Australian stores by the end of July in an attempt to radically slash costs while raising $900 million in fresh equity and debt to last it through the coronavirus pandemic.
The Agereported in April on Melbourne midwife Jacqueline Vella who lost thousands, including $1500 in fees, when she had to cancel a trip to Europe and the United States.
Flight Centre then decided to cap its cancellation fees about a week later, and a day after The Age reported a class action law suit was being planned.
This week, a mother suffering from muscular dystrophy pleaded with Flight Centre to refund the almost $20,000 she spent on a trip with her family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's dependence on immigration faces its biggest economic test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia's dependence on immigration to grow the economy is about to be sorely tested.
One of the secret ingredients to Australia's unparalleled run of economic growth since the country's last recession has been strong population growth.
While local mums have played their part in swelling the number of locals, the heavy lifting has been done by people from nations such as China, India, Britain, New Zealand and the Philippines who have decided to call Australia home.
Over the past decade, the nation's permanent population has grown by 3.7 million to more than 25 million. Of that increase, 60 per cent was due to net migration.
That extra 2.2 million people have been an economic powerhouse, requiring homes, cars, food and every day goods and services while also contributing fresh skills to the jobs market.
But it has come at a price, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Be it via higher house prices or over-crowded schools, all levels of government have struggled to keep up with the demands of a growing population while reaping the economic benefits of that population.
The Morrison government made much of its decision in last year's budget to cap permanent migration at 160,000 for four consecutive years as dealing with the congestion pressures on our big cities.
That cap didn't include the hundreds of thousands of temporary migrants – be it students or workers – who help run the economy and add to demand.
But with the borders shut, international students stuck in their home countries and immigration all-but impossible, the issues around migration and Australia's dependence on it cannot be ignored.
The government is now expecting net overseas migration – which was forecast to reach 271,000 in 2019-20 – to be 30 per cent lower. Next year, the drop is tipped to be 85 per cent.
Combined, that's close to 300,000 missing shoppers, students, family members and skilled workers from the economy.
With temporary workers leaving the country and others unable to get in, population growth is likely to stall. Sydney could shrink while Melbourne's stellar growth of recent years will be muted, with serious economic repercussions.
Australia will, post-virus, remain a desirable destination for permanent migrants, temporary ones and international students.
The Morrison government's economic rebuilding plan will have to include a discussion around the nation's dependence of immigration.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press has entered detailed discussions with multiple bidders interested in salvaging the newswire and its contacts database Medianet but it will be weeks before its fate is decided.
Chairman Campbell Reid said in a statement that the Board would enter confidential discussions with interested parties over several weeks after it met with consultancy TMT Partners on the weekend to discuss sale proposals.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements," Mr Reid said. "In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
AAP's future has been in doubt since February when The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed that AAP's major shareholders Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and News Corp planned to close the 85-year-old organisation to save costs. But the decision, which affects about 600 employees, was put on hold two months ago after AAP received a number of approaches from parties interested in acquiring its operations.
Staff and AAP subscribers have since been waiting on a decision by the Board about a potential sale before they progress with plans for a future without the newswire. AAP subscribers including the ABC, Daily Mail, Private Media, Guardian Australia and Verizon Media have previously discussed pooling resources and forming journalism partnerships that could replace the newswire when it closes in June, but sources said the conversations have not progressed since the sale process began.
AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson confirmed plans to establish a new private business that would include the company's fact-checking division and parts of its editorial services arm Pagemasters before the sale process began. He also held talks with private investors including stockbroker John Murray but all plans are currently on hold.
News Corp Australia is planning to launch its newswire service, which will provide content for mastheads including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun and external customers, next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AAP staff wait on board discussions with bidders</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press will have to wait several more weeks before a decision is made on whether the wire service is sold or closed down.
AAP chairman Campbell Reid said the board, made up of News Corp and Nine executives, has entered into "detailed discussions with a number of parties" which had expressed interest in AAP and Medianet.
"These discussions are confidential and are expected to take several weeks," Mr Reid said in a statement.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements. In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
The AAP board met over the weekend to discuss proposals which were put forward by Friday's 5pm deadline.
"You should also be aware that even after the board has met, it could still be some time before any announcement is made, depending on the assessment of the bids," AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson said in a staff email on Friday afternoon.
On March 3, AAP announced it would close its doors after 85 years in operation, affecting 180 editorial staff and a total of 500 individual staff members and 100 contractors across its business.
By mid-March, AAP had received several approaches interested in buying the newswire and its other businesses.
AAP had said the decision was made because the newswire service was "no longer viable to continue", and its largest shareholders, News Corp and Nine, decided to pull their support for the organisation to which they contribute a combined more than $10 million per year.
Australian Community Media and Seven West Media both contribute more than $1 million per year. Clients of the service pay much less for access to AAP content.
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that talent manager Glenn Wheatley was one of the interested parties.

    <h5 class="mb-1">$300m clean energy fund to back fossil-fuel hydrogen projects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Morrison government has committed $300 million to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and instructed it to invest in new hydrogen energy projects including those powered by fossil fuels.
The move makes clear the government's position on the debate over the potential to develop an emissions-free hydrogen industry powered exclusively by renewable energy.
"Gas and gas transmission networks already play an essential role in energy reliability, but gas has even more potential as a resource to produce and transmit hydrogen," said Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor.
Renewable energy advocates, along with Labor-led governments in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT, argue fossil-fuelled hydrogen should be barred from public funds, which should flow to “green hydrogen” powered by renewables. State governments contribute to regulation of the energy sector through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).
But crucially for Mr Taylor, he secured majority support at the November COAG meeting to develop a hydrogen industry under a "technology-neutral" approach including all power source options.
Hydrogen has emerged in recent months as a key element of the Morrison government’s emissions reduction strategy, which Mr Taylor said would be based on a "technology investment road map".
Mr Taylor said his goal was to back projects that could reach a long-term goal of producing hydrogen at $2 a kilogram – the point "where hydrogen becomes competitive with alternative energy sources in large-scale deployment across our energy systems".
The announcement of the Advancing Hydrogen Fund follows a crash in the global oil market crash. The fall has flowed on to lower gas prices, which Mr Taylor said “provides us with an opportunity for strategic economic stimulus”.
The government has estimated an Australian hydrogen industry could create more than 8000 jobs and generate about $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050.
Chief Scientist Alan Finkel has said a domestic hydrogen industry could underpin an energy export boom for Australia, and Australia should develop it using renewables and fossil fuel to avoid the risks associated with reliance on any one fuel source.
"By producing hydrogen from natural gas or coal, using carbon capture and permanent storage, we can add back two more lanes to our energy highway, ensuring we have four primary energy sources to meet the needs of the future – solar, wind, hydrogen from natural gas, and hydrogen from coal," Dr Finkel said.
"Think for a moment of the vast amounts of steel, aluminium and concrete needed to support, build and service solar and wind structures.
"What if there was a resources shortage? It would be prudent, therefore, to safeguard against any potential resource limitations with another energy source."
In time, green hydrogen could take over and drive a net zero emissions global economy, according to Dr Finkel.
The Advancing Hydrogen Fund will provide debt or equity finance to commercial projects requiring $10 million or more in capital, which Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive Ian Learmonth said would fill market gaps created by "technology, development or commercial challenges".
Mr Taylor recently announced a $70 million fund for green hydrogen project development through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Strippers, scrap gold and a $3.9 million heist</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A $3.9 million armed robbery in Melbourne's CBD last week, allegedly involving a man with a surgical mask, a gun and a trolley has exposed extraordinary security failings but also reveals the unusual business practices of the city's gold and precious gem dealers.
In a nondescript building near the corner of Collins and Swanston streets, bags of gold jewellery are exchanged for cash, diamonds are used to secure high-interest loans and deposits worth millions of dollars are made into company bank accounts using pseudonyms such as 'Aghtogde'.
Business has been booming in recent months, as the coronavirus battered global financial markets and spooked investors turned to gold bullion as a safe haven. Others had been forced to trade or pawn their old gold jewellery and watches after suddenly facing financial hardship.
Last week, Karl Kachami, 48, from Hawthorn East, allegedly entered the building at 227 Collins Street where many of Melbourne's gold and diamond dealers ply their trade.
At about 9.40am, he is accused of pointing a Glock pistol at the head of an employee of the Melbourne Gold Company based on the seventh floor, before leaving with almost $4 million worth of gold bullion, jewellery and cash.
Mr Kachami was charged on April 30 with armed robbery, theft, false imprisonment and assault, after police found the loot buried at a rural property near the Gippsland town of Dollar.
Lawyer Sazz Nasimi acts for Melbourne Gold Company and its owner Michael Kukulka, who was not present at the time of the robbery.
Mr Nasimi said security was usually extremely tight.
"This was a human error and protocols were not followed on the day," he said.
Mr Nasimi said the safe was unusually full because the company had received a significant consignment of gold a few days earlier amid a surge in demand for the precious metal because of coronavirus.
Mr Nasimi thanked police for the swift arrest and said it was business as usual at Mr Kukulka's company.
However, Mr Kukulka's relationship with Victoria Police has not always been cordial.
In January this year, Licensing Inspector Scott Johnson opposed an application by Mr Kukulka to reopen strip club Showgirls Bar 20 at a new site on King Street.
Mr Kukulka invested $1.2 million in the relaunch of the notorious gentlemen's club, but Victoria Police raised concerns about his involvement in the gold industry.
In an 18-page submission, police identify more than $6 million in irregular transactions in a bank account linked to his business, including dozens of payments from unidentified pseudonyms such as 'Gdetoagch' and 'Aghtogde.' Mr Kukulka has never been charged with any offence in connection with any of those transactions, and he is not accused of any wrongdoing.
Despite the police objections, Mr Kukulka's application was approved last month by the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, and the strip club is expected to open when social distancing guidelines are relaxed.
The scale of Mr Kukulka's previous gold business MAK Precious Metals was revealed in a recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal case, where he was found to have provided almost $460 million in scrap gold to a Sydney-based company called ABC Refinery Pty Limited.
Mr Kukulka sourced gold from a range of sources, including $1.5 million in just six days from Melbourne fraudster-turned-bullion dealer Rocco Calabrese, according to court documents.
Calabrese, aka Rocco De Gonza, has been bankrupt twice, jailed for three dozen deception offences in 2002, and convicted again in 2014 for stealing 5500 kilograms of prawns worth $82,000. Mr Kukulka was not involved in any of Calabrese's wrongdoing.
According to court documents, gold sourced from Mr Calabrese was referred to as ‘Rocco jobs’.
Mr Kukulka's former business also appears to have offered short-term loans, usually secured by diamonds or gold bullion.
Mr Kukulka's former business lent diamond dealer Ron Bensimon $334,000, which was never repaid when Bensimon's empire collapsed in 2016, after amassing personal and business debts of more than $10 million.
Mr Nasimi said Mr Kukulka launched legal action to recoup the debt, but abandoned the claim when Bensimon was declared bankrupt.

Mr Kukulka's former business lent diamond dealer Ron Bensimon $334,000, which was never repaid when Bensimon's empire collapsed in 2016, after amassing personal and business debts of more than $10 million.
Mr Nasimi said Mr Kukulka launched legal action to recoup the debt, but abandoned the claim when Bensimon was declared bankrupt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First the Australian economy needs CPR. We’ll worry about reform later</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I can’t take seriously all those people saying we mustn’t waste a crisis, but seize this great opportunity to introduce sweeping economic reform. It’s like telling a baby who hasn’t yet learnt to walk it should start training for the Olympics.
It’s true, of course, that we won’t get back to economic life as we used to know it – that is, knew it before the global financial crisis, more than a decade ago – until we get back to reasonably strong annual improvement in the productivity of labour.
But the plain fact is, you’ve got to have a functioning economy before you can worry about how fast its productivity is improving. So there’ll be a time to debate which policies would or wouldn't do most to enhance productivity, but we have more pressing matters to attend to.
Some in the don’t-waste-the-crisis party can be forgiven because they’re under 50 and have no memory of what happens in recessions. But as my colleague Shane Wright has said, most of them are "the usual suspects, falling back on their usual agendas".
They have no genuine concern about the economy’s present life-threatened state, but are business people engaged in rent-seeking, or economists running off faith in their economic model, whether or not it’s supported by empirical evidence their theory actually works.
These urgers have forgotten that micro-economic reform seeks to increase economic growth by making the supply (production) side of the economy work more efficiently. It delivers results only over the medium to long term. It’s thus no substitute for macro-economic management, which deals with managing the demand side of the economy in the short term.
Right now, the prospect of a 10 per cent unemployment rate tells us we have more supply than we’re able to use. Clearly, our problem’s that demand is insufficient. The improvement in economic efficiency we assume we could gain by, say, taxing land rather than the transfer of it, is minor compared with the monumental inefficiency we know for certain is occurring because 10 per cent of our workers can’t find work.
Right now, we don’t even have an economy that’s functioning, much less functioning well. Much of it’s closed - locked up by government decree. We’re starting to ease the lockdown, but we won’t be opening our borders for another year or two.
When we do have most of the lockdown removed, what will we see? The economy won’t snap back. Not even bounce back in any significant way. True, once businesses are allowed to reopen they’ll be making some sales rather than next to none. But with so many households unemployed, sales won’t go back to anything like where they were.
Most households and businesses will be in cost-cutting mode. Firms have been incurring overheads while earning little. Even those households still working will be worried about their big mortgages and fearful of losing their own jobs. As Treasury secretary Dr Steven Kennedy has warned, “some jobs and businesses will have been lost permanently”.
Most firms and households will be getting back to some semblance of normality, but few will be doing much that causes the economy to grow in any positive sense. As Reserve Bank governor Dr Philip Lowe has said, firms and households are suffering from a "high level of uncertainty about the future" and will engage in "precautionary behaviour". They’ll be saving not spending.
Sound like a bounce-back, or an economy still in the intensive care unit? Ask yourself this: which are the forces that will propel the economy forward? It won’t be the main factor we’ve relied on in recent years – high immigration. Our population’s now falling, as people on temporary visas are sent home and not replaced. (Not that population growth does anything much to lift income per person.)
It won’t be “external stimulus” because the rest of the world is growing faster than us (it isn’t), or a lower dollar is making our exports cheaper to foreigners because we’ll continue banning foreign tourists and overseas students. Export commodity prices aren’t rising.
It won’t be growth in real wages (employers will compulsively demand a wage freeze) nor a "wealth effect" from rising house prices prompting households to cut their rate of saving. And a key missing piece: it won’t be big cuts in interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending.
That leaves only "fiscal stimulus" – the budget. The huge government spending so far has merely limited the extent of the economy’s fall. Should Scott Morrison soon start winding it back as he says he plans to, we could fall even further.
No, if we're to actually recover what will come next is a lot more government spending, particularly on useful projects. It can only be a government-led recovery.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United Nations secretary-general says the COVID-19 pandemic is causing untold fear and suffering for older people around the world who are dying at a higher rate, and especially for those over the age of 80 whose fatality rate is five times the global average.
Antonio Guterres said Friday that beyond the health risks, the pandemic is putting older people at greater risk of poverty, with an especially devastating impact on the elderly in developing countries.
The U.N. chief launched a 16-page policy briefing on the impact of COVID-19 on older people with several key messages, most importantly that no person, young or old, is expendable and older people have the same rights to life and health as everyone else.
Mr. Guterres also called for improved social support and smarter efforts to use digital technology to reach older people who may face great suffering because of isolation and restrictions on their movements.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Independent.ie reporters keeping you up to date with the latest coronavirus news in Ireland and across the world.
Concerns have been raised that meat plants could emerge as black spots for Covid-19 infections after employees at a number of factories tested positive for the virus.
The Agriculture Minister confirmed in the Dáil that his department was aware of six clusters in the sector.
It is feared a larger shutdown of plants, as seen in the US, could have a significant impact on the food supply chain and would devastate the incomes of livestock farmers already reeling from the closure of key markets abroad.
TD Paul Murphy warned in the Dáil this week that meat factories and other workplaces could follow nursing homes in becoming the next big Covid-19 clusters.
Meat factories here say beef processing is down 20-30pc due to market disruption and the loss of demand from European foodservice markets.

Russia has reported its highest one-day jump in new coronavirus cases as some other countries relax lockdown restrictions.
China, where the pandemic began in December, reported a single new infection on Saturday, extending a steady decline in confirmed cases.
Russia’s government reported 7,933 new cases on Friday, raising its total to 114,431. The true number is believed to be higher because not everyone is tested and Russian tests are reported to be only 70% to 80% accurate.

Banks will be expected to assess well in advance the likelihood of borrowers not being able to return to full debt repayment after an up to six-month payment break, including looking at the effect of the Covid-19 crisis on different sectors of the economy.
Loan loss provisions for the first quarter of the year are expected to be well up on last year, and likely to be higher still for the second quarter of the year which started on April 1st and falls entirely within the lockdown period.
It is understood the Central Bank will monitor the provisions banks make for estimated losses stemming from the Covid-19 shut down to include taking a view on the medium-term effect the crisis may have on house prices and jobs. That's despite the fact borrowers getting a payment break won't be classed as non-performing or problem accounts.

The public will be given guidance on the wearing of face coverings in public in two weeks at the end of this lockdown phase, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said last night.
He emphasised they are coverings, rather than medical-grade face masks, and said they might be used when travelling on public transport or in shops.
"We are not saying to rush out and use them now.
"We are working up on guidance in the next two weeks," he added.

A five-phase exit strategy has been unveiled by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who last night warned: "It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal." But he insisted: "It will happen."
With the country facing into another bank holiday weekend under lockdown, Mr Varadkar announced that older people who have been cocooning can leave their homes for short periods from next week.
However, they are advised to keep cocooning and avoid contact with anyone when they leave their homes. Over-70s will not be permitted visitors to their homes or to go to shops until the start of June.
Schools will remain closed until September - except for Leaving Cert exams. Crèches, childminders and pre-schools for children of essential workers will be opened on June 29 and all the aforementioned will be reopened for all workers on July 20.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KHARTOUM, May 1 (MENA) - The US on Friday announced the provision of an additional assistance of $23.1 million for Sudan to help the country in its fight against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said that around $ 16.8 million of the total sum will be allocated for public communication on infection prevention control and disease surveillance, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene programs. the US Embassy in Khartoum said in a statement carried by Sudan News Agency (SUNA). Some $ 5 million in cash assistance will be dedicated to vulnerable families adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the statement added. The new assistance also includes the allocation of more than $ 1.3 million to support humanitarian response efforts for refugees in Sudan, the statement read.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will warm weather slow coronavirus?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Will there be another wave of COVID-19? And if so, how big will it be, and will there be more waves after it?
The answer to those questions depend on seasonality, the susceptibility of the population to the disease, the rate at which the coronavirus mutates and how we come out of lockdown.
Colds and influenza are seasonal because those viruses generally survive outside the body for a shorter time in high heat and high humidity than in cold weather and low humidity. People also spend more time indoors in winter, coming into close contact with others with less ventilation, so respiratory infections are far more common in winter, although of course they can sicken people in summer, too.
But in 1918 and 1919, the years of the world’s deadliest pandemic, the seasons seemed to have little impact on the influenza.
That pandemic had a mild first wave which began in February 1918. It struck relatively few places in the United States or around the world, followed by a lethal second wave which began in Switzerland in late July and spread rapidly around the world from September to December 1918, hitting the Northern and Southern Hemispheres simultaneously. (Australia was hit late; its rigid quarantine of arriving ships delayed the pandemic’s arrival until January 1919, the middle of its summer.) Then a third wave began in February 1919, marking two distinct pandemic waves in the influenza season, a highly unusual occurrence.
Susceptibility clearly was a more important factor than the seasons, because it turned out that the entire world — young and old people on every continent — was susceptible to the disease.
Mutation was also an important factor. It probably accounts for the timing of the third wave in 1919: It seems likely that by then, the virus had changed enough that any immunity to the initial virus didn’t protect well against its mutated form. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that exposure to the first wave provided up to 89 per cent protection against second wave illness (the best vaccine in the last 15 years provided 62 per cent protection), but neither first nor second wave exposure protected against that third wave.
What does all this mean now?
Nothing is certain and little is known about COVID-19, but a few things are likely.
First, modellers estimate that the true number of infected persons is up to 20 times the reported number, which still leaves about 95 per cent of the population susceptible. If, as in 1918, susceptibility proves more important than seasonal influences, hot weather will not give as much relief as hoped for. By the same token, that would mean the expected seasonal surge when colder weather arrives might not be as large as feared.
Second, COVID-19 mutates much more slowly than influenza, and its key spike protein — the part of the virus that attaches to cells — seems particularly stable. Amid all of the bad news that this virus has brought, this characteristic of the virus is a silver lining in several ways.
Since the virus does not mutate nearly as fast as influenza, this reduces almost to zero the chance that it will become more virulent, as happened in 1918. Moreover, because the spike protein is a key part of the virus likely to be recognised by the immune system, then mutation will probably not account for a new wave soon. For the same reason, the consensus view of virologists seems to be that those who recover from the illness probably develop immunity lasting a year and possibly longer, and that a vaccine will most likely protect reasonably well against COVID-19.
Third, the incubation period, on average nearly six days, is roughly triple the average incubation period of influenza, and the disease itself takes much longer for people to recover from and stop shedding virus. Therefore even without social distancing it would take months for the outbreak to pass through a community, as opposed to six to 10 weeks for influenza. With social distancing — necessary to reduce deaths by keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed — it will take even longer. Additionally, the incubation period allows an asymptomatic person more opportunity to spread disease.
But these factors will give the country more time to expand testing and contact tracing, and to isolate and quarantine contacts. All of those are impossible with fast-spreading influenza.
How then do we restart the economy? We cannot simply wait for herd immunity to develop from natural infection. That would take many months and be accompanied by an unacceptable death toll. Nor can we wait a year or more for a vaccine.
Instead, a consensus has formed among public health experts to continue current measures until the epidemic curve bends significantly downward and the stress on health care is alleviated, followed by a phased-in approach guarded by, in effect, a public health army. That army would be fighting a guerrilla war, armed with tests, tracing, isolation and quarantine to search and destroy inevitable flare-ups.
This approach has worked around the world. It will work here. COVID-19 would continue to spread, but the cases would be in manageable numbers. We would see not so much distinct waves as continuous, undulating swells, broken by occasional angry whitecaps.
But if we do not manage our public health response well — for instance, allowing a widespread lifting of restrictions too quickly — we could generate a storm surge that washes away everything gained so far by so much sacrifice. That seems to be what too many politicians seem willing to risk.
Those politicians should consider this: In 1918, San Antonio was one of the slowest cities to close, yet one of the quickest to reopen. As a consequence, more than half of the city’s population got sick, and almost every household had at least one person ill. And COVID-19 is more contagious than influenza.
It’s past time we start doing things the right way. We still lack the testing capacity and anything approaching the necessary public health army. It’s past time we start building both.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: The coronavirus pandemic has upended US equities trading with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.
The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc , closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in Mar 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group , Cboe Global Markets Inc and Nasdaq Inc also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.
Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on Jun 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange's electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.
At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.
"Our position has always been that when our customers tell us that there's no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team," Tilly said.
The NYSE is the only US exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.
While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
"Only time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor," the study said.
The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.
CME, which runs the world's largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10 per cent of its business was done.
"We will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location," CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.
The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.
"Participants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor," said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Coalition challenges government to embrace home grown solution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share on FacebookShare on Twitter
The Transform Nigeria Citizens Initiative, Concerned Nigerians Forum and Governance Index have tasked the Federal, State and Local Governments across the country to look inward and solve the economic challenges presented to Nigeria by the coronavirus pandemic and drop in oil price.
The Coalition made the call in a statement released after a three-hour virtual Conference hosted by The Governance Index, a Social Enterprise dedicated to promoting purposeful leadership around the world.
It had the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, as Guest Speaker; Marcel Ngogbehei, a Sloan Fellow from London Business School; Paul Ejime, Communications Consultant for ECOWAS and EU; Orji Udemezue, a management and financial consultant; and Alwal Hassan, a public policy consultant, as panelists and over 150 participants around the world in attendance.
The participants agreed that there is need for policy makers across the country to strategise and provide home grown solution to avert a looming economic crisis as a result of the COVID-19 and the crash in oil price.
The Zoom Conference, titled: “COVID-19 and the Oil Price Crash, its implications for Nigeria,” held on May 1, 2020, is the second of the “COVID-19: Turning a crisis into Opportunities” series being promoted by the Governance Index.
Participants x-rayed the historical net oil export income of member states of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and pointed out that although Nigeria is within the average income earning brackets, it immediately goes to the bottom once its income is divided among its over 198 million population net export per capita.
The communique of the conference said: “Angola, Algeria and Congo are above Nigeria in this ratings. This rating effectively measures the quality of life of the citizens based on their oil earnings.
“Nigeria is not making effective use of its huge population potentials.
“We need to commit resources and develop strategies for manpower development to improve the productive capability of Nigerians – i.e. provide required infrastructure and knowledge, thereby improving their market value and productivity.”
The participants recalled that during the Biafra War, which lasted for three years, the Igbos ingeniously invented many devices under a total blockade using local materials.
They said: “Many materials were invented under total blockade through local processes.
“We need to take off the glasses and take our destiny in our own hands rather than waiting for solutions from the Western world.
“We need to be original in our thinking with an intent that we are running a race with other parts of the world.”
Regarding the lockdown policy adopted by governments to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, the group adopted the former CBN governor’s position that a home grown solution will mean that government seeks to save lives without destroying people’s livelihood.
The participants agreed: “Madagascar has opened its economy, and with no death record from COVID-19. Ethiopia also did not lock down their economy but allowed Ethiopia Airlines to continue in operation, and yet Ethiopia has one of the lowest COVID-19 cases in Africa.
“It is time for Nigeria to start thinking ‘without the box’. There is need for self-belief by the Nigerian government so that we can come out of COVID-19 and also position the country for economic benefits Post-COVID-19.”
The participants, while brainstorming on opportunities embedded in the COVID-19 crisis, advised that the three tiers of government should invest heavily in human capital.
They said: “We need to commit resources and develop strategies for manpower development to improve the productive capability of Nigerians, that is provide required infrastructure, systems and knowledge, thereby improving their market value and productivity.
“After COVID-19, oil prices will fall, but there’ll be a huge demand in human resource capabilities and technological knowhow and this could be a huge source of earnings for the country.
“We should also develop Investment friendly policies, improve rule of Law index to give investors the needed assurances to play in the Nigerian Markets – No firm will invest in a country where the judicial system appears to be compromised and or controlled by an invisible hand.”
Participants further submitted that government at various level should invest heavily in Agriculture and work towards improving agricultural produce.
They said: “Nigeria is yet to cultivate 60 per cent of its arable land and should identify various Agricultural produce that can thrive in different parts of the country, cultivate it and extract maximum value.
“Agriculture was the bedrock of our economy before oil discovery – groundnuts in the North, Cocoa in the West and Palm oil in the East; therefore with the continuous decline in the oil price, it is advisable for the government at all levels to invest heavily in Agriculture.”
While stating that COVID-19 pandemic has devastated several economies but has also provided several opportunities for Nigeria and Nigerians, participants adopted a 10-Point Opportunity provided for Nigeria by the COVID-19 crisis and proposed by M. Udemezue: The opportunity to look away from oil as a critical contributor to our forex earnings and national revenue pool; Nigeria must seize this opportunity to take a longer view on issues concerning our federal system of government. Fiscal federalism must be pursued now more than ever before; COVID-19 has further exposed the economic non-viability of Nigerian States. State Governors must engage all stakeholders with a view to strategically fashioning out ways to generate independent sources of revenue for funding state budgets. The over-reliance on FAAC allocation must end now; Nigeria must now pay urgent attention to human capital development. Key areas of focus must include: healthcare, education and skills acquisition; hospitality/tourism, and entertainment; and As China faces emotional and economic backlash as a result of COVID-19, can Nigeria ramp up its manufacturing capacity.
Others are: As government faces difficulty in creating new jobs, and even meeting salary payments of existing staff, we now have an opportunity to design policies that would put SMEs in the driving seat of job creation; Individual Nigerians are also now presented with another opportunity to invest in some markets where prices have crashed. This is probably the time to assess the real estate and the stock market for possible cheaper entry; This is an opportunity for SMEs and other businesses to adopt agility and innovation in driving business growth, particularly leveraging digital and electronic platforms; With COVID-19, the drive for export earnings must now include policies that make exporting easier. The route to market must be made faster for all potential exporters; and Now that the CBN does not have the “free money” to waste in their lazy approach to FX management, Covid-19 now presents another opportunity to strategically restructure our Forex pricing system (ie, pragmatically devalue) in order to encourage and drive export.
“To take these opportunities require bold, transparent, dynamic, and transformational leadership at all levels,” the Coalition stated.
It added: “Post COVID-19, oil prices will fall, but there’ll be a huge demand in human resources capabilities and technology knowhow and thus could be a huge source of earnings for the country, the participants said, adding: “We should also develop Investment friendly policies, improve our communication strategy, be transparent, improve rule of Law index to give investors the needed assurances to play in the Nigerian Markets – No firm will invest in a country where the judicial system appears to be compromised  and or controlled by an invisible hand.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ireland unveils 6.5 billion euro coronavirus business package</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBLIN: Ireland will allow firms impacted by the coronavirus crisis to warehouse tax liabilities for 12 months, offering a "lifeline" as part of an additional package of business supports that could reach 6.5 billion euros (US$7.2 billion), the government announced on Saturday (May 2).
Commercial rates will also be written off for three months, a 2 billion euro credit guarantee scheme introduced for small and medium sized businesses and Ireland's sovereign wealth fund mandated to invest 2 billion euros directly into bigger firms, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.
After a lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, Ireland laid out a roadmap on Friday for a gradual re-opening of the economy that could allow building sites and some retailers to reopen in two weeks, with restaurants following in June, hotels in July and finally pubs in August.
The government concentrated its initial 8 billion euro fiscal response on increased jobless payments and wage subsidies for workers, with 1 billion euros of liquidity supports offered to reeling firms.
The much larger package on Saturday also included a 10,000 euro restart grant for micro and small businesses. Ireland's main business lobby, IBEC, welcomed the measures as an important further step in addressing the cashflow crisis facing many.
Highlighting the scale of the economic shock, Donohoe said firms had deferred 800 million euros of tax in March alone and that that figure could reach 2 billion euros by June.
He also hoped the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's (ISIF) new equity fund would lead to investment far in excess of the 2 billion euros available capital as it will seek to maximise added capital from existing shareholders and new co-investors.
While Jobs Minister Heather Humphries said more supports will be needed for sectors that will find the coming months harder than others, Donohoe said the acting government had not yet considered any potential sector-specific cut to VAT rates.
Hotels, restaurants and pubs, which will only be allowed operate at limited capacity when they open, have called for the VAT rate for the hospitality sector to be temporarily cut to 0 per cent from 13.5 per cent and for state funds to help them pay rent.
Donohoe said a new government would be required to enact the tax deferral and credit guarantee schemes, the first tangible sign that the political deadlock since an election in February election could directly hurt business if it cannot be broken.
Donohoe's Fine Gael and rival Fianna Fail are trying to find enough support from smaller parties to form a coalition. No new legislation can be passed until a new government is formed and selects the remaining members of the upper house of parliament.
"It is very clear to me that there are economic decisions that our country will need relavent to keeping jobs and creating new jobs that in the coming weeks will require the election of a new Taoiseach (prime minister)," he told a news conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Statsguru: Key indicators point to grim economic outlook amid lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">March saw just 10 days of the lockdown due to Covid-19, and lead indicators point at the weakening economic activity.
The crucial eight-industry core sector output fell the sharpest in the new series in the month (chart 1). This is likely to have a dampening impact on the index of industrial output (IIP), which will be released on May 12. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing did not contract but was the lowest in four months (chart 2). The figure to be released on Monday will tell the grimmer story ahead as many vehicle manufacturers, including Maruti Suzuki India and MG Motor India, reported zero sales
in the domestic market.
PMI's services did contract, with trade, hospitality coming to a grinding halt, though the pace of fall in the index was not as steep as that of the core sector (chart 3) April data would show the real position. With the external world facing the same situation and even worse in some markets, exports declined the sharpest since 1994-95 (chart 4).
However, the situation on the external account is not as worrisome due to the fall in global oil prices and many economists expect small surplus or minor deficit in the current account balance.
The demand for petrol in the domestic market reflected the same trend. As economic activity came to a virtual halt, the consumption of petrol fell in the month, for the first time in 2019-20 (chart 5).
The effect of lockdown was evident on power demand as well with the industry not allowed to work except for essential goods. The demand never rose since March 22, year on year. It was falling on earlier days of the month as well, but it was not a secular decline (chart 6).StatsGuru is a weekly feature.

    <h5 class="mb-1">View: How will the economic recovery shape up? Likely scenarios</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the country inches towards a normalcy of sorts, the question uppermost on everyone’s minds is: what does ‘normal’ really mean anymore? For readers of this paper, the question, more specifically, is: what shape will the economic recovery take?
In his 2018 Oscar-winning movie, The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro’s draws on Plato’s idea that pure water takes the shape of an icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron with many faces, to show how beauty comes in many shapes and faces. Economic recovery, too, is likely to have many shapes and faces, especially after a pandemic like this one.
It is best to talk in terms of possible shapes, rather than numbers — even while accepting that the ultimate outcome may well be something none of the scenarios had contemplated. With that caveat, here are four possible scenarios for the global economy and India.
1. Base case scenario: In this scenario, the lockdown that now covers more than half the world’s population in varying degrees, flattens the curve sufficiently to allow governments relax lockdowns by early-late May so that the world returns to close to ‘normal’ by autumn. Not the ‘normal’ of the pre-Covid-19 world. But to Bill Gates’ ‘semi-normal’, where travel restrictions remain, people travel much less, many more work from home, and while restaurants and cinemas open, they will be less crowded as social distancing remains the norm for the foreseeable future. Recovery shape: U
2. Virus returns: Here, the world wins only a temporary respite, with the virus returning in winter. However, the world will be better prepared, testing facilities will be more widespread and the western world more willing to live with restrictions on individual freedoms, slowing the spread of the disease. Growth will plummet after the initial recovery following easing of restrictions. But greater success in dealing with the return of the virus will see growth recover much faster. Recovery shape: W
3. Best case scenario: Here, the world recovers quickly. Like China, where harsh lockdown measures not only contained the virus from spreading to other areas, but lifting of restrictions has also seen a rapid recovery in economic activity. The virus is defeated for good and does not return. Even if it does, it is no more feared than the ordinary flu. In any case, majority of the population already has immunity against it. Recovery shape: V
4. Worst case scenario: Here, lockdown measures continue, although with varying intensity, till much later in the year. Economic growth plummets and stays low for a long time. It is only by Q2, 2021that the world takes slow hesitant steps towards recovery, with recovery to pre-Covid-19 levels likely only by 2023. Recovery shape: L
So, which of these shapes will recovery take in India? Much depends on how the global economy recovers. For once, our lower integration with the global value chain might even work to our advantage. Even so, the short-term outlook is bleak — barring agriculture, that is likely to fare reasonably well, thanks to a normal monsoon.
For the rest, supply disruptions, the return of labour from urban centres, lack of capital from risk-averse banks, government reluctance to extend the required level of fiscal support, and the fact that states with urban hotspots (accounting for 64% of GDP) will be among the last to resume normal activities means growth in industry and services will suffer. Since these two sectors together account for more than 80% of GDP, growth will suffer in tandem. Over the medium to long-term, however, the outlook is much brighter. As countries, world over, realise the folly of depending on a single source for their components and raw materials, and look to diversify, they are likely to turn to India.
So, what is it going to be for us in India? U, V, W or L? Alas, it’s unlikely to be a V. Recovery will be a slow process, given the scale of disruption and government’s failure to provide adequate fiscal support. It’s unlikely to be W either, for two reasons. One, social distancing for a prolonged period is, at best, a pipe dream for most Indians. So, even if the virus returns later this year, we are likely to have developed herd immunity by then.
Two, a vaccine is likely to be ready by year-end. So a return of the disease will not have a similar devastating effect on the economy. That leaves only two candidates: U and L Hopefully, GoI will wake up from its slumber, spend what is necessary to keep the wheels of the economy moving, and we will be spared an L-shaped ‘recovery’, a return to the ‘Hindu rate of growth’ we struggled to break away from.
That leaves only U. And it can happen. Provided all of us, U and I (and GoI) do our bit.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ALGIERS, May 3 (Reuters) - Algeria's expenditure on cereals imports fell 8.5% in the first two months of 2020 from the same period last year, official data showed on Sunday.
The North African country is one of the world's largest grain importers, but the government has been trying to reduce spending on food and other goods after a sharp drop in energy earnings hit state finances.
The value of imported durum wheat, soft wheat, semolina and flour reached $398.76 million over January and February, down from $435.84 million in the first two months of 2019, according to customs figures.
Details on volumes were not disclosed.
Overall spending on food imports fell by 3.5% to $1.293 million, the figures showed. (Reporting by Hamid Ould Ahmed Editing by David Goodman )

    <h5 class="mb-1">After lockdowns, economic sunlight or a long hard slog?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The strong recovery in global financial confidence caused the S&P 500 index to rebound 13 per cent in April, leaving US share prices only 9 per cent below their levels at the end of last year. This may seem puzzling, given the slim prospect that a vaccine against the virus, or effective treatments, will become available soon. 
The surge appears to rest on the pattern shown in gross domestic product forecasts from the big investment banks (see box), which is mainly driven by the expected path for supply shutdowns.
Based on indices of lockdown policies published by the Blavatnik School of Government, and on population movements shown on Google Maps, it is likely that supply curtailments in the advanced economies reached their peak in April.
From May onwards, a combination of gradual policy relaxations and normalisation of consumer behaviour should allow the global economy to bounce back. China has already seen industrial activity rebound as shutdowns have been relaxed since late February, although exports are now weakening markedly amid global recession.
Growth expectations have also been supported by the sheer scale of the monetary and fiscal policy easing introduced around the world in just a few weeks.
Thomas Huray at Fulcrum estimates that the direct fiscal measures introduced in the advanced economies so far is equivalent to 6 per cent of 2019 nominal gross domestic product, roughly double the equivalent stimulus from 2008 in the financial crisis. Furthermore, JPMorgan estimates that the expansion in central bank balance sheets may exceed 18 per cent of GDP by 2021, about three times the scale in the financial shock.
The relatively optimistic forecasts for the advanced economies seem to treat the 2020 downturn in a similar fashion to a recession caused by a natural disaster, which has a catastrophic immediate effect but then disappears extremely rapidly. If that pattern is repeated this year, the implication is that share price valuations may be only minimally affected by discounted future profits. 
According to a very interesting analysis by Zach Pandl of Goldman Sachs, the equity markets are assuming that the storm will blow over very quickly, with GDP growth rates being higher not lower than normal in 2021. On that basis, equities do not look particularly overvalued.
However, Mr Pandl adds that this outcome would be unique among recent recessions in the country. In a normal cyclical downturn, predictions for GDP growth are reduced in successive years once a recession becomes inevitable. This is particularly true in the second year after the recession starts, suggesting no early bounceback to previous peak activity. The decline in output becomes persistent, not a springboard for recovery.
This more normal pattern underpinned the strong concerns expressed by Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell last week about the medium-term risks to the productive capacity of the US economy following a very deep recession.
Mr Powell also said that the course of coronavirus itself is a new form of economic uncertainty. He is clearly right about this. Although the key infection rate — the reproduction rate — has almost certainly dropped below one in most countries during the lockdowns, there have already been indications from Germany and Singapore that improvements can be partially reversed as restrictions are relaxed.
The grim arithmetic of epidemics strongly suggests that any increase in the R rate significantly above one may lead, sooner or later, to a large second wave in infections that will need to be suppressed.
In his press conference on Thursday, the UK prime minister Boris Johnson promised that the country was now approaching “sunlight and pasture” after passing through the “huge tunnel” of Covid-19. But his chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, suggested it would still be a “long slog” for all countries from here. Unfortunately, the scientist has probably got it right.
Fulcrum has collected an indicative selection of economic forecasts from leading investment bank economists. The average of these suggests that the level of GDP in the global economy will fall by 6 per cent in the first half of 2020, but then rebound to exceed pre-crisis levels of output by the beginning of 2021. 
China is out of synchronisation with the advanced economies, and has already started to recover. This results in some smoothing in the cycle for the world as a whole.
The US economy is expected to show a similar broad pattern, although both the recession and the recovery are expected to be much sharper than for the global economy as a whole. The level of US GDP is expected to fall by 12 per cent in the first half of this year, returning to pre-crisis levels only in mid 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Toyota Has Now Sold A Whopping 15 Million Hybrids Worldwide</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Published by: Adrian Padeanu
Since the introduction of the Prius in the late 1990s, Toyota has become one of the best-known makers of hybrid vehicles. And now, just over two decades since the first cars went on sale, the company is celebrating 15 million hybrid sales worldwide.
Of those sales, almost a fifth (2.8 million) have been in Europe, where the U.K. is one of the leading markets for Toyota’s hybrid vehicles. As of the end of March this year, the company had shifted more than 356,000 units on these shores. At present, hybrids account for two-thirds (66.1 percent) of all Toyota’s new passenger vehicle sales in the U.K.
In Britain, the Yaris has recently become the brand’s best-selling hybrid model, overtaking the Prius in terms of total sales over the winter. And Toyota says the car’s position is set to be cemented with the arrival of the all-new Yaris this year. Equipped with Toyota’s latest, fourth-generation hybrid electric system, the company claims the new model will deliver “significantly” greater zero-emission electric driving capability.
The decision to make hybrid vehicles was only made 25 years ago, when Takeshi Uchiyamada’s team was tasked with developing a less polluting car for the 21st century. The Prius debuted in 1997, although it only came to Europe in 2000. Now, Toyota has sold more than 15 million vehicles, and the company estimates its products have saved 120 million tonnes of CO2 emissions compared with equivalent petrol vehicles.
Announcing the news, Toyota said: “In Europe, the U.K. is one of the strongest markets for HEVs with cumulative sales of Toyota models reaching 356,630 units up to the end of March 2020. That’s been accomplished in 20 years since Prius’s turn-of-the-millennium debut here, with sales accelerating as Toyota increased the range of models available and continuously improved the performance of the technology. More choice, lower emissions and even better fuel economy have raised people’s awareness and acceptance of hybrid, moving it firmly into the mainstream.”
Toyoya says hybrids (HEVs) are a key part of the future global vehicle fleet, alongside battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs). In Europe, the company plans to reveal 40 new or updated electrified vehicles by 2025, including “at least 10” zero-emission vehicles, which could be either BEVs or FCEVs.
Shigeki Terashi, the chief officer of the Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), said: “Of course, we must work hard on improving battery performance and lowering costs [of BEVs], which we are doing. But we must avoid having no plan until we overcome the hurdles related to both BEVs and FCEVs. In the meantime, we can contribute by continuing our work on HEVs.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manufacturing Sector Plummets In April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
By Robert Hughes
The Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a 41.5 percent reading in April, down from 49.1 percent in March. The April result is the second month in a row below the neutral 50 threshold (see top chart). Overall, the report notes, "Comments from the panel were strongly negative (three negative comments for every one positive comment) regarding the near-term outlook, with sentiment clearly impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and continuing energy market recession. The PMI indicates a level of manufacturing-sector contraction not seen since April 2009, with a strongly negative trajectory."
Many of the key components of the Purchasing Managers' Index have already fallen to levels not seen since the lows of the Great Recession in 2008-09. The New Orders Index came in at 27.1 percent, down from 42.2 percent in March and the lowest since December 2008 (see top chart). The results suggest production as measured by the Federal Reserve's industrial production for manufacturing index may show steep declines in the coming months. The New Export Orders Index came in at 35.3 percent in April, down 11.3 percentage points from a 46.6 percent result in March.
The production index was at 27.5 percent in April, down from 47.7 percent in March and a new record low since the survey began in 1948 (see bottom chart). The backlog-of-orders index came in at 37.8 percent in April, down from 45.9 percent in March and suggesting a second month of decline in backlogs.
The employment index fell 16.3 percentage points to 27.5 percent in April versus 43.8 percent in March, and the lowest reading since June 1949 (see bottom chart). The move farther below neutral suggests employment in manufacturing likely fell sharply in April. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Situation report for April is due out on Friday, May 8. Consensus expectations are for a shockingly large loss of more than 22 million nonfarm-payroll jobs including a drop of 1.6 million jobs in manufacturing. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to 16.1 percent from 4.4 percent in March.
Supplier deliveries, a measure of delivery times from suppliers to manufacturers, jumped for the third consecutive month, reaching 76.0 percent, up from 65.0 percent in March. April was the highest reading since April 1974. Slower supplier deliveries are usually consistent with stronger manufacturing activity. However, the slower deliveries in April were more a result of supply chain and logistical constraints. According to the report, "Suppliers continue to struggle to deliver, at a much stronger rate compared to March. The COVID-19 pandemic was the primary cause of global and domestic supply chain disruptions, with suppliers impacted by plant shutdowns, transportation challenges and the continuing difficulty in importing parts and components."
The prices index fell 2.1 percentage points to 35.3 percent in April from 37.4 percent in March, and the lowest since January 2016. Weaker prices were reported for scrap steel, other steels, aluminum, copper, corn, distillates and other energy sources.
Customer inventories in April are still considered too low, with the index remaining below 50 at 48.8 percent versus 43.4 percent in the prior month (index results below 50 indicate customers' inventories are too low). The index has been below 50 for 43 consecutive months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spain eases strict lockdown as U.S. approves virus drug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MADRID, Spain – Spaniards were allowed out of their homes to exercise and walk freely after 48 days of confinement on Saturday, May 2, as some European nations began cautiously easing virus lockdowns while others like Russia faced a spike in new infections.
As governments across the globe balance lifting restrictions to restart economies against the risk of new infections, US authorities brought some hope by approving an experimental drug for emergency use on coronavirus patients.
The measure was the latest step in a global push to find viable treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown, hammered the world economy and caused more than 3.3 million confirmed infections.
The virus has killed nearly 239,000 people since it emerged in China late last year.
With signs the pandemic in their hardest-hit nations is slowing, European countries and some parts of the US have begun to lift restrictions and to try to inject life into economies battered by weeks of closure.
In Madrid and Barcelona, Spaniards took to the streets to exercise and walk freely as the government eased seven weeks of strict lockdown in a country with one of the highest number of fatalities at nearly 25,000.
"After so many weeks in confinement, I badly wanted to go out, run, see the world," said financial advisor Marcos Abeytua in Madrid's Chueca district who got up a 7am to enjoy some time outside. "Yesterday, I was like a child on Christmas Eve."
In the city's Retiro park, many residents were out to running, sometimes in groups, as a policeman used a loudspeaker to urge them to keep out of deserted avenue and on the pavement.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez however said masks would be obligatory on public transport from Monday.
Spain, Germany, Austria and Scandinavian nations are all slowly easing lockdowns as the virus cases slow though they will keep in place social distancing measures, demand the use of masks or increase testing to try to track infections.
France on Saturday decided it would extend a health emergency, in place since March 24, by two months until July 24, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced after a cabinet meeting.
Italy is preparing to ease restrictions in coming days while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent time in intensive care with the virus, said Britain had past the peak of its outbreak.
Ireland extended its lockdown by two weeks to May 18, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saying the nation will reopen "in a slow, phased, staged way" after that.
In Russia, though, authorities reported the largest increase in coronavirus cases with the new infections rising by nearly 10,000 in a single day.
In Moscow, the epicentre of Russia's outbreak, around 2 percent of the population is infected by COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, officials said.
"The threat is apparently on the rise," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, said on his blog earlier Saturday.
Treatment hopes
More than 3.3 million cases of infection have been officially diagnosed in 195 countries, including 1.5 million in Europe alone. That number is likely only a fraction of true cases as testing is still limited.
The United States has the most deaths with more than 65,000, followed by Italy with 28,236, the United Kingdom with 27,510, Spain with 25,100 deaths and France with 24,594 fatalities.
US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that Remdesivir, an antiviral drug initially developed to treat Ebola, was given the green light for use after a major trial found that it boosted recovery in serious COVID-19 patients.
"It's really a very promising situation," Trump said on Friday at the White House.
The drug incorporates itself into the virus's genome, short-circuiting its replication process.
Its approval came as the US leaders struggled with growing pressure from citizens wearying of stay-at-home orders.
Trump is keen for a turnaround as the world's largest economy reels with tens of millions left jobless.
Texas became the largest US state yet to ease curbs, while anti-lockdown demonstrations were held in several states – including California, where officials had re-closed beaches beginning Friday to avoid a repeat of last weekend when crowds flocked to the shoreline.
In Huntington Beach, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Los Angeles, several thousand people rallied to denounce Governor Gavin Newsom's beach shutdown order.
"Open California!" chanted protesters near the closed beaches, carrying signs that read "All jobs are essential" or "Freedom is essential".
Hong Kong shops opening
In Asia, India announced that the lockdown on its 1.3 billion people – the world's biggest – would continue for two more weeks from May 4.
And in Singapore, the government said Saturday that pet food stores and hair salons will be allowed to reopen on May 12.
Most of the city-state's infections have been detected at dormitories housing migrant workers, and their confinement was extended to June 1.
Hong Kong recorded zero confirmed case of coronavirus on Saturday, the sixth day within a week.
The city's social distancing regulations including limits on gathering of more than four people are due to expire on May 7, but authorities have not decided whether to extend them.
The city's chief executive has said that civil servants will return to work in the office starting from May 4.
During the long weekend with public holidays to celebrate Buddha's birthday and Labour Day, residents flocked to country parks and the city's outlying islands to get some fresh air.
Shops and restaurants started to resume business in normal opening hours with more consumers going out to streets and shopping malls.
The virus restrictions put a damper on May Day celebrations worldwide on Friday as many labour unions delayed their rallies and some held online events, while a determined few hit the streets in face masks.
May Day carried extra significance this year because of the staggering number of people put out of work by the pandemic, with the global economy in a tailspin and facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
Stock markets tumbled again on Friday after Trump's unproven allegation that the virus may have come from a lab in Wuhan – the central Chinese city where the disease first emerged. – Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spain eases strict lockdown as US approves virus drug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spaniards were allowed out of their homes to exercise and walk freely after 48 days of confinement on Saturday as some European nations began cautiously easing virus lockdowns while others like Russia faced a spike in new infections.
As governments across the globe balance lifting restrictions to restart economies against the risk of new infections, US authorities brought some hope by approving an experimental drug for emergency use on coronavirus patients.
The measure was the latest step in a global push to find viable treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown, hammered the world economy and caused more than 3.3 million confirmed infections.
The virus has killed nearly 239,000 people since it emerged in China late last year.
With signs the pandemic in their hardest-hit nations is slowing, European countries and some parts of the US have begun to lift restrictions and to try to inject life into economies battered by weeks of closure.
In Madrid and Barcelona, Spaniards took to the streets to exercise and walk freely as the government eased seven weeks of strict lockdown in a country with one of the highest number of fatalities at nearly 25,000.
"After so many weeks in confinement, I badly wanted to go out, run, see the world," said financial advisor Marcos Abeytua in Madrid's Chueca district who got up a 7am to enjoy some time outside. "Yesterday, I was like a child on Christmas Eve."
In the city's Retiro park, many residents were out to running, sometimes in groups, as a policeman used a loudspeaker to urge them to keep out of deserted avenue and on the pavement.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez however said masks would be obligatory on public transport from Monday.
Spain, Germany, Austria and Scandinavian nations are all slowly easing lockdowns as the virus cases slow though they will keep in place social distancing measures, demand the use of masks or increase testing to try to track infections.
France on Saturday decided it would extend a health emergency, in place since March 24, by two months until July 24, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced after a cabinet meeting.
Italy is preparing to ease restrictions in coming days while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent time in intensive care with the virus, said Britain had past the peak of its outbreak.
Ireland extended its lockdown by two weeks to May 18, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saying the nation will reopen "in a slow, phased, staged way" after that.
In Russia, though, authorities reported the largest increase in coronavirus cases with the new infections rising by nearly 10,000 in a single day.
In Moscow, the epicentre of Russia's outbreak, around 2 percent of the population is infected by COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, officials said.
"The threat is apparently on the rise," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, said on his blog earlier Saturday.
More than 3.3 million cases of infection have been officially diagnosed in 195 countries, including 1.5 million in Europe alone. That number is likely only a fraction of true cases as testing is still limited.
The United States has the most deaths with more than 65,000, followed by Italy with 28,236, the United Kingdom with 27,510, Spain with 25,100 deaths and France with 24,594 fatalities.
US President Donald Trump on Friday announced that Remdesivir, an antiviral drug initially developed to treat Ebola, was given the green light for use after a major trial found that it boosted recovery in serious COVID-19 patients.
"It's really a very promising situation," Trump said on Friday at the White House.
The drug incorporates itself into the virus's genome, short-circuiting its replication process.
Its approval came as the US leaders struggled with growing pressure from citizens wearying of stay-at-home orders.
Trump is keen for a turnaround as the world's largest economy reels with tens of millions left jobless.
Texas became the largest US state yet to ease curbs, while anti-lockdown demonstrations were held in several states -- including California, where officials had re-closed beaches beginning Friday to avoid a repeat of last weekend when crowds flocked to the shoreline.
In Huntington Beach, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Los Angeles, several thousand people rallied to denounce Governor Gavin Newsom's beach shutdown order.
"Open California!" chanted protesters near the closed beaches, carrying signs that read "All jobs are essential" or "Freedom is essential".
In Asia, India announced that the lockdown on its 1.3 billion people -- the world's biggest -- would continue for two more weeks from May 4.
And in Singapore, the government said Saturday that pet food stores and hair salons will be allowed to reopen on May 12.
Most of the city-state's infections have been detected at dormitories housing migrant workers, and their confinement was extended to June 1.
Hong Kong recorded zero confirmed case of coronavirus on Saturday, the sixth day within a week.
The city's social distancing regulations including limits on gathering of more than four people are due to expire on May 7, but authorities have not decided whether to extend them.
The city's chief executive has said that civil servants will return to work in the office starting from May 4.
During the long weekend with public holidays to celebrate Buddha's birthday and Labour Day, residents flocked to country parks and the city's outlying islands to get some fresh air.
Shops and restaurants started to resume business in normal opening hours with more consumers going out to streets and shopping malls.
The virus restrictions put a damper on May Day celebrations worldwide on Friday as many labour unions delayed their rallies and some held online events, while a determined few hit the streets in face masks.
May Day carried extra significance this year because of the staggering number of people put out of work by the pandemic, with the global economy in a tailspin and facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
Stock markets tumbled again on Friday after Trump's unproven allegation that the virus may have come from a lab in Wuhan -- the central Chinese city where the disease first emerged.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reliance to produce new gas from D6 by June end; to cost $2.2 per unit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK have pushed back the start of production from the second wave of discoveries in their eastern offshore KG-D6 block to end June because of restrictions on movement of people and material the nationwide lockdown has imposed.
At current Brent oil price of around $26 per barrel, the gas from R-Series field in KG-D6 block will cost about $2.2 per million British thermal unit -- lower than even the government mandated rate of $2.39 for gas from state-owned ONGC fields.
In an investor presentation post its fourth-quarter earnings, Reliance said it is working on three projects in the KG-D6 block, where production from older fields stopped in February this year.
"First Gas from R-Cluster field expected by June 2020 subject to lifting of lockdown," it said.
Gas production from R-Cluster was to start by mid-May but the coronavirus lockdown has delayed it.
Reliance said it expects to achieve a peak output of around 28 million standard cubic metres per day by FY24 when all three projects are up and running.

Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.
Sources said Reliance had in November set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
Considering current average Brent price of $26 per barrel, the gas will cost around $2.2 per mmBtu.
Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
In the first round of auction in November 2019, Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL bought a majority of volumes on offer. The price at that time came to $5.1-5.16 per unit.
But international oil rates have slumped as demand evaporated due to outbreak of coronavirus and lockdowns imposed by countries around the globe.
Essar Steel had picked up 2.25 mmscmd in the country's first transparent and dynamic forward auction that lasted about five-and-half-hours on November 15, 2019, sources said.
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group and Mahanagar Gas Ltd bought 0.3 mmscmd, sources said, adding GAIL, acting on behalf of fertiliser companies, bought 0.3 mmscmd of gas.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had bought 0.35 mmscmd and 0.10 mmscmd went to Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC)/Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), sources said. In all, 15 customers across sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, city gas, glass and ceramic got gas in the tender, they added.

In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translated into a price between $5.1 per mmBtu and $5.16 per mmBtu at the then prevailing Brent oil price of $60 per barrel.
Initially, Reliance had set a floor quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of $5.4 per mmBtu at $60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around $4 per mmBtu rate currently.
To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In its lockdown avatar, yoga has gone online — and it means big business</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Delhi-NCR’s first novel coronavirus patient, 45-year-old Rohit Datta, jokes that the only yoga he did in the pre-pandemic days was kapal bhati, a breathing technique, because someone told him that each expulsion of breath burnt one calorie. “So if I did 300, I’d be burning 300 calories and save time walking,” he says laughing. But when he found himself in hospital with the dreaded COVID-19, taunted by the media for having ‘infected’ others, he grappled with both the physical effects of the infection and the mental anguish of cruel words. “People started sending me all kinds of WhatsApp messages about cures,” he says; they ranged from eating an onion with salt to performing a havan. The only message that got him thinking was one from his mother, who suggested he do anulom-vilom pranayama.
In the isolation unit, Datta made a mental list of five breathing exercises he needed to do: om, anulom-vilom, kapal bhati, bhastrika, and kumbhaka. “The first time I tried, I couldn’t do any for even two seconds. I felt like an old man who had smoked through his life,” he says. But he persisted, doing them twice a day for seven days, gradually increasing the duration. “I didn’t have the strength for physical exercise,” says Datta, who runs a technical textile business in Rajasthan. He had just returned from a work trip to Europe when he was diagnosed positive. Today, a pranayama loyalist, Datta says he will be one for the rest of his life. “It is both preventive and curative,” he says.
In Karnataka, Ashwini Shrinivas G.S. made a YouTube video on her COVID-19 journey, speaking about how yoga and pranayama helped her come through. A Pune couple, who have also recovered from the infection, said it was yoga that kept them engaged in the ward.
Something new
The yoga frenzy that engulfed the world a few years ago has suddenly seen a shift: in these times of COVID-19, it is no longer saffron-tinged and shloka-accompanied; nor is it about ‘celebrating’ the body with white people on Instagram performing the perfect vrschikasana (scorpion pose) on a beach. Today, it is seen as a form of mind-body control in a world where an invisible force bars us from stepping out of our homes.
“The pandemic has given us a different perspective on things we considered important; we’re now asking ourselves, ‘Are they really so important?’ We are looking for answers,” says Anju Dhawan, a professor at the psychiatry department of Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Some three weeks ago, she started a yoga-pranayam-meditation session over Zoom, which she conducts twice a day for students. She says the reason the class sees this level of engagement — there are 150 in the group — is probably because “some people are interested in stress reduction, and others have opened up to exploring the spiritual realm. Also, maybe this is a time they want to learn something new, have a new experience.”
It’s also a reflection of how the world came to yoga in the first place. It was a way to find a few minutes’ pause in our over-stimulating environments — long commutes, buzzing work schedules, nonstop entertainment. For Lakshmy Vijayan, a second-year student at AIIMS, yoga has helped regulate her sleep-wake cycle. “It also anchors you to the present,” she says.
Finding answers
In the second week of March, when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the number of COVID-19 cases outside China had increased 13-fold and the number of countries affected had tripled, the Harvard Medical School’s health blog published an article titled ‘Coping with coronavirus anxiety’. The writer, John Sharp, suggested yoga, meditation, and breathing as three distinct ways of relaxing. He even offered names of apps such as Yoga Studio and Pocket Yoga, Headspace and Calm, ironically all owned and developed in the West.
The West has studied yoga and found that it boosts flexibility and strength, and in some cases aerobic power too. Its attention to syncing breath with movement and its focus on different breathing exercises helps both physically and mentally, improving lung capacity and helping calm the mind, all of which make it almost prescription-worthy for COVID-19 times.
The WHO, in its media briefing on March 20, days before India’s lockdown, listed yoga as one of the ways of “making time for exercise”.
Soon the floodgates opened; Google recorded a surge in searches. For instance, on April 27, at 4.20 p.m., searches for clothing brand ‘Alo Yoga’ spiked 4,150% in the U.S. over a 30-day period compared to the previous 30 days. Searches for ‘yoga poses for kids’ went up by 3,650% in India, ‘sun salutation’ in the U.K. shot up by over 5,000% — this jump in numbers made it what Google Trends calls a ‘breakout’. The biggest traffic in India came from Sikkim, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Uttarakhand.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for whom yoga has been a top soft-power subject, tweeted that he practises yoga nidra whenever he gets the time.
Whether the popularity of yoga nidra stems from this is anyone’s guess, but on the Cure.fit app, this, along with pranayama classes, is among the two most popular yoga sessions. In fact, yoga is the highest rated among all their online classes. Naresh Krishnaswamy, who heads growth and business at Cure.fit, says that both yoga and other workout formats are growing at a 5x rate. “It wasn’t a surprise — yoga is a big market,” he says. Alistair Shearer in his book, The Story of Yoga: From Ancient India to the Modern West, talks of it being a “$25 billion-a-year wellness industry”.
Business of yoga
And as it goes online in the time of lockdown, the business is bound to only grow.
Abhishek Sharma, who calls himself a holistic fitness coach, decided to do a Facebook Live every morning during lockdown from his Mumbai home. A trainer to celebrities, including Dia Mirza and Rajkumar Hirani, he started conducting classes at 8:30 a.m., only to find that people were engaging with him even after the sessions and reaching out to him from Nepal, Pakistan and Singapore.
“I realised there’s a lot of anxiety, even though people were putting on a brave face,” he says. “I have been anti-online. I’m very old-school,” he adds. Sharma, who learnt raj yoga, considered the highest form of yoga that focuses on the inner self and its oneness with the universe, adapted to the urban needs of yoga for weight-loss, back problems or as a balm for stress. He now focuses on helping people make yoga part of their daily lives. He sees his classes as a comfort zone for people, where they feel like they are in touch with regular life. “A lot of people are bingeing on Netflix and food, so just waking up and attending a morning session puts the day in some order,” he says.
Sarvesh Shashi, founder, SARVA and Diva Yoga, Mumbai, a chain of yoga studios, says that on the SARVA app, 63% of the high intensity yoga is consumed by women, whereas the guided meditation has a 55% male audience. “In yoga terms, women are moving from asana to dhyana, and men are moving from dhyana to asana,” he says, noting the difference in entry point to the practice. Both he and Sharma talk of the immunity that yoga offers, something particularly relevant for the time. In fact, SARVA even has a sequence for this.
But is the new focus on yoga, with its online avatar, going to turn into something entirely commercial? “Purchasing health virtually is going to become the norm,” says Vijay Raaghavan, Director, Management Consulting, PwC India, who works on digital health and wellness. “We used to seek management of illness. Going froward, people will become cautious about how to manage health.” He says offers will now be linked to points that ‘buy’ you more than just products. For instance, if you sign up for a yoga class, it may be linked with a health insurance policy, but may also be linked with an intangible benefit like gaining access to an international flight that has stricter health norms, for instance. It is the sense of having access to ‘privileges’ that yoga may boom on.
Much like the LinkedIn Social Selling Index which measures the user’s profile and engagement across five parameters, Dr. Raaghavan thinks that if a company can draw up an index that fixes parameters for yoga engagement (such as yoga clothes, footwear, food, level of skill), it may be able to take yoga to the next level of commerce. “Instant gratification, say completing an hour-long session, gets you cumulative worth — your breathing gets better — which also leads you to a certain entitlement, say, being able to join a club run by a yoga clothing brand. This is the future of yoga.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ross Wilson reveals Rangers scouting staff hiring plan as sporting director builds on 'strong foundations'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ross Wilson knows that for many the writing is on the wall for the Premiership season.
But the Rangers sporting director has outlined his reasons for giving it every chance in a letter to the SPFL.
Record Sportrevealed last week how Wilson backed Aberdeen chief Dave Cormack when he urged the authorities to explore every avenue.
France, Belgium and Holland have already called their seasons but Wilson prefers to take a more optimistic approach like his old colleagues in England’s top flight.
Wilson used to work for Southampton and the Premier League reiterated its desire to complete the season on the day Manchester City star Sergio Aguero claimed players were “scared” to return to action.
Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard insisted there wasn’t a will from the SPFL to finish the season and Wilson said: “I wrote to the SPFL but not so much about playing behind closed doors, that wasn’t my point.
“What I saw from Dave Cormack and from other clubs was lots of enthusiasm, innovation and creativity to try to inject that into our way of thinking as a country and look at every possible avenue.
“From speaking to colleagues I was previously working with down south, that is the approach they’ve taken. Even if it ultimately proves to be an unsuccessful approach, that innovation and creativity to at least try to explore avenues was the first point I was supporting.
“And the second point was to ensure we consult all stakeholders – and definitely players, managers and coaching staff – to see what their view is.
“Whether we’re talking about closed-door games, fixture programmes, safety, health, testing, it would be remiss of us to ignore the players, managers and coaches in the middle of it.”
You might think the role of a sporting director would be redundant during a period of inactivity but Wilson insists he’s busier than ever.
He said: “My focus is on building the football side of things. There are so many facets to the job. When I took over six months ago I went on record as saying the foundations were strong.
“There was a lot of building to do. One of the areas I was determined to build was our scouting network and we’ve been doing that in a big way.
“We have put a lot of work into building up our scouting team to where I want it to be. There will be people joining us post coronavirus.
“I have been working hard too with Steven and the coaches.
“The coaches have also been working hard on the analysis of matches played this season, with a view to next term and where we might build our squad.”
Wilson knows there is huge uncertainty over the next transfer window and there have even been calls for it to be scrapped.
He said: “I wouldn’t call for an abolition of it but there needs to be lots of flexibility. A lot of the work in the north of England in the EFL could be affected by this.
“It might well be that at a time of real financial difficulty for clubs there, one of the routes to trade successfully out of that would be an extended transfer window.
“That has been mooted on the continent already.
“Many clubs in our Premiership may have a lot of contracts running out. You need the transfer market to sell and move.
“The flexibility, innovation and the creativity around what the transfer window looks like should certainly change. There is a lot of appetite throughout Europe for that as well.
“There needs to be an approach that enables clubs to work the market to help the situation.
“I don’t think any list ever becomes redundant. As much as we possibly can, we want to pre-empt the different scenarios.
“So it’s not a case of having 100 lists. It’s a case of our list covering all the potential bases as to where the market might be. It’s a really difficult one to answer because nobody knows what that landscape is going to look like.
“The role of the scouting team is to make sure we are really prepared for all the eventualities right across the board.
“We are trying to make sure the scouts are covering as much as they possibly can.
“There are a lot of new processes, procedures and ways of working that I was really keen to implement. That now needs to start coming to fruition.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trevor Noah is paying 'Daily Show' staffers' salaries out of his own pocket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South African comedian Trevor Noah is reportedly paying the salaries of 25 staffers at The Daily Show who have been furloughed as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. 
Variety reports that Trevor Noah is paying the monthly salaries of 25 members of The Daily Show (DStv 122) out of his own pocket.
He reportedly told staffers that he would continue to personally pay their salaries until The Daily Show returns to normal production from its New York studio.
"These are the people who have been on the show with Trevor from day one and help him put on the show," a source told thepublication, saying "Trevor is personally covering their salaries until the production business opens again. He respects his crew tremendously and feels it's only right that they get through this together."
This week the temporarily renamed The Daily Social Distancing Show was extended from 30 to 45 minutes. 
It will be the first time in the 24-year history of The Daily Show that episodes will be longer says Comedy Central in a statement.
"The news of supersized Daily Show episodes comes at a moment in time when viewers are heading to host Trevor Noah not just for satire and escapism, but also for an honest point of view and as a source of trustworthy information."
This week is the sixth week of The Daily Social Distancing Show that Trevor Noah now anchors from his home without the help of a live audience or the New York-based studio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk just declared that he's selling almost all his physical belongings and 'will own no house' and that he thinks Tesla's stock price is 'too high'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk, the billionaire and prolific Twitter user, is rethinking his attachment to the material world – and said in a tweet on Friday that a first step would be “selling almost all physical possessions.”
He also said he thought Tesla’s stock price was “too high” – a tweet that was followed by a sharp drop in the share price of the electric-car manufacturer. Tesla’s stock was down 9.3% late Friday morning.
Musk also said he “will own no house.” He followed up with a tweet that his girlfriend, the songwriter and producer Grimes, was mad at him.
Musk owns at least seven lavish houses worth over $100 million in total. He and Grimes are expecting a baby due Monday, he said in another tweet.
His remarks came amid a broader tweetstorm on Friday morning. Musk, who’s known for his eccentric online presence, also continued his weeks-long rant against government-enforced shutdowns in response to COVID-19 outbreaks.
Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, has been forced to shut down because of a shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area.
He railed against the shutdowns and orders in a shareholder call earlier this week, calling them “fascist” in a rant that was abruptly cut off when the call was disconnected.
It wasn’t clear why Musk would want to sell almost all his belongings or where he would live once he owns no house. A Tesla representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk has previously run afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission for tweeting about Tesla shares. He settled a lawsuit last year after tweeting in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed that all his public statements that could move Tesla’s stock price – including tweets – would be pre-approved by a company lawyer.
An SEC representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Narcissistic Family Legacy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When a child is raised by a narcissistic parent, they may become orbital to the parent – focused on meeting the parents needs and losing their own sense of identity in the process. However, some children of narcissistic parents become narcissists themselves and it’s easy to understand why.
Adopting the family values
When you’re raised in a family where the emphasis is on being better, brighter, more beautiful and richer than everyone else, you may internalise these values. This is how the world is, isn’t it? Mum or dad has brought you up with the belief that unless you make people laugh the hardest, or wear the best clothes or go to the most expensive school, then you’re not worth as much as you might otherwise be. “Success” is measured by these external markers and if you were raised in this type of environment, it’s no wonder you may place a high value on these types of external markers too.
Learning to be loved in the conditional way
Another reason why children of narcissists may become narcissists themselves is because they learned long ago that, in order to be deserving of love and attention from their parent, they could do so by being an extension of their parent’s efforts to be the best. This isn’t the case for all children of narcissists – some parents want their children to remain in the background, orbiting around them – but some bask in the glow of their children’s attainments. The child learns that by doing well in school, being regarded a beauty or excelling in some area of their life that they will receiving attention and praise from their parent. They have lived up to their parent’s expectations.
Being caught up in manipulation and secrets
The narcissistic family is all about maintaining outward image and, in order to do so, whatever happens in the family must stay in the family. Children of narcissists may be ashamed not only about aspects of the treatment they receive from their parent, but also about stuff that must remain hidden. For instance, the narcissistic family may not really have much wealth at all, but it’s important to project an image of wealth to the rest of the street. In addition to the secrets presented to the outside world, there are probably countless secrets within the family. Narcissistic parents can be highly manipulative of their children. They may favour one child on the basis of that child meeting their needs and, instead of treating all their children equally, may bind a child to them in various ways such as sharing confidences or rewarding them financially or in some other way. When you’ve been brought up to think it’s ok to have a favourite child and to have secrets in this way, it’s understandable that you might repeat these patterns in your own family.
Seeing only the positives
It’s possible, perhaps within your own family, to see generations of narcissism. When you’re raised with narcissistic values, it can be very difficult to see anything wrong. In fact, you may see your family values as positive. Perhaps the narcissistic tendencies in your parents or grandparents was what drove them to take certain steps which benefitted you financially.
One of my clients, a woman in her seventies with anxiety, described her mother who was, in later life, diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. My client’s mother had come from a poor background and raised a family where the whole emphasis was on ‘bettering’ herself. Working long hours as a cleaner, she managed to send her children to private school. My client and her two siblings were not allowed to talk like the local kids and were under great pressure to hide where they came from, taking long routes on the way home from school to throw their classmates off the scent that they lived in a council house. This caused considerable pressure and my client recalled how her brother wet the bed until well into his teenage years. My client displayed strong narcissistic traits herself and failed to see anything wrong with her mother’s obsession about presenting this image to the outside world – at the cost of a happy and secure family life. “Mum was amazing, what an achievement”, she told me. She had so deeply internalised her mother’s values that she saw nothing but positives in them. The fact that she was the only one of her mother’s children who spoke to her mum at the time of her death, and the fact none of the children in this family spoke to each other, failed to change her opinion of her mother as a “wonderful person” based purely on the fact that her mother had sent her children to private school and set them on the path to wealthy lives.
Choosing partners who will orbit around you
Narcissists are often drawn towards partners who will orbit around them. Instead of seeing marriage as a team effort, they see themselves in the driving seat and seek a partner who will allow them to be the dominant force in the family. If you’ve been raised by a narcissistic parent, you may find yourself similarly choosing a partner who will allow you to operate your family in the way you want without being challenged. Marianne, a client in her forties, described how both she and her sister had been single parents for years. “I don’t think it was an accident, somehow”, she told me. “I chose single parenthood. My dad played no role in the family and I think mum liked it that way. I thought men were unnecessary within the family structure and used one to get pregnant. I suspect my sister did, too”. Even if you don’t go down the route of single parenthood, you may find yourself regarding your partner as the lesser parent compared to yourself and then pass this message onto your own children.
Seeing your children as an extension of yourself
If your mother or father saw you as an extension of themselves, you may see your children in a similar light. Their achievements reflect well on you. Their ‘failures’ make you look bad. When your children do well or are complimented by other people on their looks or abilities you are validated as a parent and that sense of identity as a parent is extremely important to you.
If you have been raised by a narcissistic parent, it can take a long time to realise that you are raising your own children in the same way. It may well be that it’s not until you face problems in your own life – such as being under pressure to act in a particular way, unsatisfactory relationships or a sense of lacking a deep sense of self and security which is derived internally rather than externally – that you identify the negative impact that being raised by a narcissistic parent has had on your life. If you are at this stage, this is the first step in breaking the narcissistic legacy and ensuring that subsequent generations of your family adopt very different values.

The Federal Government has directed the release of about 17,500 metric tonnes of assorted grains from Yola National Food Reserve site for distribution as palliatives to Nigerians.
Haruna Sulaiman, Director, National Food and Strategic Reserve, said this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria in Yola on Saturday.
Sulaiman said the gesture was part of the Federal Government’s palliatives to cushion the effect of COVID-19 lockdown in the country.
Sulaiman, represented by Amusa Sulaiman, Manager, Yola Food Reserve site, said the department has many food reserve sites across the country.
He said: “Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a Presidential Order for us to start releasing food from national food reserves.
“The department has issued a standing order to every site to start re-bagging in preparedness for distribution to all states of the federation.
“From Yola site, there is directive from government to immediately release about 17,500 tonnes, equivalent of 100 trucks of the assorted grains of sorghum and maize to Kano State Government.”
Sulaiman said 28 trucks out of 100 had arrived in Kano on April 30, adding that the trucks were leaving Yola reserve site to Kano under the supervision of the National Emergency Management Agency.
Sulaiman said that after the Kano operation, the Yola site was expecting another directive to release the grains to other states of the federation.

The government is spending $240 million to boost access to online health services, including mental-health support and virtual access to doctors for primary care.
Ottawa is also providing $175 million to AbCellera Biologics Inc., which Trudeau says has shown promising signs of progress in identifying antibodies that could be used create a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How sovereign gold bonds outshine other asset classes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Those who have invested in the sovereign gold bonds (SGBs) issued over the past five years have a reason to smile. The prices of these SGBs have grown significantly and delivered handsome returns to investors.
For instance, the money invested in the first ever issue — SGB-2015-Series-I, launched in November 2015 — has appreciated about 84 per cent so far (as on April 27). Similarly, SGB 2019-20-Series-I, which was launched in June 2019, has gained around 48 per cent.
 
SGBs were first launched in November 2015 and have been sold in 38 tranches subsequently by the RBI. They score over other gold investment options as they pay a fixed interest on the holding (2.5-2.75 per cent per annum) apart from the discount of ₹50 on the issue price if invested online. They are tax-efficient too, as the capital gains are tax-exempt if they are held till maturity (eight years).
The yellow metal started its upward journey in mid-2019 on the back of an escalating US-China trade war and accelerated thereafter due to the economic uncertainty and fears of a virus-led global recession. Over the past year, gold in rupee terms has appreciated 48 per cent while other asset classes such as equity and debt have struggled to hold their head above water. The Nifty 50 TRI plummeted 15 per cent over the period.
SGBs outperformed other modes of investing in gold, such as gold ETFs and e-gold, by a wide margin, thanks to the coupon payments that offer additional returns apart from the appreciation in gold price. Further, retail/online investors are offered a discount of ₹50 in the issue price.
 
 
For instance, SGB-2016-Sr.-I, launched on February 8, 2016, has so far appreciated 89 per cent (including coupon payments) while gold ETFs (the average of the top three gold ETFs in terms of traded volume) have gained 61 per cent. Meanwhile, gold price in rupee term (source: gold.org) rose 62 per cent. This particular SGB series has made a total coupon payment of ₹286 since its launch.
The annualised performance of this SGB, as measured by XIRR (used to calculate the internal rate of return when the investment fetches periodical payments), was 17 per cent, while gold ETFs on an average generated 12 per cent annually.
Gold has been a hedge against market uncertainties. It can form part 5-10 per cent of your portfolio at any point of time.
Investors can buy SGB units from the primary issuances announced by the RBI from time to time. Recently, the RBI announced the FY21 issue calendar for SBGs, coming out with the first tranche from April 21-24. The second tranche will be conducted on May 11-15, 2020.
Investors can also buy SGB units from the secondary markets, on the BSE and the NSE. Of 37 series of SGBs, 12 have been traded with daily average volume of 100 or more units on the NSE.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Insider: Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama Ticket Could Replace Joe Biden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Panic over Joe Biden’s viability as Democrat nominee for president has begun sweeping through Democrat circles, with some suggesting that Hillary Clinton could jump in to replace him with Barack Obama as her running mate, according to a Washington insider.
Douglas Mackinnon, a former writer for presidents George H.W. and Ronald Reagan, penned an editorial for The Hill on Saturday revealing that many Democrats are secretly worried about Biden’s presidential prospects.
“Some Democrats tell me they fear that Biden’s political survival is getting more problematic with each passing day,” Mackinnon wrote. “They cite three main issues. The first is their concern that an allegation of sexual assault leveled against Biden by former staffer Tara Reade won’t go away anytime soon. If anything, it appears to be about to gain a new life.”
“Next, they worry that another shoe could drop regarding questions related to Biden’s son Hunter and his business dealings. Lastly, some Democrats are concerned about Biden’s age and possible cognitive issues — a concern that some also have expressed about Trump.”
Mackinnon then says Clinton and Obama could swoop in to save the nomination, simply because the left views such a ticket as formidable against President Trump.
“Who might be in consideration to become the new nominee — and who would be selected as the vice presidential running mate? Several likely combinations come to mind, starting in many minds with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, but one particular, truly out-of-the-box combination stops the discussion in its tracks: Hillary Clinton as the nominee and Barack Obama as her running mate,” he wrote.
“Some Democrats have confessed to me that having Biden drop out, for whatever reason, might not be bad news since they aren’t convinced he can beat Trump in November, despite polls showing him in the lead at this point. And they believe (perhaps a bit wistfully, in some respects) that a Clinton-Obama ticket would be a nightmare for Trump.”
Though the Constitution’s 12th and 22nd Amendments could present a hurdle for Obama to be reelected to the White House, Mackinnon says Democrats would nevertheless try to make it happen if Biden failed to bring confidence to the party heading into November.
“The operative word here might be ‘elected.’ If Obama were selected as Clinton’s running mate, and she had to leave office for any reason, then Obama would succeed her. At least one constitutional expert is on record saying there is nothing to prevent such a scenario,” he concluded.
Owen watches in awe as Joe Biden actually falls asleep while Hillary Clinton interviews him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Racing | Sai crowned ISRL-2 champion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The practice arena turned into a battlefield for the new generation of India’s racers in the lockdown time. Cooped up inside homes and missing out on valuable wheel time, racers from 14 cities took part in the country’s most popular online competition — the Indian Sim Racing League (ISRL), in association with Volkswagen Motorsport.
And Chennai’s Sai Prithvi made the best use of it to tally a maximum of 252 points over the five rounds to emerge Season Two’s undisputed champion.
He enjoyed four victories which was sufficient enough to give him the crown and testing in a Volkswagen Motorsport race car.
Thrissur’s Abdul Fattah (191) and Mumbai’s Raiden Samervel (172) finished for the next two places respectively.
ISRL’s third season will begin on May 8, with promise of upgrades, more viewer-friendly format and an attractive prize pool.
Registrations are already open.
The championship, organised by eight-time national karting champion Rayomand Banajee and his IR eSports, pits India’s best online racers against real world racers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK starts state-backed loans for smallest firms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — A government-backed loan scheme to help Britain’s small businesses survive the coronavirus lockdown comes into effect on Monday, allowing firms such as hairdressing salons, coffee shops and florists to receive emergency cash.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, who previously opposed 100% state backing for commercial loans, announced the new facility on April 27, bowing to pressure to do more for the smallest companies after a previous scheme got off to a slow start.
The new “Bounce Back Loans” allow businesses including sole traders to borrow between 2,000 and 50,000 pounds ($2,500-$62,500) at a flat interest rate of 2.5%. Banks handling the loans will not be required to run credit checks or assess the long-term viability of applicants.
“Small businesses will play a key role creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic,” Sunak said in a statement to mark the first day when the Bounce Back scheme goes into operation.
“The Bounce Back loan scheme will make sure they get the finance they need – helping them bounce back and protect jobs,” he said.
Most British businesses have been shut to the public since March 23, when the government imposed social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus. Government forecasters have said the economy could contract by 35% in the second quarter.
Britain last month announced an emergency 330 billion-pound credit scheme including loans of up to 5 million pounds for small and medium-sized companies, with state guarantees of 80%.
But many companies said they struggled to secure bank approvals, putting pressure on Sunak to provide full state guarantees for commercial loans to the smallest businesses.
From Monday, any firm that has already taken out a loan of 50,000 pounds or less under the 80%-state-backed scheme can apply to have it switched over to the Bounce Back scheme.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everything you need to know about 'murder hornets'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The internet is buzzing about so-called "murder hornets" after the New York Times detailed an invasion of Asian giant hornets in Washington state, adding another threat to worry about to the already calamitous year.
The description of the devastation these insects caused at a local beehive feels like something out of a novel: thousands of bees laying dead with their heads ripped off — a whole colony decimated. It's such a problem that the state of Washington is enlisting people to find, report on, and kill these hornets with a "sometimes lethal" sting. A dead one was first spotted in December on a beekeeper's front porch. More may be seen this spring and into the fall as the queens' hibernations ended in April.
In case you're unfamiliar with these murder hornets, here's exactly what we're dealing with, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Washington State University.
Asian giant hornets are the largest species of hornet in the world. They grow to sizes of 1.5 inches to more than 2 inches, which is about the length of two quarters laying side-by-side. For comparison, the much more common European hornet is about half the size, and yellowjacket wasps are around 0.5 inches to 0.75 inches.
Not only are Asian giant hornet stingers long enough to sting through normal beekeeper suits, getting stung by one of these hornets will cause excruciating pain. YouTuber Coyote Peterson subjected himself to the sting of an Asian giant hornet and described it while yelling and writhing as feeling like "absolute searing pain."
Their stingers deliver seven times the amount of venom as a honey bee. Not only that, but they can sting victims multiple times without a problem. Attacking in groups, they can kill humans, but they're mostly hunting for honeybees.
If people are allergic to the venom of Asian giant hornets or are stung by multiple hornets, it can be fatal. About 50 people are killed by the giant hornets each year in Japan, according to the Times. The hornets are territorial and will be aggressive when something gets close to their nest but are not as aggressive far away from their homes. If you spot a murder hornet in the wild in Washington, state officials ask that you contact them rather than trying to trap the insects yourself.
This is the reason why these insects are referred to as murder hornets. Asian giant hornets feed themselves and their young by killing and eating other insects and regurgitating them back to their young. When Asian giant hornets find a honey bee nest, they can tear apart tens of thousands of them in mere hours with a team of just a few dozen, completely taking out a colony without a problem. This can be devastating to beekeepers and honey producers. To make matters worse, the honeybee population has been declining for years in the U.S. due to habitat loss, disease, and pesticides. 
When scouts head out to find food sources, they secrete a special scent on honeybee hives so that their fellow hornets can find it and team up to attack. They are the only known species of wasp to apply a scent to food targets, according the the entomology journal Psyche. 
Luckily, the Asian giant hornet isn't a threat all year long. They remain relatively dormant through the winter but they do start seeking food starting in April. During the late summer and the fall is when they're at their most aggressive and are most likely to go take on honeybee colonies.
While it's currently unclear how these Asian giant hornets came to North America, the area they've been spotted in makes sense. They prefer to live in low-altitude forests and mountains and build underground nests. You probably won't find these insects in high-altitude areas or open plains.
Asian giant hornets are exceptional fliers. They can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour and can travel several miles in a single day. Luckily they're less aggressive when they're far from home, but if they spot a honeybee colony near you, you could be in danger as they attack that area and defend it from other potential threats.
This kind of goes without saying, but Asian giant hornets are not welcome in North America. Honeybees are vital to many facets of agriculture in North America as they help pollinate a lot of different crops including apples and various kinds of berries. Honeybees have enough trouble as it is with drastically reducing population numbers, the Asian giant hornet could have long-lasting effects if it's not eradicated quickly.
Don't worry, it's possible to get rid of murder hornets. There are numerous methods of getting rid of Asian giant hornets through the use of poison, controlled fires, baited traps, and screens. Not only can humans do a lot to get rid of these pests, sometimes honeybees can outnumber these giant killers. A bunch of honeybees will completely cover the murder hornets and kill them by increasing the heat within the tangle of bodies and exerting carbon dioxide.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said on Saturday that Riyadh will take strict measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, adding that "all options for dealing with the crisis are open".
"We must reduce budget expenditures sharply", Jadaan said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV, adding that the impact of the new coronavirus on Saudi Arabia's state finances will appear from the second quarter of the year.
"Saudi finances need more discipline and the road ahead is long," he said.
Jadaan said Saudi Arabia had used some revenue from investments to plug the deficit.
He noted the country had introduced stimulus measures aimed at preserving jobs in the private sector and safeguarding the provision of basic services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi to take 'strict, painful' measures to deal with coronavirus impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RIYADH — Saudi Arabia will take strict and painful measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the finance minister said on Saturday, adding that “all options for dealing with the crisis are open.”
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply,” Mohammed al-Jadaan said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV, adding that the impact of the new coronavirus on Saudi Arabia’s state finances will appear from the second quarter of the year.
“Saudi finances need more discipline and the road ahead is long,” he said.
One measure would be to slow down government projects, including mega-projects, to reduce spending, he said.
The world’s largest oil exporter is suffering from historically low oil prices, while measures to fight the coronavirus are likely to curb the pace and scale of economic reforms launched by Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia’s central bank foreign exchange reserves fell in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years, hitting their lowest level since 2011, while the kingdom slipped to a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenue collapsed.
Jadaan said last month that Riyadh could borrow $26 billion more this year while it would draw down up to $32 billion from its foreign reserves to finance the deficit.
On Saturday Jadaan told Al Arabiya Saudi Arabia had used some revenue from investments to plug the deficit, and that the crisis presented investment opportunities.
Jadaan noted the country had introduced stimulus measures aimed at preserving jobs in the private sector and safeguarding the provision of basic services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil-hungry Asian nations pounce on low prices to build stockpiles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE – Some oil-hungry Asian nations are taking advantage of the collapse in prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to build up their crude stockpiles.
Here are some questions and answers about strategic reserves and the region's oil supplies:
What are strategic oil reserves and why do countries need them?
Strategic reserves are stockpiles of oil and other fuels held by governments in secure storage facilities to cover unexpected disruptions to energy supplies.
Major economies such as the United States, China, and Russia began to build up reserves after oil shocks in the 1970s, according to Ravi Krishnaswamy, regional senior vice president for energy and environment at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The events that spurred them to take action were principally the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab nations, and the 1979 Iranian revolution, which fuelled worries about supplies.
How big are the strategic reserves across the region?
China is believed to have the biggest in the Asia-Pacific. Beijing does not give an official estimate, but analysts say it is at around 550 million barrels. In comparison, the United States' strategic reserves currently hold around 630 million.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation said recently that the country's reserves were "obviously insufficient, and have not yet reached the international standard '90-day safety line.'"
The International Energy Agency requires its members to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports. China is an associate member, but not a full member.
Japan's oil reserves were around 500 million barrels at the end of February, equivalent to national consumption for more than 7 months, according to the latest official data, while South Korea had around 96 million barrels in strategic reserves as of December 2019, enough for 89 days.
India, by contrast, has reserves with storage capacity of approximately 40 million barrels – which would last just 10 days in the country of 1.3 billion people.
How are reserves stored?
Strategic reserves are stored largely in secure underground depots like natural rock caverns. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude, is stored in huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast.
But building underground storage is challenging as it needs to have the right geological formation, and countries also need to build infrastructure to pump oil in and out.
The high cost of building reserves has stopped many countries developing them to sufficient levels.
In Asia, India uses caverns to store its reserves but other countries, such as Japan, put theirs in aboveground tanks.
Which Asian countries are pouncing on low prices to build up stockpiles?
Australia, which has long had one of the lowest levels of emergency stockpiles in the developed world, said it will take advantage of the fall in prices to develop a strategic reserve in the US.
The country's own storage capacity is already full, but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
In China, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange last month gave approval for state-owned Sinopec Petroleum Reserve to add more storage capacity.
One storage depot in southern Guangdong province can hold up to 600,000 cubic meters (3.8 million barrels), while another in northern Hebei province can hold up to one million cubic meters.
India's Ministry of Petroleum tweeted on April 15 it was buying crude to fill its reserves, stored in rock caverns, "to their full capacity."
Madhu Nainan, editor of industry publication PetroWatch, however, questioned whether the country had enough available storage space to build up capacity quickly.
"In India, storage tanks and pipelines are full and dealers' tanks are full," he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).
Japan and South Korea, with ample stockpiles, have not announced plans to build up their reserves substantially.
A Japanese trade ministry official said current levels were sufficient, while Seoul plans to increase stockpiles by less than 1% this year.
Could low prices boost the region's economies when lockdowns are lifted?
It looks unlikely, in the short term at least. Many observers believe economic activity won't bounce back quickly with the gradual lifting of lockdowns but only when a vaccine for the virus is discovered – which could be some time away.
"Low oil prices won't turbocharge Asian economic recovery," Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst, told AFP.
Are there any winners from low prices?
Major oil importers in Asia – such as China, Japan, and South Korea – would in usual times benefit from low prices, but this is unlikely to be the case immediately given the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
In Japan, for example, "the price crash has hit financial markets hard, which is negatively affecting the Japanese economy," said Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
"We can't apply our usual framework to this unprecedented period."
Some economists, however, expect oil prices to stay low for a long period, meaning major importers could eventually emerge winners.
"Oil prices are expected to remain low to some extent when the post-corona era comes, and given the current situation, it will have a positive effect on [South Korea's] economy in terms of recovery," said Jung Jun-hwan, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.
There are also "obvious losers" in Asia, such as oil exporters Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei, said OANDA's Halley. – Rappler.com

One storage depot in southern Guangdong province can hold up to 600,000 cubic metres (3.8 million barrels), while another in northern Hebei province can hold up to one million cubic metres.
India's Ministry of Petroleum tweeted on April 15 it was buying crude to fill its reserves, stored in rock caverns, "to their full capacity".
Madhu Nainan, editor of industry publication PetroWatch, however, questioned whether the country had enough available storage space to build up capacity quickly.
"In India, storage tanks and pipelines are full and dealers' tanks are full," he told AFP.
Japan and South Korea, with ample stockpiles, have not announced plans to build up their reserves substantially.
A Japanese trade ministry official said current levels were sufficient, while Seoul plans to increase stockpiles by less than one percent this year.
- Could low prices boost the region's economies when lockdowns are lifted? -
It looks unlikely, in the short term at least. Many observers believe economic activity won't bounce back quickly with the gradual lifting of lockdowns but only when a vaccine for the virus is discovered -- which could be some time away.
"Low oil prices won't turbocharge Asian economic recovery," Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst, told AFP.
- Are there any winners from low prices? -
Major oil-importers in Asia -- such as China, Japan and South Korea -- would in usual times benefit from low prices but this is unlikely to be the case immediately given the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
In Japan, for example, "the price crash has hit financial markets hard, which is negatively affecting the Japanese economy", said Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
"We can't apply our usual framework to this unprecedented period."
Some economists, however, expect oil prices to stay low for a long period, meaning major importers could eventually emerge winners.
"Oil prices are expected to remain low to some extent when the post-corona era comes, and given the current situation, it will have a positive effect on (South Korea's) economy in terms of recovery," said Jung Jun-hwan, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.
There are also "obvious losers" in Asia, such as oil exporters Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, said OANDA's Halley.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil-hungry Asian nations pounce on low prices to build stockpiles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some oil-hungry Asian nations are taking advantage of the collapse in prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to build up their crude stockpiles.
Here are some questions and answers about strategic reserves and the region's oil supplies:
Strategic reserves are stockpiles of oil and other fuels held by governments in secure storage facilities to cover unexpected disruptions to energy supplies.
Major economies such as the US, China and Russia began to build up reserves after oil shocks in the 1970s, according to Ravi Krishnaswamy, regional senior vice president for energy and environment at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The events that spurred them to take action were principally the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab nations, and the 1979 Iranian revolution, which fuelled worries about supplies.
China is believed to have the biggest in the Asia-Pacific. Beijing does not give an official estimate but analysts say it is at around 550 million barrels. In comparison, the United States' strategic reserves currently hold around 630 million.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation said recently that the country's reserves were "obviously insufficient, and have not yet reached the international standard '90-day safety line'".
The International Energy Agency requires its members to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports. China is an associate member, but not a full member.
Japan's oil reserves were around 500 million barrels at the end of February, equivalent to national consumption for more than seven months, according to the latest official data, while South Korea had around 96 million barrels in strategic reserves as of December 2019, enough for 89 days.
India, by contrast, has reserves with storage capacity of approximately 40 million barrels -- which would last just 10 days in the country of 1.3 billion people.
Strategic reserves are stored largely in secure underground depots like natural rock caverns. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude, is stored in huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast.
But building underground storage is challenging as it needs to have the right geological formation, and countries also need to build infrastructure to pump oil in and out.
The high cost of building reserves has stopped many countries developing them to sufficient levels.
In Asia, India uses caverns to store its reserves but other countries, such as Japan, put theirs in above-ground tanks.
Australia, which has long had one of the lowest levels of emergency stockpiles in the developed world, said it will take advantage of the fall in prices to develop a strategic reserve in the United States.
The country's own storage capacity is already full but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
In China, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange last month gave approval for state-owned Sinopec Petroleum Reserve to add more storage capacity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Copper giant Peru to gradually ease restrictions on mining sector in May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LIMA — Peru will gradually ease restrictions on key sectors including mining and construction in May, the government said in a decree on Sunday, after activity had been virtually paralyzed since mid-March by the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown.
In the decree published in the official newspaper El Peruano, the government said the exploitation, storage and transportation of large-scale mining could be restarted, as well as key construction projects, some related to hydrocarbons.
Peru is the world’s second largest producer of copper and is heavily dependent on the sector for economic growth.
The decree said that to restart activities, companies must implement rigorous health protocols to avoid infections. These will be set by local governments within the next five days and will be supervised by health authorities.
The country’s mining sector and wider economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has seen 42,534 confirmed cases of the virus in the country – the second most in Latin America. The death toll from the disease in Peru is now around 1,200.
“It is necessary to begin the social and economic recovery,” the government said in the decree.
“Therefore, it is a priority to address the transition to a resumption of activities that incorporates precautions and protective measures to prevent infections and minimize the risk of a rebound in the disease.”
Major local mine Antamina, controlled by global firms BHP Group Ltd and Glencore, reported over the last week that some 210 company workers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, of which 87% were asymptomatic.
The government of President Martín Vizcarra had previously said it would restart key activities in four phases starting this month, but without specifying which sectors.
The supreme decree on Sunday also included resumptions of production in the agricultural industry, industrial fishing, some areas of construction and the metal-mechanical sector.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stephen Moore on economy: 'It's going to be a bad summer'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Economist Stephen Moore predicted Sunday that the summer will not provide any relief for the U.S.'s beleaguered economy.
“It’s going to be a really tough time for retail...stores like Macy’s.. are going to face a tough time...because a lot of them were in trouble already," Moore told radio host John Catsimatidis on Sunday.
"But also people are just going to be a little more wary about going into stores...It’s going to be a bad summer."
Moore, an ally of President Trump who is on the White House coronavirus economic task force, said that many states could experience unemployment rates between 15 and 20 percent, adding that he doesn't think the U.S. will see the light at the end of the tunnel until mid-to-late August.
"In the fall we’ll start to see a nice recovery," Moore noted.
Moore's comments come as major retailer Macy's plans to open 68 stores after it shuttered its businesses in mid-March. According to data from the Commerce Department, retail sales dropped 9 percent in March, the largest drop on record according to the government office. 
Retailers that open face a double challenge: providing their customers with proper personal protective gear, and trying to convince shoppers to make purchases in-person.
In the past six weeks, over 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment and that number is only expected to rise in the coming weeks. Before the onset of the pandemic, the U.S.'s unemployment rate was roughly 3.5 percent. Economists have estimated that the number is now hovering around 20 percent.
The economic fallout from the pandemic was also reflected in the U.S.'s GDP, which fell 4.8 percent in the first quarter, the largest contraction since the financial crisis.
Through four economic stimulus packages, Congress and the president have injected upwards of $3 trillion into the country's economy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crunch time for Sezzle in US buy now, pay later market</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For investors, the growth in the United States buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector makes Australia look small beer.
Around $1 billion of Afterpay's $2.6 billion in total sales came from the US in the March quarter, with rivals like US-centric Sezzle also growing strongly.
Over the year to March 31, Sezzle more than quadrupled North American merchants and consumers using its services to 12,715 and 1.15 million respectively. Afterpay has 4.4 million active customers in the US, more than the 3.2 million in its maturer Australian market.
Overall, it's a market that is between 10 to 20 times bigger than Australia.
Yet Minneapolis-based Sezzle chief executive Charlie Youakim says the US BNPL sector is still three years behind Australia.
"We're at the early adopter phase in the US, but it's definitely picking up. Retailers are taking notice. They're starting to realise they need a solution," says Youakim.
The key to profitability will be how the fintechs manage costs fixed to every transaction. If transaction costs are managed, then BNPL could profitably scale as other non-transaction-facing costs such as staff and marketing can be kept relatively fixed versus headline growth.
"When we launched in the US we looked at what happened in Australia and noticed the biggest difference in the unit economics between the two countries was card processing rates," Youakim says.
BNPL players charge consumers' cards themselves, rather than the retailer, and pass on the cost as part of a bundled fee to retailers for different services provided.
In the US, the fee charged by card issuers (normally Visa or Mastercard ) to process a transaction is far higher than in Australia.
"In Australia, it's regulated by the government. [The fee] runs at 0.6- 0.7 per cent. In the US it's unregulated, so the oligopoly have their run at it," Youakim explains.
A typical Visa processing fee in the US is 3 per cent. Sezzle charges retailers fees around 6 per cent plus 30 cents per transaction, with the pitch that this includes the 3 per cent card fee. Afterpay typically charges retailers around 4 to 4.5 per cent in the US, including the card fee.
Bulls argue the source of income BNPL players provide Visa and Mastercard explains why they have little incentive to compete with or disintermediate the sector.
In 2019, Afterpay announced a partnership with Visa given their mutually beneficial interests. Visa or Mastercard also cannot acquire customers at online checkouts like BNPL players, because they don't face the consumer, but the consumer's bank or card issuer.
Despite this niche, bears like broker UBS argue the BNPL sector has little moat as there's little to stop new competitors offering retailers lower fees to win market share.
Another significant transaction cost for BNPL is the interest on the warehouse funding required to manage receivables.
Receivables balances are the vast sums a BNPL provider borrows from a bank to pay a merchant upfront, while waiting six weeks for the consumer to pay it back with no interest charged.
The interest on warehouse funding a BNPL provider must pay for a credit line is based on periodical LIBOR inter-bank lending rates. Three-month (US dollar) LIBOR is now 76 basis points and a typical 30-day LIBOR rate 50 basis points.
The BNPL players have benefited from interest savings on warehouse balances as LIBOR tumbled in line with global rates. If LIBOR rose with rates it would hurt transaction margins.
In turn, if BNPL players had to extend consumers' credit periods under the COVID-19 "Team Australia" principle of debt leniency, costs to fund receivables increase via higher interest and longer durations. This reduces return on invested capital as a measure of profitability.
In its March quarter update, Afterpay controversially revealed it shortened credit duration for consumers by making the first instalment payments upfront for most Australian customers.
The third key variable transaction cost driving how profitable the BNPL business model is at scale is bad debts as a percentage of sales.
In a bear scenario it's possible US margins turn negative on merchant fee pressure, increased bad debts, funding costs, or payment-processing charges.
Broker UBS says sell Afterpay because margin pressure will hurt it in FY21. It has a lowly $14 price target.
Sezzle's Youakim dismisses fee pressure as a risk, given the business model increases sales and basket sizes for retailers, while giving consumers a superior alternative to interest-bearing credit cards.
"There's much more room to grow. That's number one," he says. "This payment by instalment trend is a mega trend. Customers love it. It's going to continue to take hold. It's still early days."
Broker Ord Minnett says "the growth rates Sezzle is experiencing cannot be ignored and the company represents the best opportunity in the BNPL segment".
It has a $3.40 valuation, more than double Friday's $1.61 closing price.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First-Quarter 2020 Portfolio Review: Trimmed TGT, Dropped CSV, And Benched WMT</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
My quarterly reviews are based on guidelines written out in a business plan (for more on this read articles by Seeking Alpha author Bob Wells). By putting my review into article format, I hope to help other DGI investors in developing or refining their own business plan.
My plan's main emphasis is on steady income from companies with a history of increasing dividends but I'm also looking to create a well-rounded and diversified portfolio. This includes exposure to varying sectors, industries, and dividend risk. I've looked at those three areas and below are some details from this review and any actions I deemed necessary:
Size Review
A fully positioned portfolio will eventually feature approximately 40-50 stocks and be 95% invested. As of today, the portfolio contains 22 positions with 96% invested (4% cash reserves). With 21 total holdings, currently position size should not exceed 5% for a single stock. Below are the current holdings and their weights. Six stocks are currently overweight (TGT, WMT, LOW, PG, SNA, and JNJ).
Action taken: From this point forward I'll be focusing on re-balancing some of these overweight positions. TGT is the largest of them and on 4/28 I sold approximately half of the position which will bring the weight closer to the 5% guideline. As a bonus, any new positions opened using the sale funds will bring the total number of positions closer to the 40-50 total.
Sector Review
Sectors within the portfolio can currently be broken down into six categories. Below are those categories and how much weight each one comprises of the total portfolio.
Per the plan, no sector should make up at least 25% of holdings which is currently the case. At least 50% of positions should be in defensive sectors which is also the case. A non-defensive sector should not have more than 10%. Two sectors are currently overweight, Consumer Discretionary and Industrials.
Action: If I open a new position with either new funds or the funds from the TGT trim, it will not be towards Consumer Discretionary or Industrial. Since TGT is a Consumer Discretionary, the trim will also reduce exposure to this sector as well which is also helpful.
Dividends, Fundamentals and Technical Data Review
To maintain a healthy level of volatility as compared with the general market, the portfolio should have an overall beta of 0.7 or less. Currently the 5-yr Beta is 0.78, slightly higher than the guideline. With the current volatility the market is experiencing, this guideline will be increasingly important to assess when making stocks selection in the future.
Action taken: CVS has been on the bench due to a frozen dividend. I decided to sell my position in CVS on 4/28. In hindsight, I should have dropped this position in 2018 when the freeze extended beyond 8 quarters.
The portfolio's overall average yield is 3.67%. Three stocks have a yield that is below the plan's minimum current standard of 2.0% (AWR, HRL, and WMT). HRL has a double digit DGR of 12.0% and AWR has a decent DGR of 9.4% so I will just keep an eye on them for now.
WMT on the other hand has both a low Yield of 1.9% and a low 1-yr DGR of 1.9%. The 3-yr DGR is 2.0%. Due to the lack of dividend growth and income, I'm placing this stock on the "bench" meaning I will not expand this position and do a more in-depth performance review next quarter to see if any progress was made. WMT has had record profits due to the COVID-19 pandemic so it will be interesting to see how it plays it with regards to dividends.
VLO and MO's yield are currently over 6% so at this point I won't be expanding positions in these companies.
To end on a high-note, the portfolio's 1-yr DGR is 8.7% with 9 out of 21 stocks having double-digit growth. I will continue to do my best to follow my business plan to ensure the portfolio continues toward stable, growing income. I hope this article helps you with your own DGI business plan. Let me know how your quarterly review goes! Thank you to Seeking Alpha author Justin Law for maintaining the The Dividend Champions Excel Spreadsheet.
Disclosure: I am/we are long WMT, TGT, HRL, MO, VLO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How COVID-19 will dampen Indonesia’s infrastructure developments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Indonesian economy is plagued by a range of “infrastructure gaps”, places where much-needed physical and digital infrastructure is either substandard or absent, mostly due to under-investment.
For example, many hospitals and clinics in remote provinces lack 24-hour access to clean water and electricity. Due to Indonesia’s rapid growth, industrialization and urbanization in the past 20 years, its infrastructure needs have soared.
Successive Indonesian governments at all levels have struggled to build infrastructure at the pace required. The result has constrained its domestic economic performance and its trade integration with the broader Indo-Pacific region.
Estimating the investment required to close these gaps is challenging. A widely accepted figure is a World Bank estimate that Indonesia needs to invest US$500 billion in basic facilities over the next five years to support continued growth.
Indonesia’s decision to build a new national capital in the province of East Kalimantan adds an estimated US$33 billion to the bill.
Finding a budget to fill the gap will get harder as Indonesia’s economy and finances come under pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. This will in turn affect infrastructure development.
This year’s national infrastructure budget stands at about US$29 billion. The government will directly fund a fraction of the total of US$412 billion in investments from 2020 to 2024 to build infrastructure projects, providing 40 percent of the total budget, or about $US164.8 billion. The remaining funds will come from state-owned enterprises (25 percent) and the private sector (35 percent).
The pandemic will force the government to reallocate funds, while other sources of money will dry up in the ensuing recession.
Challenges facing infrastructure development
The Perth USAsia Centre has developed the Indonesia Infrastructure Map to help visualize the country’s infrastructural challenges. The map identifies Indonesia’s major projects by sector. It contains 206 infrastructure projects and will continue to be updated.
The map highlights that Indonesia has unique connectivity challenges unlike other countries of its economic status and population. One challenge is inherent to its archipelagic geography: the country’s 17,000 islands suffer from a lack of connectivity with each other.
You can see this reflected in the spread of projects on the map. Most are focused in the densely populated west, on the islands of Sumatra and Java. According to the National Strategic Projects pipeline, Java and Sumatra have 154 projects planned compared to 79 elsewhere.
By contrast, eastern Indonesia remains sparsely serviced by new infrastructure projects. And in the provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are non-existent.
On its larger islands, even major economic centers are not well-connected. For example, there is not yet a major railway connecting the two most populated cities of Jakarta and Surabaya.
The lack of essential infrastructure can also be blamed on policies like the fuel subsidy. It eats up much-needed cash, about US$9 billion a year, from the national budget. The subsidy also distorts markets, leaves Indonesia’s currency vulnerable and incentivizes reliance on motor transport.
The proposed capital in East Kalimantan can be viewed as an effort to spur a new hub of economic activity off Sumatra and Java. Around this new site there are also few existing infrastructure projects. The Balikpapan-Samarinda toll road is nearing completion and Jokowi himself said it will be connected to the new capital.
If geography wasn’t challenging enough, Indonesia now has to contend with the vexing financial and economic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government’s fiscal response has consisted of initial packages worth US$2 billion followed by a major stimulus of US$26 billion. It can finance some of this by reallocating funds from existing programs, but resources will become scarcer as government revenue takes a hit from the sluggish economy. The government has raised its deficit cap to 5 percent in order to borrow more funds for emergency measures.
Foreign lending will also begin to dry up. A broader question hangs over how sustainable foreign loans have been, including those from China. The clouds of a credit market crisis are already gathering.
Indonesia is especially vulnerable to increased borrowing costs. The Indonesian rupiah has declined precipitously, increasing the repayment burden of its foreign-denominated debts.
Getting harder to fill
As the full force of the economic crisis due to the pandemic takes hold, it is likely Indonesia will need a lot more cash for stimulus measures. This will eat into Indonesia’s ability to pay for its own infrastructure projects.
However, Indonesia should view infrastructure development as part of its recovery, as it provides employment, opens up new markets and creates efficiencies.
A deft move for Jokowi would be to take advantage of collapsing oil prices by cutting remaining fuel subsidies and redirecting the funds to economic recovery and infrastructure.
Indonesia will need to draw more on the resources of the range of infrastructure and connectivity (I&C) initiatives that have been launched by governments in the Asia-Pacific since 2010. These include China’s Belt and Road, Japan’s PQI and the recently established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to name but a few. These initiatives collectively offer over US$1 trillion. Participating in these also means managing the geopolitics involved.
In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia will need to carefully consider the role infrastructure plays in its economic recovery.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FPIs Remain In Selloff Mode, Pull Out Rs 15,403 Crore In April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bookmark
Foreign portfolio investors withdrew a net Rs 15,403 crore from the Indian capital markets in April amid the coronavirus crisis continuing their selling spree for the second straight month.
As per the depositories data, FPIs pulled out a net sum of Rs 6,884 crore from equities and a net Rs 8,519 crore from the debt segment between April 1-30.
The total net outflow during the month stood at Rs 15,403 crore.
In March, FPIs had withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian capital markets (both equity and debt).
"Of the inflows that are coming into India, nearly all are in the NBFC and pharma sectors," said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww.
He further said outflows have continued due to uncertainty surrounding economic conditions and investors are being cautious, keeping their reserves in the US dollar.
"Though net outflow continued in April, it did not reach the levels seen in March. However, the pessimism continues to grip the markets. Foreign investors would continue to adopt a cautious stance, which is also reflected in their investment pattern in the Indian markets.
"So far, India has been able to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading aggressively. In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors," said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.
With selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front. They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
"These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilises," Srivastava said.

The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, said last month that the pandemic could mean 1.2 billion fewer air passengers worldwide by September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor stresses on need to step up credit flow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HYDERABAD:   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday reiterated the need to improve credit flow, particularly extending working capital to MSMEs besides implementing the 3-month moratorium in toto. Interacting with the chiefs of major public and private sector banks via a video conference on Saturday, Das acknowledged the banking officials’ contribution during the lockdown and discussed the current economic situation in the country.
Reviewing the current situation, he underscored the need to step up credit flow to different sectors including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), micro finance institutions, housing finance firms and mutual funds. Last week, the central bank even opened a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity window to enable mutual fund houses to tide over the crisis.
However, the response has been lacklustre with banks borrowing a mere Rs 2,000 crore, implying that the crisis among mutual funds isn’t as severe. Despite RBI reducing the reverse repo rate to 3.25 per cent discouraging banks from sitting on cash, they continued to park suplus funds with the central bank, and as much as Rs 7 lakh crore is parked under the reverse repo window.
Some of the other topics discussed during the meeting included post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital with special focus on credit flows to small businesses, implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI, monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector, the central bank said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor takes up credit flow issue with public, private bank chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday took up the issue of improving credit flow to various sectors of the economy, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with the chiefs of major private and public sector banks. However, banks said they were looking for a credit guarantee support from the government, while extending loans to NBFCs and also proposed that a decision on extending the three-month moratorium on loan repayments can be taken at the end of May.
The RBI review, called by Governor Shaktikanta Das, has come at a time when non-food credit has plummeted by Rs 33,872 crore to Rs 102.8 lakh crore during the fortnight ended April 10 and the government extended the lockdown by another two weeks to May 17.
The meeting reviewed the current economic situation and credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to NBFCs, micro finance institutions, housing finance companies and mutual funds, the RBI said. The meeting, conducted through video conference, also took up post-lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs and implementation of three months’ moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI.
Explained
With many sectors in the doldrums due to the lockdown, banks are expecting bad loans to rise after June when the moratorium period ends. The extension of moratorium and a government guarantee scheme will give more comfort to the banks which have turned risk averse now.
While banks had extended the loan moratorium to their customers, they have not extended the same facility to NBFCs and MFIs, which borrow from banks. On extending government guarantees to loans to MSMEs and NBFCs, the CEO of a nationalised bank said, “In many countries, the government stepped in and they are giving guarantees particularly for the loans or the incremental credit even to the MSME sector.” This means the liability will be contingent in the books of the government and banks can leverage those guarantees. Banks say it can be a good model to help out borrowers, particularly MSMEs, it’s not clear whether the government is keen on such a proposal.
On the poor credit flow to various sectors, a bank official said, “Unless the economic activity picks up, the demand for credit isn’t likely to pick up and the lack of credit growth is not in my view currently because of any risk aversion.” Though many PSU banks have come out with Covid-19 loan schemes for MSMEs, credit flow has not picked up to the desired levels. The RBI has conducted long-term repo operations (LTRO) for banks at the repo rate of 4.40 per cent, but banks are preferring better rated corporates while ignoring the claims of small units and NBFCs. On extending the moratorium beyond May 31, he said, “Let’s wait till May 31 and then see that what is the demand or what is the situation and depending upon the situation on the ground, I think these are the things which the RBI can take a view and take a calibrated approach. I think the next view probably will be taken after May 31.”
As per the RBI, the Governor “appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal” operations during the lockdown … Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector were discussed.
Bank deposits rise on outflows from debt mutual fund segment
While banks witnessed a contraction in credit outstandings, deposits increased during the fortnight ended April 10. Deposits rose by Rs 1,47,435 crore to Rs 137.1 lakh crore, largely due to the outflows from the debt mutual fund segment. However demand deposits (savings accounts) saw an outflow of Rs 1.35 lakh crore, while time deposits (FDs) surged by Rs 2.82 lakh crore. ENS

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI guv Das chastises banks not doing enough on lending, NBFC liquidity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has indicated giving relaxations to banks on audit of branches for 2019-20, as they face challenges in managing branch networks owing to the coronavirus lockdown.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday met heads of major banks, both from the public and private sectors, in two separate sessions through videoconferencing to review the current economic situation, liquidity to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and the issue of moratorium on loan repayments, among other things.
Das reportedly chastised the banks for not doing enough on lending and NBFC liquidity. He was also upset about the failure of the Targeted Long Term Repo Operations 2.0 (TLTRO 2.0), but there was no warning or instruction. “The RBI can only urge,” said a person who was present in the meeting. The RBI also dwelled on preparations for conducting business after the lockdown.

The meetings were also attended by Deputy Governors M D Patra and
M K Jain, besides other senior officers of the central bank, the RBI said in a statement.
According to the statement, the RBI governor took stock of “credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to NBFCs, micro finance institutions (MFIs), housing finance companies (HFCs), and mutual funds”.

Senior bank executives aware of deliberations said banks, including State Bank of India, were examining proposals for providing liquidity to NBFCs, HFCs and MFIs. Some of the assistance will be without using RBI’s liquidity windows (TLTRO) as banks are sitting on huge surplus money, they said. Preparations for results for the fourth quarter and FY20 by banks also came up for discussion.

Everything can’t be done remotely and physical movement of auditors to branches is necessary, banking sources said, adding that the emphasis was on doing this under due care to minimise health risks.
There are some relaxations in terms of the number of branches to be covered under the audit plan. The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has made some suggestions to the banking regulator on audit activity. However, the RBI did not specify steps in this regard, bankers said.
The governor appreciated efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near-normal operations during the lockdown, and stressed on post-lockdown credit flows, including for working capital, “with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs”, the statement said.
Banks have conveyed they will adopt a segmented approach to scale up operations in the post-lockdown phase, and will first focus on green zones.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Top officials of the Reserve Bank of India, including its Governor Shaktikanta Das, and Deputy Governors, met the chief executives of public and private sector banks on Saturday to review the current economic situation and took feedback on the credit flow and liquidity situation.

The central bank also discussed the issue of loan moratorium in the meeting. The issue assumed significance in the light of the recent Supreme Court ruling that banks need to follow the RBI guidelines on moratorium in letter and spirit.
There was a lot of customer complaints that banks and other lending institutions were not extending the loan moratorium benefit, particularly to non-banking finance companies.
Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to NBFCs, micro finance institutions, housing finance companies and mutual funds, were discussed in the meeting, the RBI said. Some of the mutual funds also faced redemption pressure due to which RBI had opened a window specifically for these entities which can be accessed by banks to tap liquidity to lend to mutual funds. However, there was not much appetite from banks to tap the liquidity window.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Das appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal operations during the lockdown period, the RBI said. The interaction was held in two separate sessions through video conferencing.
Post-lockdown credit flows, including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs, were also discussed. The government has provided significant relaxation for starting economic activities in the third phase of the lockdown that starts from Monday.
Some other issues that came up during the interaction was monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe, and stability of the financial sector.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held meetings with heads of domestic banks on the economic situation and credit flow to different sectors of the economy, among other issues, the central bank said in a release .
“The governor held meetings with MDs/CEOs of major public and private sector banks today in two separate sessions through video conference. The meetings were attended by Deputy Governors and other senior officers of RBI,” it said.
Das discussed credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including availability of liquidity to NBFCs, microfinance institutions (MFIs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and mutual funds.
NBFCs and MFIs have been demanding a moratorium on their bank obligations as they have been forced to give similar leeways to their lenders. They have been dealing with lack of liquidity, as banks and mutual funds have become wary of lending to them for fear of defaults.
Independent estimates peg the funding gap for NBFCs at Rs 60,000 crore despite RBI’s efforts to make funds available at cheaper rates. Das also reviewed the current economic situation, post-lockdown credit flow, including provisions for working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs and implementation of the three-month moratorium on repayment of loan installment announced by RBI.
Medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) have been the worst hit as the extended lockdown has left them starved of cash. Industries have been waiting for a stimulus package from the government, which is yet to see the day of the light.
The RBI Governor also deliberated on monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector during the meetings.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost 23 million US jobs were created in the last decade. In a single month, they were all but wiped out.
The US labour department’s April employment report will further detail the swift and extensive toll of government efforts to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists calls for an eye-popping 21 million plunge in payrolls, the most in records back to 1939. That’s about 10 times the previous record decline in September 1945, when the nation demobilized with the end of World War II.
The US unemployment rate is projected to surge to more than 16 per cent, the highest in monthly data back to 1948.
The April jobs report will provide a fuller picture of the labour market impact after nationwide shutdowns aimed at limited the spread of the coronavirus. In March, employment slumped by 701,000 and the jobless rate climbed to 4.4 per cent, the highest since August 2017. It was just in February that the unemployment rate matched the lowest level since 1969.
Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims data have been abysmal. In the six weeks ended April 25, more than 30 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits.
Europe, Middle East and Africa
In the UK, with the government trying to figure out how to ease the lockdown, the Bank of England will decide whether the emergency measures it has taken so far are enough for the time being to sustain the economy. In a rare move reflecting the magnitude of the crisis, officials will release their monetary policy and financial stability reports on the same day, giving insight into their outlook for the economic and assessments of the state of the banking system.
The European Central Bank faces a legal hurdle on Tuesday when Germany’s constitutional court publishes its verdict on whether the ECB’s QE program is compatible with the country’s law. An adverse ruling, or one which imposes strict limits on purchases, could spark turmoil in markets, potentially undermining the institution’s fight to help the economy weather the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Commission will be the latest institution to give its official view of the virus impact on the bloc’s economy. The forecasts for individual countries matter because they will form part of the basis on which aid will be granted to different EU states to support their recovery.
Hungary’s central bank will make its first government purchases as part of its QE program on Tuesday, while two days later, Czech policy makers are expected to lower interest rates again. Policy makers in Norway also set rates on Thursday, while Russia’s central bank governor gives a briefing on Friday, amid one of the world’s fastest-growing virus outbreaks and surveys suggesting that the
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, finding itself in the eye of the storm as a relative lull grips the economy with markets becalmed by its yield curve control. Malaysia’s central bank meets that same day and is likely to cut interest rates, according to early economist survey results.
First quarter GDP reports from Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines will be released throughout the week, while China trade data for April on Thursday will show how the global virus shutdowns dented shipments even as the world’s second-largest economy shows signs of recovery.
Just one of Latin America’s three central banks meeting this week still has policy room available for monetary stimulus. On Wednesday, Brazil’s central bank will probably cut its key rate for a seventh straight time to at least 3.25 per cent. Further easing is expected given 2020 forecasts for below-target inflation and the deepest recession in decades.
By contrast, Chile’s central bank, also meeting Wednesday, has said its key rate, now at 0.5 per cent, has reached its “technical minimum,” or effective lower bound, after two reductions in March. Peru’s policy makers on Thursday are in a similar bind: Their 100 basis-point cut at an unscheduled April 9th meeting left their key rate at a record-low 0.25 per cent. – Bloomberg

    <h5 class="mb-1">OPANGA: Why Raila will be the man to beat in 2022 elections</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some media outlets and pundits were last week still contriving to figure out whether Mr Raila Odinga will be running, for the fifth time, for president in 2022. Here's why Mr Odinga will gun for the top job.
One, he is currently the red hot favourite to clinch the presidency, especially because a Building Bridges Initiative-based political alliance is on the cards. Mr Odinga is BBI and BBI is Mr Odinga.
BBI is not the out of view bureaucratic-cum-technocratic-cum-intellectual panel.
It is the festivals of cacophony and euphoria at weekend rallies, since halted by Covid19-induced ban on meetings and social distancing decree.
They sell and celebrate Mr Odinga's political tradecraft, demean and destroy Deputy President William Ruto, and relegate other senior politicians to paying homage to Baba.
Two, it was I who nicknamed him the unelected powerhouse. Mr Odinga has never been this politically powerful.
Not even as premier did he amass such power; not twice as Cabinet minister did he wield such authority, and not as secretary-general of governing Kanu did he have such influence in government.
Three, never before has an unelected politico been this prohibitively strong a whole two years before a presidential poll.
EXPANSIVE LEEWAY
Mr Odinga was strong heading into the now infamous 2007 presidential election, but that became evident towards the tail end.
Then he was up against a sitting president. Now the incumbent president is his top backer and defender.
Four, before Baba no unelected individual had ever become a powerhouse without a defined public office and had his executive physical office, and infrastructure, paid for and maintained by the taxpayer. May Mr Odinga be the last.
Five, it indeed is instructive that the holder of this amorphous office is consulted and briefed by Cabinet ministers and senior public servants on key developments.
He in turn orders and directs them, as if he were their hirer. This incongruity has the president's blessings.
Six, an aspirant to the presidency has never before enjoyed such expansive leeway as to dictate the political trajectory of Kenya.
Welcome to BBI, Mr Odinga's custom-made State House Express. Every politician scrambles to be seen and heard at BBI rallies.
Seven, the power of the presidency and levers of state have been used legally and politically, subtly and overtly, brilliantly and brazenly to soften the political ground for Mr Odinga.
REPAY DEBT
This has seen the drip drip of damning information for public humiliation and destruction of Dr Ruto and his allies, as Mr Odinga has constructed an anti-Ruto network organised around governors.
Eight, crucially never before has a sitting president made a fetish of publicly and wholesomely praising and almost fawning over foe-turned-ally.
President Kenyatta even hints at Mr Odinga being an asset to Kenya because without his cooperation the country would be in a bad place.
With the DP often deliberately sidestepped, sidelined, and blindsided on major and minor state, presidential, Cabinet and political events, and ignored by ministers and senior civil servants, Mr Odinga seems to many the undeclared second in command in government.
Nine, in 2022 President Kenyatta's Big Four legacy projects will still be a pipe dream. The saving grace would appear to be for him to bridge the chasm between the Luo and Kikuyu begat by his father Jomo when he betrayed Raila's dad, Jaramogi.
The Kikuyu have always rejected Mr Odinga, yet his dad refused to be made premier by colonialists, insisting there would be no independence without jailed Kenyatta.
The president appears ready to pay the Luo the debt his dad incurred when he betrayed Jaramogi.
REFERENDUM
Ten, and last, Mr Odinga will drive Kenya into a referendum whose outcome is predetermined. The plebiscite will be the starter's gun for a marathon race to the 2022 General Election.
Its outcome will feed into the campaigns for the General Election. If there is a coalition government before the end of the year, Mr Odinga will be running his show like an incumbent.
Who else would keep Kenya in a permanent state of election?
---------------------------
When in 2014 River Nyando burst its banks, a displaced young woman's anguished cry stunned Kenya: "Government, please, where are you?"
Today, flooding Nyando has displaced more than 6,000 people. Where, they ask, is Serikali? The government has been around since 1963? Nyando floods will recur. Government's silence will recur. Where's local leadership?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The future of the naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 from Toyota and Lexus has been confirmed: it will be phased out and a new twin-turbo V6 will take its place. The announcement shouldn't have come as a big surprise, but it's still sad to hear nonetheless. However, before that V8 takes its final bow, Lexus might launch a certain model variant that will surely please brand enthusiasts and could even give the likes of BMW some trouble.
According to Japanese language Carsensor.net, a V8-powered Lexus IS 500 is reportedly in the works specifically for the North American market. A right-hand-drive JDM version is not planned. If true, think of the IS 500 as a last hurrah for not only the V8 but also the current generation Lexus IS sport sedan.
Revealed back in 2013, the third-generation IS last underwent an update for the 2016 model year and instead of being replaced outright, it'll receive yet another significant refresh for 2021. The plan would be to continue with the current IS for another three years until the fourth-gen model arrives. Interestingly, the report claims the new IS won't switch to the brand's rear-wheel-drive architecture or even the RWD platform that will underpin the next Mazda 6, which is being co-developed with Toyota.
Instead, the plan is to turn the Lexus IS into a Tesla Model 3 fighter. If so, it will be the first Lexus model to utilize the new e-TNGA electric vehicle architecture.
Going from a naturally aspirated V8 to an all-electric powertrain would be a major change, but there is some logic here. Lexus also just announced the discontinuation of the GS RWD sedan, which also means the GS F is finished. It's powered by that same V8 and the IS provides Lexus with the opportunity to keep that engine around a little while longer. A Lexus IS 500 could potentially produce a hearty 475 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque. Think of it as the Lexus IS F we've been hoping to see return for years.
For the time being, Lexus has not applied for the IS 500 trademark in the US, though that could change at any time. Allowing the IS to fill the void that'll soon be left by the GS F would enable Lexus to stay in the high-powered sports sedan game for the next few years. Again, this is merely a rumor for now but it doesn't sound so far-fetched.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Almost 23 million U.S. jobs were created in the last decade. In a single month, they were all but wiped out.
The Labor Department’s April employment report will further detail the swift and extensive toll of government efforts to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists calls for an eye-popping 21 million plunge in payrolls, the most in records back to 1939.

The U.S. unemployment rate is projected to surge to more than 16%, the highest in monthly data back to 1948.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say…
“The unlocking of the economy has started to varying degrees in different parts of the country, but the hemorrhaging of jobs will persist for at least a few more months, pushing unemployment toward 20% and in turn stifling prospects of a vigorous recovery.”

Data out of Europe will focus on industrial production, and Canada will also issue figures on the damage done to its labor market. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia, Norway’s Norges Bank and the Bank of England will set policy, with the latter releasing both its latest economic forecasts and financial stability assessment.

In the U.K., with the government trying to figure out how to ease the lockdown, the BOE will decide whether the emergency measures it has taken so far are enough for the time being to sustain the economy. In a rare move reflecting the magnitude of the crisis, officials will release their monetary policy and financial stability reports on the same day, giving insight into their outlook for the economic and assessments of the state of the banking system.

The European Central Bank faces a legal hurdle on Tuesday when Germany’s constitutional court publishes its verdict on whether the ECB’s QE program is compatible with the country’s law. An adverse ruling, or one which imposes strict limits on purchases, could spark turmoil in markets, potentially undermining the institution’s fight to help the economy weather the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Commission will be the latest institution to give its official view of the virus impact on the bloc’s economy. The forecasts for individual countries matter because they will form part of the basis on which aid will be granted to different EU states to support their recovery.
Hungary’s central bank will make its first government purchases as part of its QE program on Tuesday, while two days later, Czech policy makers are expected to lower interest rates again. Policy makers in Norway also set rates on Thursday, while Russia’s central bank governor gives a briefing on Friday, amid one of the world’s fastest-growing virus outbreaks and surveys suggesting that the economy may contract by almost 10% in the second quarter.
Turkey may report on Monday that inflation slowed to 10.7% in April after Central Bank Governor Murat Uysal lowered his year-end forecast to 7.4% — a move that may hint at further interest-rate cuts. Countries across Africa and the Middle East will also release purchasing managers index data throughout the week, giving an indication of the extent of the deterioration in market conditions due to coronavirus lockdowns.

The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, finding itself in the eye of the storm as a relative lull grips the economy with markets becalmed by its yield curve control. Malaysia’s central bank meets that same day and is likely to cut interest rates, according to early economist survey results.
Hong Kong GDP by Sector
First quarter GDP reports from Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines will be released throughout the week, while China trade data for April on Thursday will show how the global virus shutdowns dented shipments even as the world’s second-largest economy shows signs of recovery.

Latin America
Just one of Latin America’s three central banks meeting this week still has policy room available for monetary stimulus. On Wednesday, Brazil’s central bank will probably cut its key rate for a seventh straight time to at least 3.25%. Further easing is expected given 2020 forecasts for below-target inflation and the deepest recession in decades.
By contrast, Chile’s central bank, also meeting Wednesday, has said its key rate, now at 0.5%, has reached its “technical minimum,” or effective lower bound, after two reductions in March. Peru’s policy makers on Thursday are in a similar bind: Their 100 basis-point cut at April 9’s unscheduled meeting left their key rate at a record-low 0.25%.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About 99.2% of the 132170 depositors of CKP Cooperative Bank will get their full deposits back as they are covered under the deposit insurance scheme, Reserve Bank of India said on Sunday.
The bank's license was cancelled by the RBI. It requested the registrar of cooperative societies (RCS) for the liquidation process.
"CKP Co-op Bank Ltd., Mumbai has been under All Inclusive Directions of @RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC," a RBI spokesperson said in a social media post.
RBI has requested the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the CKP Cooperative Bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.
Now RCS will appoint a liquidator for starting the process of giving back the deposits in consultation with Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). The deposit insurance cover was increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh earlier this year. The bank has a deposit base of ₹485.56 crore, as on November 2019.
RBI said CKP, which has 8 branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts, did not satisfy the requirement of minimum capital and reserves and was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">About 99.2% CKP Co-operative Bank depositors to get money back under deposit insurance: RBI</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About 99.2 percent of the 1,32,170 depositors of CKP Co-op Bank, whose licence was cancelled on Saturday, will get their full deposits back under the deposit insurance and credit guarantee scheme (DICGC), a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) spokesperson said on May 3.
"CKP Co-op Bank Ltd, Mumbai has been under All Inclusive Directions of RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for a revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 1,32,170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2 percent will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC," said Yogesh Dayal, chief general manager, department of communication at RBI said in a tweet.
Under Deposit insurance scheme, on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to Rs5 lakh from DICGC. In other words, going by RBI communication, 99.2 percent of the depositors of CKP Bank are in the less than Rs 5 lakh deposit category.
As on April 30, the bank had a loan book of Rs 158 crore and deposits of Rs 486 crore. The bank had a negative net worth of Rs 239 crore, according to the latest figures available. Nearly, 97 percent of its loans had turned to NPAs, a lot of which are loans given to small and mid-sized real estate developers.
CKP Bank has its head office at Matunga, Mumbai and has eight branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts. "The Bank has attained an important status in the co-operative banking sector, by crossing various milestones of quality and standards and by setting new standards of its own," its website says.
The lender is the latest cooperative bank to lose its licence on account of financial failure. Cancelling its licence, the RBI said that the financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. The adverse financial position was only one of the many reasons behind the cancellation of the licence. The bank, as per RBI's observation, also did not have any concrete revival plan or proposal for a merger with another bank.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI cancels Mumbai-based CKP Co-op Bank's license</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Sunday said 99.2 per cent of the depositors of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, whose license has been cancelled, will get full payment of their deposits from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)
As at November-end 2019, CKP Co-op Bank, as per its website, had deposits aggregating Rs 485.56 crore and loans aggregating Rs 161.17 crore. 
According to a tweet by RBI Chief General Manager Yogesh Dayal, “CKP Co-operative Bank has been under All Inclusive Directions of @RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its license has been cancelled.
“Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC.”
The RBI, in a statement on Saturday, said the licence of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, has been cancelled with effect from the close of business on April 30, 2020.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Bank is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits as defined in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 with immediate effect, the central bank said in a statement.
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai and appoint a liquidator for the bank, the central bank said in a statement.
Depositors eligible for higher deposit insurance claim
With the cancellation of licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, as per the DICGC Act, 1961 will be set in motion, it added.
On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of ₹ 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) as per usual terms and conditions. 
DICGC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, had raised the limit of insurance cover for depositors in insured banks from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh per depositor with effect from February 4, 2020 with the approval of Government of India.
The central bank said it canceled the Bank’s license as “The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible.
“The bank is not satisfying the requirement of minimum capital and reserves…and capital adequacy and earning prospects…and also stipulated minimum regulatory capital requirement of 9 per cent.”
The central bank statement observed that the affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest. Thus, the bank has not been complying with provisions of Section 22 (3)(b) and (c) Banking Regulation Act.
“The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations. No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further.
“No useful purpose would be served by allowing the bank to continue as envisaged in Section 22(3)(e) of the Act. Rather, Public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry on its banking business any further,” the RBI said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Norwegian Air gets bondholder deal on US$1.2b debt-for-equity swap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OSLO, May 4 — Norwegian Air said yesterday it had secured support from enough bondholders for a US$1.2 billion (RM5.15 billion) debt-for-equity swap, a vital step in helping it survive the coronavirus crisis.
The budget airline is poised to run out of cash by mid-May without approval for its plan, which involves handing over most of the company to its lessors and bondholders.
Airlines around the world have been hit particularly hard by the impact on travel of the coronavirus pandemic, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
The next step for Norwegian Air is to secure support from its lessors for its rescue plan, ahead of an extraordinary general meeting today to get approval from shareholders.
Bondholders had turned down Norwegian Air’s plan on Friday, but yesterday the airline said it had now secured a written agreement with the largest bondholders of the NAS07, without naming them, to improve some of the terms.
Although holders of three of its four bonds had given sufficient backing on Friday, support among holders of the NAS07 bond had fallen short of the minimum requirement, with only 62 per cent voting in favour, less than the 67 per cent required.
“I am pleased to confirm that we have reached an agreement with the bondholders,” CEO Jacob Shram said in a statement, which said that a vote will still need to take place on May 18 to ensure Norwegian Air secures the necessary 67 per cent support.
The agreement will provide an improvement of terms for holders of the NAS07 — whose collateral include slots to fly in and out of London’s Gatwick airport — so that the value of their bonds after the conversion may be increased by up to 38 per cent, against 20 per cent earlier, based on valuations of the Gatwick slots.
The same terms would apply for holders of another bond, the NAS08, but not for those of the NAS09, Norwegian Air said.
Also today, Norwegian is set to decide the timeline for the launch of a share issue, which will end on May 18. The airline has said it plans to raise 400 million crowns.
If successful, the debt-to-equity plan allows the carrier to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion Norwegian crowns (US$265 million), which hinge on a reduction in its debt to equity ratio, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Norwegian Air is only paying invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure. It has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold. — Reuters

    <h5 class="mb-1">Norwegian Air gets bondholder deal on $1.2 bln debt-for-equity swap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OSLO — Norwegian Air said on Sunday it had secured support from enough bondholders for a $1.2 billion debt-for-equity swap, a vital step in helping it survive the coronavirus crisis.
The budget airline is poised to run out of cash by mid-May without approval for its plan, which involves handing over most of the company to its lessors and bondholders.
Airlines around the world have been hit particularly hard by the impact on travel of the coronavirus pandemic, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
The next step for Norwegian Air is to secure support from its lessors for its rescue plan, ahead of an extraordinary general meeting on Monday to get approval from shareholders.
Bondholders had turned down Norwegian Air’s plan on Friday, but on Sunday the airline said it had now secured a written agreement with the largest bondholders of the NAS07, without naming them, to improve some of the terms.
Although holders of three of its four bonds had given sufficient backing on Friday, support among holders of the NAS07 bond had fallen short of the minimum requirement, with only 62% voting in favor, less than the 67% required.
“I am pleased to confirm that we have reached an agreement with the bondholders,” CEO Jacob Shram said in a statement, which said that a vote will still need to take place on May 18 to ensure Norwegian Air secures the necessary 67% support.
The agreement will provide an improvement of terms for holders of the NAS07 — whose collateral include slots to fly in and out of London’s Gatwick airport — so that the value of their bonds after the conversion may be increased by up to 38%, against 20% earlier, based on valuations of the Gatwick slots.
The same terms would apply for holders of another bond, the NAS08, but not for those of the NAS09, Norwegian Air said.
Also on Monday, Norwegian is set to decide the timeline for the launch of a share issue, which will end on May 18. The airline has said it plans to raise 400 million crowns.
If successful, the debt-to-equity plan allows the carrier to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion Norwegian crowns ($265 million), which hinge on a reduction in its debt to equity ratio, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Norwegian Air is only paying invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure. It has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Biz activities significantly hit; recovery may take over a year: CII survey</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The lockdown has brought economic activity to a grinding halt, CII said on Sunday, citing findings from its CEOs survey, which indicated that 65 per cent of the firms expect revenues to fall more than 40 per cent in April-June quarter.
The survey results reveal that the country may experience a protracted slowdown in economic activity, as 45 per cent of the CEOs polled feel it will take over a year to achieve economic normalcy once the lockdown ends.
The snap poll saw the participation of more than 300 CEOs, of which nearly two-thirds belonged to MSMEs.
On the career and livelihoods front, more than half of the firms foresee job losses in their respective sectors after the lockdown. A significant share of respondents (45 per cent) expect 15 per cent to 30 per cent cut in jobs.

However, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported that they have not experienced a salary/ wage cut in their firms so far.
The country-wide lockdown imposed on 23 March, while necessary, has had deep ramifications on economic activity, CII said.
For the full financial year 2020-21, the expectations of a fall in revenue are staggered, with 33 per cent of the firms anticipating a revenue fall of more than 40 per cent, closely followed by 32 per cent of firms expecting a revenue contraction ranging between 20 per cent to 40 per cent.
While three out of four firms have identified that a 'complete shutdown of operations' was a major constraint being faced by business, more than half of them have also indicated 'lack of demand for products' as a hindrance to business activity.
"While the lockdown was necessary to mitigate the coronavirus impact on the population, it has had dire implications for economic activity. At this hour, the industry awaits a stimulus package for economic revival and livelihood sustenance besides calibrated exit from lockdown," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.

Additionally, it is pertinent to note that according to a large proportion of the firms, a recovery in domestic demand, for their product or services, may precede the recovery in foreign demand for the same.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett: 'American magic' will spur US economic recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed".
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
'American miracles, American magic'
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again." 
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations. 
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Growth by one measure
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier. 
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett: 'American magic' will spur US economic recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed."
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
- 'American miracles, American magic' -
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again."
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
- Growth by one measure -
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett has been dressing down and letting his hair grow out during the coronavirus pandemic, he revealed during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday.
“It’s been seven weeks since I’ve had a haircut,” the billionaire investor and Berkshire CEO said during the virtual event, which was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
“It’s been more than seven weeks since I put on a tie or anything,” Buffett continued. “Just a question of which sweatsuit I wear.”

The 89-year-old has likely been avoiding a trip to the barbers and other non-essential social contact to avoid catching the potentially lethal virus.
He joked in March that he was “drinking a little more Coca-Cola” during the pandemic, as the soda “seems to have warded off everything else in life.”
Buffett made his latest comments while discussing Berkshire’s exit from its positions in the “big four” US airlines. The conglomerate sold $US6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, which Buffett attributed to dumping airline stocks.
He suggested that people might fly less in the coming years out of fear of catching the virus, or cut back on travel after realising the ease of working from home. Fewer passengers could force the airlines to drop prices, widening their losses due to the coronavirus.

Buffett explained the move by highlighting the airlines’ bailout deals with the US government. Their agreements include billions of dollars in loans that they will have to repay, as well as warrants that the Treasury can exercise to acquire their shares at a discount in the future. The warrant part of the deal was inspired by Buffett’s bailouts of Goldman Sachs and other companies during the financial crisis.
The investor also questioned whether people will fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if passenger volumes bounce back to 70% or 80% of their pre-coronavirus levels, he said, the carriers will be left with “too many planes.”
“The future is much less clear to me,” Buffett said about the airline business.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold the “big four” airline stocks in April, the famed investor revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday.
“It turned out I was wrong,” Buffett said about his decision to invest in the airlines. The companies are well managed and the CEOs “did a lot of things right,” he continued, but “the airline business … changed in a very major way.”
Berkshire’s first-quarter earnings revealed that it sold $6.1 billion in stock in April, without detailing what it sold. Buffett attributed that figure to Berkshire’s exit from the airlines.

Buffett explained the move by highlighting the airlines’ bailout deals with the US government. Their agreements include billions of dollars in loans that they will have to repay, as well as warrants that the Treasury can exercise to acquire their shares at a discount in the future. The warrant part of the deal was inspired by Buffett’s bailouts of Goldman Sachs and other companies during the financial crisis.
The investor also questioned whether people will fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if passenger volumes bounce back to 70% or 80% of their pre-coronavirus levels, he said, the carriers will be left with “too many planes.”
“The future is much less clear to me,” Buffett said about the airline business.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett discussed a range of topics at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, famously described as “Woodstock for capitalists.”
The famed investor and Berkshire CEO, along with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, hosted the virtual event and answers questioned posed by journalists.
The pair spoke hours after Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings. The company posted a record quarterly loss of about $50 billion, largely due to $55 billion in investment losses. It also grew its cash pile from $128 billion to $137 billion in the period, and sold about $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, upending expectations that it would capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap.
Here are the highlights from the Berkshire annual meeting:
Buffett opened the meeting by explaining the absence of Charlie Munger, his longtime partner.
“Charlie is in fine shape, his mind is as good as ever, his voice is as strong as ever,” he said, but it “just didn’t seem like a good idea” for the 96-year-old to attend.
“He’s added Zoom to his repertoire,” Buffett continued. “He’s just skipped right by me technologically. Like stepping over a peanut.”
Buffett tackled the topic of coronavirus early on in the meeting.
“It’s been a flip of the switch in a huge way in terms of national behavior, the national psyche, it’s dramatic,” he said.
“There was an extraordinary wide variety of possibilities on both the health side and the economic side,” he continued. A few months on, it’s become clear that “we’re not getting a best case and we know we’re not getting a worst case.”
“The range of possibilities is still extraordinarily wide,” he continued. “We do not know what happens when you shut down a substantial portion of society.”
Whereas the train fell off the tracks in the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett said, “This time we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on its siding.”
Buffett discussed America’s rapid progress since its creation.
“We are a very, very young country,” he said. “What we have accomplished is miraculous.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett held forth on airlines, buybacks, bailouts, coronavirus, the US economy, oil prices, and other topics at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, often described as "Woodstock for capitalists."
The famed investor and Berkshire CEO, along with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, hosted the virtual event and answered several questions. The event was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
The pair spoke hours after Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings. The company posted a record quarterly net loss of about $50 billion, largely due to $55 billion in investment losses.
It also grew its cash pile from $128 billion to $137 billion in the period, and sold about $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, upending expectations that it would capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap.

Here are the highlights from the Berkshire annual meeting:
Buffett opened the meeting by lamenting the absence of Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and his longtime partner.
"Charlie is in fine shape, his mind is as good as ever, his voice is as strong as ever," he said. It "just didn't seem like a good idea" for the 96-year-old to fly from his California home to attend the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
"He's added Zoom to his repertoire," Buffett continued, referring to the video-conferencing app. "He's just skipped right by me technologically. Like stepping over a peanut."
Buffett discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
"It's been a flip of the switch in a huge way in terms of national behavior, the national psyche, it's dramatic," he said.
"There was an extraordinarily wide variety of possibilities on both the health side and the economic side," Buffett continued. A few months on, it's become clear that "we're not getting a best case and we know we're not getting a worst case."
"The range of possibilities is still extraordinarily wide," Buffett continued. "We do not know what exactly happens when you shut down a substantial portion of your society."
Whereas the US economy went off the tracks in the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett said, "This time we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on its siding."

Buffett offered historical context for the current disruption by reflecting on the Great Depression. He pointed out that someone who invested on the day of his birth in August 1930 needed to wait more than 20 years to make back their money.
He also discussed the challenges that his father faced at that time, when he had no job and two children to feed, but couldn't access his savings as the bank was closed.
"Don't worry about your groceries," Buffett's grandfather, who owned a grocery store where Buffett and Munger worked as children, told his father. "I'll let your bill run."
"He cared about his family, but he wasn't going to go crazy," Buffett joked.
When the Dow Jones passed the 381 mark in the 1950s, he said, investors feared the market was overheated and it was going to be 1929 again. Buffett's mentor and boss at the time, Benjamin Graham, was called to Washington along with a slew of other experts to assess whether the US economy was in trouble.
Now, the Dow is above 24,000. "You're looking at a market today that has produced $100 for every $1," Buffett said. "Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it."
"We are now a better country as well as an incredibly more wealthy country than we were in 1789," the next slide read. "We have gone dramatically in the right direction," Buffett said.

Buffett applied his optimistic outlook to the pandemic threat. He also underlined his company's commitment to funding its own operations, and warned against the dangers of debt.
"When something like the current pandemic happens, it's hard to factor that in and that's why you never want to use borrowed money to buy into investments," he said. "We run Berkshire that way."
"There's no reason to use borrowed money to participate in the American tailwind," he added.
Buffett also trumpeted the merits of stocks.
Equities are an "enormously sound investment," he said, that will outperform US Treasuries and the money people have stashed under their mattresses over time.
Buffett also discouraged people from selling stocks purely because their prices change.
"If you owned the businesses you liked prior to the virus arriving, it changed prices, but nobody's forcing you to sell."
The Berkshire boss recommended "the best thing" for investors to bet on is the S&P 500 index, as it gives them a broad cross-section of American businesses.
"I will bet on America the rest of my life," Buffett said. "I hope I've convinced you to bet on America."

Buffett described the impact of coronavirus on Berkshire's numerous companies.
"For some period, certainly during the balance of the year ... our operating earnings will be considerably less than if the virus hadn't come along," he said. "It hurts some of our businesses a lot."
While Berkshire's three biggest businesses — insurance, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy — are in a "reasonably decent" position," Buffett said, other businesses have been "effectively shut down."
Buffett also defended the company's vast cash reserves.
"We don't want to be dependent on the kindness of friends even," Buffett said, let alone strangers. "There are times when money almost stops," he added, pointing to the 2008 financial crisis and the liquidity crunch just over a month ago.
"Investment-grade companies were essentially going to be frozen out of the market" in late March, Buffett said, before the Federal Reserve "reacted in a huge way."
"Fear is the most contagious disease you can imagine, makes the virus look like a piker," he added, using a term for a gambler who only makes small bets.
Buffett shed some light on Berkshire's stock-market activity in recent months. "We did very little in the first quarter," he said.
However, he pointed to Berkshire's sales of $6.1 billion in stocks on a net basis in April, and explained that figure reflected its exit from positions in the "big four" US airlines.
"It turned out I was wrong," Buffett said about his bets on American, Delta, United, and Southwest. He explained that the airline business has "changed in a very major way."
The investor questioned whether people would fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if 70% or 80% of the airline business returns, he said, the carriers could end up with "too many planes."
Later, he added that an oversupply of airline seats would drive down prices, and it was unclear how long the airlines would have to sustain billions of dollars in operating losses due to the pandemic.
Moreover, they will have to repay their recent loans from the government out of their earnings, he said. The carriers also agreed to hand over warrants that the Treasury can exercise to buy their shares at a discount in the future then sell them for a profit, potentially weighing on their stock prices down the line.
"The future is much less clear to me," Buffett said about the airline business.
Buffett addressed the question of whether Berkshire would be bailing out companies as it did during the financial crisis. He said that the Fed's speed in lending to struggling companies meant there was less need for Berkshire's cash this time around, and the right opportunity was yet to come its way.
"We haven't done anything because we don't see anything that attractive to do," Buffett said. However, there was some early interest, he added.
"There was a period right before the Fed acted," the investor said. "We were getting calls. A number of them were able to get money in the public market, frankly at terms that we wouldn't have given them."
Buffett and Abel added that none of Berkshire's fully owned businesses have applied for government aid.
Buffett detailed the tough situation at See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned chocolate maker that he's described as his "dream business."
"We were in the midst of our Easter season, and Easter is a big sales period for See's," he said. "See's business stopped and it's a very seasonal business to start with. We have a lot of Easter candy. Easter candy's kind of specialized too, we won't sell it."
He also acknowledged that not all of Berkshire's businesses will last, giving the example of Blue Chip Stamps, a trading stamps company that he invested in back in the 1970s.
Buffett tackled the topic of Berkshire's underperformance versus the S&P 500 in recent years.
"The truth is I recommend the S&P 500 to people," he said. "Berkshire is about as sound as any single investment can be in terms of earning reasonable returns over time, but I would not want to bet my life on whether we beat the S&P 500 over the next 10 years."
While Berkshire's sheer scale makes it difficult to beat the broader market, Buffett said, it has some upsides.
"We're better positioned than anyone in the energy business," he said, citing the fact it doesn't have to pay dividends. "We can do things in insurance that nobody else can do."
Buffett lauded Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations.
He praised his intelligence, revealing that he wrote to Jain's father a few years after he joined Berkshire to say, "If you've got another son like this, send him over from India, and we'll rule the world."
Buffett weighed in on the plunge in oil prices in recent weeks. He defended his $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum, saying "it was attractive at oil prices that then prevailed." Now, he continued, "it does not pay to drill."
"Any shareholder in any oil-producing company, you join me in having made a mistake so far in where oil prices went," Buffett added. "Who knows where they go in the future." 
If oil prices remain low, he continued, at least some energy companies are likely to default on their loans, hurting their shareholders and causing headaches for the banking industry.
"There's going to be a whole lot of money [lost]," Buffett said.
Buffett considered the prospect of negative interest rates as central banks around the world cut rates to almost zero in order to stimulate their economies.
"Probably the most interesting question that I've seen in economics," he said.
"We're doing things that we don't know [their] ultimate outcome," Buffett continued, warning of "extreme consequences."
The puzzle of what negative rates would do to US financial markets is "the most important question in the world," he said in March. "And I don't know the answer."
Buffett doubled down on his defense of buybacks as an efficient way of distributing cash to shareholders. The practice is facing fresh criticism after the "big four" airlines repurchased billions' worth of their stock in recent years, then clamored for government aid when they were caught short of cash by the coronavirus outbreak.
"It's very politically correct to be against buybacks," Buffett said. "There's a lot of crazy things said on buybacks."
While he's witnessed some cases of "stupid" buybacks, they aren't immoral, he added.
Buffett answered a question about why Berkshire didn't repurchase more of its shares when they plunged in late March.
The investor seemed to suggest that Berkshire's intrinsic value fell roughly in line with its stock price during the market meltdown.
"I don't feel that it's far more compelling to buy Berkshire shares now than I did three months or six months or a year ago," Buffett said.
"Berkshire is worth less today because I took that position than if I hadn't," he said about its airline investments.
Buffett praised the Paycheck Protection Program, the government initiative to loan money to small businesses to help them weather the pandemic.
"It's a very good idea to take care of the people that are having terrible trouble taking care of themselves," Buffett said. He expected some amount of fraud, but gave "real credit" to Congress for acting promptly to help the millions of people left jobless by the outbreak.
Comedian Bill Murray submitted a similar question about how the country would reward the grocery-store cashiers, delivery drivers, warehouse workers, and others who will make up "a new class of war veterans."
"It's like people that landed in Normandy," Buffett said. "The poor, the disadvantaged, there's an unimaginable suffering. They're working 24-hour days and we don't even know their names."
"We ought to do something that can help those people," he added, referring more broadly to Americans struggling to make ends meet. "Nobody should be left behind."

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM meets Shah, Sitharaman for second stimulus package as lockdown continues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met two senior ministers and civil servants from the economic ministries to prepare a second stimulus package for the economy hit by a nationwide lockdown triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Modi, after his meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will hold talks with key economic ministries such as Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), PTI reported quoting unnamed sources. The finance ministry, which deferred on Friday releasing the monthly Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection numbers, will make a presentation to Modi later in the day on the state of economy and initiatives that it plans to undertake to help the economy.
Modi met with aviation, labour and power ministries on Friday. He had detailed deliberation with commerce and MSME ministries among others on Thursday with focus on attracting both domestic and overseas investment and revival of small businesses in the country so that the recovery process is hastened. Shah and Sitharaman were present in these meetings, reported PTI.
Small businesses, farmers, women, poor, migrant workers and other marginalised sections are likely to benefit from the second stimulus, Business Standard reported on April 28. Industries worst hit by the lockdown--aviation, hospitality, automobiles, real estate, and logistics to name a few—will have to wait. Any support for these sectors and big industry will only happen later down the line, once economic activity normalizes to some extent, officials said.

Sitharaman on March 25 announced a stimulus worth Rs 1.7 trillion or around 0.8 per cent of India’s GDP--much smaller compared to most other G-20 nations. The United States’ stimulus package was pegged at 11 per cent of GDP, that of Australia was at 9.7 per cent, Brazil was at 3.5 per cent, as per data portal Statista.
The government said on Friday it would extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks after May 4, but would allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones under a plan to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
The home ministry issued new guidelines to regulate life and work in this period, based on districts divided into red ( coronavirus hotspot), green and orange zones. There will be considerable relaxations in the districts falling in the green and orange zones, the government said.
A number of activities will remain prohibited throughout the country, irrespective of the zone. Travel by air, rail, metro and inter-state movement by road will remain banned.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New vulnerabilities (described as 'numerous') have been detected in Apple’s Image I/O, impacting on MacSecurity and iPhone functionality. This comes following news that every iPhone running a version of iOS 6 or newer is vulnerable to remote attacks, which was reported on Digital Journal following detection by cybersecurity experts at ZecOps, comes information data unveiled by Google's Project Zero team.
According to Forbes, the new vulnerability is dubbed 'Fuzzing ImageIO'. This can lead to security gaps relating to media files sent over messaging platforms.
Full details have not been specified, since Google's Project Zero has a policy over not disclosing the actual nature of security flaws. Instead the Google's security analysts (who specialize in finding zero-day vulnerabilities) have contacted Apple directly.
In response, Apple has stated it has addressed the flaws in its latest platform updates. In terms of the risk to consumers, however, this very much depends on whether people update to the latest versions of iOS and macOS and have appropriate cybersecurity measures in place.
There's a 'Catch-22' situation otherwise: the vulnerability can introduce a serious crash bug, which renders users unable to download and install the required updated. To overcome this dilemma, Apple are apparently fast-tracking the release of iOS 13.5 together with patches suitable for Macs and iPhones.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having a strong social media presence, Aakash Chopra has made himself a fine content creator that engages his fans all the time. Recently, in line with the ICC’s post to pick one player from each country to pick a XI, Aakash Chopra immediately jumped into the bandwagon to have his own team.
While his selection of Jos Buttler was unquestionable, he picked David Warner ahead of Rohit Sharma as the opener. It was surprising considering the Aussie has been a massive underperformer in T20Is, unlike his performance in the other form of T20 cricket. 
But Chopra’s selection seems to be in direct line with having to pick Jasprit Bumrah into the XI that adds balance in the presence of Rashid Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Lasith Malinga along with Shakib Al Hasan and Andre Russell. Colin Munro becomes the Kiwi representative in the line-up while Babar Azam and AB de Villiers are the flagbearers of the two Green armies - Pakistan and South Africa. 
Aakash Chopra’s World T20I XI: David Warner, Jos Buttler, Colin Munro, Babar Azam, AB de Villiers, Shakib Al Hasan, Andre Russell, Rashid Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Dividends? 3 Stocks You Might Want to Buy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">These days, it's a skill finding stocks that aren't likely to cut their dividends in 2020. More than ever, weak financial health is the bane of dividends and there is nothing like a global pandemic to help sort out which companies weren't as strong financially as you might have thought or prepared to take a hit. That's why it's important to identify solid companies prepared not only to weather the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic but also to adapt to changes over time -- whatever those changes might be.
To that end, here are three companies that have tackled changes head-on. If you love dividends, these are ones to consider adding to your portfolio. Let's dive into why.
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has an attractive dividend yield and strong financials to maintain it. In its second-quarter 2020 earnings report, the company had over $40 billion in current assets with $8.5 billion of that in cash. Contrast that with $22 billion in current liabilities, of which $1.5 billion is short-term debt.
This healthy balance sheet, combined with a current payout ratio of 56% and a history of paying consistent dividends since 2011, suggests the company has the funds to support its dividend. So what about the business itself?
Cisco got its start producing computer networking hardware, but that business started declining as companies began shifting to cloud computing solutions. It responded to this trend by successfully expanding into software.
Its software division includes its WebEx videoconferencing platform, which has enjoyed tremendous growth after many people were forced to work from home due to the pandemic. WebEx reached a record 324 million users in March. Its AppDynamics software, used by companies to monitor IT infrastructure, saw double-digit growth during the second quarter.
Cisco earns recurring revenue from its software products using a software-as-a-service subscription model. This adds a stable revenue stream for the company.
In addition, its networking hardware sales will benefit from the broader growth trends of the Internet of Things and 5G, both of which create the need for wireless technology, and in turn, increase demand for Cisco's solutions. These factors make Cisco an attractive dividend stock.
Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has a solid dividend track record. In its last earnings announcement, for the 2019 fourth quarter, Home Depot raised its dividend by 10%, marking the 11th straight year of dividend payments. With the company's 59% payout ratio, it's likely to maintain its dividend. 
Still, while the company had a successful 2019, in which Home Depot experienced the highest sales in its history, this year will be challenging due to the coronavirus pandemic. To bolster the company's financial flexibility during this crisis, Home Depot borrowed $5 billion, adding to the $2.1 billion in cash it held at the end of the fourth quarter. A bright spot is that the retail stores were designated an essential business and were thus allowed to remain open.
Helping Home Depot weather the pandemic is the company's One Home Depot initiative. The project seeks to create a seamless retailing experience between digital shopping and its physical stores. This evolution in its business is essential as consumers increasingly expect less division between e-commerce and in-store shopping.
The strategy paid off last year as digital sales grew 21.4% over 2018. Today, with many people confined to their homes, the One Home Depot project facilitates e-commerce sales. Thanks to Home Depot's forward thinking, the company is in a better position to return to its pre-pandemic sales success over the long run.
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) may have a modest dividend yield, but it is a rock-solid company that continues to prosper despite the pandemic. In February, Costco's sales grew 13.8% year over year; in March, as the impact from the pandemic intensified, sales rose 11.7% year over year.
This sales resilience is not just because the company provides consumer staples. It collects recurring revenue from membership fees. Also, before the pandemic, Costco saw the rise of e-commerce and wisely invested in building up digital shopping capabilities.
Now the company is seeing strong e-commerce growth. February's e-commerce sales rose 22.6% year over year. In March, e-commerce sales grew by 48.3% as many consumers remained sheltered at home.
The company also has a strong balance sheet with $7.8 billion in cash as of the end of its 2020 second quarter. Coupled with a payout ratio of 33%, investors are ensured Costco's dividend is safe. In fact, the company announced a dividend increase on April 15. All these factors, even during a pandemic, make Costco a sensible investment.
Each of these companies saw opportunities and took steps to strengthen their businesses. As a result, dividends can continue while financial health is maintained over the long term, making these dividend stocks worthwhile investments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farmers markets scaling down with eye on safety due to virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DETROIT - For a dozen years, Johnny Gyergyou has sold meat, poultry and eggs from his Berlin Township livestock farm at Eastern Market in Detroit.
Lately, he’s been staying home as fear of the COVID-19 virus has kept thousands of shoppers away from the popular venue northeast of downtown.
“The crowds are small and there aren’t many vendors,” said Gyergyou, adding that it’s just not cost-effective to haul the loads 33 miles to Detroit where they may or may not sell.
“We’ve been doing fairly well (selling) at the farm. It’s not Eastern Market sales by no means, but at least it’s helping us along here,” said Gyergyou, 72.
Farmers, growers and operators of open-air markets are heading into a busy time of the year as many states still are under stay-at-home orders for residents and non-essential businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus which has killed more than 60,000 people in the United States and at least 230,000 worldwide.
Shoppers venturing out this year are just as likely to come across tables of hand sanitizer and face mask-wearing produce peddlers as they are to see bushels of corn, quarts of blueberries or flats of petunias.
Many venues have moved to drive-thru shopping, reduced days or hours, and fencing to control crowds.
At the farmers market near London, England’s, Primrose Hill neighbourhood, shopping is restricted to a few people at a time who are given gloves upon entering. Vendors are spread out and work behind plastic shields.
Detroit’s Eastern Market is considering fencing. Six-foot by six-foot grids will be painted on floors as a reminder to social distance.
About a dozen vendors are participating in drive-thru shopping on Tuesdays at the market.
“It’s my feeling after listening to people that they’re scared to go down to Detroit with it being a hotspot (for the COVID-19 virus),” said Gyergyou, hoping for a return to normalcy sooner than later. “I’m anxious to get back there.”
Detroit has topped 9,000 confirmed virus cases and more than 1,000 deaths.
The farmers market in Overland Park, Kansas, outside of Kansas City, Missouri, has been relocated to the city’s convention centre where patrons drive past vendors who bring produce to their vehicles.
About 35 vendors participated on April 25 and vehicles were at the gate when the market opened at 8 a.m. About 700 drove through before a 2 p.m. closing, said Meg Ralph, a city spokeswoman.
Vermont officials are requiring all farmers markets to be held outdoors. Entertainment, children activities and cooking demonstrations have been suspended to prevent people from congregating in small spaces.
The Bennington Farmers’ Market was scheduled to reopen on Saturday as a pre-order drive-thru market. In Montpelier, the Capital City Market was prepared for both pre-order pickups and in-person shoppers with no more than 10 people in the market at a time. Vendors must be spaced 12 feet apart and wear face coverings and gloves.
Such precautions can take some of the joy out of outdoor shopping, but that’s the price of safety.
“They won’t be able to talk about recipes, their families; converse about the kids, like they normally do,” said Myra Gorman, market manager for the farmers market in Evanston, Illinois. “Some of them will share phone numbers so they can do that stuff later.”
The market is just north of Chicago and attracts as many as 7,000 people on a Saturday. Thirty-five vendors will be set up and only 105 or so customers will be allowed inside at any one time.
Once inside, all the thumping, touching, smelling and grabbing of fruit and vegetables will be replaced by pointing by mask-wearing customers to mask- and glove-wearing vendors.
No farmers have backed out, said Gorman, adding that “this is their business, their livelihood.”
Todd Nichols couldn’t skip the market — even if he wanted to.
Nichols is an owner of Nichols Farm & Orchard in Marengo, Ill.
About 90% of his income is from farmers markets and restaurants. Restaurant sales have fallen through the floor, he said.
“Farmers markets are just too important not to go,” Nichols said.
The Saturday market in Collingswood, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, launched 20 years ago.
Absent from the 2020 edition scheduled to open Saturday will be live music and much of the colour that made it a festival-like destination. In fact, like so many others trying to survive while waiting out the coronavirus, it will be a stripped-down “farm-to-car” market that has moved to a big parking lot.
Continuing the market provides normalcy for area residents and help for some now-struggling farmers, said Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley.
“Their crops didn’t know there was a pandemic going on,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain will begin the first round of post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US this week as the Government seeks to strike an “ambitious” relationship which “opens up new opportunities” to UK businesses.
International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer will launch the negotiations via video conference call because of the Covid-19 crisis.
Around 100 negotiators on each side will take part in the talks, the first round of which are set to last for a fortnight.
Further rounds will take place roughly every six weeks, and will continue to be carried out remotely until it is safe to travel.
“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.
“As we sit down at the negotiating table early next week, be assured that we will drive a hard bargain to secure a deal that benefits individuals and businesses in every region and nation of the UK.”
Talks will be led on the UK side by UK-US chief negotiator Oliver Griffiths, while all UK trade negotiations are being overseen by the Department for International Trade’s chief trade negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer.
It comes after the UK blamed Brussels for having made “limited progress” during the second round of negotiations on a future trade deal between the European Union and UK.
Negotiators have warned their counterparts across the Channel that Britain will “not subordinate” its laws to the EU “in any areas” and called for more flexibility from the bloc in order to strike a deal.
The EU’s negotiation mandate stated that the UK must sign up to some Brussels-set regulations to prevent the bloc being undercut on standards once the transition period ends in December.
Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, last month accused the UK of refusing to commit “seriously” on numerous fundamental points during the talks, which took place via video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said: “With the US election now just six months away, we should all be extremely wary of a president who will do anything to stay in the White House, and a Conservative Government that will do anything to help him.
“That is a recipe for a trade deal designed for the benefit of the major corporations behind American industry, farming and healthcare, which will have very real implications on workers’ rights, environmental protections, the food we eat and our beloved NHS.
“If Boris Johnson will not stand up to Donald Trump, then the British Parliament must. This is too important to get wrong.
“Labour will insist that any proposed trade deal is subject to proper scrutiny, and we will not let the interests of the British people be sacrificed to boost the profits of US corporations.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">KVK helps farmers find market for produce</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brahmavar-based Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) has been playing a vital role in helping farmers, affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in finding buyers for their produce.
KVK has taken the help of WhatsApp groups and has been successful in linking sellers and buyers.
After Suresh Nayak, who had grown watermelons on 13 acres of his field in Munduje in Udupi district, found it difficult to market his produce due to lockdown, KVK publicised it on the WhatsApp groups.
Soon, Mr. Nayak began getting calls from buyers in different places and also in Udupi city asking for watermelons. As a result, he sold 200 tonnes of the crop.
“The buyers came to my field and purchased it,” he said.
This facilitation process has helped farmers from other districts also. Vasanthakumari, a farmer from Katanayakanahalli in Chitradurga district, had grown 10 tonnes of onions in her field. Unable to sell them, she expressed her distress on social media.
Officers of the Department of Horticulture, Chitradurga, got in touch with KVK who in turn contacted Mr. Nayak and asked him if he would purchase the onions.
Mr. Nayak purchased 172 sacks, containing 60 kgs onions each, at ₹550 per sack, though it normally sells for ₹250 per sack.
Ms. Vasanthakumari thanked Mr. Nayak for purchasing the onions, and Chaitanya H.S., horticulture scientist at KVK, Brahmavar, for helping her.
Mr. Nayak said that owing to the facilitation by the KVK he had also purchased different vegetables grown by farmers in other districts and had been selling it here for wholesale prices.
“This facilitation is helping the farmers as they do not have to search for buyers and the customers also get vegetables and fruits at cheaper rates,” he said.
“Our only aim is to help farmers find markets for their produce,” said Mr. Chaitanya.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
IN the latest episode of African Voices Changemakers, CNN explores the reality TV industry in Nigeria, going behind the scenes of The Fasttest Shedder and Try My Job.
The Fasttest Shedder is a 90-day weight loss reality show created by Seyi Olusore, popularly known as Shedams. Shedams speaks about his motivation behind the programme, “I’ve realised that a lot of women they face body shaming. They are quick to, you know, look down on themselves in terms of self-esteem.
We have so many reality TV shows in Nigeria, and I just wanted the fun aspects, you’re losing weight and at the same time, you’re documenting your progress. We’re trying to show people that this is real.”
Past contestants attest that Shedams’ passion is not just an act for the camera. Season 2 runner-up Vera Agu, says that his support has continued after her season ended, “I love the way he pushes me even after the show.”
Regardless of who wins the show, Shedams sees all the contestants as champions, “It’s a passion over profit. When I see persons, who couldn’t fit into some clothes, then fit into it and we are happy to pray for me.
So, I’m supposed to be happy. I’m supposed to be impressed, saving people’s lives.”
 
CNN also looks at Try My Job, a show which takes celebrities and influential people and tasks them with being a blue-collar worker for the day.
Creator and host Olawunmi Oyadeji says that she made the show to promote skills acquisition and entrepreneurs, “I just noticed that a lot of these guys that are doing blue-collar jobs are not really appreciated. We take them for granted. We don’t pay so much attention to what they do.”
Now in its tenth season, the show has proved to be a hit. Oyadeji talks about the concept, “The show gives celebrities, not just celebrities, influential people the opportunity to wear other people’s shoes for a day, most especially their fans.”
Oyadeji advises anyone wanting to follow in her footsteps to be prepared to work hard, “It’s a lot of patience, is a lot of money. It’s a lot of dedication.
So, you need to have a passion for what you’re doing. There are many times I wanted to give up and I woke up the next day I was like, ‘No, I can’t’.”
These two changemaking programmes show that reality TV is not always about the drama, but also about the life-changing results

    <h5 class="mb-1">Helping charity is a piece of cake, says family</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Shropshire family has found a tasty way to raise money for a charity in the county after launching a cake delivery service.
David Vicary, from Shrewsbury, decided to launch the service providing home-made cakes in aid of The Movement Centre, which provided life-changing treatment for his son Stan, who is now six.
Mr Vicary, also helped by daughter Lillybelle, 10, and sons Jake eight, and Reg, four, are offering weekly deliveries every Friday.
The Movement Centre, based at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Gobowen, near Oswestry, provides pioneering therapies for children with cerebral palsy and other movement-related conditions.
The family is taking advantage of the lockdown to bake their own cakes, which are delivered every Friday to anyone within 10 miles of Shrewsbury. Collection is also possible.
Mr Vickery said The Movement Centre had changes Stan's life.
“He was born with Down Syndrome and a range of other medical complications," he added.
"By the time he was four, he still had very little trunk control and was a way off being mobile, and the prospect of him ever walking was a distant dream. But attending The Movement Centre transformed our lives in indescribable ways.
"Stan is now a very happy mobile boy. We wanted to use this time in isolation to give something back to The Movement Centre and there is nothing Stan loves more than cake.”
Mr Vicary said five flavours were on offer: lemon drizzle, millionaire's shortbread, chocolate brownie, rainbow-sprinkle sponge and raspberry bakewell delight.
The are offered in trays of 12, and come as part of a family pack also including a wordsearch, fun family game, colouring sheet and conversation-starter cards. Customers are asked to donate a minimum of £12, with all proceeds going The Movement Centre.
To order a cake, families must email havecakewilltravel2020@gmail.com with their order and contact details (including phone number). Donations can be made through the web-page justgiving.com/fundraising/david-vicary1.
Mr Vicary, who is also chairman of trustees at the charity, said: “As well as this being a challenging time for charities like The Movement Centre, we know that everyone is facing tough times at the moment but we also know that keeping the children fed and watered is one of the biggest challenges of being at home, so hopefully this can save families a job and give them a delicious and well-deserved weekly treat, safely delivered to their door."
So far the venture has raised more than £900 for the charity. Mr Vicary added that there would be prizes to be won if the family hit its £2,000 fundraising target, including a£100 voucher for Woodings & Co Jewellers, an overnight stay at The Malthouse, Ironbridge, two flotations sessions at Shropshire Floats, and a £40 dough and oil voucher. Other prizes included family tickets for Shropshire Festivals 2021, and a fiesta tapas night for two at The Bull in Roddington.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After about five weeks of total lockdown of some states considered main centres of motion picture production, some notable celebrities speak about the gains and pains of the COVID-19 lockdown.
Enyinna NwigweFor gains, I will say this period has given me time to reflect and reassess a lot, with regards to what matters and what doesn’t.
I have found more time to do the little things I am passionate about like, trying out new recipes in the kitchen and getting back into my fitness routine, which my pre-COVID-19 schedule had taken from me. In all, am learning to slow down and carve some balance to life.
It also afforded me time to reconnect with friends I haven’t been in touch with for a while in the name of ‘busy schedule.’
As for pains, I really miss working and socialising with fellow humans without worry. I also miss making projections and plans without running into a mental block due to the uncertainties of the post-COVID-19 season.
Most importantly, I miss credit alerts!
Kate Henshaw Personal gains for me is that I have maintained my fitness regime, spent time with myself, evaluating my life and doing some spring cleaning to get rid of excess stuff I have around me.
The pains is definitely not being able to work, as our production was halted due to COVID-19, and then inability to go out and interact with family and friends and attend social events.
But I remain positive nonetheless. It is the only choice I am comfortable with.
Bolaji Amusan (aka Mr Latin) Well, I must say that the pain is greater than the gain. Day in day out, I have to feed over 100 people. Those in my area know that before I wake up, lots of people will be coming in one and twos to ask for favours, particularly to feed.
My members are not left out, the elders and the vulnerable among them.
However, the gain is that I am able to rest, reset my brain and try other things that can put food on my table and above all, I am able to know how poor our people are in this country.
I think government needs to a do a lot, in terms of instituting a proper welfare or social scheme, with support of well-meaning individuals.
Importantly, one lesson this has taught us as practitioners is that we need to always save for the raining day, as nobody is ready to feed anybody in a situation like this. People expected so much from actors and all the cinemas are closed due to the lockdown. So, we cannot shoot and cannot practically do anything.
We needed to use this situation to re-evaluate ourselves.
Nse Ikpe-Etim I have learnt to always take the good out of the bad from any situation, even though it has been tough having to be without my family.
Not working, being holed up, not having my usual choice and variety of meals and missing out on my neighbourhood community has been quite a difficult process for me.
However, I am learning to converse with the walls and the inanimate objects and my imagination has been at its best.
On the other hand, I am so thankful for the green environment, the reduction in pollution and cleaner streets and air generally. The lockdown has afforded people the opportunity to reflect on the priorities of our existence as humans and how durable we can be when faced with the fear of extinction.
I have also used this time to study and finally take the necessary steps towards self-development. For someone like me, who suffers from allergies, ‘social distancing’ is a plus.
So much can be prevented with this practice and thankfully, hand washing is in fashion for the public and to beat this, we need to become germaphobes (this can become an OCD and have a negative impact), so not for everyone.
Can you imagine how much germs a hotel remote control carries? These were things we normally wouldn’t think twice about. This certainly isn’t going anywhere like the rest of the viruses out there, so we will do what is right.
Bimbo Manuel The lockdown has been a most profound experience, both in gains and pains. For the first time in a long time, the entire family is together again, we have been able to catch up and share burdens with stronger empathy, as we have had proximity.
I have personally been able to truly pause, assess both content and approach of all areas of my life to great benefit and I have been able to begin the processes of my book publications that I have put off for so long.
It allowed me to reconnect with so many people.
The pains are not any less intense- being helplessly restricted at home drove home more strongly, the losses we suffered at the truncated production of our play, ALHAJI, the disruption of all the plans we had made for the year, the financial losses, the frustrated projects and the overwhelming feeling of helplessness seeing so many people in hunger and other kinds of distress.
It was going to be a big great year, but…it still will be. No doubt!
Uche Jombo Personal gains for me will be a strong focus on what really matters. I have learned to focus on what/who is important in life and to prioritise my time efficiently. We can never say, “this can’t wait,” because tomorrow is not guaranteed.
Also, I have always been a clean and hygienic person, but this pandemic has helped me to pay greater attention to my hygiene, especially with regard to hand washing and sanitising. We can stay perfectly alive without expensive cars, eating expensive foods or wearing expensive clothes.
This virus that sees no difference in people has ultimately thought us that there is no difference in people. I hope this is remembered after the pandemic is over.
As for pains, I had to break off my #drlove series set and loss of continuity, and I am not sure how we will achieve them when COVID-19 is over.
This pandemic proved that the world wasn’t prepared for a disaster of such scale. It also proved that politics control the economy and in countries with inadequate leaders, communities are disproportionately impacted.
Hopefully, pharmaceutical companies and governments can change their attitude towards investments in public health and related research. If the mindset continues to be profit-oriented, the future can be as blank as the present chaos.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How coronavirus is spreading through UK prisons</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we prepare for another week of national lockdown, my fellow prisoners and I receive a missive from Phil Copple, the director general of prisons, offering thanks for “your patience and cooperation as we work through this difficult time”. These are calming words of reassurance – but do they reflect the reality of life in prison during the coronavirus pandemic?
As the whole nation grapples with isolation, sombre news updates, supply shortages and fear of an unknown future, is being in prison, as I am, a blessing or a curse?
Our local management team of governors is visible and attempting to cope with a rapidly changing picture. We have cases of Covid-19 inside our prison, with prisoners hospitalised and a number being isolated. Like all UK prisons, overcrowding is a big issue here, with many inmates sharing cramped cells for 23 hours every day. Communal showers, laundry procedures, the need for exercise, and healthcare facilities limit the true meaning of social distancing.
Now, more than three weeks since “outbreak” status was confirmed in this prison, the Ministry of Justice appears at best muddled about what to do as the virus spreads through our prisons.
We all follow the news and know that many mistakes have been made by the government: personal protective equipment shortages, the crisis in care homes, inaccurate statistical reporting, the abrupt change of strategy after the Cheltenham racing festival and other big sporting gatherings were held in March, which would have added to the death toll. 
The next crisis will surely be in prisons. For years, they have been underfunded and overcrowded breeding grounds for crime, drug abuse and mental health decline. When, not if, Covid-19 spreads throughout the prison population it will be an avoidable catastrophe.
Iran is reported to have released at least 85,000 prisoners during this unprecedented global crisis. But, so far, the Ministry of Justice has released only around 50 pregnant inmates. In early April there was talk of releasing 4,000 low-risk prisoners (less than 5 per cent of the prison population), of which I am one. But this programme has been paused. With around a third of prison officers across the country self-isolating we need more action.
This is not just about our own safety, but a need to be there to support our families. Visits were cancelled in March and there is no sign of an early resumption. Yes, I hear you say that most of the population is also unable to visit family and friends, but the two-hour visits are essential for our mental well-being.
I’ll return to Mr Copple’s words of “comfort”. It’s as if he almost promised us that there would be more deaths in custody. He needs reminding that the death sentence was abolished over 50 years ago. My white-collar crime has put me in a prison with arsonists, murderers and other violent criminals. I didn’t believe death would be part of my sentence!
While the government deserves some praise for the action taken so far, it now needs to address the prison issue before there are more deaths in custody. No, not all prisoners are safe to be released, but the many that are would slim down numbers to create a safer environment for inmates and staff alike. These are unprecedented times, so take some unprecedented action. As prisoners we are told constantly that we cost the taxpayer more than £30,000 per year to be kept in these places, so let’s save money and lives before it is too late.
Robert Buckland, the Justice Secretary, should immediately implement the advice of the Prisoners Advice Service to slow down the emergency in our prisons by releasing the following groups of inmates:
Most of these proposals are supported by Nick Hardwick, the former chief inspector of prisons. All those released – not just the most dangerous – would be tagged and monitored in their community.
I am in a working prison, but almost all work has stopped. Education has stopped, the chapel is closed and most men are locked up for 23 hours every day. I have no internet access. Amid an already volatile situation, there is £2.02 to provide three meals per day for each prisoner. Something has to happen and soon.
The writer’s name has been changed to protect his identity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI cancels licence of CKP Cooperative Bank, cites its ‘adverse, unsustainable’ financial position</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India on Saturday said it cancelled the licence of Mumbai-based CKP Cooperative Bank, as the bank’s financial position is “highly adverse and unsustainable”. The central bank said that the affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest. The order, passed on April 28, is effective from April 30.
“Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the CKP Co-operative Bank Limited, Mumbai, is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits...” the RBI said. The central bank asked the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, to issue an order for winding up the affairs of CKP Cooperative Bank. It also ordered the registrar to appoint a liquidator.
The RBI said CKP Cooperative Bank is not in a position to pay its depositors. Instead, they will be paid according to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation can grant each depositor up to Rs 5,00,000 as repayment, the RBI said.
“The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations,” the RBI said. “No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further.”
As of November 2019, the total deposits of the bank amounted to Rs 485.56 crore and its loan book has Rs 161.17 crore, Mint reported.
In March, RBI had imposed a moratorium on cash-strapped Yes Bank, and restricted withdrawals at Rs 50,000 for each account. The board of directors of the bank was also superseded with immediate effect. The RBI said Yes Bank lacked a credible revival plan, and therefore it had to act in the interest of the public and depositors.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India has cancelled the licence of Mumbai-based CKP Co-operative Bank to carry on banking business in the wake of its unsustainable financial position. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the bank and appoint a liquidator, the RBI said.
On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. The bank has a deposit base of Rs 486 crore.
According to the RBI, it cancelled the licence of the bank as the financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. “There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible,” the RBI said.
“The bank is not satisfying the requirement of minimum capital and reserves, capital adequacy and earning prospects and also stipulated minimum regulatory capital requirement of 9 per cent,” it said. The bank is not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.
“The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest,” the RBI said. The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations.
“No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further,” it said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
The Lagos State Government has issued fresh guidelines for the reopening of markets and shopping malls as part of efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered gradual easing of the lockdown imposed on the Lagos, Ogun and FCT from Monday.
Speaking at a stakeholders’ meeting in Alausa, Ikeja, Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr. Wale Ahmed, said all markets and stores in the various Local Governments/Local Council Development Areas across the metropolis will be allowed to open from 9 am till 3 pm on selected days.
He emphasised that everyone patronising them will be mandated to observe precautionary measures such as physical distancing and high levels of personal and respiratory hygiene.
 
Ahmed disclosed that malls will also be allowed to open with the provision that stores will maintain a 60% occupancy capacity at any point in time while ensuring two-meter physical distancing is maintained between a shopper and the next person in the store.
The Commissioner maintained that food handlers must also wear masks and hand gloves in markets at all times.
He directed shop owners must provide hand sanitisers and wash hands with soap and running water at all entry points, conduct temperature checks on customers and ensure that nobody is exempted from the process.
According to him, the guidelines are proactive measures put in place to curtail a possible spread of the deadly virus among traders in markets places and malls when the gradual ease of the lockdown commences on Monday.

Mr Ahmed declared that malls will also be allowed to open with the proviso that stores will maintain a 60 per cent occupancy capacity at any point in time, while also ensuring that a two-meter physical distancing is maintained between a shopper and the next person in the store.
The commissioner maintained that food handlers must also wear masks and hand gloves in markets at all times, directing that shop owners must provide hand sanitisers and wash hands with soap and running water at all entry points, conduct temperature checks on customers and ensure that nobody is exempted from the process.
According to him, the guidelines are proactive measures put in place by the government to curtail a possible spread of the deadly virus among traders in markets places and malls when the gradual ease of the lockdown commences on Monday, May 4, 2020.
Mr Ahmed disclosed that stakeholders at the meeting, which was attended by the Iyaloja/President, General Association of Commodity Market Women and Men of Nigeria, Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, and other major market leaders in the state, unanimously agreed that effective from May 4, 2020, food sellers and other ware traders should operate on alternate days in all markets across the State.
“In essence, those trading in other items and wares apart from food will only be allowed to trade on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while all food and farm produce sellers will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays,” the commissioner explained.
While stressing that there will be zero tolerance for all forms of street-trading, Mr Ahmed disclosed that all market leaders also promised to ensure that their members abide by all the stated guidelines, while the Ministry, Chairmen of LGs/LCDAs, Office of Iyaloja-General and the State Enforcement Agencies will ensure strict compliance with the directives.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Death of Zimbabwe's economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Better the economy dies than our people do declared President Mnangagwa the other day: you can revive the economy but can't bring back a dead person. He was speaking at State House while accepting donations for the fight against the coronavirus.Mnangagwa later went on to extend the lockdown and announce a massive US $720 million stimulus for the economy.But where is the money coming from? The Vigil's guess is that it will come as usual from bleeding the people through massive inflation. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube is earlier reported to have warned that if Zimbabwe didn't get a big bailout it would again have to resort to printing money.The respected London-based magazine Africa Confidential said Ncube had written to the international financial institutions based in Washington appealing for money to save the country from disaster.The magazine says it has seen a copy of the letter, which warned that the situation in Zimbabwe is so bad that it could cause an implosion of the state and threaten security in neighbouring countries.It quoted Ncube as acknowledging 'recent policy missteps' which had seen inflation soar to over 500%. He said that without help the government would have to revert to printing money, risking a return to hyper-inflation and the crash of the Zimbabwe dollar.In the letter Ncube asks for the rescheduling or cancellation of Zimbabwe's foreign debt arrears and US $ 200 million to fight the coronavirus. He promises in return to introduce a market-determined exchange rate and end the Reserve Bank's 'quasi fiscal operations'.Africa Confidential observes: 'this according to finance officials in Washington is code for saying conditions are so horrendous that Ncube has been given the political cover to promise a crackdown on grand corruption at the heart of government'.The magazine says that neither the World Bank not the International Monetary Fund have responded officially to Ncube's letter, nor do they intend to do so despite him following up with phone calls. An official is quoted as saying: 'Zimbabwe is a political, not an economic policy crisis and . . . Without credible change on that level nothing else will move'.The magazine sums it up: 'Senior finance officials in Washington say that grand corruption and state violence have to go before they resume economic co-operation with Zimbabwe.So dust off your old trillion dollar notes!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus | PM Modi discusses reforms for agriculture sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday discussed ways to reform the agriculture sector with an emphasis on marketing, farmers’ access to institutional credit and freeing the sector from restrictions with legal backing.
Full coverage on coronavirus
The government has maintained that the farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19, and the lockdown will not have much impact on its growth in the current financial year, unlike other sectors.
The pros and cons of biotechnological developments in crops or productivity enhancement and reduction in input costs were also deliberated, an official statement said.
The meeting discussed strategic interventions in the marketing ecosystem and reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development. Concessional credit flow to strengthen infrastructure, a special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) beneficiaries and facilitating inter- and intra-State trade of agriculture produce to ensure the fairest return to farmers were some of the other important areas covered, the statement said.

Developing eNAM or the National Agriculture Market (NAM) into a “platform of platforms” to facilitate e-commerce was among the important topics of the meeting. Also discussed was a uniform statutory framework to create new ways of farming, which will infuse capital and technology into the agrarian economy.
The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016, and protecting the interests of small and marginal farmers were discussed at the meeting attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

The meeting also discussed ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with the present times so as to incentivise largescale private investment in post-production infrastructure.
Developing ‘Brand India’, creation of commodity-specific boards/ councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract-farming were some of the interventions that were discussed to boost exports.

The use of technology in agriculture is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.
Mr. Modi underscored the importance of the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain.
The meeting decided to further strengthen the role of Farmer Producer Organisations to make the agrarian economy vibrant and agriculture trade transparent and to create the maximum benefits to farmers. The overall emphasis was on revisiting the laws governing the market for better price realisation and allowing farmers the freedom of choice, the statement said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi discusses reforms in agriculture sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid coronavirus-induced lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday deliberated on ways to reform the agriculture sector with emphasis on agriculture marketing, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of laws. Agriculture accounts for 15 per cent of India's gross domestic product and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the country's 1.3 billion population.
The government has maintained that the country's farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the Covid-19 lockdown and there will not be much impact on its growth in the current fiscal, unlike other sectors.
The pros and cons of bio-technological developments in crops or enhancement of productivity and reduction in input costs was also deliberated, an official statement said.
The meeting also focused on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.
Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure fairest return to farmers were some of the other important areas covered, the statement said.
Developing eNAM or the National Agriculture Market into a "platform of platforms" to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics of discussion on Saturday.
Discussion also emanated on the possibilities of a uniform statutory framework in the country to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in the agrarian economy.
The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 and how to protect the interest of small and marginal farmers was discussed in detail.
Ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with present times so that large-scale private investment in post-production agriculture infrastructure is incentivised, and how it has a positive effect on commodity derivative markets, was also discussed.
Developing 'Brand India', creation of commodity specific boards/councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract farming are some of the interventions that were deliberated to boost agriculture commodity export.
The use of technology in the agriculture sector is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.

It was decided to further strengthen the role of Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs) to bring vibrancy in agrarian economy, transparency in agriculture trade and enable maximum benefits to the farmers.
Overall emphasis was on revisiting the existing laws governing market for better price realisation and freedom of choice to the farmers, the statement said. Agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Govt moves to offset remittances shortfall</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ISLAMABAD: Expecting a shortfall in the amount of money sent back to the country by migrant workers because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has decided to offer an incentives package to overseas Pakistanis to encourage them to use banking channels to transfer remittances.
According to a recent World Bank, remittances to low- and middle-income countries are projected to fall by nearly 20%, “representing the loss of a crucial financial lifeline for many vulnerable households”.
Describing the decrease as the worst in recent history, including the 2008 financial crisis, the bank said migrant workers were especially vulnerable to losing their jobs during coronavirus lockdowns which are still largely in place across the developed world.
The package — to be effective from the start of the next fiscal year — includes tax exemptions and other incentives under a special loyalty programme.
Under the incentives package, “withholding tax will be exempted from July 1, 2020 on cash withdrawal or on issuance of banking instruments/transfers from a domestic bank account to the extent of remittances amount received from abroad in that account in a year”.
In this connection, the finance ministry has directed the Federal Board of Revenue to propose necessary amendment to the Income Tax Ordinance through the finance bill.
Under a ‘National Remittance Loyalty Programme’ to be launched from September 1, various incentives will be given to remitters through mobile apps and cards.
They will be offered debit and loyalty cards, in addition to a smartphone-based incentive product. Moreover, a special application similar to Vouch365 will also be launched to facilitate them.
Under the programme, children of overseas Pakistanis sending remittances home will be given 50% discount in Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) School and college fees and a special quota will also be allotted to the expatriates in the OPF housing schemes.
According to finance ministry sources, a sub-committee led by additional finance secretary (international finance and investment) has started designing the loyalty programme.
A high-level committee formed for the purpose has completed the preliminary work on it.
The committee consists of Ministry of Finance (MoF), State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), Immigration and Passport office, National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and representatives of other banks.
Sources said the committee will finalise the comprehensive programme and present it for approval.
It was further said that the finance bill will be amended in the next fiscal budget and a National Remittance Loyalty Programme with the collaboration of banks will be introduced in September 2020 along with an incentive package.
The federal government, in an attempt to offer additional relief to the overseas Pakistanis, has decided to introduce a centralised loyalty programme under which debit card and loyalty cards will be issued, while a smart-phone based incentive product and a special application similar to Vouch 365 will also be launched.
The committee is further deliberating over exempting the immigration fees, insurance premiums and registration fees for the overseas Pakistanis.
The expatriates will be issued frequent flyer cards, while special facilities in the government institutions will also be offered to them under the programme.
The PIA will draft the incentive package and share it with the sub-committee, which will later be added to the loyalty programme.
In addition, recommendation to open a separate counter for overseas Pakistanis at the international airports is also under consideration where they will be given clearance on priority basis on their arrival and departure.
Sources said that the panel had reviewed the initial recommendations put forth and in a recent meeting, the SBP, OPF, FBR and other institutions had reached a consensus on the matter.
The committee had been directed to complete the work on the proposals and finalise them.
The recommendation to exempt the overseas Pakistanis from the immigration fees is also under consideration, for which Bureau of Immigration and Overseas Employment (BIOE) had been tasked to complete its work.
The Overseas Pakistanis Foundation Welfare Fund (OPFWF) and Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) authorities will complete the working with the BIOE to determine the additional financial burden that they will have to bear for exempting the immigration fees, insurance premium and registration fees.
Similarly, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is also reviewing the recommendations to offer special concessions to overseas Pakistanis for which the Pakistan Remittance Initiatives (PRI) and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will complete the work in consultation with other banks and decide a procedure for the use of CIP lounges at all international airports and estimate the cost to be borne in this regard.
Moreover, separate counters will be set up for overseas Pakistanis and red carpet will be rolled out for them.
Special standing and welcoming notes will be posted at these counters from where the expatriates will be able to deposit their remittances in exchange for the local currency.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Donald Trump is getting nervous. Internal polls show him losing in November unless the economy comes roaring back.
But much of the economy remains closed because of the pandemic. The number of infections and deaths continue to climb.
So what is Trump’s re-election strategy? Reopen the economy anyway, despite the risks.
Remove income support, so people have no choice but to return to work.
Trump’s labor department has decided that furloughed employees “must accept” an employer’s offer to return to work and therefore forfeit unemployment benefits, regardless of Covid-19.
Trump’s ally, Iowa’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, says employees cannot refuse to return to work for fear of contracting the disease. “That’s a voluntary quit,” making someone ineligible for benefits.
GOP officials in Oklahoma are even threatening to withhold the $600 a week of extra unemployment benefits Congress has provided workers, if an employer wants to hire them. Safety is irrelevant.
“If the employer will contact us … we will cut off their benefits,” says Teresa Thomas Keller of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission.
Forcing people to choose between getting Covid-19 or losing their livelihood is inhumane. It is also nonsensical. Public health still depends on as many workers as possible staying home. That’s a big reason why Congress provided the extra benefits.
Hide the facts.
No one knows how many Americans are infected because the Trump administration continues to drag its heels on testing. To date only 6.5m tests have been completed in a population of more than 200 million adults.
Florida, one of the first states to reopen, has stopped releasing medical examiners’ statistics on the number of Covid-19 victims because the figures are higher than the state’s official count.
But it’s impossible to fight the virus without adequate data. Dr Anthony Fauci, the administration’s leading infectious disease expert, warns that reopening poses “a really significant risk” without more testing.
Not surprisingly, the White House has blocked Fauci from testifying before the House.
Pretend it’s about “freedom”.
Weeks ago, Trump called on citizens to “LIBERATE” states like Michigan, whose Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, imposed strict stay-at-home rules.
Michigan has the third-highest number of Covid-19 deaths in America, although it is 10th in population. When on Thursday Whitmer extended the rules to 28 May, gun-toting protesters rushed the state house chanting: “Lock her up!”
Rather than condemn their behavior, Trump suggested Whitmer “make a deal” with them.
“The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” he tweeted. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely!”
Meanwhile, the attorney general, William Barr, has directed the justice department to take legal action against any state or local authorities imposing lockdown measures that “could be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens”.
Making this about “freedom” is absurd. Freedom is meaningless for people who have no choice but to accept a job that risks their health.
Shield businesses against lawsuits for spreading the infection.
Trump is pushing to give businesses that reopen a “liability shield” against legal action by workers or customers who get infected by the virus.
This week, he announced he would use the Defense Production Act to force meat-processing plants to remain open, despite high rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths among meatpackers.
“We’re going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that’ll solve any liability problems,” Trump said.
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, insists that proposed legislation giving state and local governments funding they desperately need must include legal immunity for corporations that cause workers or consumers to become infected.
“We have a red line on liability,” McConnell said. “It won’t pass the Senate without it.”
But how can the economy safely reopen if companies don’t have an incentive to keep people safe? Promises to provide protective gear and other safeguards are worthless absent the threat of damages if workers or customers become infected.
The biggest obstacle to reopening the economy is the pandemic itself.
Any rush to reopen without adequate testing and tracing – far more than now under way – will cause a resurgence of the disease and another and longer economic crisis.
Maybe Trump is betting that any resurgence will occur after the election, when the economy appears to be on the road to recovery.
The first responsibility of a president is to keep the public safe. But Donald Trump couldn’t care less. He was slow to respond to the threat, then he lied about it, then made it hard for states – especially those with Democratic governors – to get the equipment they need.
Now he’s trying to force the economy to reopen in order to boost his electoral chances this November, and he’s selling out Americans’ health to seal the deal. This is beyond contemptible.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Murder Hornets vs. Honeybees: A Swarm of Bees Can Cook Invaders Alive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SEATTLE — When a pack of Asian giant hornets targets a hive of honeybees for slaughter, the carnage can be swift.
The so-called murder hornets, which have surfaced for the first time in the United States, have a particular appetite for bees and specialize in group attacks. The slaughter begins when a worker hornet spots a colony, marks it with a pheromone and then brings a backup crew of between two and 50 others. While a honeybee hive can have thousands of residents, hornets can wipe out the whole population in hours.
During one recorded slaughter examined by researchers, each hornet killed one bee every 14 seconds, using powerful mandibles to decapitate its prey.
But some bees have also demonstrated a remarkable survival strategy by working as a team to fight back against individual invaders, researchers have found.
When a hornet enters the hive of Japanese honeybees, researchers have witnessed how hundreds of bees can respond by forming a ball around a hornet. While the bees face an immense disadvantage in both size and strength, the bees working in unison can vibrate to produce heat, raising the temperature in the formation, like a tiny oven, to over 115 degrees. Bees can survive the high temperature, but the hornet cannot, and after up to an hour of cooking, the hornet dies.
European honeybees, which are the most common pollinator in the United States, don’t appear to have the same instinct. They try to defend against a hornet attack by stinging the invaders, but the Asian giant hornet carries a rigid exoskeleton that makes bee stings ineffective, according to researchers.
“The honeybee in Japan has adapted with this predator and learned through generations to protect themselves,” said Ruthie Danielsen, a beekeeper in Birch Bay, Wash., near where two Asian giant hornets were discovered. “Our honeybees, the predator has never been there before, so they have no defense.”
While the Asian giant hornet is a threat to humans, with a potent stinger that kills up to 50 people each year in Japan, its arrival in the United States has brought particular dread to beekeepers. They are working together to post traps to try and catch queens this spring and workers in the upcoming summer. Government biologists are trying to identify where the hornet has settled in Washington State and eradicate it before it establishes a permanent presence.
Ms. Danielsen said the beekeepers were exploring a special trap used in Japan that was placed in front of a beehive, designed to catch an Asian giant hornet before it marks the hive with a pheromone.
Tim Lawrence, a professor of entomology at Washington State University with expertise in honeybees, said that in Japan, however, there were smaller beekeeping operations compared with in the United States. In America, he said, it is not uncommon to find hundreds of bee hives in an apiary.
“We don’t know what’s going to happen if the hornet is established in an apiary of that size,” Mr. Lawrence said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway Lost $50 Billion Last Quarter As Warren Buffett’s Investments Took A Hit From Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Warren Buffett’s famed investing conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a massive net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter, as the coronavirus-driven market sell-off took a significant toll on the company's stock holdings.
Berkshire posted a record net loss of $49.75 billion in the first quarter—down from $21.7 billion in profit last year.
That amounts to a loss of $30,653 per share, compared to profits of $13,209 per share in the first quarter of 2019.
Even as the coronavirus hurt the company’s business, Berkshire’s operating profit rose 6% to $5.87 billion, up from $5.56 billion a year ago.
Berkshire’s quarterly filing makes 31 references to coronavirus, showing the pandemic’s substantial impact on the company so far in 2020.
The first quarter saw many of Buffett’s largest stock holdings—including big banks and airlines, plummet even further than the benchmark S&P 500, which fell 20% during that period.
Buffett’s cash pile is up from $125 billion to $137.3 billion, as the Oracle of Omaha continues to look for an elephant-sized acquisition.
Buffett emerged as a key player who helped restore confidence in the markets during the 2008 financial crisis, but he’s remained relatively quiet during the 2020 coronavirus downturn. Charlie Munger, vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B , told the Wall Street Journal recently that the Oracle of Omaha is being “fairly conservative” with his investments in the current market. He also admitted that a few of Berkshire’s smaller businesses might altogether. Companies are reportedly not calling Berkshire for capital like they were in 2008: “The phone is not ringing off the hook,” Munger confirmed, adding that airlines are “all negotiating with the government, but they’re not calling Warren.”
Berkshire Hathaway’s stock is down 20% so far this year, compared to a 13% decline for the S&P 500.
Warren Buffett is the world’s fourth-richest person, with a net worth of $72 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates.
Berkshire’s first-ever online annual shareholders meeting will take place later today, at 4:45 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's firm reports nearly $50B loss as investments drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Warren Buffett’s company reported a nearly $50 billion loss on Saturday because of a huge drop in the paper value of its investments, though the company is still sitting on a huge pile of cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That’s down from last year’s profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.
Berkshire’s revenue grew 1 percent to $61.27 billion.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently
On Saturday afternoon, Buffett plans to lead an abbreviated online version of Berkshire’s annual meeting without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend. The company shifted to an online meeting and cancelled all the events surrounding the event because of the coronavirus outbreak.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Ferrari that was used by Rome's police force from 1963 to 1968 is now on sale.
The Ferrari 250 GTE is considered one of the automaker's most popular models, ultimately evolving into three different series throughout four years, according to Girardo & Co. But unlike any other Ferrari build, the 250 GTE that's now on sale with Girardo & Co has a unique history: the Ferrari 250 GTE Polizia was used by Rome's police force during a time when crime-related car chases were at a high.
Before the arrival of the 250 GTE, the police had been driving an Alfa Romeo Giulia 1600. However, the decision to purchase a Ferrari came after one of the force's most revered officers, Armando Spatafora, said, "What could be better than a Ferrari?" in response to being asked what he would need to be "complete," according to Girardo & Co.
This statement then started a series of events that ultimately led to the purchase of the now "legendary" 250 GTE Polizia vehicle.
That exact Ferrari 250 GTE Polizia is now being sold with its robust history file that includes police documentation and Ferrari build sheets. The car dons a body fitted by Pininfarina and a tan leatherette interior that contrasts its black exterior paint.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There's a crazy Google Home sale happening, hurry to get one for under $30</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Home speakers have become common household items over the last few years, and if you're looking to replace your old one, upgrade from a Mini, or add another to a new room, this is your week: almost every retailer has them on sale for just $30, a full $70 off their regular price.
Google has been constantly working on improving and tweaking the Home ecosystem, recently letting you adjust the sensitivity of your device's "Ok Google" listening, and including a separate volume level setting for the assistant's voice, so they're not screaming at you at the volume of your music. Now, it seems Google's next step is moving more units into homes, as the Home — as well as several other Google products — are on sale everywhere this week.
Google Home Smart Speaker - $30 ($70 off)
Google Store, Best Buy, Walmart, Target
If you already own your share of Google Home speakers — or you're looking for something with a bit more oomph — these larger Google Home hubs and speakers are also on sale - though not as drastically as the original Home speaker.
Google Nest Hub - $80 ($50 off)
Google Store, Best Buy, Walmart, Target
Google Nest Hub Max - $199 ($30 off)
Google Store, Best Buy, Walmart, Target
Google Home Max - $249 ($50 off)
Google Store, Best Buy, Walmart, Target
This is an excellent opportunity to stock up on easy and useful gifts, as you'll be hard-pressed to match the $30 deal for Google Homes anytime soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rolls-Royce considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce - source</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L) is considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce, a source close to the company told Reuters, as customers cut production and airlines park planes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The size of layoffs has been mentioned internally by senior management, but is by no means finalised and there is a lot of negotiation still to be done, the source added.
The company’s engines power Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co’s (BA.N) widebody jets and Rolls-Royce is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly.
The Financial Times earlier reported Rolls-Royce was preparing to lay off up to 8,000 of its 52,000-strong workforce.
An announcement on the final figure is not expected before the end of May, when the company will update employees, according to the FT report. (on.ft.com/2VSaQfD)
Last month, Rolls-Royce scrapped its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances to cope with the virus outbreak.
The company’s Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in April Rolls-Royce would be looking at cutting cash expenditure, including salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year.
Discussions with unions about the job cuts have just begun, the newspaper reported, citing sources.
The scale of job cuts is still likely to be larger than after 9/11 when the group cut 5,000 jobs and the vast majority of it is expected to hit the civil aerospace unit, the FT said.
While job losses are also expected in the unit’s operations in Singapore and Germany, Britain’s civil aerospace workforce is expected to bear the majority of the cuts, according to the report.
Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, did not comment in response to a query from Reuters.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leading Indian carmakers had zero sales in April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: India’s top carmakers couldn’t ship a single vehicle to dealers in April as they shut production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the world’s biggest stay-at-home restrictions to stop the coronavirus from spreading.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., which produces about half the cars on India’s roads, and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., the nation’s biggest SUV maker, recorded no sales in the domestic market last month. Hyundai Motors India Ltd. too couldn’t sell a single unit last month. Maruti sold more than 120,000 cars a month in the year ended March 31.
“There’s always a first time for everything,” said Maruti’s Chairman R.C. Bhargava in a phone interview. “I can’t say what will happen in May. Whether we will start production or not is not possible to forecast.”
The total lockdown is hurting local vehicle makers, who sold more than 2.8 million cars, SUVs and vans each month in the year ended March, more than peers in other countries. In China, while sales plunged in February, the peak of the pandemic in that nation, companies managed to sell 224,000 cars. Indian carmakers were struggling even before the lockdown. The pandemic and the ensuing stay-at-home orders on March 25 have since disrupted supply chains.
With the economy set for a rare contraction, the outlook for the car manufacturers remains bleak. They are losing 23 billion rupees ($306 million) each day factories remain closed, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The lobby group has written to the government seeking help.
“Considering the fragile health of the automotive industry, as also its economic contribution, we are writing to request you to kindly allow the entire automotive value chain for opening up and re-commencing operations,” car and auto part makers said in a joint letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs on Friday.
The ministry extended the stay-at-home restrictions for most parts of the country for two weeks starting May 4.
Bhargava in a recent interview to Bloomberg had said he expects a car-sales boom after the lockdown is lifted as customers appear more motivated to buy than before the pandemic because they see personal vehicles as safer than public transport.
Although there were no sales in the local market last month, Maruti exported 632 units after a port in the western state of Gujarat resumed operations, while Mahindra sold 733 vehicles in international markets. Hyundai shipped 1341 units in April. These are wholesale numbers as Indian carmakers do not announce retail figures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett Dumps Airlines and His Aerospace Pain Only Worsens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped its stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines but the billionaire investor remains deeply exposed to the collapse in air travel.
Berkshire still owns all of Precision Castparts Corp., a supplier of aerospace parts that’s bracing for lean times as Boeing Co. and Airbus SE cut jetliner production. Berkshire bought Precision Castparts in 2016 in a transaction valued at $37.2 billion, making it one of Buffett’s biggest deals.Now the maker of jet-engine blades and aircraft structural components is facing a double whammy as the coronavirus pandemic all but erases demand for flights, prompting airlines to park jets and slash schedules. That means less need for replacement parts and a big drop in aircraft purchasing. With carriers predicting that flying won’t return to 2019 levels for as long as three years, aerospace suppliers are hunkering down for a protracted slump.
“The current downturn is quite different from regular economic cycles,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners in London. “Normally, there’s an exaggerated short-term impact with a fairly quick return. This time around, the impact seems to be significant as you’re looking at a collapse in air travel around the world.”
In the U.S. alone, passenger totals are down about 95% from a year ago. An index of major U.S. carriers has lost more than half its value this year, paced by a 70% drop for United Airlines Holdings Inc. Buffett said he lost money on his investments in the industry, which also included stakes in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.“The airline business -- and I may be wrong and I hope I’m wrong -- but I think it’s changed in a very major way,” Buffett said. “The future is much less clear to me.”
Airline shares sank sharply in pre-market U.S. trading Monday, with big players like American and United falling more than 10%. Boeing slid 4% while General Electric Co. was down 1.8%.
Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman for non-insurance operations, acknowledged at Berkshire’s annual meeting Saturday that Precision Castparts was getting hit, although its defense business remained strong. The parts maker is working to adjust the business to meet current demand, he said, and Buffett pointed out that the pain is rippling throughout the supply chain.
“We’re going to have aircraft in this country, we’re going to be flying. But the real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not and when you’re likely to need them and it affects a lot of people,” Buffett said. “And it certainly affects Precision Castparts, it affects General Electric. It obviously affects Boeing.”
Boeing and Airbus have also tumbled by more than half, with steeper declines at suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. and Triumph Group Inc.“It’s good for Precision Castparts that they’re not a standalone public company right now, because if they were, they’d certainly have a very low stock price,” said James Armstrong, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. “It’s not great news for them, but I don’t think that business goes away. I think it slows down.”
Precision Castparts has been hit by two massive and unpredictable blows that weren’t in any way its fault.
Even before the Covid-19 outbreak pushed airlines into the worst crisis in industry history, Boeing’s 737 Max was grounded in March 2019 after two deadly crashes. The Chicago-based planemaker halted production of the Max, its best-selling jet, earlier this year as the flying ban dragged on.
The fortunes of Precision Castparts are largely tied to those of Boeing, said Scott Hamilton, a consultant at Leeham Co. who publishes a popular aviation news website. As goes the aerospace giant, so goes its suppliers, he said.“Nobody could have foreseen the airline industry collapse in which 95% of the traffic evaporated virtually overnight,” Hamilton said. “Nobody could foresee the grounding of the Max lasting what may be 18 months. And just as Precision is tied to Boeing, Boeing is tied to the airlines.”
Precision Castparts watched its sales slip in the first quarter across all of its major markets, Berkshire said Saturday in its earnings report. That was partly due to the effects of Boeing’s Max problems as well as reduced shipments to customers hurt by the pandemic. That contributed to a 7.3% decline in pretax earnings in the period.
The parts maker ended up temporarily halting work at a plant in Portland, Oregon, and later said it would “significantly” cut its workforce, according to a report in The Oregonian. Berkshire said that the business faced higher production costs because of “manufacturing inefficiencies primarily attributable to Covid-19.”
Boeing also briefly paused production of multiple aircraft programs. The company has said it will reduce employment by 10%, or about 16,000 jobs, and lower production of jetliners including the 787 Dreamliner.
Precision Castparts, with its advanced technologies for casting and forging metals, will remain a key cog in the aerospace supply chain. In addition to the robust defense business in aircraft parts, the company serves customers in the power and energy industries.But with commercial air travel facing a long and uncertain recovery, Buffett’s bet on Precision Castparts will remain a drag on Berkshire for the foreseeable future.“That’s a big-time dud,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, which owns Berkshire shares. “He obviously in retrospect made a real bad whole-company purchase.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. Official Warns Israel About Chinese Investors Amid Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A key U.S. official said Israel is among the countries that need better screening of foreign investment to guard against having their companies turn toward China during the economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
“One of the preliminary takeaways from this crisis is that we have to be more cautious in our dealings with China,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said in a phone interview. “There are firms out there that are desperate for capital and could become targets for predatory investment.”
The rhetoric is heating up again between the world’s two biggest economies, with President Donald Trump escalating efforts to pin blame on China for unleashing the pandemic and exploring ways to hold it accountable. Tensions are also playing out elsewhere, with the European Union ushering in the first continent-wide rules for screening takeovers on security grounds.
Chinese companies backed by the government’s financial muscle are already hunting for bargains in Europe, prompting EU countries to increase their powers to veto investment from outside the bloc. Canada is also among countries stepping up scrutiny of foreign investment amid the crisis.
“We’ve taken steps,” Schenker said. “Some of our partner nations have taken steps to bolster investment-screening efforts of late but Israel could also be welladvised to add some of these mechanisms as well.”
After coming under pressure from the U.S. to better scrutinize potential investment from China, Israel last October said it would form a new advisory panel to vet the national security aspects of foreign investment. Schenker said Israel’s new process still falls short because it doesn’t cover the field of high technology and is voluntary.
“It’s necessary but I think they can do a whole lot better and I think they should,” he said.
Others have also raised concerns over the new Israeli body, which was established when an interim government was in charge. A Rand Corp. report published this year said “the committee will likely have legal and structural challenges” and “might not fundamentally change the regulation environment.”
China is a key economic partner for Israel. It plays a major role in local infrastructure projects and is the country’s second-largest commerce partner with $11.8 billion in annual trade between the two sides.
But its role in the Israeli economy has come under pressure during Trump’s administration, with U.S. officials urging Israel to rethink China’s reach. America is Israel’s top strategic ally, and the U.S. has said intelligence sharing and other forms of cooperation could be at stake.
Axios reported over the weekend that U.S officials asked their Israeli counterparts why a Hong Kong-based company’s bid to build an Israeli desalination plant didn’t go through the screening committee. Schenker declined to comment on the specific project.
Schenker singled out a recent U.S. law known as FIRRMA -- which strengthened the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to include some non-controlling investments and real estate deals -- as potentially worth adding for Israel.
“We are working with the Israelis, talking to them about lessons learned,” he said. “But I think now in the aftermath of Covid it should highlight to all of us just how important it is to have these types of mechanisms in place.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. Official Warns Israel About Chinese Investors Amid Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — A key U.S. official said Israel is among the countries that need better screening of foreign investment to guard against having their companies turn toward China during the economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
“One of the preliminary takeaways from this crisis is that we have to be more cautious in our dealings with China,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said in a phone interview. “There are firms out there that are desperate for capital and could become targets for predatory investment.”
The rhetoric is heating up again between the world’s two biggest economies, with President Donald Trump escalating efforts to pin blame on China for unleashing the pandemic and exploring ways to hold it accountable. Tensions are also playing out elsewhere, with the European Union ushering in the first continent-wide rules for screening takeovers on security grounds.
Chinese companies backed by the government’s financial muscle are already hunting for bargains in Europe, prompting EU countries to increase their powers to veto investment from outside the bloc. Canada is also among countries stepping up scrutiny of foreign investment amid the crisis.
“We’ve taken steps,” Schenker said. “Some of our partner nations have taken steps to bolster investment-screening efforts of late but Israel could also be welladvised to add some of these mechanisms as well.”
Not Enough
After coming under pressure from the U.S. to better scrutinize potential investment from China, Israel last October said it would form a new advisory panel to vet the national security aspects of foreign investment. Schenker said Israel’s new process still falls short because it doesn’t cover the field of high technology and is voluntary.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global Oil Demand Starts a Long, Painful and Uncertain Recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Few have a better watchtower over oil demand than Joe Gorder, chief executive officer of major U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp. But this week Gorder didn’t even need his business insight to know that fuel consumption was starting to recover in America.
He only needed to look at the streets of San Antonio, the Texas city where he’s based, to see traffic emerging after weeks of lockdown.
“People are starting to get out more,” Gorder said. “I think there probably is a pent-up demand for folks to get out of their houses and get mobile.”
From the streets of San Antonio to Barcelona and Beijing, traffic data, sales at fuel stations, and pipeline flows all suggest that the slump in oil demand probably bottomed out around the middle of April, and has now started a modest -- and very tentative -- recovery. The signs matter beyond the petroleum industry as they provide a glimmer of hope after a torrent of negative economic data.
“I believe we have seen the bottom,” said Marco Dunand, co-founder of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the world’s top-5 oil trading houses.
But the recovery is extremely slow. Oil traders believe it’s likely to take more than a year, and perhaps much longer, before global demand reaches the pre-pandemic levels of roughly 100 million barrels a day. A growing minority even speculate it may never get there again.
The likely shape of the revival has been a hotly contested topic. A V-shape was discarded a while ago. It’s possible it could be U-shaped, with a relatively long period along bottom, or L-shaped, with demand never returning to where it once was.
Perhaps the Latin alphabet doesn’t have a letter for the right shape. The square-root mathematical symbol may offer, to a point, an alternative: first a V-recovery as lockdowns are relaxed, followed by a long, flat tail as lifestyle changes, such as more work-from-home, become more normal.
Certainly, airlines don’t expect a return to the 2019 level of demand for years to come. It’s what Ed Morse, a veteran oil watcher at Citigroup Inc., calls “the winding, bumpy road to an oil recovery.”
The sheer scale of the demand destruction -- about 30 million barrels a day in April -- means the comeback is going to be a painful process. The International Energy Agency estimates that consumption will be down 25.8 million barrels a day in May, and 14.6 million in June. In December, it would still be 2.7 million a day below 2019 levels.
“We’re seeing improvements really across all three markets, we’ve seen in May volumes trending up in Europe, we see that happening in the U.S., and we see that also in Asia,” Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., told investors on Friday. “There are some, I’d say, encouraging early signs.”
The very gradual improvement comes just as producers, from the OPEC+ alliance to drillers in Texas, accelerate their output cuts. Together they could progressively push supply and demand into balance over time. In the past week, more companies, including big American firms such as ConocoPhillips, have announced fresh production closures.
“Globally, we are at the inflection point where we are past the worst for oil demand destruction but not for supply destruction,” Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultant Petromatrix GmbH. “This should help price stabilization.”
The process will take time, with unsold crude and oil products likely to accumulate well into June and perhaps even July. Storage tanks are nearly full, and brings with it the risk of New York crude gyrating wildly again when the June futures near expiry in the middle of this month, mirroring what happened when the May contract ended and sent prices below zero.
Even so, the physical oil market, where actual barrels change hands, is showing tentative signs of recovery, particularly in Europe. Urals, Russia’s flagship export grade, has risen to a premium over Brent after Moscow cut exports to a 10-year low.
The epicentre of the oil recovery is the same as where the public health crisis started in January: Wuhan. Weekday traffic in the Chinese city has almost returned to pre-crisis levels, although it remains depressed on weekends. It’s completely back to normal during rush hour in other major cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, according to data from navigation company TomTom International BV.
“There are a few green shoots in some places like China,” said Jessica Uhl, finance head at Royal Dutch Shell Plc. “We have some of our retail stations where demand and volume is up above pre-Covid levels.”
Some of these shoots are also visible in one of the most battered industries -- aviation. Commercial operations worldwide are recovering slightly, with Flightradar24 data showing 33,500 flights taking off on April 30, the most in a month. However, that’s still two-thirds lower than from before the pandemic. Most airlines do not plan to fly again until July at the earliest.
In the oil industry itself, the recovery is patchy, and many worry that it could quickly reverse if a second wave of infections hit after lockdowns are relaxed. Diesel, which fuels trucks and industries, is holding up better than gasoline, which is doing a lot better than jet-fuel. Even when demand strengthens, crude consumption may remain low because refiners will have first to get rid of the millions of gallons of oil products that have piled up over the past weeks.
As with many economic indicators, oil demand data comes with a significant lag. So traders rely on proxy estimates for a near real-time view. One is highway traffic. Another is the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s trucked out from pipeline terminals into fuel stations.
In the U.S., the amount of gasoline supplied to the market increased last week to nearly 5.9 million barrels a day, up from 5.1 million in the first week of April but well below the typically more than 9 million before the virus, according to the official data. Early last month, refiners saw gasoline demand at 55% of normal level, which improved to 64% in the latest seven-day average. Valero confirmed on Thursday that it’s seeing some pick-up.
“I do think we’re going to see more activity,” Valero’s Gorder said.
Spain, which had one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, offers a rare window into real-time demand as the nation’s biggest pipeline operator is disclosing weekly information. CLH Group said gasoline demand in the week to April 26 was down 75% from a year ago, a slight improvement from 81% in mid-April and 83% in late March.
In the U.K., demand for road fuels is currently down between 55% and 60% from levels before the crisis, compared with 65%-70% two weeks ago, according to the Petrol Retailers Association.
The data show that the recovery is only marginal. But it also indicates that consumption has, at the very least, bottomed out. Where demand goes, prices follow, and Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd, thinks the worst of oil’s slide is over.
Echoing a widely held view in the market, Tornqvist warns, however, that these subdued prices and demand may remain for a while. Prices aren’t likely to go much above $40 a barrel before the end of 2021, Tornqvist said. Only four months ago, at the start of this year, benchmark Brent crude was near $70. It was at about $26 a barrel on Monday.
“It’s going to take a long time to balance the market,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Lawsuit Against Sycamore Might Be The Only Thing L Brands Will Get Right For A While</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Source
L Brands, Inc. (NYSE:LB) was hanging by a thread when I first wrote about the company in late-January. The only way for the company to get out of the waters, back then, was to sell the struggling Victoria's Secret (VS) segment. A few weeks after I published my article on L Brands, the company secured a deal with Sycamore Partners to sell a 55% stake of Victoria's Secret for $525 million. This sent the shares higher, rightly so, considering the obstacle VS segment has turned out to be for the company to grow its earnings. Things, however, have suddenly become more complicated along with Sycamore's announcement on April 22 regarding the termination of Victoria's Secret transaction. Shares retrieved further as this was a punch in the gut for L Brands that was already suffering from the closing of its stores across the globe to help fight the spreading coronavirus. The company, on April 24, confirmed taking legal actions against Sycamore for violating the deal terms. The only thing that many investors are sure of is the escalation of this legal battle in the coming months. There's a lot at stake. After carefully evaluating the situation, I believe investors should still avoid L Brands.
The court case; arguments for and against L Brands
The story has two sides. On one side, Sycamore Partners is claiming that L Brands did not honor the deal terms by furloughing employees and halting rent payments to landlords. On the other side, there is L Brands arguing the closing of its stores, the non-payment of rents due, and the furloughing of employees are consistent with the measures taken by all retail stores alike in these trying times. What's more, L Brands is making the case that Sycamore's other holdings companies, including The Limited, have taken the exact same steps to remain solvent amid the global lockdown.
L Brands dropped a bombshell as well.
The contract terms of the L Brands-Sycamore deal include protection for the former against a pandemic! This should be the first instance the word "pandemic" was used in a M&A contract, but considering the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus in Italy, China, and some parts of Europe in February, this doesn't come as a surprise.
Sycamore will most likely find it difficult to prove that L Brands has violated the deal terms as the negative impact resulting from a pandemic will not be classified as a "material adverse effect" that allows Sycamore to walk away from the transaction.
As things stand out, the deal will most likely go through. I'm not a legal expert by any stretch of the imagination, but it's easy to see why Sycamore faces unfavorable odds in this legal battle. If you want the opinion of a legal and corporate transactions expert, you need not look beyond what Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, had to say about the upcoming legal battle.
If the deal goes through, will L Brands recover?
That's the question many investors want an answer for. The key to answering this question is to differentiate between recovery and survival. I'll get back to this at the end of this segment.
L Brands needs Victoria's Secret out of the way to focus on Bath & Body Works, which has a much better profitability profile. Even if the deal is to go under the agreed-upon terms, L Brands would still be owning 45% of Victoria's Secret segment. Investors should not take this lightly. The relationship between L Brands and Sycamore is starting from the wrong foot. If the deal goes through, Sycamore would not be happily collaborating with L Brands by leaving everything aside. If the deal goes through as a result of a court ruling, investors should expect corporate battles between the two partners for years to come. This is not good news for L Brands.
Second, think about why L Brands wanted the VS segment out of its sight to start with. The company wanted the $525 million so badly to get the house in order. Now, the company is forced to spend a massive amount of litigation costs just to get the deal through. Even after incurring these costs, it's not 100% sure whether the court will rule in favor of L Brands. If you ask company executives, I'm sure they will confirm that this is an abyss they never wanted to fall into. The company has about $6.5 billion of long-term debt, and EBITDA has been declining consistently over the last five years. This is not exciting news for a company that will be in an uphill battle to grow its earnings in the coming years.

Third, even if we forget everything surrounding the Sycamore deal for a moment, it's fairly obvious that L Brands, along with other retailers, will find it difficult to get back to its normal state for many months to come. Think about Wuhan, the original epicenter. A month has passed by since mobility restrictions were lifted off. But residents are still reluctant to come out of their homes unless otherwise it's absolutely necessary. I doubt whether shopping for lingerie would be a good enough reason for people to risk being exposed to a second wave of the virus. L Brands was already struggling to stay on its feet, and the coronavirus outbreak has landed a punch in the gut. Regardless of whether the deal goes through, L Brands will find itself in a precarious situation once business activities return to normalcy.
Based on these three developments, it's safe to conclude that recovery is nowhere near L Brands' sights. In the best-case scenario, the Sycamore deal will go through and L Brands will survive. The question I have for investors is, would you rather invest in a company that can survive if everything goes according to the plan or a company that will grow in leaps and bounces if everything goes according to the plan? The battle for L Brands will stretch beyond the court, even if it comes out victorious inside the court.
A smaller and better Victoria's Secret segment is the only silver lining
L Brands might use this opportunity to permanently scale down its business operations related to the VS segment. The once-booming Victoria's Secret products are now out of sync with shoppers because of the massive failure of its marketing campaigns. Customers have gone for more inclusive brands that accepted beauty can come in all sizes and shapes. If L Brands, together with Sycamore (depending on whether the transaction will go through), decides to reduce the store count of the VS segment and focus on building its brand image, recovery would be possible in the long term. That is the only silver lining amid all the dark clouds for L Brands.
Takeaway: the risk-reward profile is not favorable
It's easy to lose perspective when the shares of a company loved by an investor decrease to never-before-seen levels. With so many things going around L Brands, it's easy to lose sight of what really matters. Yes, L Brands might come out victorious in its lawsuit against Sycamore Partners. But assuming that things would be a smooth run for the company thereafter could prove to be a grave mistake. The company could face liquidity problems, and the brand value might continue to decline the same way it did over the last five years. Simply put, the things that could go wrong for the company are greater than the things that the company might get right, such as the lawsuit against Sycamore.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Services And Wearables Have Protected Apple From The Pandemic, But What About The Looming Economic Crisis?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are a number of interesting surprises to be found in Apple’s financial results. The first is that in a period defined by the coronavirus pandemic, with half the world in lockdown and its stores closed, the company has not only improved its sales and exceed the analysts’ forecasts by showing remarkable resilience, but also its servicesand wearables divisions — two relatively recent commitments within the company’s strategic plan — have enjoyed strong growth.
Global revenues of $58.3 billion represent an increase of 1% over the same period as last year under very different circumstances, beating the analysts’ consensus of $54.54. That may not sound like much compared to Amazon’s numbers, but let’s not forget that many companies are now in the red. But beyond the global number, what is really interesting is the $13.35 billion the services division contributed, compared to $11.45 billion last year; along with the $6.28 billion dollars from wearables and accessories, compared to $5.13 billion a year ago. This is because the emphasis on these two divisions is relatively recent, a strategic refocus that has effectively served to balance the company’s books at a difficult time. Apple’s services and wearables have been its protective mask while the rest of the world caught the virus.
The question, obviously, is not what will happen during the pandemic, which should be relatively short — or so we hope — but afterwards, when the economic crisis kicks in. While we’ve been in lockdown, Apple News has reached 125 million active monthly users, which is not that surprising given Apple’s strong corporate umbrella.
It’s worth asking how many of those users will continue to pay the ten dollars a month it costs in the midst of an economic crisis that is likely to be prolonged. In general, subscription services such as Netflix, Spotify, Apple Music, etc. are somehow considered luxuries, in that the content they provide can, in most cases, be obtained free through other more or less regular channels, which implies that the decision to pay is fundamentally a question of convenience. In that sense, the services that have allowed Apple to balance its books during the pandemic may not be so useful in the post-pandemic phase, especially if the economic crisis turns out to be intense or prolonged. Even Tim Cook has recognized a few uncertainties for the (not so) foreseeable future.
As a rule, services have a certain reputation for being more sensitive to economic crises than tangible products. That said, the rules don’t usually apply to Apple. It will be interesting to see how its results pan out over the year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">JK Rowling donates £1 million to charity to help vulnerable during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JK Rowling is donating £1 million to charity to help the most vulnerable in society during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Harry Potter author usually marks the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts – the showdown between Harry and the Hogwarts students and Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the final book, The Deathly Hallows – on 2 May each year.
However, she decided it would be ‘inappropriate’ to discuss the fictional deaths that occurred in the Harry Potter books while the country is in crisis.
The 54-year-old tweeted: ‘Today’s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I’m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world.

‘So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I’m thinking of the people who’re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I’m torn between pride and anxiety.’
The author – believed to be worth £700 million – went on to confirm she would be making a donation to Crisis and Refuge, to help the homeless and victims of domestic abuse. 
Rowling wrote: ‘As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I’ll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to https://crisis.org.uk, who’re helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to https://refuge.org.uk, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.’
Chief executive of Refuge Sandra Horley CBE stated that domestic abuse could potentially increase during lockdown, with people spending more time at home with their abusers.
A statement read: ‘1.6 million women experienced domestic abuse last year, and self-isolation has the potential to aggravate pre-existing abusive behaviours by perpetrators.
‘While in lockdown or self-isolation, women and children are likely to be spending concentrated periods of time with perpetrators, potentially escalating the threat of domestic abuse and further restricting their freedom.
‘Domestic abuse isn’t always physical – it’s a pattern of controlling, threatening and coercive behaviour, which can also be emotional, economic, psychological or sexual. Abuse is a choice a perpetrator makes, and isolation is already used by many perpetrators as a tool of control.
‘In the current climate, it is certainly more challenging for women suffering abuse. Lines of communication could be severely limited if women are unable to leave the home.’
Rowling had been ‘reminded’ by a fan on 1 May that the Battle of Hogwarts was coming up, to which she responded with a shout-out to the birthday of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour’s daughter – who was called Victoire, French for victory, because of the day her birth fell on.
The writer – who lost her billionaire status due to her charity donations – tweeted: ‘Also Victoire Weasley-née- Delacour’s birthday, but that gets overshadowed. I feel bad for her. The wizarding equivalent of being born on Christmas Day and christened Holly.’
The creator of the wizarding world of Harry Potter has been active on social media during lockdown, responding to fan art and also launching Harry Potter At Home to keep kids entertained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">J.K. Rowling Honors ‘Battle Of Hogwarts’ Anniversary With $1.2 Million Charity Donation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">J.K. Rowling is donating $1.2 million to charity, to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, the final showdown that takes place in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
The Harry Potter author decided to forego her tradition of apologizing for killing off Harry Potter characters on May 2, and instead penned a heartfelt message on the current global COVID-19 crisis, and announced that she would be donating £1 million ($1.2 million), splitting this donation between homeless support charity Crisis, and domestic violence charity, Refuge:
“Today's the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I'm going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world. 1/4
“So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I'm thinking of the people who're out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I'm torn between pride and anxiety. 2/4
“As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I'll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to crisis.org.uk, who're helping the homeless during the pandemic 3/4
“and half of which will go to refuge.org.uk, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown. 4/4”
May 2 is the day on which Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort and his followers in the Harry Potter books. The final battle at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry resulted in the deaths of many fan favorite characters, and in previous years, Rowling took to Twitter every May 2 to apologize for one of these deaths:
Even last year, many thought Rowling had forgotten to post an apology, but eagle-eyed fans spotted a change in her cover photo, presumed to symbolize an apology for the death of Sirius Black in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:
Fans have reacted to Rowling’s break from tradition with gratitude, with many saying that they also plan to donate after seeing her announcement.
In December 2019, Rowling was awarded a Ripple of Hope R.F. Kennedy Human Rights award. To help fans, families and teachers through the COVID-19 crisis, Rowling announced the launch of her Harry Potter at Home hub, dedicated to providing free resources to those reading the Harry Potter series, including offering the first Harry Potter eBook and audiobook for free.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronovirus in Oklahoma: Metro businesses slow to return to the office despite governor's May 1 kickstart date</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Edmond optometrist Steve Moyer wasted no time reopening Memorial Eye Clinic on Friday, the official start to Phase Two of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s plan for reopening the state economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the past five weeks, Moyer has seen patients only in emergencies, his wife Kim Moyer said on Thursday.
“But we‘re going full time starting May 1,” she said.
Despite the now-relaxed rules, the eye doctor, his partners and associates are returning to the office with extra-protective precautions.
“Steve will wear gloves and, unless it scares patients, a mask also,” Kim said. “He’ll scrub up and show patients how to wash their hands, and give them their own masks."
Patients’ temperatures will be taken before they’re seen, and exam rooms will be sanitized after every visit, which are being scheduled one hour apart, starting half-days at first.
Monday, Monday
Other businesses across the metro — including TeamLogic IT, Contemporary Sounds and OKIE811 — are waiting until Monday to return to the office, but with similarly stringent protocol and sanitizing.
The 11 employees of TeamLogic IT, who’ve primarily worked from home since March 18, will work on a rotating basis May 4 through May 31.
“We’ll have a limit of five in the office at one time,” said Davis Merrey, owner-president. Employees also have been provided thermometers, sanitizers, gloves and masks, and instructed when to use them, Merrey said.
“Even though we were considered an essential business, we closed, and chose to shelter in place, because so many of our employees and customers were at high-risk for COVID-19,” said David Treadway of Contemporary Sounds.
“But, we have kept lines of communication open and have a list of people to visit as soon as everyone feels safe,“ he said. Each installation team will visit only one household a day to keep cross contamination at a minimum, and all tools and trucks will be cleaned daily.
OKIE811 executive director Susan Bohl said, starting Monday, those employees who once worked from the NW 67 and Broadway offices of the safe-digging agency can self-select when to return to the office full time — but only in phases: three at a time, with two weeks in between.
After the March 11 Thunder game was canceled due to a opposing player infected with the coronavirus, 85% of her 63-member staff started working from home, as 25 workers already did. She stayed put in the office alongside three workers who lacked home internet service, and a few others.
“Those who are returning on Monday are all extroverts,” she said. "But new protocols require that all of us remain 6 feet apart, with no more than two employees at a time in the kitchen, walkways and restrooms. Returning employees also are being asked to conduct self-wellness assessments, including taking their temperature, before coming to the office each day.
“Employees who have compromised immune systems have been instructed to continue working from home until all executive orders have been lifted and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines proclaim it is safe."
A little more time
The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, which employs nearly 450, is formulating gradual return-to-work plans for possibly later this month, but “doesn’t expect to have a full onsite staff any time in the near future,” said Adam Cohen, senior vice president and general counsel.
“We’ll prioritize science and laboratory operations, but we’ll do it in a way that will keep our onsite population as low as possible,” Cohen said. “We’ll only bring more staff back onsite when we feel confident, based on available health data, that we can do it in a way that keeps them safe.”
The skeleton crew who occasionally reports to the OMRF office to maintain mechanical systems or process payroll come on staggered or reduced shifts, Cohen said, “with everyone required to wear masks and practice social distancing in offices and labs."
Business as usual
Wayne Pettigrew, president of Vanguard Benefits Group LLC, said it was business as usual on Friday, as it has been for his company throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
“We never closed,” Pettigrew said. “Vanguard processes medical appointments and assists with medical claims, so we are considered essential,” he said.
Ditch Witch of Oklahoma owner Gary Bridwell said his business, which employs 51 at two Oklahoma locations, also has remained fully open with halted commercial air travel, extra cleaning precautions and requests of employees to maintain social distances with each other and customers, and frequent hand washing.
“We haven’t missed a day, and have avoided any sickness in all of our stores,” Bridwell said. “Things did slow a bit, but we still have had work in the shop and parts sales have been decent. Whole goods are at about 80%.”
“We are ready to go full speed,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Community QE2: Newly Eased Terms and a New Game Plan For Use</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I. Introduction
This week the Fed announced further easing of its three-week-old Municipal Liquidity Facility (‘MLF,’ ‘Facility’) for States and their Subdivisions struggling to address the national COVID-19 pandemic. Because this revised rendition of Community QE, as I call it, will be functioning as a literal lifeline to States and their Subdivisions, and because it remains, in light of its novelty, as unfamiliar as it will be essential, I will in this column briefly summarize what the newly eased Facility enables now and will likely enable in future. I’ll also elaborate an updated three-phase ‘Game Plan’ for States and Cities to put into operation with all deliberate speed – particularly if they have not yet acted on the earlier Game Plan I put out at the beginning of April.    
II. The Revised MLF: Key Current Provisions
The revised MLF will continue to operate under color of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (‘FRA’), which grants the Federal Reserve emergency lending authority in exigent circumstances. The Fed exercises this authority through purchase and hence ‘monetization’ of financial instruments. In this case the instruments in question will be what the MLF Term Sheet calls ‘Eligible Notes’ issued by ‘Eligible Issuers.’ The following provisions are of the most immediate importance. Present exceptions to, and likely future liberalizations of, terms are highlighted along the way.
Direct Purchase. The MLF, as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), will purchase securities directly from States or their Subdivisions. The securities will not have to be sold first on the ‘open market’ to private sector financial institutions, as is the case with Fed purchases under the FRA Section 14 authority. The ‘window’ through which the Fed will do this, previously scheduled to remain open till the end of September, will now remain open till the end of December. Like the previous Term Sheet, the updated Term Sheet remains vague until further notice about pricing, apart from the customary Bagehotian reference to assessing a ‘penalty rate’ to avert ‘moral hazard.’ As nothing in the past, present, or likely future of the current pandemic would seem attributable to any want of due diligence on the parts of American States or their Subdivisions, however, I find it impossible to read this language as anything other than formulaic. 
Three-Year Maturity. The months-to-maturity on the State and Municipal paper in question will be, for now, 36 rather than 12 months as originally anticipated or 24 months as announced earlier this month. Crucially, however, these durations could well be extended still further for reasons provided below.
Eligible Notes. Presently the Term Sheet requires that Eligible Notes be ‘tax anticipation notes (TANs), tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs), bond anticipation notes (BANs), [or] other similar short-term notes issued by Eligible Issuers,’ which can secure lending only up to 20% of each relevant issuer’s ‘general revenue from own sources and utility revenue’ for the fiscal year 2017. Crucially, however, three-year notes enable far more to be characterized as ‘revenue-anticipating’ in character than the earlier-forecast six, twelve, or twenty-four-month notes would have enabled. Moreover, ‘States may request that the SPV purchase Eligible Notes in excess of the applicable limit’ in order to assist political subdivisions and instrumentalities that are not presently eligible for the Facility’ (emphasis added). While the new Term Sheet, unlike its predecessor, also stipulates minimum ratings for which Eligible Notes must qualify, the relevant takeaway for City and State officials is that the instruments must simply be what is known in the industry as ‘investment grade.’ That is simply to say that they are likely to be repayable in future notwithstanding distress at present, hence that the Notes are not ‘junk bonds.’ 
Eligible Issuers. The Term Sheet stipulates that Eligible Issuers will be all U.S. States and the District of Columbia, U.S. Counties with populations exceeding 500,000, and U.S. Cities with populations exceeding 250,000. Crucially, however, the Term Sheet permits ‘States [to] request that the SPV purchase Eligible Notes in excess of the applicable limit in order to assist political subdivisions and instrumentalities that are not eligible for the Facility.’ A full list of Counties and Cities that now qualify as Eligible Issuers is available here. Moreover, the Term Sheet now expressly provides for Multi-State Entities established by interstate compacting among any two or more States. Parties interested in the prospect will find contact information to learn more below. The Term Sheet continues, on the other hand, to say nothing of Tribes or Territories, which the CARES Act singled out for special solicitude. It is to be hoped – and forcefully urged – that this omission will be rectified by the time that the next Term Sheet update is made.
Eligible Use. Presently the Term Sheet stipulates that proceeds of Note sales be used ‘to help manage the cash flow impact of income tax deferrals resulting from an extension of an income tax filing deadline; potential reductions of tax and other revenues or increases in expenses related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; and requirements for the payment of principal and interest on obligations...’ The Fed seeks in these words to encourage perception of the MLF as a tide-over facility meant to assist counterparties in, as the Term Sheet puts it, ‘managing [their] cash flows.’ Crucially, however, other sections of the Term Sheet emphasize the prospect of longer-term ‘rollover’ of Note debt, while analysts also anticipate expansion of coverage from 36-month to longer-term paper as explained immediately below. Moreover, as noted above, three-year instruments allow for far more uses to be characterized as ‘revenue-anticipation’ measures than those customarily associated with that phrase.
II. The Next MLF: Likely Further Easing Ahead
           Much of the language found in the new, as in the earlier, MLF Term Sheet suggests that present conditionality might be loosened yet further than it has been already relative to what was anticipated last month and what was first announced this month. There are two additional reasons, outside ‘the four corners of the document,’ which further underwrite expectation of further easing.
Fed Interpretive Pronouncements. Chairman Powell and the Fed Board of Governors have publicly encouraged a quite ‘flexible’ interpretation of all conditional language found in the MLF’s Term Sheet. They have also repeatedly stated that they will be monitoring the municipal debt (‘muni’) markets for signs of resumed volatility, with an eye to intervening yet further to stabilize them if and as necessary. Combined with the many openings for extension and exception specified in the Term Sheet itself as described above, these amount to assurances that the MLF remains a ‘work in progress’ whose scope will expand if and as the need for it expands.
Analyst Prescriptions & Predictions. Bond market and public finance experts have called on the Fed to purchase State and Municipal debt with maturities not only in excess of traditional 6-month and 12-month durations, but also in excess of the previous 24-month and the new 36-month durations. The Fed has done nothing to discourage such calls. Most commentators, not to mention ‘smart money’ on the markets, seem now to anticipate upwards of five-year State and Municipal debt to find its way onto the MLF balance sheet before the Facility completes its mission. The fact that the move from 24-month to 36-month notes came within less than three weeks lends color to that expectation. While it of course cannot be predicted with certainty, States and Cities faced with serious crises should judge maturity lengthening more likely than not.          
IV. An Early May ‘Game Plan’ for States & Their Subdivisions
           In light of the above, States and their Subdivisions should be planning for use of the newly eased MLF immediately. This Facility, again, is unprecedented – the Fed is improvising right now. What States and Cities do now in response to the improvisation will thus be decisive in determining what shape the MLF takes as it unfolds. States and their Subdivisions are in other words co-authors of this new authority. It will ultimately be what they make of it. The following updated three-phase ‘Game Plan’ is proposed with that ‘existential’ truth in view. 
Phase One: Immediate‘Quantitative’ Legislative & Executive Sessions. All State Governors and Legislatures, as well as their eligible County and City counterparts, should go into emergency session at once, ‘virtually’ if need be, to determine how much funding to seek from the MLF. The State sessions should also include (a) representatives of the States’ principal Subdivisions, (b) appropriate Public Finance personnel, and (c) representatives of the regional Federal Reserve Banks in whose operational jurisdictions the relevant States and Subdivisions are located. Because the need of funds generally is likely to be recognized and agreed upon even more quickly than the full panoply of uses of funds, Phase One can be limited to deliberation and decision over how much funding to seek and whom to authorize to begin preparations for seeking it. Additionally, States and their Subdivisions at this stage should open regular channels of communication both with the FRBNY, which will administer the MLF, and with their regional Federal Reserve Banks, all of which have Public Affairs Offices for the purpose. I am currently organizing webinar sessions for State and Municipal officials on the one hand, and the Public Affairs Offices of regional Federal Reserve Banks on the other hand. Officials may also contact FRBNY’s MLF administrators directly at: Tel: 202-452-2955; Email: MLF@ny.frb.org. A full list of Eligible Issuers, as well as answers to Frequently Asked Questions, is available here.
Phase Two: Subsequent ‘Allocative’ Sessions. Once all Phase One decisions have been reached and the appropriate State and Local personnel have been assigned their Fed-liaising and Note-issuing tasks, States and their Subdivisions can proceed directly to Phase Two preparations – gathering information, testimony, advice and all other deliberative ‘inputs’ necessary to make sensible allocation decisions in respect of the new funding that will be incoming from the MLF. Crucially, some States and Subdivisions will likely see advantage in establishment of State-wide Coordinating Bodies through which States and all relevant Subdivisions can plan together in issuing Eligible Notes and directing resultant funds. Additionally, some States and Subdivisions will see advantage in developing such coordinating bodies into full Public Banks, which can not only help store and disburse funds, but also can help lever them into additional moneys, as well as ensure that all State residents have access to banking and payment services.
Phase Three. Later ‘Envelope-Pushing’ Sessions. Once Phase Two deliberations end in allocation and, possibly, Coordinating Body or Public Bank chartering decisions, States and their Subdivisions might turn to ‘Phase Three’ deliberations over whether and how to press the Fed for yet further easing of the terms of the MLF Term Sheet. It might be decided, for example, that authorization to purchase State and Municipal paper of longer maturity than 36 months should be sought – even up to 5 year notes as many analysts predict, or that a rollover option should be made more explicit. These questions can presumably wait, however, until current uncertainties ‘on the ground’ are resolved. With any luck, the pandemic might be contained before we reach any Phase 3.
V. Conclusion
However this may be, what matters now is that Phase One commence, and that it commence ‘with all deliberate speed.’ I will continue to watch events unfold, and will follow-up with further reporting and recommendations on an ‘as [seems to be] needed’ basis. Best wishes to all as we now reassume control of our public health and productive potential.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Activist investor hedge fund reportedly financing Eko lawsuit against Quibi over Turnstyle feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. is financing Eko’s patent lawsuit against streaming service Quibi, The Wall Street Journal reports. Eko’s suit claims that Quibi stole trade secrets and that its “Turnstyle” feature violates Eko’s patents. Turnstyle allows Quibi videos to play differently depending on the orientation —vertical or horizontal— of the viewer’s phone, switching in real time.
Eko wants Quibi to stop using its technology or license it and is suing for a preliminary injunction and damages. As part of the financing arrangement, Elliott would get an equity stake in Eko, according to the WSJ, though it’s not clear how much money is involved.
Quibi, the mobile video app that launched last month, raised nearly $2 billion to produce “quick bite” shows that last a max of 10 minutes. It filed a lawsuit against Eko a day before Eko filed its suit, asking a court to find that Turnstyle doesn’t infringe Eko’s patent. Quibi told The Verge in March that Turnstyle was its patented technology and that Eko’s claims were “without merit.”
A Quibi spokesperson reiterated its stance in a statement emailed to The Verge late Sunday. “As we made clear in our filing, Quibi’s patented Turnstyle feature is the result of the work from our talented engineering team,” the spokesperson said. “When a new product launches, these types of claims are unfortunately too common. Eko’s actions and complaints remain meritless.”
Elliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. An Eko spokesperson declined to comment.
Elliott Management is known for aggressive investor activism, backed by more than $40 billion in capital. The group was behind a recent push to replace Jack Dorsey as CEO of Twitter. The two sides reached an agreement in March that allowed Dorsey to remain as CEO but gave Elliott executive Jesse Cohn a seat on Twitter’s board, and a seat on a board committee tasked with evaluating a CEO succession plan for Twitter. Elliott also acquired a stake in AT&T in 2019, writing in a letter that the telco “suffered from operational and execution issues over the past decade, for which the current leadership team is accountable.” But it supported the recent appointment of AT&T COO John Stankey to CEO, according to CNBC.
(Disclosure: Vox Media, which owns The Verge, has a deal with Quibi to produce a Polygon Daily Essential, and there have been talks about a Verge show.)
UPDATE: May 3rd 6:40PM ET: Added information about Elliott’s role at AT&T
UPDATE May 3rd 7:06 PM ET: Added that Eko declined to comment.
UPDATE May 4th 9:50AM ET: Added comment from Quibi spokesperson

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hedge Fund Elliott Management Backs Patent Lawsuit Against Quibi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The activist investor that waged high-profile battles with AT&T and Twitter is financing a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile streaming service Quibi, a source familiar with the matter confirms.
Elliott Management agreed to fund Eko’s suit in exchange for an equity stake in the company, theWall Street Journal first reported.
The dispute centers on Quibi’s signature feature, called Turnstyle, which displays full-screen video horizontally or vertically—depending on how the viewer holds the phone.
The Israeli company claims two Quibi employees, who were provided access to its subsidiary’s technology while working at Snap, stole its idea. A Quibi spokesperson issued a statement denying that, saying Eko’s claims lack merit.
The conflict will pit Elliott’s combative founder, billionaire Paul E. Singer, against another tenacious figure, Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Elliott had previously called for the ouster of Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, before reaching a settlement with the company earlier this year. AT&T agreed last year to separate the CEO and chairman roles after Randall Stephenson stepped down.
Quibi launched on April 6, 2020, debuting a service designed to deliver quick bursts of entertainment for busy people on the go—in the middle of a pandemic. Katzenberg and CEO Meg Whitman raised $1.75 billion to launch the service, which attracted 1.7 million downloads in its first week.

Most of these retailers require at least $35 in the cart for free shipping, so you're going to pay an extra $5 to $7 unless you can order it for in-store pickup (or order more than one).
This deal price is honestly shocking considering we shared a deal just a couple days ago where it was down to $47, and we thought that was pretty good. I can't imagine this will last long and it looks like some places are already selling out. Get it while you can.

    <h5 class="mb-1">World’s Oldest Central Bank Hits Legal Blockade Amid Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden’s central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it’s to act on a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to save the economy.
The Riksbank’s 352-year history gives it the distinction of being the world’s oldest central bank. But the legislation governing it has yet to catch up with the kind of policy it needs to deliver to address the crisis triggered by Covid-19.
Specifically, the Riksbank doesn’t have the legal right to buy bonds issued by companies, even though it’s made clear it’s ready to do so as part of a recent package of emergency measures.
“The intention of the current Riksbank Act doesn’t allow the bank to make outright purchases of corporate bonds or other private securities on the primary or secondary markets,” said Niklas Schullerqvist, secretary to the parliamentary committee charged with overhauling the bank’s policy framework.
So far the Stockholm-based central bank has bought 5.6 billion kronor ($568 million) of corporate commercial paper as part of an emergency quantitative-easing plan. But it’s refrained from buying corporate bonds -- an important source of financing in the biggest Nordic economy -- despite repeated assurances it will do so.
Schullerqvist says the Riksbank needs to consider European Union legislation on state aid as corporate bond purchases “may be considered supporting some specific parts of the economy.”
Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank’s legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn’t comment further because “it’s an ongoing process.”
Meanwhile, a proposal due to be voted on by lawmakers may strip Sweden’s central bank of its right to do any form of quantitative easing beyond the purchase of government bonds.
According to the bank, “The proposed bill limits the Riksbank’s capacity to act, for instance by not allowing the Riksbank to purchase other securities than government papers, unless there are special reasons, or making lending to the banks conditional on them increasing their lending to companies. If this bill had applied now during the coronavirus pandemic, it would have limited the Riksbank’s monetary policy toolbox and it would have been unclear what the Riksbank was allowed to do.”
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are “certainly on our agenda.” He also said “there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market.”
Sweden’s primary bond market is a vital source of funding for the country’s businesses. And with record-low borrowing costs and a growing investor base flush with cash, the market’s growth has increasingly shaped Sweden’s economy.
But the market has been turned on its head since the Covid-19 crisis hit. Investors panicked and tried to redeem their cash, prompting 35 fixed-income funds to shut their doors. Even so, clients withdrew record quantities of cash and a spike in yields locked out all but a handful of top rated borrowers.
In April, Sweden’s syndicated public bond market only saw corporate issuance from investment-grade companies such as Volvo Group, Industrivarden AB and Scania CV AB, as well as state-owned entities including Jernhusen AB, Akademiska Hus AB and Sveaskog AB.
The crisis that’s hit Sweden’s corporate bond market has drawn pleas from the investor community for the Riksbank to intervene before it’s too late.
The Riksbank “should support new money rather than being very active in the secondary market,” said Daniel Sachs, chief executive at credit manager Proventus Capital Management AB.
Magnus Nilsson, founding partner of Nordic Cross Asset Management, says that a “first step” toward making it easier for struggling businesses to access funding “would be for the Riksbank to get involved in the primary market for investment grade bonds.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sydney to Resume Property Auctions as Virus Curbs Are Relaxed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sydney will allow open-house property inspections and public auctions to restart from next weekend in the latest easing of restrictions introduced to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
The move will be a major boost for the New South Wales property market, which has seen transaction volumes collapse as social-distancing measures brought an end to traditional selling practices.
Unlike other countries, individual inspections of properties are rare in Australia’s major cities, with realtors typically putting homes on show twice a week to encourage as many people as possible to visit. These open houses, which are combined with onsite public auctions and often attract crowds of onlookers, were banned in March.
“Easing the restrictions to ensure people can more easily inspect, buy or rent a property is an important step for NSW,” New South Wales Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said in a statement Sunday.
The industry will still need to ensure that physical distancing and hygiene measures are maintained, Perrottet said, urging the public to exercise commonsense.
“If people are not genuinely in the market for a new home, now is not the time to be having a look through their neighbor’s house,” he said.
The relaxation of the rules comes as Australia’s success in flattening the coronavirus infection curve means aspects of the economy are slowly starting to re-open ahead of schedule.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The State Government on Saturday issued an order to open several businesses from Monday with limited workforce as directed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) while continuing a strict lockdown in containment zones. A day after the MHA orders, the Karnataka government too allowed most economic activities barring public transport in red zones including Bengaluru. There will be no interstate vehicular movement. Buses, auto-rickshaws and cabs, salons and spas are allowed in green and orange zones. Meanwhile, Revenue Minister R Ashoka has asked BBMP Commissioners BH Anil Kumar to prepare a detailed note to divide Bengaluru into four zones so that restrictions of red zone be applied to only those areas with highest number of Covid-19 patients. “We will forward it to the MHA for approval,’’ Ashoka said. Liquor shops to openAn order issued by the Excise Commissioner on Saturday said that only stand alone CL - 2 (retail liquor shops) and CL 11-C (MSIL retail shops) are allowed to open from May 4 with restricted timings. The shops can operate only between 9 am and 7 pm by maintaining standard operating procedures like six-foot distance must be maintained between each customer, not more than five persons can stand in the queue at a time, both customers and the shop operators must wear masks, shops should keep alcohol-based sanitisers. Liquor shops in containment zones and in malls, however, continue to remain closed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel in talks to buy Israel's Moovit public transit app for $1 billion: media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp is in advanced talks to acquire Israeli public transit app developer Moovit for $1 billion, financial news website Calcalist reported on Sunday.
Moovit has raised $133 million from investors including Intel, BMW iVentures and Sequoia Capital.
Officials at Intel Israel and Moovit declined to comment on the report.
Calcalist reported that people with knowledge of the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the deal is very close to being signed.
Moovit’s free mobile navigation app provides transit information to more than 750 million users in 100 countries.
Last month it launched an emergency mobilization service, which was created for transit agencies and enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The technology transforms vehicle fleets into an on-demand service to get essential employees safely to work and has been implemented in a number of cities by large corporations.
Intel has made significant investments already in Israel, having acquired autonomous vehicle technology provider Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017. In December it bought Israeli artificial intelligence firm Habana Labs for $2 billion.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors’ sales in China saw double-digit year-on-year growth in April, its two local ventures said on Sunday, as the world’s biggest auto market recovers from the coronavirus.
GM’s (GM.N) joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (600104.SS), which manufactures Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles, said its sales in China grew 13.6% compared to a year earlier. It said it had sold 111,155 units in April, including exported cars.
Meanwhile, SGMW, a separate GM venture with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group which produces no-frills minivans and has started to make higher-end cars, said its sales jumped 13.5% to over 127,000 units last month.
U.S. automaker GM, which is China’s second biggest foreign car company after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), said its sales in China fell 43.3% in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year.
To attract customers, GM and SAIC have hired social media celebrities to promote its new models and are offering free medical masks to customers.
China’s biggest automaker SAIC, which sold more than 6 million cars last year, said its sales rose 0.5% compared to the same period last year. As well as the GM venture, it also builds its own brand cars and operates a venture with Volkswagen.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Business was booming for people who owned cars, trolleys and wheelbarrows in Olievenhoutbosch, Centurion, on Saturday.
As thousands of residents queued for food parcels, they used this opportunity to charge people to transport their food parcels home.
The Mahlasedi Foundation has been handing out food parcels to residents over the past few days outside Walter Sisulu Primary School.
Vehicle owners charged between R20 and R30 per person, depending on the distance they were travelling, while wheelbarrow and trolley pushers charged between R10 and R15 per load.
Honest Ndebele, who owns a wheelbarrow, grabbed the opportunity after receiving his food.
"Yesterday after receiving my food, I noticed that people were struggling to carry their food and I then started charging them. Many have now joined us. We are pushing their loads to taxis as they are not allowed near the school.
"This is a good opportunity to make something during this period. Our challenge is people who don't want to pay us after boarding a taxi," said Ndebele.
Kabelo Motloung said he and his friends were taking a walk when they saw people waiting outside the school.
"I asked them if they needed someone to push their food and they agreed. We quickly ran home and returned pushing our wheelbarrows and trolleys. We have been working since this morning and so far have made some money.
"I would rather push a wheelbarrow the whole day than rob people. This is an honest way of making money legit," he added.
Pule Netshilaphala said he was waiting for someone who was queuing for food when he was approached by people asking for a lift.
"I asked others who were already transporting people how much they were charging and they told me that we must charge people the same amount. I have taken about five loads. I think by the end of the day, I would have taken more loads," added Netshiphala.
Thabo Sikhosana said he had transported two loads with his private vehicle.
"I am helping people who are desperate for transport. People here need transport and I am not going to miss this opportunity to make cash to feed my family. I would rather be here than to sit at home without money," Sikhosana added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.
HOUSTON: Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.
Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world's top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70per cent this year to under US$20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever.
Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts.
"We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover," Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.
The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output.
Exxon's biggest cuts will come in the Permian, "where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted," said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.
He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is "beneficial in long term" to ensure "we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive." Exxon will sideline 75per cent of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.
The company posted a US$610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly US$3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a US$3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.

Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30per cent this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to US$14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at US$23 billion, the lowest in four years.
Even though their results topped Wall Street's reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7per cent to US$43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8per cent to US$89.44.
Chevron’s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it "a defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas," said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Exxon’s balance sheet "is strong enough to withstand the current environment," but it needs oil prices around US$75 per barrel this year to break even versus around US$50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.
U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around US$19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around US$26 per barrel.
Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.
Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc's first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Disney is selling non-medical face masks in the US featuring characters from across its multiverse, including Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, the company announced.
Disney will donate one million masks to underserved communities via humanitarian aid organization MedShare, and all profits from the mask sales in the US through September 30th, up to $1 million, also will go to MedShare.
The masks, which include Anna and Elsa from Frozen; Woody and Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story; The Avengers; R2D2 and Baby Yoda (who Disney refers to as “the Child” in its release), are designed for the CDC’s recommendation that people wear cloth face coverings when out in public to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Disney said.
Cloth masks are not intended for use by medical professionals treating COVID-19 patients.
“We realize this is a challenging time for families and wearing any type of mask can be daunting,” Edward Park, senior vice president of Disney store and shopDisney said in a statement. “Our hope is that Disney’s cloth face masks featuring some of our most beloved characters will provide comfort to the families, fans and communities that are so important to us.”
The masks come in packs of four for $19.99 and are available for pre-order now in Disney’s online store, and come in various sizes, including children’s sizes. According to the shopDisney site, the company expects the masks to be available by July 15th.
“Disney’s donations will make a tremendous impact in the communities we serve,” Charles Redding, CEO and president of MedShare said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk says Tesla’s stock price is too high, and now it has fallen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday that Tesla’s stock price is “too high imo,” and the stock fell immediately after. Tesla’s stock is down more than 10 percent.
Last year, Musk made an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to have a company lawyer pre-approve tweets about Tesla’s finances, sales, or deliveries last April. The settlement exists because Musk tweeted he was thinking of taking Tesla private, “funding secured.” The SEC sued him for securities fraud as a result.
Here is Musk’s entire tweet:
On February 19th of last year, Musk tweeted that Tesla would make “around” 500,000 Tesla Model 3s in 2019, which was not in line with the company’s guidance at that time. The SEC then asked Musk if he was complying with the order to have his tweets reviewed. It turned out that he wasn’t, which led to a weeks-long legal battle for a stricter settlement agreed upon in April 2019. Tesla and Musk are still defending themselves from shareholder lawsuits stemming from the go private tweets.
When asked by The Wall Street Journal if he was joking in today’s tweet about Tesla’s stock price or if the tweet had been vetted, Musk only replied “No” in an email.
Musk followed today’s tweet about the stock price being too high by tweeting the lyrics to “The Star-Spangled Banner,” America’s national anthem. This also has echoes of his response to the SEC: he’s called the agency’s response to his February 19th tweets “an unconstitutional power grab.”
Update May 1st, 1:57PM ET: Added comment from Musk obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Broc Rutter is a couple hundred dollars richer today after he received an unexpected gift from the 49ers a few days after signing with the team.
Rutter was given a $279 signing bonus that wasn’t part of his original deal with the club. Why you ask? Basically, the 49ers had the extra money just sitting around and decided to give it to somebody.
Every year, teams are allocated a set budget of bonus money to give to undrafted free agents. Once the 49ers signed all 10 members of their 2020 UDFA class, they had an extra $279 leftover, and rather than have that money go to waste, they put it on to Rutter’s deal as a signing bonus.
Rutter led his team to the NCAA Division III National Championship in December while also smashing the Division III career passing yards record and winning the Gagliardi Trophy as the nation’s top D-III player.
Hopefully, he can translate that talent into the pros and became highly successful.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Gazette reportRIYADH — Moody’s Investors Service, one of the world's leading rating agencies, affirmed Saudi Arabia’s sovereign credit rating at “A1”, however, it modified Kingdom’s outlook to “negative” from “stable”, Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday.The change in future outlook was the result of the outbreak of the coronavirus coupled with the crash of oil prices in the international market, according to Moody’s.“The negative outlook reflects increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia's fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term,” Moody’s said in a statement.Moody's noted that Saudi Arabia is the second largest oil producer in the world, and has significant oil reserves and low extraction costs, providing the Kingdom with a high degree of competitive advantage over other oil producers.In its report, Moody's stressed that the Saudi Arabia's “stable” rating reflects its effective monetary policy, credibility of the exchange rate, overall financial and economic stability, and signs of improvement in fiscal policy resulting from structural financial reforms with plans to diversify the economy away from oil.Moody's raised its estimate for the 2020 fiscal deficit from 8.7 percent to 12 percent of GDP.This will cause government debt to increase to around 38 percent of GDP by the end of 2021 from less than 23 percent of GDP in 2019, according to the statement.It is noteworthy that Fitch Ratings announced its rating for the Kingdom last week, which confirmed the long-term credit rating of Saudi Arabia at “A” with a stable future outlook.These positive estimations by the global rating agencies confirm the great confidence enjoyed by the Saudi economy, as well as the strength of its financial position in facing challenges, especially in light of crises in general and the current exceptional circumstances the world is currently experiencing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia’s outlook cut to negative by Moody’s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Saudi Arabia’s outlook was cut to negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service after the crash in oil prices exposed the vulnerability of the kingdom’s finances amid the global pandemic and its reserves plunged to the lowest level in almost a decade.
The rating company kept the sovereign at A1, its fifth-highest grade, according to a statement on Friday. Moody’s last downgraded Saudi Arabia in 2016, and now has its assessment above those of Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings.
“The negative outlook reflects increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia’s fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term,” Moody’s said.
Under strain from the coronavirus and collapsing oil prices, Saudi Arabia is headed for an economic contraction this year while increasingly drawing down its savings. In March alone, the central bank’s net foreign assets fell by more than 5%, or more than 100 billion riyals ($27 billion).
The government is looking to its largest-ever debt program to keep the depletion of reserves at up to 120 billion riyals, as originally planned in the budget. Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan has also laid out plans to scale back spending after already cutting 50 billion riyals in expenditure.
Moody’s projects that Saudi’s fiscal deficit will widen to more than 12% of GDP in 2020 and more than 8% in GDP in 2021 from 4.5% of GDP in 2019. This will cause government debt to increase to around 38% of GDP by the end of 2021 from less than 23% of GDP in 2019, according to the statement.
The price of Brent crude crashed by more than 50% in March and has fallen further since then. It’s now trading around $25 a barrel - far short of the $76.1 the International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi Arabia needs to balance its budget.
Assuming a base case scenario of Brent averaging $35 and Saudi Arabia implementing further spending cuts this year, its fiscal deficit could widen to just under 15% of gross domestic product, according to Bilal Khan, senior economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Dubai.
“Limiting the drawdown in net foreign assets to pre-announced levels is certainly possible but would likely require additional borrowing, deeper spending cuts or further divestment of state assets,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s announcement on 27 April, the Bounce Back Loans Scheme opens for applications from today. Accredited lenders are not providing access to loans ranging from £2000 to £50,000. These loans include a 100% government guarantee and thus hold zero risk for individual lenders.
The application form is said to be streamlined with the process enabling access to funding within days.
The Bounce Back Loans Scheme enables businesses to obtain a six-year term loan at a government set interest rate of 2.5% a year. The applicable interest rate was revealed by HM Treasury in a letter by the Chancellor posted on Friday.
The government will cover interest payable in the first year. Borrowers may receive up to £50,000or 25% of a business’ turnover. As no payments are due for the first 12 months the business does not have to pay any upfront costs.
Borrowers will begin principal repayments after the first 12 months on a straight-line basis.
There are no personal guarantees needed for these loans.
According to the British Business Bank, eligibility criteria is as follows:
The Bounce Back Loans are part of a series of programs designed to backstop the economy that has been undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The British Business Bank website will post the approved lenders.
Eligible companies will be subject to standard customer fraud like Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA pushes back draft combine, draft lottery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NBA is delaying the draft lottery and draft combine, events scheduled for Chicago later this month.
The league made the decision Friday, though it has been expected for some time. The lottery cannot occur until the regular season is completed or is declared over, because team records determine the odds that the 14 non-playoff teams will have of securing the right to pick No. 1 overall in the draft.
MAVERICKS OWNER MARK CUBAN 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' NBA CAN FINISH SEASON
For now, the draft remains scheduled for June 25 — though that, too, will likely have to change in the coming weeks as the league continues reacting to the coronavirus pandemic.
The lottery was to have taken place May 19. The draft combine was to have run from May 21-24.
The league typically invites about 70 players to the combine, where some of the candidates work out and play in scrimmages and others skip the on-court events entirely and just interview with teams instead. The combine has also been a chance for teams to conduct physicals with players, a key component of the evaluation process.
The NBA has been looking at several options for weeks about the draft schedule and pre-draft events, just as the league has when it comes to possibilities for resuming the season when public health officials say that would be appropriate.
“There are no target dates. There are more target responsibilities,” San Antonio CEO R.C. Buford said earlier this week. “And there’s still questions. We just got the early entry candidates list in the last couple days. That at least gives some kind of clarity on who the draft pool will be. But from there, we don’t have clarity on the Chicago pre-draft or medicals or all the things that go on with draft preparation.”

The NBA has not played since March 11, when it became the first of the major U.S. pro sports leagues to suspend games because of the pandemic. The league has missed 259 regular-season games because of the shutdown, and the playoffs would have started about two weeks ago.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McDonald's to reopen 15 outlets in UK this month, fast food fans relieved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: McDonald's said it would reopen 15 restaurants in the United Kingdom this month, only for delivery, leaving some fast food fans cheering.
The company said it would announce the locations of the restaurants next week, with plans to open them on May 13.
The new restaurants will employ stringent social distancing measures, including having perspex screens and floor markings to separate employees working in close quarters and temperature tests on arrival, McDonald's Chief Executive Officer for UK and Ireland, Paul Pomroy said in a statement.
The restaurants will have a limited menu and would not be serving its popular breakfast items to reduce complexities that arise in kitchens on changing menus from breakfast to lunch.
"When we return it will be different as we all adjust to this new normal," Pomroy said, adding that the company was working hard towards opening more restaurants but at the "right pace" with the wellbeing of employees, suppliers and customers being front of mind.
The news comes just three days after the world's largest restaurant chain denied a report that it would reopen some outlets in May, but confirmed that it was testing out a new restaurant model where social distancing measures were properly enforced.
It also follows moves by rivals such as KFC, Burger King and Pret-a-Manger, which reopened some locations for delivery in late-April.
However, on Thursday, bakery chain Greggs reversed its decision to reopen about 20 outlets after it stoked a social media frenzy, which led to fears of overcrowding.
McDonald's UK restaurants closed on Mar 24, with social media rife with images of long snaking lines of people queuing outside of restaurants trying to score their last Big Mac ahead of a three-week lockdown, that has since been extended.
On Friday, McDonald's UK's tweet about the reopening had already garnered nearly 2,000 likes, with users anxious to know if their neighbourhood outlet would be one of the 15 reopening.
"How do we know which ones are opening?", Twitter user Joanne of Birmingham, UK asked, while there were several other questions related to the opening locations in London.
Though some were disappointed that the limited offering didn't offer breakfast items, some were happy that they were just reopening.
"(It's) Better than nothing, don't moan about it," Twitter user Claire Willicombe (@bearthegooner) tweeted in response.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rally organiser confirms plans for post-pandemic events</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In association with 
Classic rally organiser Rally the Globe has announced two new events due to run in post-lockdown Britain, including a week-long event to be held in Scotland in early October.
Both rallies will include a range of special tests and regularity sections for period cars and are being planned for a time when international events may still be unworkable due to travel restrictions.
Subject to government rules and Motorsport UK approval, the new Highland Thistle Rally (October 4-9) will tackle challenging highland roads, starting and finishing at St Andrews. The five-day route is open to all pre-1977 cars and will take competitors to the Isle of Skye and the mountains north of Inverness.
The second new event will break fresh ground by being the first such event to be run for family pairings in pre-1986 cars. The Generations Rally will be based in the Lake District in late March and is aimed at family crews in a bid to encourage younger people to sample historic rallying.
Rally the Globe has recognised that international events may take longer to return to the calendar and many of the club's forthcoming events, including the Round the World circumnavigation, have had to be cancelled.
"Clearly there are still lots of uncertainties ahead but we wanted to provide our supporters with some light at the end of the tunnel," said organiser and former World Rally Championship co-driver Fred Gallagher. "The prospect of getting back into such wonderful events will certainly help to lift spirits."
"We are very much hoping the Highland Thistle will be a big celebration of our freedom but clearly it is entirely dependent on what the Scottish government allows at the time - that's why we are offering entrants a full refund should such gatherings not be permitted come the autumn," added Graham Goodwin, Rally the Globe's chairman.
"We have taken a pragmatic approach to our revised calendar and focused on events we believe our members will feel both safe and excited to enter post coronavirus."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posted a higher operating profit on Saturday (May 2), but the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments and led to a record net loss.
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss totalled US$49.75 billion, or US$30,653 per Class A share, reflecting US$54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totalled US$21.66 billion, or US$13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6per cent to US$5.87 billion from US$5.56 billion.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealised stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire's net results that Buffett considers meaningless.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US aviation sector cuts more jobs amid travel meltdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: The ongoing US travel crisis is causing thousands of job cuts as the aviation sector waits for passengers to return to the skies but braces for years of lower demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
US airlines are slashing hundreds of thousands of flights, cutting schedules by 80 per cent or more through at least June and parking thousands of jets as demand for tickets has plunged by about 95 per cent. Airlines are requiring facial coverings and implementing new cleaning procedures to try to convince passengers it is safe to fly again, but also fear the weakened economy may further drag down demand.
Late Friday, Spirit AeroSystems said that in response to lower production rates from Boeing and Airbus it would layoff 1,450 workers in Kansas.
"This sudden drop in air travel has forced our customers to adjust to lower demand from airlines, many of which are seeking to defer or cancel airplane orders," Spirit AeroSystems chief executive Tom Gentile told employees in an email seen by Reuters. "All indications right now tell us this lower demand for new commercial airplanes is likely to last for several years."
On Wednesday, Boeing announced it would cut some production rates and eliminate about 16,000 jobs worldwide, or 10per cent of its workforce by year end.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said he expects it will "take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends." The cuts in some areas, such as commercial airplanes, will be more than 15per cent, Boeing said.
Delta Air Lines Inc said last week it does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years. More than 37,000 Delta employees have volunteered to take unpaid leave lasting from one month to a year.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the airline will be "smaller than we intended to be certainly into 2021."
Labor union SEIU said Thursday at least 13,000 union members at airports have been laid off and another 1,000 layoffs are planned. The US Treasury has not yet awarded US$3 billion in payroll assistance cash grants approved by Congress for airport contractors such as baggage handlers and airplane caterers.
US airlines last month collectively were awarded US$25 billion in Treasury cash grants but as a condition must not fire workers or reduce through Sep 30.
Numerous airlines have warned that without a dramatic turnaround in passenger numbers they will be forced to make new significant cuts before year end.
JPMorgan Chase said in a research note on Friday that "Oct 1 is likely to emerge as one of the darkest days in history for airline labour" - though it noted that Congress could opt to extend additional assistance.
United Airlines is reducing working hours by 25 per cent for 15,000 employees starting May 24, drawing criticism from an employee union and some U.S. lawmakers who contend that the move violates the terms of the US$5 billion payroll assistance United is receiving from the Treasury.
"The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honour this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ," Republican Senator Josh Hawley wrote United on Friday.
United declined to comment on Hawley's letter on Saturday but its chief operations officer Greg Hart told employees in an email on Friday that the reduction in hours does not violate the terms of the government assistance.
He said United is "making similar changes for our management personnel" and that those changes will be announced on Monday.
Last month, General Electric said it was furloughing 50 per cent of workers in US engine assembly and component manufacturing operations, a move that impacted thousands of employees. That followed the 2,600 US job cuts announced in March by GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">7 reasons to still believe in emerging markets in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The combined equity value of 26 nations listed by MSCI Inc. as developing markets increased by $9.2 trillion since the end of 2009 through December 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emerging markets ended 2019 on a high note, but 2020 seems to be a different year altogether.
Today even the most optimistic investors know the chances of repeating this are slim. The financial fallout from the coronavirus is spreading rapidly and all emerging-market assets -- currencies, stocks and bonds -- are underperforming.
Outflows from emerging market funds totalled more than $83 billion in March, according to data from the International Institute of Finance (IIF).
“Investors across the globe are worried about the uncertainty the coronavirus outbreak is bringing to financial markets. The ramifications have been widespread,” says Chetan Sehgal, Senior Managing Director, Director of Portfolio Management at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity. “But we recognise that this period will pass and that things will recover.”
Even though economic activity in many countries has dramatically slowed or stopped due to the coronavirus outbreak, there’s underlying long-term potential in emerging markets, according to Franklin Templeton, a global investment management organisation with over 70 years of investment experience, employees in more than 30 countries and managing over $580 billion in assets under management (as of March 31, 2020).
Here is a quick look at why the long-term investment case for emerging markets is still compelling for investors with a calm and rational approach.
While the coronavirus outbreak will continue to dominate headlines and inform how we approach emerging market investing, there are some distinct trends that have taken off over the past few decades.
“First, economic growth differentials between emerging markets and developed markets (DMs) remain in the former’s favour,” says Sehgal.
Around the world, emerging economies are expected to grow around three times higher than developed markets until at least 2024, according to figures by the IMF.
“We are witnessing a transformation in emerging markets, despite the fact that many are having to adjust to a new reality because of the coronavirus outbreak. They will continue to play a vital role in fuelling global economic growth,” says Andrew Ness, Portfolio Manager, Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity.
The world’s second-largest economy paid a very high price near term to contain the virus, but China is slowly turning the corner. Short-term Chinese economic data is the worst seen in modern times. For the January to February period, year-on-year retail sales data were -20 per cent, exports -17 per cent, fixed asset investment -25 per cent and industrial production -13 per cent, figures from National Bureau of Statistics reveal.
“We expect recovery to begin in Q2, however, GDP growth should be significantly below trend for 2020. The decline in oil prices should benefit China as a net importer,” says Ness. “There are signs that ‘life’ is returning to some companies locally, many of which have been incredibly resilient and adaptable throughout this crisis.”
In terms of intellectual property and R&D spends, emerging markets have moved from imitation to innovation in recent years, another crucial factor that works in their long-term favour. “EMs are embracing technological innovation,” says Ness. “Many EM companies are leapfrogging those in developed economies in areas like e-commerce, digital payment and mobile banking.”
According to a report by online news portal Vox in March, China’s massive e-commerce infrastructure helped it through the coronavirus outbreak. JD.com said online grocery sales more than tripled year over year during a 10-day period between late January and early February. Today, e-commerce makes up a far higher percentage of retail sales in China than in the US.
The digital payment market in China is also multiple times that of the US. More broadly, EMs have also overtaken the US and Japan in patent applications. Emerging markets are also at the forefront of transformational technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, battery technology and supercomputers.
Another reason for optimism is that emerging markets today are much more resilient to capital flow shocks. “EM institutions have reformed policies, which should help them better withstand market stress,” says Sehgal. “EMs have increased their foreign reserve holdings since the early 1990s, which matters because they are a pillar of support for currencies. Many EMs have also abandoned currency pegs to the dollar, making them less vulnerable to speculation or a strengthening of the greenback.”
EMs have also reduced reliance on dollar debt, while diversifying borrowing sources and increasing local currency debt issuances, says Sehgal.
Mass urbanisation is transforming the face of emerging markets. By 2025, emerging markets will be home to over three-times the urban dwellers as the developed world, according to data from The Case for Emerging Markets Investments report by Franklin Templeton. By 2050, it will be close to five-times.
“EMs have a younger population with lower dependency ratios, while developed market populations are aging at a faster rate. By 2030, 86 per cent of the global working age population will live in emerging markets,” says Ness. “This paints a very clear picture about the potential for market dominance for those companies that can stay on top of this global trend — appropriately siting R&D and manufacturing centres while building brands that appeal to burgeoning local consumer markets as well as the global marketplace.”
Emerging economies are also taking a bigger share of global purchasing power and traditionally developed economies are having a hard time keeping up. “As consumers in EMs earn more, they will be compelled to spend some of that wealth on their families’ lifestyles. Internet and technology are also working their magic — the internet allows consumers to access global brands in a way that wasn’t available a decade or so ago, with mobile making it more accessible,” says Ness.
The current market dislocation is also an investment opportunity for active investors for looking for bargain buys. Stocks across emerging markets have dropped to a record discount to Wall Street, according to the IIF. “EMs are trading at a significant discount to developed markets, providing long-term investors with attractive investment opportunities,” says Sehgal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Weekly High Frequency Indicators: Trying To Stabilize At The Bottom Of The Cliff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Purpose
I look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy, they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available. They also are an excellent way to "mark your beliefs to market." In general, I go in order of long leading indicators, then short leading indicators, then coincident indicators.
A Note on Methodology
Data is presented in a "just the facts, ma'am" format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized.
Where relevant, I include 12-month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right. All data taken from St. Louis FRED unless otherwise linked.
A few items (e.g., Financial Conditions indexes, regional Fed indexes, stock prices, the yield curve) have their own metrics based on long-term studies of their behavior.
Where data is seasonally adjusted, generally it's scored positively if it's within the top 1/3 of that range, negative in the bottom 1/3, and neutral in between. Where it's not seasonally adjusted, and there are seasonal issues, waiting for the YoY change to change sign will lag the turning point. Thus I make use of a convention: Data is scored neutral if it's less than 1/2 as positive/negative as at its 12-month extreme.
With long leading indicators, which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole, there is an additional rule: Data is automatically negative if, during an expansion, it has not made a new peak in the past year, with the sole exception that it's scored neutral if it's moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high.
For all series where a graph is available, I have provided a link to where the relevant graph can be found.
Recap of monthly reports
April data started out with a plunge in the ISM manufacturing index.
March data included personal income and spending, the Confidence Board’s measure of consumer confidence, and pending home sales, all of which plummeted. Residential construction spending, however, increased, while nonresidential declined.
In the rearview mirror, Q1 GDP also fell off a cliff, while the employment cost index, in a last hurrah, increased to a new high for the expansion (wage growth is a long lagging indicator).
Long leading indicators
Interest rates and credit spreads
Rates
(Graph at FRED Graph | FRED | St. Louis Fed )
Yield curve
(Graph at FRED Graph | FRED | St. Louis Fed )
30-Year conventional mortgage rate (from Mortgage News Daily) (graph at link)
BAA Corporate bonds and Treasury bonds turned positive several months ago. That corporate bonds recently fell to yet another new expansion low would ordinarily be extremely bullish into Q1 2021, but the more recent spike to nearly five-year highs would ordinarily mean this is a negative. In the past several weeks bonds have bounced back into positive territory near their lows.
The spread between corporate bonds and Treasuries recently turned very negative, but also has bounced back significantly. Two of the three measures of the yield curve remain solidly positive, while the Fed funds vs. two-year spread turned neutral. Mortgage rates remain a positive.
Housing
Mortgage applications (from the Mortgage Bankers Association)
*(SA) = seasonally adjusted, (NSA) = not seasonally adjusted
(Graph here)
Real Estate Loans (from the FRB)
(Graph at Real Estate Loans, All Commercial Banks | FRED | St. Louis Fed )
With lower rates since early 2019, purchase mortgage applications were solidly positive. When the crisis started, they reverted back to negative. On the other hand, lower rates also recently led to a decadal high in refi, and were close again this week.
With the exception of several weeks in 2019, real estate loans generally stayed positive for the past several years.
Money supply
M1
M2
(Graph at FRED Graph | FRED | St. Louis Fed )
In 2018 and early in 2019, real M1 turned neutral and very briefly negative. Real M2 growth fell below 2.5% almost all during 2018 and early 2019, and so was rated negative. Last year, both continued to improve and for the past few months, both have turned and remained positive. Fed actions to combat the economic crash have only amplified that.
Corporate profits (estimated and actual S&P 500 earnings from I/B/E/S via Factset.com)
(Graph: P. 24 here)
FactSet estimates earnings, which are replaced by actual earnings as they are reported, and are updated weekly. Based on the preliminary results, I expanded the "neutral" band to +/-3% as well as averaging the previous two quarters together, until at least 100 companies have actually reported.
Q1 earnings have been downgraded over -15% since March. Needless to say, this metric is negative.
Credit conditions (from the Chicago Fed) (graph at link)
The Chicago Fed's Adjusted Index's real break-even point is roughly -0.25. In the leverage index, a negative number is good, a positive poor. The historical breakeven point has been -0.5 for the unadjusted Index. Four weeks ago all turned negative. In the past two weeks, there has been a bit of a rebound.
Short leading indicators
Trade weighted US$
Both measures of the US dollar were negative early in 2019. In late summer, both of improved to neutral on a YoY basis. The measure against major currencies took a major spill recently. Both measures had recently been neutral. This week, the broad measure remained negative, while against major currencies it remained neutral.
Commodity prices
Bloomberg Commodity Index
(Graph at Bloomberg Commodity Index )
Bloomberg Industrial metals ETF (from Bloomberg) (graph at link)
Commodity prices surged higher after the 2016 presidential election. Both industrial metals and the broader commodities indexes declined to very negative into 2019. Industrial metals briefly improved enough to be scored neutral and then positive, but both are now extremely negative.
Stock prices S&P 500 (from CNBC) (graph at link)
In 2019 stocks made repeated new three-month and all-time highs, right up into February. With the recent crash, they made a new three-month and one-year lows. They are now roughly halfway between those two extremes. Since in the past three months there have been both new three-month highs and lows, this metric is scored neutral.
Regional Fed New Orders Indexes
(*indicates report this week)
The regional average is more volatile than the ISM manufacturing index, but usually correctly forecasts its month-over-month direction. All during 2019 it had been waxing and waning between positive and flat, until it turned negative in January. In February there was a strong positive spike, but in March this fell apart and the average is now even more negative than during the Great Recession.
Employment metrics
Initial jobless claims
(Graph at FRED Graph | FRED | St. Louis Fed )
Initial claims made new 49-year lows in April 2019. Needless to say, that has all gone out the window.
Temporary staffing index (from the American Staffing Association) (graph at link)
This index turned negative in February 2019, worsened in the second half of the year, and has worsened still in the last two months, and badly so in the past month.
Tax Withholding (from the Dept. of the Treasury)
Year-over-year comparisons were almost uniformly positive since February 2019, until three weeks ago. One week ago they turned firmly negative.
Oil prices and usage (from the E.I.A.)
(Graphs at This Week In Petroleum Gasoline Section )
At the beginning of this year they went higher YoY, but since have abruptly turned lower, thus they have turned positive. Gas prices have are near 20-year lows. Usage was positive YoY during most of 2019, and had oscillated between negative and positive for the last several months. It turned decisively negative in the past month.
Bank lending rates
Both TED and LIBOR rose in 2016 to the point where both were usually negatives, with lots of fluctuation. Of importance is that TED was above 0.50 before both the 2001 and 2008 recessions. After being whipsawed between being positive or negative in 2018, since early 2019 the TED spread remained positive — until three weeks ago, when it turned negative again. But both TED LIBOR have now declined far enough to turn positive.
Business formations
Prof. Geoffrey Moore included net formations minus bankruptcies as measured by Dun and Bradstreet among his 11 short leading indicators. This statistic, which isn’t exactly the same and is only 15-years-old, is a similar measure. There's marked seasonality and considerable variance week to week, but a five-week average cuts down on most of that noise while retaining at least a short leading signal that appears to turn 1-3 months before the cycle.
This turned negative year-over-year six weeks ago as soon as coronavirus turned into a real issue.
Coincident indicators
Special note:The St. Louis FRED has initiated a Weekly Economic Index consisting of many of the same components as I track below, plus the weekly Rasmussen consumer index, electricity usage, plus initial and continued jobless claims and the Staffing Index I track above. You can find it here.
Restaurant reservations YoY (from Open Table)
I will update this for the duration of the coronavirus outbreak. The last day that restaurant reservations were positive YoY was Feb. 24. The sharp break downward began on March 9.
Consumer spending
Three weeks ago the bottom fell out below the Retail Economist reading. Redbook finally turned negative one week ago, and worsened this week.
Transport
Railroads (from the AAR)
(Graph at Railfax Report - North American Rail Freight Traffic Carloading Report)
Shipping transport
Since January 2019 rail has been almost uniformly negative and worsened beginning late in the year. YoY comparisons have continued to worsen in the last month.
Harpex made new three-year highs in mid-2019, and remained near those highs until the beginning of this year. It has declined about 165 points. BDI traced a similar trajectory, making new three year highs into September 2019, then declining to new three year lows at the beginning of February. It remains above those lows, but is still a negative. With the recovery in China, these measures may begin to improve.
I'm wary of reading too much into price indexes like this since they are heavily influenced by supply (as in, a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade) as well as demand.
Steel production (from the American Iron and Steel Institute)
By autumn of 2019, the YoY comparisons were almost exclusively negative. It was generally positive since the beginning of this year, but in March it turned negative again. The bottom fell out three weeks ago.
Summary and Conclusion
Among the coincident indicators, everything except for the TED spread and LIBOR - consumer spending, tax withholding, the Baltic Dry Index, rail, steel, restaurant reservations, Harpex and the BDI - is negative.
There were no changes among the short leading indicators. Gas and oil prices are positives. The broad US dollar and stock prices and the spread between corporate and Treasury bonds are neutral. Temporary staffing, the US dollar against major currencies, initial claims, the regional Fed new orders indexes, the Chicago Financial Conditions Index, gas usage, business formations, and both industrial and overall commodities are negative.
Among the long leading indicators, corporate bonds, Treasuries, mortgage rates, two out of three measures of the yield curve, real M1 and real M2, real estate loans, and mortgage refinancing as positives are all positives. The two-year Treasury minus Fed funds yield spread turned neutral. Corporate profits are negative, as are purchase mortgage applications, the Adjusted Chicago Financial Conditions Index and its Leverage subindex.
In the data the story is the same this week as it has been since the public health crisis started: Both the nowcast and the short-term forecast remain awful, while the long-term forecast is weakly positive, laying the groundwork for the eventual recovery.
The important news this week is that while the comparisons are awful, almost all aren’t any "more" awful than they were a week ago. A few have even rebounded slightly. The weekly and then monthly data for May will begin to tell us whether the data, while awful, has at least stabilized, or whether there are even worse second-order effects to come.
To reiterate what I have said for the past few weeks, the economy will be determined in the near future by the quality of political public health decisions at the federal and state levels, and by whether a “miracle cure” or treatment should suddenly appear. As the states are now taking widely divergent and in some cases opposing measures for dealing with the crisis, a “natural experiment” has been set up with 52 separate Petri dishes including DC and Puerto Rico. The results should begin to become apparent by the end of May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mortgage rates fall to new record low — here’s why some loan applicants won’t be offered them</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mortgage rates have dipped to a record low for the second time in as many months amid the global coronavirus outbreak.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to an average of 3.23% during the week ending April 30, a decrease of 10 basis points from the previous week, Freddie Mac FMCC, -0.31%reported this week. This represents the lowest level since Freddie Mac began tracking this data starting in 1971. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.14%.
Previously, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit an all-time low back in early March, when it dropped to 3.29%. Before that, the lowest rates recorded were seen back in November 2012 in the wake of the recession, when the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate home loan fell to 3.31%.
Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped nine basis points to an average of 2.77%. The 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage averaged 3.14%, down 14 basis points from a week ago.

Freddie Mac’s report is based on a survey of lenders, and it reflects the dollar volume of conventional loans, meaning loans eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae FNMA, -2.07%. The survey therefore does not reflect movements in rates for loans backed by other agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also doesn’t include rates for jumbo loans.
But whether borrowers get a loan featuring a record-low rate will depend on a number of factors. “While some borrowers could be quoted rates close to the lowest they’ve ever been, others either with less-than-excellent credit scores or seeking an atypical loan type — like jumbo or FHA loans — may be offered a much-higher rate,” said Matthew Speakman, an economist with real-estate firm Zillow ZG, +0.24% .
In recent weeks, some banks have begun tightening the standards prospective borrowers must meet in order to get a home loan. Mortgage companies have become stingier in terms of who they’ll lend to because of the risk posed by the current economic environment.
There’s an increased chance that a borrower could lose their job soon after getting a mortgage, which would make it much more difficult for them to make their monthly payments. Lenders are eager to avoid that at a time when some 3.5 million homeowners have already requested relief from making their monthly mortgage payments.

Nevertheless, in spite of the challenges people may face getting a low-interest rate mortgage, Americans continue to apply for new home loans in droves. “These low rates are driving higher refinance activity and have modestly helped improve purchase demand from their extremely low levels in mid-April,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.
Last week, the volume of refinance applications was more than three times larger than it was a year ago — a reflection of the appeal of low rates, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The number of Americans applying for loans used to purchase homes, while 20% down from last year, had nonetheless improved after hitting a five-year low.
But low rates won’t be enough to change the tides in the housing market, experts said. The number of listings of homes for sale continues to decrease as home buyers and sellers across America have grown wary of making such a large transaction given the state of the economy.
“Many buyers — stuck at home and worried about their jobs — have hit the ‘pause’ button,” George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com, said. “With financing less of an incentive and inventory disappearing, we will see a sharp contraction in sales over the next two months.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">CGT implications in transfer of income producing property</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You recently wrote that I can change our family home to joint ownership by doing this "personally". Could you tell me how to do this? Our house in Melbourne is in my name because my husband was in business and requested that I be the nominal owner. He conducted this business in a home office on the ground floor of the residence. If we sell the house, which has appreciated somewhat since we occupied it, the office part will attract a sizeable Capital Gains Tax (CGT) amount, as it is about one third of the "footprint" of the property. My thinking is that if the house was in both our names we could spread the CGT between our two incomes, a small part of which is from the aged pension. J.T.
In NSW, the State Revenue website is informative, telling us that if a family home is also used for other purposes, the duty exemption for transfers between spouses will only apply to the residential part of the home, unless only one room was being used for the business.
In Victoria, the State Revenue Office is less helpful and its 21 page "Guide to Spouse/Domestic Partner Property Transfers in Duties Online", which you can download from the SRO website, says nothing about using part of a home for business purposes.
The SRO’s client adviser (on 13 21 61) didn’t know the answer and its technical branch believed that as long as you meet all other requirements and the house is now wholly used as a principal residence, nothing in the law would reduce the exemption.
Assuming you obtain an exemption, go to the website, propertyandlandtitles.vic.gov.au and look for "Transfer of Land Forms" to download the "Guide: Transferring property between spouses or domestic partners".
It will give you the option for a non-monetary transfer under the quaint title "Natural love and affection".
Having gone through all that, it is a grey area whether you will save on CGT when you sell.
If you bought your home after 1985 and started using part of it to produce income for the first time after August 20, 1996, you are assumed to have bought the dwelling at its market value at the time.
However, CGT will not apply if the business was run through a company or trust. Also, you may be able to apply one or more of the small business CGT concessions to reduce your capital gain.
It's best to talk to a tax accountant, or seek a private ruling.
Regarding your recent comments on the Australian Taxation Office's treatment of foreign pensions, our tax accountant in WA was apparently not aware of the deductible amount you mentioned in your answer. My wife and I have both been receiving defined-benefit pensions for a number of years from our Canadian employers and also from the Canadian Pension Plan. We are citizens of both Australia and Canada, are non-tax residents in Australia and spend more than half the year in Canada. We may follow our children back to Australia in future. Would the deductible amount from the Canadian defined-benefit pensions be tax exempt? P.C.
As long as you are a non-tax resident, your Canadian pension is not taxable here.
Once you live here for 183-days of a financial year, whether continuously or with breaks, you would be considered a tax resident and your foreign pensions would be taxable.
Where tax is withheld in Canada, you can claim a foreign income tax offset, unless you are entitled to seek a refund there.
Your personal after-tax contributions to the pension fund form the Undeducted Purchase Price (UPP). That part of your annual pension, which represents a return to you of your UPP, known as the deductible amount, is untaxed and is calculated by dividing the UPP by your life expectancy factor at the start of the pension.
Should you move back to the much warmer Land of Oz, and want to claim a deductible amount, Google "ATO Request for a determination of the deductible amount of UPP of a foreign pension or annuity".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stocks in the news: RIL, YES Bank, Adani Ports,Cadila Healthcare, HUL and TechM</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 89.50 points or 0.97 per cent higher at 9,311.50 in early trade on Monday. But they were still trading far lower than Thursday's spot Nifty closing of 9,859.90. The domestic market was shut on Friday on account of Maharashtra Day.
Going into Monday's session, Dalal Street has to adjust with the depression that set in across global markets, as equities took a turn for the worst on the first trading day of May after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap new tariffs on China over the coronavirus crisis. Most Asian and European markets tanked on Friday.
That said, here are a few stocks which are likely to see some action in Monday’s trade:
Reliance Industries (RIL): Oil-to-telecom conglomerate RIL on Thursday missed street estimates and reported a 38.73 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 6,348 crore for the quarter ended March 31. Separately, Reliance Jio also announced plans to enter the video-conferencing space with its app Jio Meet.
YES Bank: The private lender said it has appointed Neeraj Dhawan as its chief risk officer with immediate effect. The board of directors, vide their resolution dated May 1, 2020, appointed Neeraj Dhawan as the chief risk officer of the bank for a period of three years, Yes Bank said in a regulatory filing.
Cadila Healthcare: Drug firm Zydus Cadila said it has received tentative nod from the US health regulator to market generic Empagliflozin and Metformin Hydrochloride tablets, used for management of type-2 diabetes, in the American market.

Liquor stocks: Cheers accompanying the reopening of liquor stores could be short-lived as companies said existing stock at distributors will be exhausted after the initial round of stockpiling and replenishment could take a month or so.
Kalpataru Power Transmission: The company said it has terminated the deal with CLP India to sell its transmission project ALP for not fulfilling certain conditions. The deal was inked in July last year.
Bank of Baroda: The MSME sector is a key priority area and Bank of Baroda (BoB) is taking various steps, including extending a Rs 2,300 crore worth financial support, to help the sector hit hard by the coronavirus-induced lockdown, the bank's Executive Director Vikramaditya Singh Khichi said.
Coal India: The company has shifted its focus to overburden removal -- the process of removing the top soil and rock to expose coal seams in its open cast mines --as the power sector, a major consumer of the dry fuel, has witnessed almost 30 per cent drop in fuel consumption amid the lockdown, a company official said.
ITC: Fast moving consumer goods major ITC has ramped up personal care production to meet the demand for sanitisers. The company which retails Savlon range of sanitisers, has stepped up production at the facility in Himachal Pradesh to produce an additional 1.25 lakh litres.
Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M): M&M reported 83 percent decline in total tractor sales at 4,772 units in April with lockdown impacting sales. The company had sold a total of 28,552 units in the same month last year.

Tech Mahindra: IT major Tech Mahindra posted a 29 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in consolidated profit at Rs 803.90 crore for the quarter ended March 31. Analysts in an ET NOW poll had projected the number at Rs 1,012.40 crore.
AU Small Finance Bank: The bank reported a 3 per cent increase in net profit to Rs 122 crore for the last quarter of 2019-20. The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 118 crore in the January-March period of 2018-19.
ICICI Lombard: The company reported a 23.8 per cent jump in net profit in the March quarter at Rs 282 crore on lower motor claims even as it suffered losses in stock markets which plunged 30 per cent in the quarter.
Mahindra Logistics: The company said its board has approved raising up to Rs 250 crore through various means, including loans and debt issuances. The borrowing will be done in one or more tranches, the company said in a regulatory filing.
GE Power India: The company said it has resumed production at its Durgapur plant in West Bengal. GE Power had suspended operations temporarily at its facilities located at Durgapur, West Bengal, and Noida, Uttar Pradesh, due to the lockdown imposed by the government in March to contain COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Economist sees Bangladesh as 9th strongest among emerging economies in coronavirus peril</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Economist has placed Bangladesh on the ninth position in terms of different indicators of financial strength among 66 emerging markets in peril over the coronavirus crisis.
China is just behind Bangladesh while Botswana has been placed first, according to the rankings published by the magazine on Saturday.
The others ahead of Bangladesh are Taiwan, South Korea, Peru, Russia, Philippines and Thailand.
The Economist has ranked the countries using four potential sources of peril. These include public debt, foreign debt, and borrowing costs.
It has also calculated their likely foreign payments this year and compare this with their foreign exchange reserves.
“The damage to exports will be acute. Thanks to low oil prices, Gulf oil exporters will suffer a current-account deficit of over 3% of GDP this year, the IMF reckons, compared with a 5.6% surplus last year,” the magazine said of the economic impacts of the pandemic.
When exports fall short of imports, countries typically bridge the gap by borrowing from abroad, it said.
To weather the crisis, emerging economies may need at least $2.5 trillion, the IMF reckons, from foreign sources or their own reserves.
One way to ensure countries have more hard currency is to stop taking it from them, The Economist said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Afterpay dismisses security fears after WeChat owner builds $300m stake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Afterpay chief executive Anthony Eisen has dismissed suggestions the emergence of the $800 billion owner of Chinese messaging app WeChat on its shareholder register could expose the buy now pay later platform to security risks.
The Australian payments juggernaut disclosed late on Friday that one of China's biggest companies, Tencent, had picked up a 5 per cent stake in the company for $300 million. Tencent owns the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat which has reportedly been banned by the Australian Defence Department due to security concerns.
But Mr Eisen said Afterpay was not concerned about security risks and more excited about the collaboration opportunities its new shareholder might bring to the table.
"There’s no board representation. It’s purely a financial investment," said Mr Eisen in an interview.
"So we’re not contemplating that relationship to be of a different form to that. And in terms of opportunities, as they arise, we’ll approach it in what you would typically expect to be the right governance formats of any publicly listed company," he said.
Tencent's investment into Afterpay comes after it last month launched a buy now, pay later platform of its own on WeChat, which has more than 1 billion monthly active users. But Mr Eisen said Afterpay would maintain its focus as a consumer finance provider. “We’re maintaining our consumer and retail focus it’s not about deviating from that for us,” he said.
Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar said Afterpay could learn from Tencent's global scale. “I think there's a combination of, 'how do we learn from people who have scaled globally and understand deeply the payments infrastructure at a global level'. And then just also what potential collaboration opportunities to give the most value to our retail partners,” said Mr Molnar.
Tencent spoke of developing a long term partnership with Afterpay.
"Afterpay's approach stands out to us not just for its attractive business model characteristics, but also because its service aligns so well with consumer trends we see developing globally in terms of Afterpay's customer centric, interest free approach as well as its integrated retail presence and ability to add significant value for its merchant base," Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell said in a statement to the ASX released on Friday.
"We look forward to a deep and long-term business partnership between Tencent and Afterpay," he added.
Tencent's substantial shareholder notice revealed that it started acquiring Afterpay shares in late March.
This was just after Afterpay shares hit a multi year low of $8.90 as market concerns grew about the company's ability to deal with its first ever economic downturn and potential bad debts if its customers were not able to pay their bills.
The fintech told investors last month that it could insulate its business model from high-risk clients and avoid any uptick in bad debts from cash-strapped customers.
Tencent paid just over $300 million for a five per cent stake in the buy now pay later provider. The stake is now worth $390 million.
Afterpay shares closed at $29.16 on Friday. The stock is flat so far in 2020, compared to a 22 per cent fall for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Private donors match crisis cash for artists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A crisis fund for artists has been set up with the aim of gifting $1000 to 1000 unemployed creatives across the nation.
Creative Partnerships Australia, a Commonwealth corporation that encourages a culture of private sector support for the arts, will provide seed money for the campaign, offering to match donations up until $110,000, potentially doubling the impact of donations.
CPA will also extend its offer to the National Association of the Visual Arts’ Artists’ Benevolent Fund that offers eligible artists a one-off payment of $2000 for immediate assistance following a disaster or catastrophic event such as COVID-19.
Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said the funding initiative from Creative Partnerships Australia would complement the federal government's existing 0support measures. CPA provides Australian government funding as co-matched contributions with private sector contributions to fund activities in the arts sector.
But artists continue to report loopholes in the JobSeeker and JobKeeper wage subsidy program.
Casuals and contractors working for state entities such as the Art Gallery of NSW, the Sydney Opera House, National Gallery of Victoria, and Melbourne Arts Centre are ineligible for the JobKeeper scheme due to a long-standing convention between state and federal governments, according to the Members Entertainment and Arts Alliance.
The 1000 X 1000 Crisis Cash for Artists aims to provide stop-gap support for those arts workers slipping through the JobKeeper or JobSeeker safety nets.
It is to be promoted through more than 40 arts organisations affiliated with Theatre Network Australia including Sydney Theatre Company, Belvoir, Force Majeure, Circus Oz, and Circa with the campaign to raise $1 million to provide grants of $1000 to 1000 independent artists in the performing arts who can demonstrate loss of income as a result of COVID-19.
Theatre Network Australia chair Jill Smith said CPA's matched funding would act as an incentive for more donors to come on board, knowing that a donation of $1000 would support two artists instead of one.
"The independent sector has been devastated by the shutdown of the arts due to COVID-19, and a small grant can pay for urgent materials, technology, or just pay a gas bill."
Creative Partnerships Australia chief executive officer Fiona Menzies said the offer to match funds acknowledged the adversity and isolation that artists felt and the impact of the temporary closure of venues and postponement of events were having on livelihoods.
Matched funding was a proven way to attract additional funds from the private sector to the arts, she said.
"It is our hope that this funding will assist to immediately respond to the critical situation facing Australia’s artists, and to help sustain our vibrant creative sector."
Casuals at the Sydney Opera House have been without shifts since the closure of its public spaces in mid-March. These workers were provided with six weeks of income maintenance support up until April 26 when wage-subsidy schemes came into full effect.
"We are calling on the federal government to work with the states on a solution so these hundreds of thousands of workers, also local government, are not left in the cold and forced to go onto social security," a Media and Entertainment Alliance Australia spokesperson said.
"The federal government could fix this by amending the eligibility criteria for JobKeeper, or the states could step into the breach to subsidise the income of public sector employees stood down because of coronavirus."
Art Gallery of NSW confirmed it was not eligible to apply for the JobKeeper payments.
"Our permanent, full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public," a gallery spokesperson said.
"During this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery."
The Opera House's chief executive officer, Louise Herron, said the venue was committed to supporting staff as much as possible.
No full-time, part-time or casual staff had been stood down as a result of the pandemic.
"All casual employees remain important members of the Opera House’s workforce and will be offered shifts when activity resumes," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BoB NPAs surge six-fold, Indian Bank sees four-times rise in 6 years: RTI</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Non-performing assets of Bank of Baroda soared more than six-fold to Rs 73,140 crore, while those of Indian Bank surged four-times to Rs 32,561.26 crore in six years, according to a Right to Information reply.
The NPAs of Bank of Baroda (BoB) rose from Rs 11,876 crore at March-end 2014 to Rs 73,140 crore at December-end 2019, the RTI reply showed.
The number of NPA accounts rose from 2,08,035 as of March 31, 2014, to 6,17,306 as of December 2019.
The NPAs of Indian Bank surged from Rs 8,068.05 crore as on March 31, 2014, to Rs 32,561.26 crore as on March 31, 2020.
The NPA accounts rose to 5,64,816 as on March 31, 2020, from 2,48,921 as on March 31, 2014, according to reply to Right to Information (RTI) queries on a number of NPA accounts and the total amount filed by Kota-based activist Sujeet Swami.

The RTI data also showed the state-run lenders earned a huge amount from SMS alert service fees, minimum balance charges, locker charges, debit-credit cards service charges, outward, inward, ledger follows charges, among others.
According to the reply, Bank of Baroda collected Rs 107.7 crore through SMS alert fee during April 1, 2018 to February 29, 2020. Indian Bank collected around Rs 21 crore through the SMS service fee during the same period.
Swami said, "My motive to file RTI was to unearth NPA amounts of two national banks between 2014 to 2020." He said he has sought same information from State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank but they are yet to provide the data.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Incredible hurlers, the best two I've ever come across to demand the ball when the pressure was on'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This article is a part of 2000: Revisited, a week-long series of features looking back on some of the headlines and the forgotten stories that filled the sports pages 20 years ago.
Here Pat Mulcahy tells Fintan O’Toole how All-Ireland glory, All-Stars, Munster triumphs and hurling styles were impacted by his club Newtownshandrum’s Cork title win in 2000.
**************
IN OCTOBER 2000 they experienced a Sunday evening homecoming like no other in their pocket of North Cork.
There had been hurling celebrations previously, there would be plenty momentous ones to come over the following decade.
But this was a landmark occasion in the village of Newtownshandrum.
The senior hurling summit in Cork had been reached for the first time that afternoon.
“I remember coming down the village on the open top bus and Jerry (O’Connor) was next to me,” recalls Pat Mulcahy.
“Jerry just said, ‘Look whatever happens after this, we won’t top this’. I remember him saying that and I’ll never forget it. That was as good as it gets.
“There were people from Duhallow, North Cork, loads of neutrals because we were the small club that came from nowhere. The support we had was phenomenal.”
The delight and hysteria at collecting their maiden senior hurling crown was cloaked in emotion.
Their victory that day in Páirc Uí Chaoimh over Erins Own had arrived a week after the game was originally set to be played.
On the Friday night Dan Mulcahy had passed away suddenly, the father of a trio of Newtown players in full-back Brendan, centre-back Pat and full-forward Donal.
The match was postponed but in trying circumstances, the focus was placed on hurling seven days later. The Mulcahy brothers all pitched in, Pat left with the man-of-the-match award and a three-point victory was fashioned.
A week later they had to turn around and face a Munster assignment, an onerous task heading to Waterford to face a Mount Sion team loaded with talent and aided by extra rest. Newtown fell short by a point but defeat did not diminish what they had achieved that season.
And it would prove to be the launchpad for a special era.
*************
First-time county champions face a question at some juncture when the celebrations have eventually been parked
After all the effort at reaching the top, will this be the pinnacle in the lifespan of their team or the start of a spell where they consistently enjoy elevated status?
For the Newtownshandrum hurling class of 2000, it ignited their charge. By the end of that decade they had added three more Cork titles. They turned that into a trio of Munster final victories, the most successful senior hurling club in the province in that time frame. The list of those they defeated is a roll call of heavyweight outfits – Adare, Ballygunner, Patrickswell, Thurles Sarsfields and Toomevara.
National acclaim arrived in the shape of their All-Ireland triumph in 2004 as they hit full speed in their display to sweep past Antrim’s Dunloy.
They were only foiled in the bid to retain that crown in 2006 at the final hurdle by a Portumna team inspired by a 17-year-old Joe Canning who struck 1-6 on a day of bone-chilling cold in Croke Park.
And there was wider recognition as well. Mulcahy and the O’Connor twins would land a combined haul of six All-Ireland medals that decade and match that with the same amount of All-Stars. Ben captained Cork as they lifted Liam MacCarthy in 2004, Jerry was Hurler of the Year a year later. Paul Morrissey, John Paul King and Cathal Naughton would also make the jump to the Cork senior ranks over the next while.
For a club not blessed with a plentiful pick, they reaped a rich dividend from those that they possessed.
In early 1996 Mulcahy was finding it tough to get a place on the Cork U21 panel. By the close of the season he had manned the centre-back berth to pick up a pair of county medals with divisional outfit Avondhu (senior) and Newtown (intermediate).
Those wins coupled with the knowledge that a gifted underage crop were charging up the ranks fuelled his hope for the club’s future.
“We knew going into 2000 that we weren’t bad, we weren’t far off it. Blackrock and Imokilly were very strong at the time, as it turned out we didn’t meet either one of them. We were young, almost carefree and it was building.
“The one thing that sticks in my head is that we played Ballyhea in an U21 North Cork final in ’96, my last year, I was captain. Ben was only 17 and we’d a quick chat on the pitch beforehand and I said, ‘Jesus I’ve never beaten Ballyhea in championship’.
“Ben just looked at me and said, ‘I’ve never lost to Ballyhea at any level ever’.
“He just had that confidence and I fed off it. The younger fellas genuinely believed they were going to win every match they went out and played.
“And if they weren’t winning it, it was just a matter of working harder to win it.”
Graft was only part of it, they needed a touch of stardust to triumph as well.
Twin brothers helped in that regard, their hurling telepathy and chemistry enabling them to dazzle on the club and county stages. More than anyone, Ben and Jerry O’Connor put Newtownshandrum on the national hurling map.
“I haven’t met anyone at any level in GAA, and I include players I played against, that are as good as they were coming down the tracks with five minutes to go to get on the ball, to look for a winner.
“Most players, myself included, when the game is in the melting pot, teams can panic a little bit and they shy away from the ball. Incredible hurlers, the best two I’ve ever come across to demand the ball when the pressure was on.
“They would look for the ball when the maximum pressure was on and that’s why we won so many games by a point. They were never afraid to lose it. Like Cork and Clare in 2005, the All-Ireland semi-final, Jerry getting that last point, they were just so brave. That set them apart from anybody else.”
Overseeing the club’s rise was a dominant figure with an unwavering belief in what they could achieve.
Newtownshandrum have enjoyed the input of experienced coaching figures over the years – Ger Cunningham from Limerick and current Cork football coach Cian O’Neill amongst them – but it was Bernie O’Connor, native of Meelin and father of the twins, that had the most transformative impact.
“Bernie used to say to us, ‘Lads, ye should be winning five seniors in your time’.
“And we laughed at him like. But that was Bernie’s dream. It wasn’t cocky or over confidence, it was just utter belief that these guys at their best could be as good as anyone.
“Bernie did drive it. He’s a very confident person and he’s a person that no matter what environment he’s in, he believes he deserves to be there. I can only speak personally, I would have probably lacked that confidence myself as a younger person.
“When you’re playing in a team with him, he can be very harsh but he’d absolute self-belief. He drilled that into us day and night. He changed the culture in the levels we played at. We were playing B grade underage and he put us up A straight away.”
Central to his legacy was the style of play he implemented.
The environment was different around 2000, the value placed on possession in hurling was lower. Newtownshandrum’s focus on movement, passing and support play was not always to the taste of those watching on.
“They drew a county U21 final in 1998 and he got hammered in the papers about the short passing style. It was just water off a duck’s back, didn’t bother him in the slightest. He’d absolute belief in what he was doing.
“We believed we were better than a lot of teams because we had a style that was ahead of its time in lots of ways.
“Even though I didn’t play it growing up, the first time Bernie came in and when I saw lads playing, it was just logical to me.
“What I loved about Bernie was that he always focused on what your strengths were and what your asset was.
“I always thought of it like this, if a long ball went in and it wasn’t won inside, everyone blames the full-forward for not winning it. If a handpass didn’t come off, no one blamed the guy who was executing the handpass, they blamed the style. So in the short ball game the style was blamed, in the long ball game it was the individual was blamed. That’s what Bernie used to always say to us.”
It worked in their favour and it reverberated around the country as the Cork senior side adopted those strong characteristics to help them regain elite status between 2003 and 2006.
Two decades on and those stylistic features in hurling teams are widespread.
The new normal.
“I’ve seen a couple of videos from back then and we were long ball in comparison to what teams are like now,” says Mulcahy.
“If you’re not getting your head up now and finding someone and coming off a shoulder, then you’re not playing hurling. We did that and we were ahead of our time but it’s completely evolved and every single county and club are doing it now.”
28.04.20 'I was told, 'You'll be going in now'. I nearly turned pale, I was thinking, 'Oh no Brendan, will you get up'15.04.20 Tipp's Michael Cahill: 'I took a ball into contact and my kneecap broke in two, it was so rare what happened' 09.04.20 Hurling challenges in business and coaching for Cork All-Ireland winner as Covid-19 crisis continues
Their gameplans were effective in securing results and that success was the catalyst for call-ups elsewhere. Those auditions were integral to Mulcahy’s subsequent progress in a Cork jersey.
“I’d an up and down time in the noughties with Cork but if your club was going well, you could always come back to your club and you’d feel comfortable there and good about it. You always felt like part of a family and that would get your confidence back.
“And because we were going reasonably well, we were always in the shop window. We were always playing high visible games, so it was easier to get yourself back into inter-county contention.”
Their time in the limelight featured some results that sparked regret but also gave them joyous journeys outside their local borders.
“We lost county final in 2002 and Blackrock were better than us, they were more mature, the better hurling side. 2004 we were coming off the back of an All-Ireland, that was tough to sustain it because we didn’t have a huge panel and the same in 2006 after that final.
“The one we were really frustrated with was probably 2007 (county final) because we had a really good side. We were complacent going into it and our mindsets weren’t right, all of us and Erins Own beat us on the day.
“The Munster championship games were real adventures for us. We felt they weren’t as tactical as the Cork championship because people didn’t know you as well. We could express ourselves a little bit more. Those were the games we enjoyed, the county championship ones were more pressure.
“Outside that then against O’Loughlin Gaels, two games in 2004, they were outstanding that time. They’d serious players. 2010, Ballyhale were probably that bit better than us but they only beat us by two points and we didn’t play well.
“We always felt if we’d got a chance off Portumna again, we’d have had a right cut off them because they beat us in 2006. They were phenomenal that time but we were really poor that day, I was shocking myself.
“But in general it was a brilliant decade and it was all set by that group of lads that came through.”
Back to where it all began.
That county final two decades ago. Mulcahy can still recall the slice of fortune when Erins Own looked to crucially hit the net late on in a game that transpired to be a major breakthrough.
“It was probably a goal. It was disallowed, there was a free out given. I think Tomas O’Leary got it, I didn’t think it was a free but I would have argued it wasn’t a free in the first place.
“I remember Jerry O’Connor went in centre-forward on Brian Corcoran with ten minutes to go and he picked off a few brilliant points. That settled it but it was a nervous finish alright.”
“It all started in 2000. It was that year that kicked it off for us in lots of ways.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s a case of the grapes of wrath.
Tech billionaire Sean Parker ponied up nearly $6 million for a Peter Paul Rubens painting called “A Satyr holding a Basket of Grapes and Quinces with a Nymph,” but the San Diego seller wants it back.
Parker, Facebook’s first president, won’t be “friending” Debra L. Turner anytime soon after the SoCal resident consigned the masterpiece to Christie’s auction house in Manhattan two years ago and then had a change of heart, court documents show.
Christie’s staged the April 2018 auction and Parker, whose net worth is $2.7 billion, won the bid on behalf of his non-profit foundation, court papers state. Turner, 62, claimed she had withdrawn the painting from auction before its sale, “even though the seller’s contract did not permit her to do so unilaterally,” court papers state.
Said a Christie’s spokesman: “A consignor sought to cancel a completed auction sale and following repeated attempts to settle the matter amicably, the matter was submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled that Christie’s complied with its contractual obligations and that the successful bidder had lawfully acquired the painting.”
Christie’s filed a petition in Manhattan Federal Court April 20 to affirm an arbitrator’s ruling that the foundation get the art piece — which remains in Christie’s possession — and Turner the proceeds.
Turner, who represented herself in the dispute, could not be reached for comment.
The San Francisco-based Parker Foundation was launched in June 2015 through a $600 million gift by the Internet entrepreneur and his wife, Alexandra, according to its website. The foundation “aggressively pursues large-scale systemic change in four focus areas: Life Sciences, Global Public Health, Civic Engagement and the Arts,” according to its website.
In a letter to the court Friday, the foundation noted it “promptly paid in full” for the painting on May 2, 2018, and had no knowledge that Turner “attempted to withdraw it from the auction.”
The foundation aims to “take possession of the painting it purchased in good faith more than two years ago and put it to charitable use,” according to the new court filing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA in Vegas: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sets scoring record with sky hook</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Editor’s note: The NBA planted its seeds in Las Vegas during the 1983-84 season and still has a growing relationship with the city. This is the second of a five-part series detailing the league’s history in Las Vegas.
It’s not a basketball shot. It’s a ballet move. That’s how veteran broadcaster Eddie Doucette, the man responsible for the term “sky hook,” describes it.
He won’t take any credit for it, though. That belongs to the player who mastered it, former Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who made a particularly noteworthy version of his signature shot inside the Thomas &Mack Center on April 5, 1984.
“He pushes off the left leg, right leg folded, left arm extended … right arm totally extended way at the top,” Doucette said. “Firm release. Beautiful follow-through.”
Even now, more than 36 years later, “It’s like everything is in slow motion,” he said.
Before a crowd of 18,389 on that particular Thursday night, Abdul-Jabbar used his sky hook against the Utah Jazz to surpass Wilt Chamberlain’s 31,419 points to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. He concluded his career with 38,387 points.
Perhaps no two of those points are more famous than those he scored in Las Vegas during the fourth quarter of the Lakers’ 128-115 victory.
He needed 21 points against Utah to eclipse Chamberlain’s unfathomable mark. He scored 22.
“We were all aware of it before the game that he could possibly break the record,” said former Jazz shooting guard Darrell Griffith. “He was going to do it against somebody.”
The Jazz hoped it wasn’t them.
Utah center Mark Eaton matched up with Abdul-Jabbar, and the Jazz’s guards abandoned their man to double the Lakers star whenever possible. But too often he caught the ball too close to the basket, where he operated with a precision that few in the sport’s history could match.
He scored 12 points in the first quarter and 16 in the first half, adding a hook shot in the third quarter to give him 18 points and a dunk in the fourth to equal Chamberlain. The sellout crowd buzzed with an anxious excitement as Abdul-Jabbar corralled a pass — and missed a sky hook on the right block.
But it need not wait much longer.
“A lot of times in sports, you don’t realize the significance of the moment. But this time, everybody realized the significance,” said Joe Hawk, the public-address announcer that night at the Thomas &Mack. “Really, you just got kind of tense and kept waiting.”
The Lakers secured a stop. On the ensuing possession, Abdul-Jabbar camped on the right block, pinning Eaton on his hip as Magic Johnson feathered a pass into the low post. Abdul-Jabbar dribbled once toward the lane as Jazz guard Rickey Green doubled from the weak side and pivoted back toward the baseline as he went into his familiar routine.
Push off his left leg, right leg folded, left arm extended, right arm totally extended way at the top. Firm release and, of course, the beautiful follow-through.
“You get to the point on anything that you do, if you’ve been doing it long enough, you understand what’s happening and everything becomes slow motion,” Doucette said. “And I saw this thing as I saw the first time that the sky hook reached full blossom in (1974), it became the same way again.”
Hawk was a longtime sports columnist and sports editor at the Review-Journal and has lived more than 40 years in Las Vegas. He considers that moment to be among the most memorable in the city’s sporting history, which includes several legendary title fights, a UNLV men’s basketball championship and a run to the Stanley Cup Final.
“For just the sheer anticipation, I think what that night meant and especially what it meant for one individual, I think it’d be the biggest one,” Hawk said. “This was a case where everybody showed up and they got exactly what they came for, which is a record set with an amazing, traditional shot by one of the most beloved players in the sport’s history.”
Abdul-Jabbar passed Chamberlain with 8:53 to play, prompting a stoppage, a joyous ovation and a congratulatory ceremony at center court. NBA commissioner David Stern was on hand in anticipation of the history-making event and praised Abdul-Jabbar as the “greatest.”
Abdul-Jabbar humbly thanked the crowd before checking out of the game for good having made 10 of his 14 shots.
Abdul-Jabbar’s manager, Deborah Morales, declined an interview request on his behalf, but others fondly remember the most iconic NBA moment in the city’s history.
Like Doucette, who called the game on USA Network’s national broadcast and to this day maintains a friendship with the 7-foot-2-inch icon. Or Marc Ratner, then a local statistician tasked with tallying rebounds during each of Utah’s 11 home games in Las Vegas during the 1983-84 season.
“It’s so amazing that of all the games that were scheduled, it ended up here,” said Ratner, who admitted that his lasting memory of the Jazz playing in Las Vegas was that “Kareem broke the scoring record here with an assist from Magic (Johnson).”
Doucette began his broadcasting career by calling Bucks games during their expansion season of 1968-69. He recalled the excitement generated by the then-Lew Alcindor when he was drafted as the No. 1 overall pick in 1969. Abdul-Jabbar was brilliant while leading the Bucks to their first NBA title in 1971 — the same year Doucette invented the term “sky hook.”
“The shot is a shot that will never be equaled in the game of basketball,” Doucette said. “You think of how many people have a jump shot, have various creative shots that are often duplicated, sometimes intimated and sometimes not. But no one has really been able to duplicate the sky hook.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">APC hits Atiku, says Obasanjo’s Administration was shortsighted on Economic Diversification</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
The ruling All Progressives Congress APC said it welcomes the suggestions of a former vice president, Atiku Abubakar on economic diversification, but took a swipe at him for not implementing those suggestions when he was in office and held sway as chairman of the National Council on Privatisation for eight years. APC in a statement on Saturday by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu also expressed shock that it took the former vice president 13 years after leaving office to know that the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo under which he served as second in command was shortsighted for its inability to “faithfully diversify the economy”.
The party said it was a bit surprised that the former Vice President failed to acknowledge the bold efforts the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has made in the last five years towards diversification of the economy and the many positive gains Nigeria has recorded. “Perhaps, it was an oversight. Or, could it be too inconvenient a truth to admit?”, The party queried.   “While we appreciate that Atiku Abubakar is keying into this administration’s policy direction regarding diversification, we are only worried that it took him 13 years after leaving office to realise that the Government under which he served as the Vice President was short-sighted for its failure to faithfully diversify the Nigerian economy.    “Not to be confused, Atiku Abubakar had eight years as a powerful Vice President and Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation with vantage opportunity to lead the country away from its dependence on oil. How Nigeria got worse even when international oil prices were stable and high are matters Atiku Abubakar may still need to address in future”, APC added.   The party is reeling out what it described as the successes of the current administration, said as far back as 2016, President Buhari launched the Anchor Borrowers Programme ABP, an intervention policy primarily aimed at giving farmers access to finance, which entails the provision of credit for financing the production of rice, wheat, ginger, maize and soybeans in many states of the federation. The statement added that; “This policy driven by the Central Bank of Nigeria is an initiative that has, in the last four years, provided hundreds of billions of naira for rice farming, cultivation and milling. Few years down the line, Nigeria is now rated the highest producer of rice in Africa, producing over seven million tonnes per annum.   “And just late last year, the APC-led government through the CBN has also made available huge funds to our cotton farmers, a move geared towards reviving our moribund textile factories thereby creating millions of direct and indirect jobs.   “Also, as part of the efforts of the President Buhari-led administration to boost agriculture is the massive successes recorded in the local production of fertiliser. This was one policy personally driven by the President and which has received applause from even his most virulent critics. This policy, which is built on a partnership between Nigeria and the Kingdom of Morocco, has led to the resuscitation of 11 blending plants producing about 1.3million tonnes of fertiliser, creation of over 50,000 direct and 150,000 indirect jobs, in addition to farmers having timely access to the product at an affordable price.   “The contributions of agriculture to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has consistently been on the increase and is being captured by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in the last four years.   “Most heart-warming is the fact that the private sector is keying into President Buhari’s agenda. An example is the Dangote Group’s ongoing test running of its $2billion fertiliser plant, which would make Nigeria meet all its domestic demand and also make our country a net exporter of fertiliser.   “So, we ask Alhaji Atiku Abubakar: if all these major achievements are not commendable efforts towards diversification of the economy, what are they?   “Atiku Abubakar said in his article that land border closure is an ‘insane’ policy. We believe that the former Vice President did not consider his position on this matter well enough as the facts leading to the closure of the border clearly justify the temporary closure. Perhaps, Atiku Abubakar is now at the pain that the trans-border security challenge our country was facing and from which he was making a huge political capital is now mostly curtailed. He should have realised the contradiction in his new propositions and the counterproductive business of smuggling of foreign goods into our country through our borders. How does the former Vice President expect Nigeria to be a productive economy if we continue to allow neighbouring countries to jeopardise our efforts to grow our own economy?    “Alhaji Atiku Abubakar may wish to know that the policy he has unfortunately chosen to label as ‘insane’  has led to a significant spike in rice production across the country, opening up of hundreds of rice mills, indigenous manufacturing firms are sourcing their raw materials locally, the boom in poultry farming, with Nigerians, now patronising locally made food items like never before and, in the process, boosting the income of farmers and local producers.   “It is heart-warming to know we are coping well as the Coronavirus pandemic and the resultant lockdowns are testing our country’s capacity to feed itself. We have been able to meet the pandemic induced surge in demand for foods only because the APC administration has been implementing policies targeted at expanding the capacity of our farmers and the other players in the allied industries. We ask Atiku Abubakar; where would we have gotten the farm produce for palliatives and feed our people during the lockdown if we had not taken the courageous route of looking inwards while curtailing sabotage from neighbouring economies?   “In the areas of plugging revenue leakages, curbing waste, diversifying and growing the economy, budgeting, borrowings, ease of doing business, support of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises SMEs, the President Muhammadu Buhari government is matching electoral promises with actions.   “Since the launch of the National Action Plan on Ease of Doing Business, being driven by the Presidential Enabling and Business Environment Council PEBEC, the APC government has aggressively implemented major reforms by reducing the challenges faced by the Minor, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises MSMEs in accessing credits, paying taxes, amongst others.    “According to industry reports, Nigeria startups attracted $122million out of the $493million in funding for African startup sector in 2019. In the latest World Bank ranking, Nigeria jumped 15 places from her previous 2019 spot and was also named amongst the 10 most improved economies in the world.   “In February this year, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, held a meeting with all federal agencies that are playing one role or the other in the MSMEs sector. At the meeting, the Bank of Industry (BoI) approved a $20 million Technology Fund for young innovators, while the CBN is offering an N90billion soft loan facility for small scale agricultural enterprises. All these and more are part of this administration’s drive at changing the nation’s decades of mono-economy status.   “In the fight against public sector corruption, the launch of the Open Treasury Portal (OTP) complements other initiatives such as the administration’s full implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) which has increased the level of accountability, transparency in financial resources of government and plugged leakages.   “Importantly, we no longer borrow money to pay salaries, but to build infrastructure, particularly roads, rails and airports. The era of phoney and abandoned contracts is in the past, contracts awarded are now strictly monitored to ensure full value for released contract sums.   “For instance, in the road, railway and aviation sectors, President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has recorded milestones that are visible to see and feel. While all the 36 states can boast of at least one major road project being undertaken by this government, there are also legacy projects, which include the Abuja to Kano expressway, Lagos to Ibadan expressway reconstruction, and the ongoing Second Niger Bridge.    “On the railway, this administration’s record is unmatched. It is to this government’s credit that the Abuja to Kaduna Standard Gauge rail line was completed in 2017, while the Itakpe to Warri railway, which had been abandoned since 1987 by successive administration has been completed and is due for commissioning. Even more commendable is the near completion of the Lagos to Ibadan Standard Gauge rail, construction of which started about three years ago.   “On aviation infrastructure, the APC government has, in the last two years, completed the upgrading of terminals at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja and Port Harcourt International Airport, while work has reached advanced stages on many terminals across the country.    “While we consolidate our rank as Africa’s biggest economy, aided by our re-emergent manufacturing sector, we continue to climb in the global ranking on the ease of doing business. Our investment and focus on agriculture where we have comparative advantage has been a huge success. We are beginning to look inward and grow our SMEs. We now have an army of entrepreneurs supported by the government and creating wealth and livelihoods.    “Finally, the APC welcomes Alhaji Atiku Abubakar’s concerns and the fact that he is beginning to make a good attempt at sounding like a statesman. Going forward, this is the least we expect from him, even as we hope that he will be more forthcoming in future, in appreciating and commending the positive steps, while offering suggestions on what more can be done.    “We, however, urge him to continue to do this without sounding overtly sanctimonious”, APC added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Summer festival virus cancellations deal blow to local Japan areas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO — The forced cancellation of major festivals and fireworks events this summer in Japan due to the coronavirus pandemic is frustrating for the host towns and cities that rely on the cultural and financial contribution they make to their local areas.
The pneumonia-causing virus has forced major events that were to be part of Kyoto's Gion Festival to cancel for the first time in 58 years, while the Nebuta Festival in Aomori was called off for the first time in 62 years. Kochi's Yosakoi Festival was also canceled for the first time in its 66-year history.
Ikujiro Kimura, head of the Gion Festival's organizing committee, explained the dilemma his organization faces.
He says people in Kyoto would like to hold the annual Yamahoko float procession as normal, but that the ancient capital cannot afford to run the risk of becoming a coronavirus group infection hot-spot.
The procession, often described as a "moving art gallery," is the highlight of the festival, which is said to date back to the year 869 when a ceremony was held to pray for driving off epidemics.
"It was the most gut-wrenching decision," Kimura said, in reference to the cancellation of the parade, which is held every July 17 and 24 and attracts tens of thousands of tourists each day from Japan and overseas. "Now is supposed to be the time when we should put on a big festival," he said, touching on the festival's origin in wishing for people's good health.
Ryuho Tatsuta, an Aomori resident who manufactures gigantic lantern floats featured in the Nebuta Festival, was similarly pained when the festival in northeastern Japan met the same fate.
"The festival is part of our lives," Tatsuta said. "I cannot imagine our lives without those scenes because people in Aomori say we feel autumn after the festival."
Held every year from Aug 2 to 7, the festival draws about 2.85 million people from Japan and abroad to watch floats, some measuring up to 5 meters in height, parade through the city of Aomori while surrounded by dancers.
Besides local disappointment, cancellations of annual summer events have dealt a blow to businesses involved such as manufacturers of fireworks.
The cancellation of fireworks for the Tenjin Festival in Osaka in July has caused a significant fall in revenue for Gunsmith of Kunitomo Co, a gunpowder manufacturer in Kyoto.
Before Osaka Temmangu Shrine announced the cancellation in mid-April, the company had started producing firework shells for the festival which draws around 1.3 million people every year.
"I know it cannot be helped (due to the coronavirus), but most of our annual revenue is generated in a few months of summer," said Masaki Ueno, a director at Gunsmith of Kunitomo.
Citing cancellation of fireworks for the Ise-Jingu National Dedicatory Fireworks Festival in July in Mie Prefecture, central Japan, and other firework events in Japan, Tomohiro Yamazaki, a director at a fireworks shell manufacturer in Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, said, "Our firework revenues have fallen to nearly zero."
Some of the firework shells will need to be disposed of because they are vulnerable to humidity and the amount of gunpowder a manufacturer can store is regulated by law, according to Yamazaki.
He said the impact of the coronavirus on business will be more significant than what the company suffered after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan and left about 16,000 people dead.
Further disappointment will be felt by residents of Tokyo and neighboring areas who normally attend the annual Sumida River Fireworks Festival in July. Canceled for 2020, the event usually draws around a million spectators to the river that runs through the east and north of the capital.
Referring to the cancellation of the Nebuta Festival, the Aomori prefectural government said it will have a significant impact on the prefecture's economy, most notably in the transport and tourism sectors.
"The number of tourists traveling exclusively for the festival will be zero, and the impact will be serious," said Kenichi Tsubo, a prefectural official for tourism affairs, citing the damage that transport companies, souvenir shops, restaurants and hotel operators will sustain.
Aomori Kokusai Hotel said reservations for its 67 rooms in the festival period have all been canceled.
"It is usually the peak period for our business. It has dealt us a severe blow," a hotel staffer said.

“It is usually the peak period for our business. It has dealt us a severe blow,” a hotel staffer said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IIT Hyderabad Partners With Hong Kong Financial Capital Firm To Create Venture Ecosystem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">International Business
Written By Pritesh Kamath | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 10:36 IST
The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad has planned to collaborate with a Hong Kong-based financial firm New Frontier Capital Management, to establish a global network for ventures as well as to create a venture ecosystem. The objective of the collaboration is to promote innovation, research and incubation. The firm has offices in Tokyo and Singapore as well. 
While giving details about the collaboration, Director of IIT Hyderabad, Prof BS Murty said, "IIT Hyderabad incessantly encourages the entrepreneurship ecosystem with its unique BTech minor in entrepreneurship and it's tech incubators like i-TIC and CfHE."

    <h5 class="mb-1">SXSW on Amazon—French electronica, Dark Web subcultures, and two great shorts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler took to the podium on March 6 and effectively prevented South by Southwest from happening with a new city health order, the longtime film and music festival simply became the first of what would be many COVID-19-related live-event cancellations. Given the late-breaking nature of this one—SXSW was scheduled to start the week after, on March 13—organizers suddenly had to scramble. And when it came to the film portion, SXSW officially settled on transitioning to an entirely digital experience.
Partnering with entities like Mailchimp (shorts-only) and Amazon (any film willing), any project selected for the festival was invited to become available digitally for a limited time so all that hard work could still find an audience this spring. The resulting Amazon initiative started this past week and runs through Wednesday, May 6, no Prime subscription required.
Ultimately... the selection feels a little lacking. Major studio films like Judd Apatow's The King of Staten Island declined in favor of forging their own path (that one will go straight to VOD this summer with a theatrical run out of the question), and smaller but compelling movies like the arcade-documentary Insert Coin have kept the rights to their debuts for now in the hopes that a festival season will still exist later in 2020 (since a good debut there can help facilitate lucrative distribution deals and theatrical runs if all goes according to plan). As more film festivals face this reality—Tribeca is already digital, Canada's Fantasia Festival just announced its intention to do the same—hopefully the industry warms up to the idea.
In total, the Amazon/SXSW initiative hosts only seven feature films out of the originally planned 125-titles-plus feature-film lineup. Even so, there are a few unique offerings (plus Amazon series' Tales from the Loop, which debuted in full shortly after it was supposed to originally screen at SXSW) worth queuing up for a weekend in these quaran-times. And we're only counting the stuff we've been able to watch so far: Shudder documentary series Cursed Films, about doomed horror productions, has gotten good buzz, and Selfie sounds like ideal satire for these Internet-times.
Le Choc du Futur, like any film focused on a fictional musician, has a big challenge right off the bat—the song this person or group will inevitably perform/write/release has to be good, or at least believably good within the film's world. (That Thing You Do would have simply crashed without the late Fountains of Wayne songwriter Adam Schlesinger penning the catchy title track, for instance.) Here, young composer/musician Ana (played by Alma Jodorowsky, granddaughter of the would-be Dune filmmaker) writes commercial jingles and does masseuse work on the side to make ends meet, but she really wants to be a full-time recording artist writing a brand of electronica not really popular at the time. Fortunately, her manager has gotten a local record producer to RSVP to Ana's next house party, so the young musician just needs to get her tape together quickly so she can get it in front of industry ears. A new, cutting-edge Roland CR-78 factors prominently.
Whether or not Ana's song succeeds, Le Choc du Futur does in this aspect—the film's central track (called "Future Shock") eventually sounds like "Chromatics or Electric Youth, lite," a laid-back, atmospheric synth song you might come across on a site like Gorilla vs. Bear. Just as important for this story, it feels totally believable as what an early, DIY electronic musician might gravitate toward, and the song particularly flows well from what we see of Ana's tastes and stylings. Her initial sonic doodles in the film kinda, sorta resemble S U R V I V E (of Stranger Things soundtrack fame), then a wise old French hipster friend who evidently does home vinyl delivery later introduces her to early electronic-y acts like Throbbing Gristle, Suicide, and The Human League. Together, these impulses push Ana to more melodic, pop-oriented synth compositions. The result is something you could hear at a house party or chic retail shop in 2019 (back when those experiences existed) or in 1970s Parisian apartments of the young and trendy.
As for the film at large, my partner walked in mid-way through and perhaps summed up Le Choc du Futur for a non-zero portion of Amazon/SXSW's potential audience: "This seems so pretentious." She didn't even hear director Marc Collin's plot description in the film intro, either ("A young woman invents a new way of doing music in Paris in the late 1970s. They'll call it electronic music 10 years later, but she has to convince people she saw the future"). The dialogue can be a bit over the top, though some of that may be lost in the transition; Ana's commercial jingle agent expresses his skepticism of electronic music as such: "I know what a stupid beatbox is for. You think it’s going to replace a live drummer? The sound? The energy? You believe there won't be studios anymore? Musicians? There's just gonna be this poor guy alone doing music in his home?" Scenes do tend to linger in silence or soft soundtracking often, and the film's overall pacing can be slow. Musicians creating doesn't make for really compelling action sequences, after all (montages include Ana in headphones looking at her synth while internalizing her melodic ideas). And if someone playing music for another person who is close by and staring as if they're a CBS Sunday Morning interviewer makes you uncomfortable, Le Choc du Futur is not for you.
But for me, a self-identified music nerd, things generally worked. Le Choc du Futur's aesthetic may ultimately be the point more so than its story, and I've found myself queuing up its soundtrack on Spotify more than once in the last few days. Think of it as one long, narrative electronic music video, perhaps, and choose whether or not to hit "Play" accordingly.
"Pepe and Wojak represent the dichotomy of man," begins Kantbot, a person on screen in TFW NO GF who is better known by his online handle. "Pepe is the troll, your public self trying to get under people's skin. But then we have our Wojak, who is depressed, can't fulfill his own goals, and has all these feelings he can't manage... This is what social media creates—the fragmentation of our personalities."
The documentary TFW NO GF is pitched as being about the Wojak meme, but really the film focuses on a handful of young people (here, all young white dudes) who have spent a large swath of their lives caught up in online communities like 4chan. Now, these individuals have left that behind and are trying to determine what's next. They have mostly moved from the Pepe stage to the Wojak stage, so to speak.
If you've seen documentaries about people who have been in any kind of destructive community—from gangs to cults to hate groups—TFW NO GF might broadly feel familiar. The documentary doesn't hide the kind of filth you can find on Dark Web-ish forums (the misogyny, racism, calls for violence, threatening "pranks," etc.), but it does ask you to sympathize with the individuals who end up in these spaces. They're not bad people, TFW NO GF seems to argue, but they're easily influenced and up against tremendously tricky societal forces (bad job market/economy, the predatory bad-actor groups leveraging digital media, etc.). Some of the film's participants even describe ballooning forum usage as a past addiction.
"What's making these young people the way they are, these young men, I can't put it into a sentence," says former 4chan user Kyle, who now struggles to find steady work in El Paso but genuinely wants to move his life forward. "It's not like anyone I know, but anyone who's lonely and angry like that... it's completely possible they'd do something."
Kyle's thoughts kind of fade there, but anyone queuing up this documentary likely knows what he's referring to with "something." Search for "4chan" in the Ars archives, and you'll find stories about ominous messages potentially linked to school shooters, images of extreme violence, and a slew of DDoS or doxing initiatives seemingly stemming from forum activity. "What the punks would do was have concerts, break shit, and have fights—people in this demographic have the digital world because maybe they can't do these things in the physical world," as Kantbot later puts it. And though TFW NO GF at times can make you empathize and sympathize with individuals caught up in this lifestyle—particularly participants like Kyle, who now appears determined not to go back but at a dead-end, or another man named Sean, who seemingly acts as a mentor for others trying to escape constant online-forum life—ultimately it remains so hard to overlook all the negativity associated with these kinds of online communities and disassociate all the people on the screen from it. This documentary will act as an intro and interesting glimpse at a particularly unique 2000s subculture, but it may not change how those of living as contemporaries understand or feel about it.
Honestly, the best use of would-be SXSW/Amazon viewers' time might be to focus on the shorts. To start, these are the creators who need eyeballs and may suffer the most from the lack of a 2020 festival circuit—shorts typically act as proof-of-concepts, they play at festivals because people who might be able to collaborate on or finance a larger project tend to attend, and the goal might be a future deal more than audience distribution. If that ecosystem gets wiped away, shorts aren't going to be saved by becoming VOD offers (see The Hunt, Emma, Trolls: World Tour) or by finding a second-life on a streaming platform down the line.
But more pertinent to any upcoming viewing this week, SXSW shorts might be the most interesting things available in this free screening initiative. Simply put, participating in a digital film festival is less risky for short films, so the best of the available shorts have signed up while the best of the available feature-length works skipped.
The best thing you can watch through this Amazon/SXSW partnership is actor/writer Ingrid Haas' Still Wylde. It centers on an underdiscussed real-world topic that is equally underrepresented in entertainment: lost pregnancies. But as heavy as that experience is, Still Wylde approaches the topic with humor and heart (kinda, sorta similar to how Juno tonally approached teen pregnancy). Haas' script has unexpected laughs side-by-side with emotional sequences you'll think about long after these 12 minutes even if no one you know or loved has gone through this. And even in this short form factor, the lead performances—Haas as the would-be mom, Barry Rothbart as her seemingly flimsy but ultimately supportive partner, and Juzo Yoshida as an endearing sales clerk—all demonstrate the kind of relatability necessary to pull off this tonal high-wire act happening against the backdrop of a very emotional, difficult subject. If karma exists in the film industry amid the destruction COVID-19 continues to unleash, Still Wylde will become a full-length feature in the next few years.
If you need something more bizarre and high-concept-y (another good use for the short film format, after all), Carlyn Hudson's Waffle would be the recommendation. This film has a premise that's equal parts Black Mirror and astute 2020 culture observation: a rich waffle heiress has utilized a friends-on-demand app to arrange a sleepover, and our central friend has to do whatever she can to not let her rating drop for fear of losing customers. The intellectual concepts here are all resonant and heady (Capitalism! Gig-workers! Performative relationships! Financial privilege!), but Waffle is more interested in leaning into the odd, precarious situations such a world could lead to. Everything plays out in a clever, darkly comedic manner that will have you glued till the end. Like Still Wylde, it's easy to imagine a fuller version here, too. Waffle could maybe become a solid B-horror from Blumhouse, but it'd be best as a single episode of some kind of near-future techno-warning series (like Black Mirror or Jordan Peele's Twilight Zone reboot).

    <h5 class="mb-1">ATF price slashed 23%, costs one-third of 'frozen' petrol, diesel rates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jet fuel (ATF) prices have been slashed by a steep 23 per cent in line with a slump in international oil prices and it now costs about one-third of petrol and diesel whose rates continue to be frozen for the 50th day on Sunday.
Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price has been cut by Rs 6,812.62 per kilolitre, or 23.2 per cent, to Rs 22,544.75 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification by state-owned oil marketing companies.
ATF, which is used as a fuel in aeroplanes, now costs less than one-third of the price of petrol used in cars and two-wheelers. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for Rs 69.59 while jet fuel is priced at Rs 22.54 per litre.
Diesel, used mostly in trucks, buses and tractors, is priced at Rs 62.29 per litre.
In fact, even market priced or non-subsidised kerosene is much cheaper than petrol and diesel after its rates were cut 13.3 per cent to Rs 39,678.47 per kl (Rs 39.67 per litre), according to the notification.
This the steepest cut ever and sixth reduction in ATF prices since February.

Since February, jet fuel prices have been cut by almost two-thirds. ATF price in Delhi before the reduction cycle began in February was Rs 64,323.76 per kl and now costs Rs 22,544.75 per kl.
Similar reduction has been effected in other metro cities as well.
While the oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF prices, they have since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets.
Petrol and diesel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on the two fuels by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates.
Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.
Market analysts, however, said the same volatility was witnessed in ATF prices as well but that has not stopped the oil companies from passing on the cut to airlines.
More importantly, no airline has been operating since mid-March in view of restrictions placed to check the spread of coronavirus, yet oil companies have continued to revise downward jet fuel prices.
In fact, oil companies used to revise ATF prices on the 1st of every month but they on March 21 adopted fortnightly revisions to pass on the benefit of falling international oil prices to the airlines.
Even non-PDS or market priced kerosene cost has seen rate reduction similar to ATF. It was priced at Rs 65,815.47 per kl in January.
Though the government had deregulated petrol and diesel prices, rate changes have been in the past put on hold by public sector oil companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for reasons that appear to be non-commercial.

There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of the Karnataka polls in May 2018 despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 a barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, they rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase -- over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018, petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38.
Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.
These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017, and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states -- Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur -- were held.
During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said. And rates began to rise a day after the final phase of polling for Lok Sabha elections ended.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATF, which is used as a fuel in aeroplanes, now costs less than one-third of the price of petrol used in cars and two-wheelers. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for Rs 69.59 while jet fuel is priced at Rs 22.54 per litre
Jet fuel (ATF) prices have been slashed by a steep 23 per cent in line with a slump in international oil prices and it now costs about one-third of petrol and diesel whose rates continue to be frozen for the 50th day on Sunday.Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price has been cut by Rs 6,812.62 per kilolitre, or 23.2 per cent, to Rs 22,544.75 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification by state-owned oil marketing companies.
ATF, which is used as a fuel in aeroplanes, now costs less than one-third of the price of petrol used in cars and two-wheelers. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for Rs 69.59 while jet fuel is priced at Rs 22.54 per litre.
Diesel, used mostly in trucks, buses and tractors, is priced at Rs 62.29 per litre.
In fact, even market priced or non-subsidised kerosene is much cheaper than petrol and diesel after its rates were cut 13.3 per cent to Rs 39,678.47 per kl (Rs 39.67 per litre), according to the notification.
This the steepest cut ever and sixth reduction in ATF prices since February.
Since February, jet fuel prices have been cut by almost two-thirds. ATF price in Delhi before the reduction cycle began in February was Rs 64,323.76 per kl and now costs Rs 22,544.75 per kl.
Similar reduction has been effected in other metro cities as well.
While the oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF prices, they have since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets.
Petrol and diesel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on the two fuels by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates.
Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.
Market analysts, however, said the same volatility was witnessed in ATF prices as well but that has not stopped the oil companies from passing on the cut to airlines.
More importantly, no airline has been operating since mid-March in view of restrictions placed to check the spread of coronavirus, yet oil companies have continued to revise downward jet fuel prices.
In fact, oil companies used to revise ATF prices on the 1st of every month but they on March 21 adopted fortnightly revisions to pass on the benefit of falling international oil prices to the airlines.
Even non-PDS or market priced kerosene cost has seen rate reduction similar to ATF. It was priced at Rs 65,815.47 per kl in January.
Though the government had deregulated petrol and diesel prices, rate changes have been in the past put on hold by public sector oil companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for reasons that appear to be non-commercial.
There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of the Karnataka polls in May 2018 despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 a barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, they rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase -- over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018, petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38.
Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.
These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017, and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states -- Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur -- were held.
During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said. And rates began to rise a day after the final phase of polling for Lok Sabha elections ended.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Consumers' focus shifts to packaged, high-value food items amid coronavirus lockdown 2.0</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The second phase of the coronavirus lockdown saw a considerable shift in buying patterns of consumers from basic necessities to high-value items like snacks, processed food, packaged meat and frozen desserts, retailers said.
Retailers such as Future Group, Metro and Lots Wholesale said they witnessed a spike in demand for packaged food products like biscuits and noodles, resulting in an increase in the average purchase value per customer.
People also sought critical non-food products such as kitchen appliances, electrical goods, stationery and storage containers at Metro.
"Yes, the second phase witnessed a growing demand for processed food, packaged meat and frozen desserts. People are working from home. Hence, snack items, biscuits and hot beverages are also in demand amongst customers," Metro Cash & Carry India MD and CEO Arvind Mediratta told PTI.
As the restrictions started easing, customers saw they could get easy access to their daily essentials and so panic buying stopped, he added.
"Initially, customers were unsure of what the trickle down effect of the lockdown would be. Consumers started becoming vigilant and began hoarding essential commodities. There was a sense of panic.
"But gradually, everyone was made aware that all essential products will continue to be available and people will not face a shortage. Currently, there is less panic buying and more need base buying," he said.
As most people are working from home, Metro is witnessing enquiries from customers for IT products such as computers, mouse, keyboard, chargers and other accessories.
Future Group President Food & FMCG Kamaldeep Singh said in the first phase people were buying basic necessary items such as atta, pulses and sugar, but in the second phase they focussed more on food items like biscuits, noodles and pasta.
"The definition of basic necessity has changed in couple of weeks from basic foods to snacking and munching items," he said.
According to Singh, people are not willing to travel long distances, hence footfall of large format stores is down but sales of convenience stores like EasyDay have picked up considerably.
Though people are not hoarding goods, they have cravings for snacks and other items as they are staying at home, he said.
"In the second stage, people are buying products which can be cooked at home like pasta, noodles etc. Sales of frozen non-veg and home snacking and processed food have gone up to a large extent, such as French fries, baked items and ready-to-cook meals," he said.
As restaurants are closed, people are cooking many dishes at home, Singh said, adding "the trend in the second phase has shifted from pure basic essentials to instant food and snacking items."
Lots Wholesale Solutions Managing Director Tanit Chearavanont said the demand in the second phase is majorly coming from both the "food and non-food FMCG categories" as compared to commodities which had seen a spike in the initial phase of lockdown. "Overall, the average purchase value per customer has gone up," he said.
"There is a marked difference between consumer behaviour between the first phase and the second phase of lockdown. The first phase of lockdown was fuelled by panic buy resulting in bulk purchase in categories like commodities and FMCG food products. Panic buying continued for an initial 7-10 days of lockdown, slowly giving way to consumer's confidence in the availability of essential goods," he said.
Also, with the summer season kicking in, another category seeing major demand is insecticides, Chearavanont added.
According to value fashion and lifestyle products retailer V-Mart Retail, now consumers are "trusting" their retailers and have faith that goods would remain available.
"Though, we are not operating many stores but have observed a shift in the consumer buying pattern in the second phase of lockdown. Earlier, we had noticed panic buying by the customer, purchasing whatever they can do but now people are assured about availability. That trust has come and now people are purchasing as per their requirement," said V-Mart Retail Chairman and MD Lalit Agarwal.
Meanwhile, several retailers have reported an increase in sales of their private labels, which filled the gaps as supply lines from other manufacturers were disrupted.
Asked whether the trend is likely to continue, Singh said consumers in the lockdown period are brand agnostics. "Right now the consumer is not very brand conscious, he simply wants products," he said.
According to Mediratta, due to the disruption in the supply chain, there were several FMCG companies that were not able to deliver their goods as their production was interrupted, leading to a shortage of branded goods such as instant noodles.
"However, customers were not bothered even if favorite brands were not available and were happy to transition to a private label brand. This gave a lot of boost to private labels whose stocks were available locally and so their supply remained steady without hindrances," he said.
The government first imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown on March 24 to curb the spread of coronavirus infections. On April 14, the lockdown was extended till May 3.
The government has further extended the lockdown till May 17, but with considerable relaxations based on zones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why you should hold on to Axis Bank till Covid-19 impact blows over</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid the Covid-19-caused disruption in businesses and the market mayhem, it has been a rough ride for investors so far in 2020.
With uncertainty persisting in corporate earnings, investors could face more pain ahead in the coming months.
Axis Bank’s commentary post its March quarter results is indicative of the challenging times ahead for the banking sector.
The management stated that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis and the financial impact could be high across sectors. Therefore, in a bid to be conservative and prudent, Axis Bank made large Covid-19-related provisions during the March quarter, which led to the bank reporting losses for the January-March period.
The key takeaway for investors from the bank’s March quarter results is that, aside from loan growth faltering in the coming months, stress is likely to build up, weighing on earnings.
The Covid-19-induced slowdown would delay the normalisation of the bank’s stressed book and could lead to further downgrades into the BB and below-rated book this fiscal.
On the positive side, the bank has significantly ramped up its provision cover and sported a healthy capital adequacy ratio, which can help it tide over the increased stress in the coming quarters.
At the current price, the stock is trading at 1.5 times price-to-book, much below the 2.7 times it traded a year ago. While the stock has lost about 41 per cent so far this year and is trading at attractive levels, near-term risks to earnings estimates persist, owing to slowdown in loan growth, lower fee income, higher slippages and provisioning in the coming quarters. Hence, investors can continue to hold the stock and wait for more clarity around the Covid-19 situation before accumulating the stock.

Based on an internal stress-testing exercise, the bank has made large provisions related to Covid-19 during the March quarter. From ₹3,471 crore in the December quarter, total provisions more than doubled to ₹7,730 crore in the March quarter. Of the ₹7,730 crore of provisions made, ₹1,338 crore pertains to standard assets, which include RBI-mandated 10 per cent provision on overdue loans where moratorium is granted. Another ₹2,116 crore of provisions include additional provision for Covid-19. In effect, Axis Bank made ₹3,000 crore provisions related to Covid-19 during the March quarter. This, along with additional ₹4,200 crore of bad loan provisions, resulted in the bank reporting a ₹1,388-crore loss during the March quarter.
However, the bank making huge provisions is a prudent move and will provide some buffer if credit quality across corporate firms worsens. The bank’s provision cover has increased substantially to 69 per cent in the March quarter from 60 per cent in the December quarter.
That said, provisioning could continue to move up in the coming quarters.
Much before the Covid-19 caused disruption, asset quality for Axis Bank had been under pressure, owing to its relatively high exposure to stressed sectors. Since the March 2019 quarter, slippages for the bank have been steadily rising. In the previous December quarter, slippages had spiked to ₹ 6,214 crore.
While in the latest March quarter slippages have fallen to ₹3,920 crore, in the absence of the moratorium, slippages could have been higher by ₹691 crore.
A better picture on the overall asset quality can be ascertained only after the three-month moratorium is lifted in June. As of March 2020, the bank’s GNPA ratio stood at 4.86 per cent.
A sizeable portion of loans falling under the moratorium and a notable stressed book (BB and below-rated book) warrant a close watch in the coming quarters. The management stated that as on April 25, 10-12 per cent of customers in number and 25-28 per cent of customers by value opted for moratorium.
During the March quarter, the bank’s BB and below book (fund-based) increased to ₹6,528 crore from ₹5,128 crore in the December quarter. Significant downgrades during the quarter include clients in the cement, medical services, automobiles and ancillaries sectors. The top four sectors (infrastructure construction, cement, power generation and distribution, hotels) comprise 61 per cent of the fund-based BB and below outstanding book.
The ongoing Covid-19 crisis could lead to significant downgrades in the stressed book in the coming months.
On the core performance front, Axis Bank has been delivering a healthy performance thus far.
As of March 2020, the loan book grew by 15 per cent y-oy, led by 24 per cent growth in retail.
Within the corporate book, the bank has been focussing on better-rated entities and short-term loans. The bank’s net interest income for the full year (FY20) grew by 16 per cent YoY.
Loan growth is most likely to moderate substantially in the coming quarter, as the full impact of Covid-19 is felt. This will impact earnings significantly, along with higher provisions.
Axis Bank’s strong capital position, healthy deposit flow and liquidity position lend comfort.
The bank’s total capital adequacy stood at 17.5 per cent as of March 2020, with tier 1 at 14.5 per cent. The bank’s liquidity coverage ratio stood at 120 per cent.
 
Unlike some of its peers in the private sector, Axis Bank has not seen a drawndown in its deposits, which is a positive.
In fact, deposits grew by 8 per cent q-o-q to ₹6.4-lakh crore in the March quarter.
Axis Bank announced its decision to acquire an additional 29 per cent stake in Max Life, the fourth-largest private life insurer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Expert pushes cloud technology for businesses amid pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Filipino  technology executive says cloud-based platforms can fill the gap for businesses that were affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic that resulted in major disruptions to their processes, transactions and networking. 
Kiu Philippines president Junie Pama says there will be a major shift on how enterprises will conduct transactions. Kiu Philippines is the local subsidiary of Hanoi, Vietnam-based technology company Kiu. In Vìetnamese, Kiu means bridge.
Pama says the  implementation of the community quarantine is a “global tipping point” as a way  of life and in  various  verticals/industries that changed  and  forced everyone   to  get  out of their  respective  comfort zones.  
"It  also  changed the way  we do  business.  I call this  the  'digital  shift'  which  practically  started in the  60s  when  the  computer  was invented," he says.
Pama says Kiu, in response to the current business challenges, has introduced the KIU Business Management Platform--a Cloud-based system of integrated applications to manage business and automate back office functions for customer relations management, sales, purchases, inventory management, manufacturing, human resource and accounting.
"Kiu's BMP is designed to simplify daily work, automate processes, transfer data continuously across departments and ensure data security. Your data is secure and controlled only by you," Pama says.
Through KIU's BMP, digitalizing the business  processes ensures that an enterprise can achieve  efficiency resulting in productivity and ultimately  profitability.
Pama says Kiu's BMP offers a number of benefits such as cost-efficiency.  As a subscription-based model, a user will only pay a minimum amount on a monthly basis to maintain the KIU services, he says.
It can also be deployed in less than a month from day one of engagement, compared to other platforms which will take months to implement and years for the service provider to integrate with existing system.
Pama says Kiu is scalable, which means that from 3 to 5 users, it can expand up to thousands of users depending on requirement and needs of the company.
The total cost of ownership is miniminimal as a user will only need a personal computer, a laptop, a tablet or even a smartphone. 
To protect against obsolescence, Pama said they will provide upgrades on a regular basis at no cost to subscriber. Moreover, it has  free automatic software updates as part of service to the subscriber.
He says connectivity is not a problem as long as a user  has the device and internet connectivity.
Pama says that being cloud-based, Kiu is apt for disaster recovery because it is not dependent  on traditional IT infrastructure. He says cloud-based  solutions ensure the  sustainability  of business with minimal cost impact to its  implementation.
Pama says using Kiu is as simple as “plug and play.”  
He says to ensure a smooth transition, to digital from manual processses, the business consultants will connect to the company for guidance to ensure businesses are on the right track.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Week Is Key For A Corrective Phase Of This Rally, Friday Stocks Go On Sale</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
I’ve been asked to explain my thesis one more time, so forgive the repetition.
The question was asked in a number of ways. Basically, why now? Why should the market react to the jobless number this past Thursday, and why do I think it reacts further this coming Thursday and going into Friday? Furthermore, if the stock market is a discounting mechanism, why hasn’t it already discounted the economic aftermath?
These are all good questions, and it makes me feel humble that my writing hasn’t been up to the task of laying this all out earlier. So let me try again. It is true that the stock market is a discounting engine, it is the greatest expert system there is, and its predictive value is beyond reproach, over a period of time. That means that it needs to process what is clear before it. The fact that this coronavirus is really a once in 100 years type of occurrence, both in the disease and how it ferociously singles out a small group, the old, the chronically ill with preexisting conditions, the otherwise out-of-shape individuals, and how society chose to deal with it, locking down the economy.
The approach was to deal with these two conditions serially. First, the illness. What is the extent of the threat, will it crush our civilization, and destroy humanity? Will our science and public policy find a way to defeat the virus? Slowly, there were signs that yes, we will survive, and that was the impetus to the April rally. Once it became sure that life as we know it will soon resume to some normalcy the next part of the conundrum needs to be assessed. To their credit, the Fed and Congress reacted with uncommon alacrity in enacting policy that will cushion the blow somewhat, and at first, that was enough for the market. Then as it momentarily elevated as we celebrated our continued existence as the dominant species on this blue marble. You may think I am joking, but if this virus was a tad bit more of a killer, we would be asking ourselves this existential question with poignancy.
In any case, the stock market was on its way before you even had to consider such a dire possibility. Still, we pretty much crashed down 37% in record time, and then floated up 60% from the bottom. So now, why does the market need to come in, hadn’t it assessed all the negative ramifications for the economic outcome? I would hold, that that is what we are now about to experience. First of all, the full toll of the lockdown has not been tallied as yet. The total jobless numbers might take us close to 40 million before we are done.
This week the toll will probably be 33 million jobless with next Thursday's update. So now we deal with the economic wreckage, not only jobless but so many businesses will sadly be washed away. The whole bankruptcy issue of small business all the tiny manufacturers, machine shops, dressmakers, retail shops, any and all sorts of small businesses, You have read my assertion that the hidden strength of this economy has been small businesses, and that “Main Street is doing better than Wall Street”. That sadly is no longer the case. When I say Wall Street, I mean the big corporations not the stockbrokers. The Targets (TGT), the Costcos (COST), the Walmarts (WMT), and all the big franchise restaurants and fast food joints, they will win, and the little guy will be crushed. I believe in the entrepreneurial spirit of America and as long as regulations are kept at bay, and taxes favor business formation, small business will come back. It will take time, and in that time the bear will be ascendant.
The bears will argue that it is impossible for the Fed and fiscal policy to account for that many jobless and business destruction that we will tip into a depression. Notice that I used the word depression, not a recession. The Fed is furiously creating money, and it has to because the destruction of the money supply is gargantuan. Helicopter money, a phrase coined by Bernanke from his famous analysis about what went wrong during the great depression; his solution was to dump money from helicopters to counteract the effects of the collapse of prices. We see it plainly with the price of gasoline, being under a dollar in some places in the U.S. I don’t want to get too histrionical, I just want to lay out the bear case for you, so you see that the market has not fully accounted for the downside. I am purposely overstating, but the argument can be made, and I am sure that some bears are happily going there.
Also, the question of whether the consumer is really ready to save the economy by getting out and spending. Will they venture out to the hair salon, the dentist, the mall without fear of the ‘rona? That is another question that the bears will have for us bulls.
Finally, on Friday we will be seeing such a big percentage of unemployment 15%, 16% maybe 19% unemployment for April. Such a huge change in gestalt from the historic 50 year low of 3.5% in February will get the tongues wagging. Mainstream media will use it as a cudgel politically and hurt trading too. Whether we sell on Wednesday, rally Thursday then sell on Friday is the question. Or do we rally on Monday because of short covering and then sell every day this week is another. The point is, this is a very big week for the bears. Will they roar, and then whimper as the market decides that 16% unemployed is no big deal? I think not. I think we test the lower bound of this trading range. I shared a chart with you on Friday so we’ll stick with those levels
I don’t think we will see 2930 again for several months...
All I know for sure is that at this point the S&P 500 has no business being above 2850 and even that's a stretch right now. Again, this does not mean that I am a bear. I am a total bull, it is just that the market is ahead of itself. I blame the algo traders that move this market around to levels, that no human would dare to. Or maybe we should thank them if we did take the initiative to generate the cash to prepare for just such an occurrence.
There is one thing I want to correct
There is talk that this crazy jump toward 3000 was quant-driven. That means the quants/algos/robots can drive the indexes right back down. That datum got me thinking that I wasn’t clear enough when I said this process will take 3 to 6 weeks to play out, and earlier in my writing I said that we will have a very sharp correction that it might scare you into not taking advantage of it. I still think this will be sharp but it will also be like the other sell-offs we have had over the last two years. We see very sharp dives and equally sharp rebounds. In fact didn’t we just have one like that? From late March into April... Patterns tend to repeat, and this will be another “v” reaction. I think we have a panic sell this Friday as a culmination of selling all week, then a bounce on the following Monday and another attempt lower the rest of the week of the 11th, then we slowly start the process of recovery after that. I think we go back to that sideways motion with a slight bias to the upside which will be great for trading again. The full recovery to a sideways trading pattern will take 3 to 6 weeks.
I have one caveat, I am not a prophet, I could be VERY wrong
Look this is trading, I set out an impossible task for myself trying to call short term market moves. Take what I say as my personal view. The fact that I called this move and it looks like it might happen could be a coincidence. It is impossible to consistently try to call market direction week-by-week and get it right. I hope that my writing, my conjectures about where the market is going is a help to you, that you take what I say, and use your own judgment. Even if you decide to always take the opposite side of the argument, I hope that by providing my thoughts you can create your own plans. I write to get my thoughts straight so that in the heat of trading I don’t forget the plan. Remember what Mike Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” I know I wrote this recently, but it is so apropos for trading right now. A lot of mouths will likely get punched this week, the key is how to react to it. So here is my final caveat, I have been anticipating this week for a whole month, I have been writing about this pretty much every article in April about this week. If what happens does not conform at the beginning of what I laid out, then don’t follow my suggestions.
I have been asking you to generate cash for the last few weeks. Now I am asking you to get ready to use it. Here is the plan
Look, so far I have just asked you to lighten up up your positions and take profits. You never get it wrong when you take profits. I further have been asking you to trim a few shares every day from positions, that is a very gradual way of building cash so that you still are creating alpha with the largest portion of your capital. Now comes the commitment part, when and how to reapply that capital to create new alpha. If I am wrong, then there is no need to hold on to your capital to Friday. On the other hand, I believe we will have panicked selling this Friday. That means that you should screw up your courage and go shopping on Friday. I would say take one or two trading positions in the last 15 to 30 minutes of trading on Friday when fear will be at its greatest level. Throw down some crazy low offers on the stocks you admire most. It almost doesn’t matter what they are. In fact, just put down some crazy low-ball offers on the QQQ or other tech-related ETF, Start 10% below the offer price 15 - 20 - 30 minutes before the close and slowly push it up every 30 seconds until you have your first tranche bought then bracket that level a bit below and a bit above that price. If you hit on the lower side keep adding at lower prices. I would start with just a few shares and get bigger as you go. Don’t use up all your cash, there might be a bit more selling the following week. With all this negativity let me end with this...
I am bullish on stocks, I am bullish on capitalism, and I am bullish on America
I believe in America and I am bullish on stocks. I believe that we get past this trying time, and small business will re-generate, the well-prepared businessperson who was frugal and wise will come out of this stronger than before. Even those who were less prepared but still intrepid and tries again will surely have a fantastic opportunity. Unfortunately, many business people will not have the resources to try again, leaving the field wide open for those who can. That is the nature of capitalism -- creative destruction, it isn’t neat, it isn’t pretty, and many utopians will aver that it isn’t fair. It is the best system we have, and I am glad for it.
Trades this week: This past Friday stock sold off sharply, and I while I have no idea what the futures are at the time of this writing. I suspect that we will have a bounce Monday morning. If we do and you don’t feel like you generated enough cash, please sell some shares tomorrow morning. Don’t go crazy and dump everything. If you have 10% cash, maybe get it to 13% to 15%, that will be enough if you save your powder for Friday. Next time please do this more gradually. If we do sell right from the start on Monday, don’t sell when everyone else is selling. This is a very bad habit that you need to break. Get in the habit of selling when everyone is buying. I know that sounds trite right now, but if you adopt my “cash management” discipline it is possible to eliminate the emotion from taking profits and losses. Keep your allocation of cash for the latter half of this week. Therefore I am not talking about any trades for Monday.
Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury pranked into James Corden ‘interview’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are among the latest stars to have fallen victim to prankster Josh Pieters. 
The couple were tricked into believing they had landed an interview on the Late Late Show with James Corden recently when actually, it was YouTube star Josh orchestrating the fake chat behind the scenes. 
Molly-Mae and Tommy, both 20, thought they were in communication with a producer who had booked them in for a spot on the US chat show via video link, due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, it was simply Josh and his crew using segments of an old interview James did with Julia Michaels and JP Saxe. 
In one of his lines, James says: ‘I don’t know if people know this but you are a couple? You’re dating.’ 
The reality stars nodded in unison – although slightly confused at the obvious line of questioning – as Tommy confirmed: ‘You can call it dating if you want, yeah. It might be a little bit past that but OK,’ referring to the fact they’ve lived together for months.’ 
James then ‘asked’ how the couple have been coping ‘sheltering’ together during the lockdown, to which Molly-Mae replied: ‘It’s been fine, he’s been working out a lot. I’ve been doing a lot of tidying.’ 
Boxer Tommy added: ‘I miss being punched in the face but what can you do?’ 
At one point, the so-called producers make out there’s a wifi issue between Tommy and Molly and James, prompting them to momentarily halt the interview before resuming. 
The talk show host then asks Tommy who he’d love to play in a movie to which the boxer chose Leonardo DiCaprio, while Molly-Mae opted for Margot Robbie so they could have a ‘Wolf of Wall Street moment’. 
‘Producer’ Josh then wrapped up the interview with an outro from James, bringing his prank to a close without suspicion.
Tommy and Molly shouldn’t feel too bad though as they aren’t the only stars who have been targeted in Josh’s three-day prank series – singer Craig David also made the cut. 
Earlier this year, Josh famously pranked Katie Hopkins into believing she had won a Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy award, even flying her out to Prague, but it was entirely fake.

Yet, this year, the COVID 19 crisis took away these revenues and left us with losses that will be very difficult to compensate,” Masihollah Safa, the head of Kish Hotel Owners Association, was quoted as saying by ILNA. According to the official, the overall financial loss caused to hotels across the country is estimated at 60 quadrillion rials ($375 million). “There are 50 hotels operating in Kish Island, all of which have been hit by the virus outbreak, following which all hotels in the country were closed down,” he said.  Kish is a 91-square-kilometer resort island in the Persian Gulf, off the southern coast of Iran. It is part of the Bandar Lengeh County in Hormozgan Province.  Owing to its free trade zone status, Kish Island is touted as a consumer's paradise, with numerous malls, tourist attractions and hotels.  Kish Island is the third most-visited vacation destination in Southwest Asia, after Dubai and Sharm el-Sheikh. Tourists from many foreign countries entering Kish Free Zone from legal ports are not required to obtain a visa prior to travel. The government has announced bailout to coronavirus-hit businesses, including loans with a 12% interest rate and the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Ministry has also put forward a rescue package for tourism businesses, which has yet to be finalized. Economic operators, however, believe although these bailouts are positive measures, they can’t resolve problems facing the industry.   “The bailouts don’t offer much of a cure, given the fact that the pandemic has brought tourism to a standstill for two months now,” Amir-Pouya Rafiei-Shad, the head of Tehran Province Tour and Travel Agencies Association, said.  “Last year was a bumpy ride for tourism industry: spring flooding events, November protests and Ukraine International Airlines plane crash. The outbreak of the coronavirus may be the last straw for the industry not only in Iran but in the whole world,” he said. Noting that the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Ministry has proposed delaying value added taxation to support the industry, he said no work has been done over the past couple of months because all travel agencies were closed.  “The government needs to offer tax exemption to tourism industry for the fiscal 2019-20 and 2020-21, and lend some support by providing social welfare to employees of this sector. All governments produce to reduce the unemployment rate, so the financial support could help save jobs and prevent the bankruptcy of travel agencies,” he said.  Rafiei-Shad put the number of travel agencies in Tehran at 20,000 and said considering that each of them has 10 people on their payrolls and each employer is the head of a four-member household on average, they provide livelihood for 80,000 people only in the capital city.  “No one accepts the responsibility for the unemployment of tour guides,” Mahdiyeh Jahangir, a tour guide, told the Persian-language daily Iran. “There are 10,000 tour guides in Iran and as they don’t have an employer, they usually don’t hold insurance and consequently can’t receive unemployment benefits at this time. We only have a tour guide ID card and nothing more.” Hamzehzadeh said the government bailout for tourism businesses is 120 million rials ($750) for each employee, which must be repaid over two years with a 12% interest rate.  “This sum is only sufficient to pay financial compensation for two months of an employee’s services. The government needs to offer loans at low interest rates like 5% instead of 12% to tourism industry and consider a five-year period for the repayment of the loans with a one-year moratorium,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">While you were isolating, scientists were working on a hangover cure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’ve been hitting the bottle a little harder than usual during lockdown, you’ve probably devoted some of your new-found free time to looking for a hangover cure. And the chances are, you’ve felt rubbish all day regardless of your findings.
But now scientists believe that certain plant extracts may help to relieve throbbing heads and nausea.
A new study on hangovers has concluded that feeling rough the day after the night before may not actually be down to a loss of electrolytes as previously thought. That means no amount of Barocca or Lucozade is going to save you after eight hours of tequila.
Researchers at the British Medical Journal split 214 healthy adults into three groups and gave them a flavoured, water-soluble supplement 34 minutes before and immediately after giving them beer, white wine or a white wine spritzer.
The first group were given a supplement contianing plant extracts, vitamins and minerals and antioxident compounds. The second group had a supplemt withtout the plant extracts and the third group were given a glucose placebo.
The complete supplement included plant extracts like Barbados cherry, prickly pear, ginkgo bilboa, willow and ginger root, as well as vitamins and minerals like magnesium, potassium, sodium bicarbonate, zinc, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid.
Blood and urine samples were taken and measured, before the same samples were taken again 12 hours later. Participants were also asked to fill in questionnaires about their hangover symptoms.
On the whole, people who took the plant extracts and vitamin supplements experienced significantly less severe symptoms than the group who had the placebo supplement or the supplement which didn’t have the plant extract – suggesting that the plants were the key.
The average headache was 35% less instense, nausea was 42% less overwhelming and restlessness was down by 41%.
The fact that vitamins and minerals alone didn’t seem to have a big impact suggests that perhaps hangovers aren’t caused by a drop in electrolytes and minerals.
You can buy lots of plant extracts online but given that the supplement industry is notoriously under-regulated, it’s fair to say that what you buy may bear very little resemblance to what was consumed under test conditions.
Let’s hope this research cracks on and they find a definitive cure once and for all.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc has sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting.
The conglomerate held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines and about 9% stakes in both United Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co at the end of 2019, according to its annual report.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sales.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up…. It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Buffett added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FICCI seeks infrastructure status for lockdown-hit steel sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Industry body Ficci has suggested various measures like infrastructure status to the steel industry, zero duty on critical raw materials, and another three-month moratorium to revive the sector, which has been impacted by the lockdown.
COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent nationwide lockdown have affected the demand and production of steel, as well as resulted in the rise of inventory levels, it said, adding the policy interventions would help the industry to revive and help generate employment opportunities.
In its suggestions to the government, Ficci said: "It recommends for an extension of additional three months moratorium granted on payment of interest and repayment of loans without any penal interest and interest free financing/at nominal rates for MSMEs in the sector to revive".
Granting infrastructure status to the steel industry, it said, will give access to finance at competitive rates from various markets and sources.
Besides, the entire supply chain of the sector should be incorporated into essential services, and be allowed to operate with precautionary measures as per the guidelines of the government.
The industry body also suggested zero import duty on critical raw materials for steel making.
The move will help players to reduce input cost and sustain in the market.
Fast tracking operationalisation of all steel consuming industries should be accorded the highest priority, the body said, adding new areas of applications for steel products like in furniture, setting railway infrastructure etc must be explored to further enhance the demand.
"To further reduce financial burden on the sector, Ficci recommends for deferment of royalty, DMF (District Mineral Fund) and NMET (National Mineral Exploration Trust) by 6 months till the economic situation stabilises and subsuming of all levies like royalty, DMF, NMET etc. into one tax like GST," the industry body said.
Other suggestions included to subsidise railway freight by additional 15 per cent for next six months, waiving off charges like container detention and demurrage charges, ground rent by custodians till end of May 2020 to reduce the financial burden on the industry, priority in rake allocation for transportation of raw material and steel products for next 6 months.
It also said that all statutory clearances like mineral license, environment clearance, and consent to operate etc, that are pending for renewals, should be deemed granted for at least one year, in view of the nationwide lockdown.
It has requested the government to facilitate the movement of migrant workers from their native places to plants by providing special sanitised wagons and financial support to the workers for commuting.
The body also raised concerns that India could see a surge in imports post lockdown as many countries would try to dump in their products into local market.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During the probe, it was found that these entities were connected and indulged in manipulating the price of the scrip downwards through a complex web of accumulating and distributing shares in the off-market
Sebi has imposed a total penalty of Rs 1.05 crore on 21 entities for executing fraudulent trading in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd.
The regulator had conducted an investigation in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd between February 2012 and November 2014.
During the probe, it was found that these entities were connected and indulged in manipulating the price of the scrip downwards through a complex web of accumulating and distributing shares in the off-market.
Thereafter, executing market transactions among themselves at lower circuit filters price to bring down the price to facilitate certain entities to acquire shares at a lower price for various manipulative purposes.
Besides, they contributed to negative LTP (last trading price) by executing trades at lower circuit price every day.
The entities by trading amongst themselves below the LTP in the scrip manipulated and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by such trade, the regulator noted.
Hence, the entities by indulging in fraudulent trade practices have violated the provisions of the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations.
The regulator has levied a fine of Rs 5 lakh each on 21 entities -- Aavia Buildtech, Aavia Softech, Accurate Buildwell, Aglow Financial Services, Anchal Goel, Ashok Kumar Jain HUF, Ashvin Verma, Bluechip Fincap Serve, Capital Securities, Century Buildmart, Lalit Mohan Gupta, Laxmikant Gaggar, Kanchan Bastimal Jain, Mould Trading, Ocean Share Brokers, Poonam Mittal, Ram Kumar Goyal, Steady Capital Advisory Services, Sure Portfolio Services, Surya Medi Tech, and Usha Jaiswal.
In a separate order, Sebi has imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on Sapna Dilip Bombaywala for fraudulent trading in the matter of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd (JPIL).
Separately, the regulator has imposed a penalty totalling Rs 15 lakh on auditor M V Damania & Co (currently known as DNV & Co) and its partner Bharat Jain for wrongly certifying that Paramount Printpackaging utilised the IPO proceeds as per the objects of the issue.
They indulged in fraudulent trade practice by publishing such information that is not true and indulged in misleading advertisement as well as planted misleading news.
By doing so, they have violated the provisions of PFUTP norms.
Also, in another separate order, the regulator has levied a fine of Rs 5 lakh on Shashikant Keshavlal Shah for fraudulent trading in the matter of Well Pack Papers & Containers Ltd.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Westpac has deferred its dividend after revealing a massive 70% slump in profit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac Banking Corporation has revealed a massive 70 per cent slump in first half cash profit of $993 million and elected to defer the dividend until greater clarity is known about the economic impact of COVID-19 on bad debts.
Westpac chief executive Peter King sheeted the hit to profits back to the likely cost of settling the AUSTRAC matter, its ongoing response to recommendations from the Hayne royal commission and growing projections of the cost of the virus crisis.
“This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years. It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision,” Mr King said in a statement.
The bank stressed that its capital position remained sound following its decision to raise $2.8 billion in December last year but said it felt it was prudent not to make a distribution at this time.
“The board has deferred the decision on determining an interim dividend and no dividend will be paid in June 2020. This was a difficult decision given many retail shareholders rely on
The bank said it had been in constant dialogue with the regulator over stress testing scenarios and it had not expressed any concern about its position. The bank said it would revisit the dividend decision at some point over the year.
“Westpac remains well provisioned and capitalised. Nevertheless, the board recognises the uncertain economic and operating conditions and how these may develop over the next six months.
Westpac has also flagged the sale of several wealth assets including its superannuation and insurance operations and wealth platforms. It has created a new “specialist businesses division”, which will be led by Jason Yetton, a former head of retail banking at Westpac who returns from Commonwealth Bank.
Mr Yetton will lead a strategic review of Westpac’s sub-scale operations across superannuation, wealth platforms, investments, insurance, auto finance and the Pacific.
Mr King said “over the coming months we will conduct a detailed strategic review on the best options for these businesses.
This will include considering whether they would ultimately be more successful under different ownership.
Expectations of shareholders had been softened up in recent weeks with the bank announcing $1.4 billion in provisions including setting aside $900 million for the AUSTRAC matter and a further $2.2 billion for bad and doubtful debts with $1.6 billion set aside for COVID-19.
Before the resumption of trade on Monday morning, Westpac shares were down 49 per cent to $15.34 from their 52 week high of $30.05 reached in September last year.
Shares in the bank have been sold off heavily in the wake of the AUSTRAC money laundering scandal that saw CEO Brian Hartzer step down and brought forward the retirement of chairman Lindsay Maxsted.
The decision to pay no dividend follows a directive from the prudential regulator for banks to materially reduce or defer a decision on making distributions until the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is better known.
Last week NAB slashed its dividend to 30¢ from 83¢ while ANZ said it would defer the decision entirely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Westpac profit slumps 70pc, defers dividend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac Banking Corp has revealed a massive 70 per cent slump in first half cash profit to $993 million and elected to defer the dividend until there's greater clarity on the impact that COVID-19 will have on bad debts.
The bank has also chosen to bring forward a decision about the bank's involvement in the beleaguered wealth management sector by putting its remaining assets in a separate division as it considers exiting the sector entirely. Westpac shares fell a modest 1 per cent at the open before recovering by midday to trade 1.6 per cent higher.
Westpac chief executive Peter King sheeted the hit to profits back to the likely cost of settling the AUSTRAC matter, its ongoing response to recommendations from the Hayne royal commission and growing projections of the cost of the virus crisis.
“This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years," Mr King said in a statement. "It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision."
The sharp downturn in the business was reflected in the banks return on equity down to 2.9 per cent from 10.4 per cent in the first half of 2019. The bank said its capital position remained sound following its decision to raise $2.8 billion in December 2019 but said it felt it was prudent not to make a distribution in June after paying investors 93c a share this time last year.
"This was a difficult decision given many retail shareholders rely on Westpac dividends," the bank said. The board had "accepted APRA’s consistent guidance on dividends and being prudent at this point in time".
UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said the result was better than expected with much of the bad news including the multibillion-dollar provisioning already known and applauded the bank for flagging its intention to exit remaining wealth assets.
"Establishment of the specialist business division (wealth management, life, auto finance, general insurance and Pacific) with strategic review to assess "appropriate ownership" is a positive, in our view, given these businesses utilised $4 billion of regulatory capital," Mr Mott said in a flash note for clients.
Good news however was in short supply in the result in which the bank’s four main divisions revealed falls in cash earnings of between 18 per cent and 63 per cent.
Consumer banking fell 18 per cent compared with the previous half on the impact of the bushfires, severe weather events and higher impairment charges.
Cash earnings at the business bank fell 46 per cent as it took an early hit from the likely fallout of the COVID-19 virus crisis.
Earnings at the institutional bank were off a whopping 63 per cent on the previous corresponding half for similar reasons while earnings in New Zealand were off 39 per cent.
The net interest margin at the bank – a key metric which shows the gap between its cost of funds and the price it charges its customers – was a rare bright spot up 1 basis point to 2.13 per cent however CFO Gary Thursby cautioned investors from seeing much improvement in the margin over the next half.
The bank said it had been in constant dialogue with the regulator over stress testing scenarios and it had not expressed any concern about its position. It will revisit the dividend decision at some point over the year; this time last year, Westpac paid an interim dividend of 94 cents per share before cutting it to 80c a share in the second half.
The decision to defer the dividend was an historic one; even during the depths of the recession in 1992, when Westpac almost collapsed, it still paid a small dividend to shareholders.
Westpac's common equity tier 1 (CET1) remained at 10.8 per cent following last year's capital raising.
"Westpac remains well provisioned and capitalised. Nevertheless, the board recognises the uncertain economic and operating conditions and how these may develop over the next six months."
Westpac has also flagged the sale of its remaining wealth assets including its superannuation and insurance operations and wealth platforms. It has created a new “specialist businesses division”, which will be led by Jason Yetton, a former head of retail banking at Westpac who returns from Commonwealth Bank after CBA abandoned plans for a wealth spin-off.
Mr Yetton will lead a strategic review of Westpac’s sub-scale operations across superannuation, wealth platforms, investments, insurance, auto finance and the Pacific. Mr King said “over the coming months we will conduct a detailed strategic review on the best options for these businesses".
"This will include considering whether they would ultimately be more successful under different ownership," he added.
Westpac has already made an effort to reduce its exposure to businesses adjacent to its core banking operations after selling the majority of its financial advice network to Viridian in March 2019 for a song.
The bank pointed to “early signs of stress” in its lending books. While loans put into deferral are not treated as being impaired under after an APRA directive, Westpac said the number of mortgages more than 90 days overdue were up 5 basis points over the half while those more than 30 days overdue were 23 basis points higher. Other consumer 90+ day delinquencies were also higher, up 25 basis points over the half.
"The full impact of COVID-19 is expected to emerge in future periods," the bank said.
Shareholders had been softened up in recent weeks with the bank announcing $1.4 billion in provisions including setting aside $900 million for the AUSTRAC matter and a further $2.2 billion for bad and doubtful debts with $1.6 billion set aside for COVID-19. Overall provisions for expected credit losses now sit at $5.8 billion.
Like ANZ and National Australia Bank last week, Westpac flagged considerable interest among its customers for deferring loans due to COVID-19. It said 105,000 Australian mortgage accounts had been put on hold, with a loan value of $39 billion, and in addition loan repayments had been deferred across 31,000 Australian business loans with a value of $8.2 billion.
On the macro-economy, it said as a base case, it expects the unemployment rate to peak at 9 per cent in June and drop to around 7 per cent by the end of the year.
House prices could fall by 15 per cent in 2020 and a further 5 per cent in 2021.
The bank is expecting a 5 per cent contraction in GDP in 2020 and credit growth in 2020 to be just 0.3 per cent. But in 2021, GDP is forecast to rise by 4 per cent.
Shares in the bank were been sold off heavily in the wake of the AUSTRAC money laundering scandal that saw CEO Brian Hartzer step down and brought forward the retirement of chairman Lindsay Maxsted.
The decision to pay no dividend follows a directive from the prudential regulator for banks to materially reduce or defer a decision on making distributions until the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is better known.
Last week NAB slashed its dividend to 30¢ from 83¢ while ANZ said it would defer the decision entirely and would make a decision possibly as late as August.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Protests see sale of .org suffix to investment firm shelved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The proposed 1.1 billion dollar (£880 million) sale of the dot-org online registry to an investment firm has been shelved following widespread opposition.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) board voted not to allow the sale to Ethos Capital of the website suffix that is widely used by non-profits and community groups.
Activists, politicians and hundreds of organisations had protested that costs for non-profits would rise and freedom of expression would be at risk if a for-profit company were in charge of dot-org, one of the original domains created in the 1980s.
Vetoing the sale is “reasonable, and the right thing to do,” said ICANN’s chairman Maarten Botterman in a blog post.
Mr Botterman noted the “fundamental public interest nature” of the organisation that currently oversees dot-org which wold have been transferred to one “bound to serve the interests of its corporate stakeholders” had the sale gone through.
He also expressed concern over what the debt involved in the transaction would mean for those dot-org users, which include public radio broadcaster NPR, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and medical humanitarian group Doctors without Borders.
Ethos Capital and the Internet Society, the nonprofit founded by many of the internet’s early engineers and scientists that currently runs the registry, had said concerns were misplaced.
The investment firm said in a statement that the decision “will suffocate innovation and deter future investment in the domain industry” and that it is evaluating its options.
The Internet Society said it is disappointed “that ICANN has acted as a regulatory body it was never meant to be”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sale of internet's dot-org suffix nixed after protests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — After widespread opposition, the organization overseeing internet domain names has voted against the $1.1 billion sale of the dot-org online registry to an investment firm.
The board of the Los Angeles-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers voted not to allow the sale to Ethos Capital of the website suffix that is widely used by non-profits and community groups.
Activists, politicians and hundreds of organizations had protested that costs for non-profits would rise and freedom of expression would be at risk if a for-profit company were in charge of dot-org, one of the original domains created in the mid-1980s.
Vetoing the sale is “reasonable, and the right thing to do,” said ICANN's chair, Maarten Botterman, in a blog post .
Botterman noted the “fundamental public interest nature” of the organization that currently oversees dot-org. That would have been transferred to one “bound to serve the interests of its corporate stakeholders” had the sale gone through, he said.
He also expressed concern over what the debt involved in the transaction would mean for those dot-org users, which include public radio broadcaster NPR, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and medical humanitarian group Doctors without Borders.
Ethos Capital and the Internet Society, the nonprofit founded by many of the internet’s early engineers and scientists that currently runs the registry, had said concerns were misplaced. Ethos had offered concessions including capping price hikes.
The investment firm said in a statement that the decision “will suffocate innovation and deter future investment in the domain industry” and that it is evaluating its options. The Internet Society said it is disappointed “that ICANN has acted as a regulatory body it was never meant to be.”
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which had campaigned against the sale, said ICANN's decision was a “stunning victory for nonprofits and NGOs around the world working in the public interest.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While carrying Friday’s losses forward, USD/JPY drops to 106.84 amid the early Monday morning in Asia. Even if the US dollar registered gains again major counterparts amid risk-off, mainly due to the US-China tension, the greenback seems to step back against the Japanese yen’s safe-haven allure.
Read: What you need to know as markets open: Pompeo and Trump ratcheted up US and China tensions
While the global markets are still struggling to find a cure for the coronavirus (COVID) pandemic, the US-China tension adds a burden to the risk-tone.
The US diplomats said to, as per the AP, rely on the Intelligence reports to allege China for intentional mishandling of the virus outbreak.
Although Chinese dailies tried to turn down the allegations on Friday, there hasn’t been any update so far, which in turn makes the world doubt the dragon nation’s role in the virus outbreak.
The US has already warned to use harsh tariffs and the global economies might also dislike the Asian major if the nation becomes guilty. Though, until the final decision, which might never arrive, the war of words between the world’s two largest economies can keep weighing on the global risk-tone sentiment.
The tussle becomes severe especially when the macro markets are yet to find a footing off the virus-less losses.
On the contrary, news that the Gilead’s Remdesivir will be available to the virus patients this week should be considered for the risks.
However, market players seem to pay more attention to the trade stories and the rejuvenation of the US-China tussle, which in turn could keep the risks heavy.
Hence, any more deterioration of the US-China trade relations, which is more likely, could keep weighing on the market’s trading sentiment amid a lack of major data/events as well as off in Japan.
Friday’s Bearish ‘Spinning Top’ candlestick on the daily chart seems to keep the pair below the monthly resistance line, currently near 107.45/50. As a result, bears targeting March 10 top near 105.90 remain hopeful.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gold Road: A Soft Start To FY-2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
It's been a mixed start to the Q1 earnings season for the Gold Miners Index (GDX) given that we've seen barely one-third of the sector maintain guidance, and more than two-thirds cutting their FY-2020 outlook due to COVID-19 related uncertainties. Fortunately, Gold Road Resources (OTCPK:ELKMF) is one of the few miners that hasn't been affected much by the shutdowns and has maintained guidance; however, the Q1 results were a little underwhelming. The good news is that there were a few clear culprits to the weakness, and costs are still at industry-leading levels, despite the soft quarter, suggesting that Gold Road should be able to bounce back from this in the remainder of FY-2020. For now, I continue to see the stock as a Hold, and I would view any drops below the A$1.20 level as buying opportunities. All production figures are reported on a 100% basis for the Gruyere Gold Mine.
(Source: Gold Fields Company Presentation)
Gold Road Resources was one of the first miners to report its Q1 earnings results, and unfortunately, we saw a pretty weak quarter after what was a blow-out first quarter of commercial production in Q4. Not only did gold production dip materially from Q4 levels, but all-in sustaining costs also increased, and free-cash-flow fell substantially. The good news is that management has maintained its FY-2020 guidance at 268,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of A$1,150/oz. While beating this guidance mid-point won't be an easy feat considering the soft Q1 performance, the encouraging thing is that mining itself continues to track the Feasibility Study assumptions, suggesting that this was likely just a one-off. Let's take a closer look at the Gruyere operations below:
(Source: Company Presentation)
The Gruyere Mine, which is 50% owned by Gold Road Resources, produced 59,595 ounces of gold in Q1, nearly 15% below the Q4 figure of 70,023 ounces. Due to the lower production in the quarter, all-in sustaining costs jumped 3% sequentially, from A$1,102/oz to A$1,135/oz. On the surface, this looks like a nasty detour from an incredible Q4 performance. However, the main culprit for the weak performance was the low plant availability of 83% in Q1 due to several maintenance shutdowns that the company guided for, that were made worse by a rain event as CEO Duncan Gibbs elaborated on below:
From a mining standpoint, however, gold recoveries remained steady at 94.1%, up 80 basis points sequentially, and head grades were in line with the FY-2019 figure at 1.05 grams per tonne gold. While all-in sustaining costs were up in the quarter and came in at A$1,135/oz, it's worth noting that these are still some of the lowest-costs in the industry. If we translate to figure to compare it to North American gold producers, a cost figure of A$1,135/oz translates to US$726/oz, a number that that is more than 25% below the industry average. Therefore, while it's easy to chalk this up as a disappointing quarter and argue that we're already deviating significantly from planned performance, I believe this is the wrong conclusion to arrive at here. Instead, this seems to be more of a one-off event, and the company deserves the benefit of the doubt after building Gruyere below budget, and trouncing guidance last year. Let's take a look at the financial results below:
(Source: Author's Chart)
As we can see from the chart above, free-cash-flow dropped off significantly in the quarter to just $13.2 million, partially a result of lower gold sales, higher costs, and a much larger portion of gold sales going towards removing hedges from the June 2020 quarter. While this was a considerable damper on the financial results as the company sold nearly 70% of its gold at much lower than spot prices, it was the prudent move to make given the COVID-19 backdrop. This is because the last thing the company needs is a chunk of gold hedges weighing the company down if operations are affected. Based on this, while the Q1 results looked weak financially as well, this should provide a tailwind to the Q2 results as most of the gold sales will be done near spot prices, as there is now just 7,400 ounces of hedges remaining for the June quarter vs. the 13,200 ounces expected. When compared to the current gold price of over A$2,600/oz, it's not difficult to see why the weighted average price of A$1,800/oz was a considerable headwind financially in Q1.

It's worth noting that there was some great news from a financial standpoint, and this was the continued improvement in Gold Road's balance sheet. The company ended the quarter with A$115 million in cash and bullion, and just A$80 million debt, suggesting that the company would potentially extinguish its debt almost entirely by the end of Q1 2021. This assumption is based on the fact that Gold Road was able to make a A$38 million debt repayment in Q4 alone, and would only need to pay down its debt by A$20 million per quarter pay off the remaining balance within 11 months.
(Source: Company Presentation)
In summary, while Gruyere had a weak Q1, and while the significant balance of hedges is the one detriment to the Gold Road investment thesis, the improved balance sheet and maintained FY-2020 guidance is encouraging. Clearly, there are better Australian miners out there like Saracen Minerals, which enjoy similar costs with much less pronounced gold hedges. Still, Gold Road remains an attractive name in the Australian mining space, especially if we can see some exciting exploration results later this year. Currently, the company has an aggressive A$26 million exploration planned this year, which will begin to give us an idea if the company might have any mineable deposits on 100% owned tenements, such as Gilmour or Renegade. Let's take a quick look at the technical picture:
(Source: Tradingview.com)
As we can see from the chart above, Gold Road has pulled back a little over the past couple of weeks but remains well above a multi-year breakout near A$0.80. The fact that the stock found immediate support at this breakout during the mid-March market turbulence is a positive sign, though the stock has now had a nice run since these lows, up nearly 100% in just over a month. Therefore,I would be waiting for a dip closer to A$1.20 before starting a position to bake in some margin of safety. Not only would a decline closer to A$1.20 allow the stock to reach more oversold levels, but it would place the stock at a more attractive valuation of closer to 12x free-cash-flow.
Gold Road Resources may have had a slow start to the year, but the company can still meet guidance, assuming no further interruptions to mining in Q4. While the company's low all-in sustaining costs make the company a market leader, the remaining low-priced hedges do soften the investment thesis a little, as they will weigh on profitability until the company chews through most of them. Therefore, I see Gold Road Resources as a Hold at current levels, but I would view a dip below A$1.20 as a much more attractive entry point.

    <h5 class="mb-1">INTERVIEW: Saudi Arabia is open for business despite the pandemic </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DETROIT: For a dozen years, Johnny Gyergyou has sold meat, poultry and eggs from his Berlin Township livestock farm at Eastern Market in Detroit in the US.
Lately, he’s been staying home as fear of the COVID-19 virus has kept thousands of shoppers away from the popular venue northeast of downtown. “The crowds are small and there aren’t many vendors,” said Gyergyou, adding that it’s just not cost-effective to haul the loads 33 miles to Detroit where they may or may not sell.“We’ve been doing fairly well (selling) at the farm. It’s not Eastern Market sales by no means, but at least it’s helping us along here,” said Gyergyou, 72.Farmers, growers and operators of open-air markets are heading into a busy time of the year as many states still are under stay-at-home orders for residents and non-essential businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus which has killed more than 60,000 people in the US and at least 230,000 worldwide.Shoppers venturing out this year are just as likely to come across tables of hand sanitizer and face mask-wearing produce peddlers as they are to see bushels of corn, quarts of blueberries or flats of petunias. Many venues have moved to drive-thru shopping, reduced days or hours, and fencing to control crowds.At the farmers market near London, England’s, Primrose Hill neighborhood, shopping is restricted to a few people at a time who are given gloves upon entering. Vendors are spread out and work behind plastic shields.Detroit’s Eastern Market is considering fencing. Six-foot by six-foot grids will be painted on floors as a reminder to social distance.About a dozen vendors are participating in drive-thru shopping on Tuesdays. “It’s my feeling after listening to people that they’re scared to go down to Detroit with it being a hotspot (for the COVID-19 virus),” said Gyergyou, hoping for a return to normalcy soon. “I’m anxious to get back there.”Detroit has topped 9,000 confirmed virus cases and more than 1,000 deaths.The farmers market in Overland Park, Kansas, outside of Kansas City, Missouri, has been relocated to the city’s convention center where patrons drive past vendors who bring produce to their vehicles.Vermont officials are requiring all farmers markets to be held outdoors. Entertainment, children activities and cooking demonstrations have been suspended to prevent people from congregating in small spaces.The Bennington Farmers’ Market was scheduled to reopen on Saturday as a pre-order drive-thru market.In Montpelier, the Capital City Market was prepared for both pre-order pickups and in-person shoppers with no more than 10 people in the market at a time. Vendors must be spaced 12 feet apart and wear face coverings and gloves.Such precautions can take some of the joy out of outdoor shopping, but that is the price of safety.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farmers markets scaling down with eye on safety due to virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DETROIT (AP) — Johnny Gyergyou has been selling his farm’s meat, poultry and eggs at a Detroit farmers market for more than a decade, but like many of his regular shoppers, he’s been staying home in recent weeks to wait out the coronavirus crisis.
Gyergyou, 72, said the crowds at Eastern Market just aren’t big enough to make it cost-effective for his typical 33-mile (53-kilometer) Saturday trips into the city from his farm in Berlin Township.
“We’ve been doing fairly well (selling) at the farm. It’s not Eastern Market sales by no means, but at least it’s helping us along here,” said Gyergyou, who added that he’s heard other vendors say they were scared to sell in Detroit, which has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus.
Farmers, growers and operators of open-air markets are heading into one of their busiest times of year while facing the added challenge of the coronavirus. The disease has led to stay-at-home orders and the closure of nonessential businesses in many places, and has killed more than 60,000 people in the U.S. and at least 230,000 worldwide.
Shoppers venturing to farmers markets this spring are likely to see a lot fewer vendors and fellow customers. The ones they do see will be taking precautions to guard against the spread of COVID-19, such as the wearing of face masks and frequent use of hand sanitizer. Many markets have already taken other steps, including turning to drive-thru shopping, reducing their hours of operation and using fencing for crowd control.
Nearly all of the hundreds of Saturday morning shoppers at Eastern Market wore masks and there was ample spaces between vendors.
“Three weeks ago, it was nearly empty,” said Carrie Simpson, 48, of Wyandotte outside of Detroit.
Saturday was her fourth visit to the market since fears of the virus forced businesses to close and people to stay home. Simpson bought eggs, plants and herbs and said she drives to Gyergyou's livestock farm for her meats.
“I want to support the farmers. Their sales are down,” she said.
The farmers market in Overland Park, Kansas, has been relocated to the city’s convention center, where patrons drive past vendors who bring produce to their vehicles. About 35 vendors participated on April 25 and vehicles were at the gate when the market opened at 8 a.m. About 700 drove through before a 2 p.m. closing, said Meg Ralph, a city spokeswoman.
In Vermont, officials are requiring all farmers markets to be held outdoors and have banned entertainment, children’s activities and cooking demonstrations to prevent people from congregating in small spaces. The Bennington Farmers’ Market was scheduled to reopen on Saturday as a pre-order drive-thru market. And in the state’s quaint capital city of Montpelier, the Capital City Market was prepared for pre-order pickups and in-person shoppers, with no more than 10 people allowed in the market at a time. Vendors must be spaced 12 feet apart and wear face coverings and gloves.
Such precautions can take some of the joy out of outdoor shopping, but that’s the price of safety.
“They won’t be able to talk about recipes (or) their families — converse about the kids, like they normally do,” said Myra Gorman, market manager for the farmers market in Evanston, Illinois. “Some of them will share phone numbers so they can do that stuff later.”
The market just north of Chicago typically attracts as many as 7,000 people on a Saturday. This weekend, 35 vendors will be set up and only 105 or so customers will be allowed inside at any time. Once inside, all the thumping, touching, smelling and grabbing of fruits and vegetables will be replaced by pointing by mask-wearing customers to mask- and glove-wearing vendors.
No farmers have backed out, said Gorman, adding that “this is their business, their livelihood.”
One of the vendors, Todd Nichols, said he couldn’t skip the market even if he wanted to. Nichols is an owner of Nichols Farm & Orchard in Marengo, a community about 55 miles (90 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. He said about 90% of his income comes from farmers markets and restaurants. Restaurant sales have fallen through the floor during the pandemic, he said.
“Farmers markets are just too important not to go,” Nichols said.
Gorman said things were going smoothly in the first few hours Saturday at the new-look farmers market.
“We passed our first thousand customers, everybody is doing social distancing and there is a big open space in the middle of the market so there’s enough space to walk around and feel safe,” she said.
The Saturday market in Collingswood, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, launched 20 years ago. The 2020 edition, which was set to open Saturday, won’t have live music or some of the other attractions that has made it a festival-like destination in years past. Like so many other markets trying to survive the pandemic, it will be a stripped-down “farm-to-car” market that has moved to a big parking lot.
Continuing the market provides normalcy for area residents and help for some now-struggling farmers, said Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley.
“Their crops didn’t know there was a pandemic going on,” he said.
Meanwhile, Detroit’s Eastern Market is considering putting up fencing to maintain social distancing. Grids are painted on the floors to remind people to keep space between themselves and others.
About a dozen vendors are participating in drive-thru shopping on Tuesdays at the market.
“We feel safe,” said Mark Thomas, who along with his wife, Jill, were trying to sell bottles from their Unwined Winery.
But things were slow Saturday morning. “It's easier when you can get samples to people,” said Jill Thomas. “We're not allowed to do that now.”
The restrictions aren’t limited to the U.S., either. At the farmers market near the Primrose Hill neighborhood in London, shopping has been restricted to a few people at a time who are given gloves upon entering. Vendors are spread out and work behind plastic shields.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ashford Group Of Companies Takes Action To Meet Changed Paycheck Protection Program Eligibility Guidelines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DALLAS, May 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Ashford Group of Companies announced today that all of its companies, including Ashford Inc. (NYSE American: AINC), Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) ("Ashford Trust"), and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE: BHR) ("Braemar"), will return all funds provided by the Small Business Administration's ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") due to the agency's recently changed rules and inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.
Federal Government assistance is required to repair the most significant damage in history to U.S. hotels and hospitality businesses caused by government-ordered shutdowns and restrictions on travel and public gatherings. Industry-wide revenue is down approximately 80-90% as a result of the government orders, resulting in the immediate loss of 3.9 million jobs, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association.
Some media and members of Congress have falsely implied that Ashford accessed "loopholes" in the CARES Act to qualify for the PPP funds. In fact, Congress designed the PPP to specifically allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property as a means to prevent the economic collapse of the hospitality industry that is now occurring. This is why Congress wrote the CARES Act to waive the SBA's standard affiliation rules for hotels and restaurants, as follows:
[A]ny business concern that employs not more than 500 employees per physical location of the business concern and that is assigned a North American Industry Classification System code beginning with 72 at the time of disbursal shall be eligible to receive a covered loan.
This specific provision of the law was referenced in the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQ") published on April 13, 2020:
Question 24: How do the $10 million cap and affiliation rules work for hotels and restaurants (and any business assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code beginning with 72)?
Answer: Under the CARES Act, any single business entity that is assigned a NAICS code beginning with 72 (including hotels and restaurants) and that employs not more than 500 employees per physical location is eligible to receive a PPP loan.
Ashford relied on the statute as passed by Congress and the guidance provided by the SBA to apply for PPP loans in good faith. Ashford also relied on the SBA's view that its affiliation rules do not apply to any business entity that is assigned a NAICS code beginning with 72 and that employs not more than a total of 500 employees. Under these rules, qualified hotels and restaurants that are owned by a parent business are permitted to apply for separate PPP loans, provided that each property maintains a unique EIN. The $10 million maximum loan amount under the PPP applies to every eligible business entity.
Ashford applied for PPP loans for each qualified hotel property in full compliance with this guidance, and in the belief it was our obligation to protect our employees, vendors, communities, lenders and shareholders from unfair economic damage.
Since we submitted our loan applications, the rules have changed almost daily. In fact, the SBA has issued numerous Interim Final Rules and at least 12 separate FAQs. For example, the SBA added the following new guidance relating to public companies on April 23, 2020 (weeks after we submitted our PPP applications):
31. Question: Do businesses owned by large companies with adequate sources of liquidity to support the business's ongoing operations qualify for a PPP loan?
Answer: In addition…borrowers should review carefully the required certification that "[c]urrent economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant." Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.
Ashford companies do not have "substantial market value" compared to the majority of other publicly-traded companies or even Ashford's own market values before the government shutdown actions. We also now have limited access to the capital markets across our companies.
More recently, the SBA issued a Fifth Interim Final Rule on April 30, 2020, with the following addition:
Can a single corporate group receive unlimited PPP loans?
No. To preserve the limited resources available to the PPP program, and in light of the previous lapse of PPP appropriations and the high demand for PPP loans, businesses that are part of a single corporate group shall in no event receive more than $20,000,000 of PPP loans in the aggregate. For purposes of this limit, businesses are part of a single corporate group if they are majority owned, directly or indirectly, by a common parent. This limitation shall be immediately effective with respect to any loan that has not yet been fully disbursed as of April 30, 2020. Businesses are subject to this limitation even if the businesses are eligible for the waiver of affiliation provision under the CARES Act or are otherwise not considered to be affiliates under SBA's affiliation rules.
While we believed then and continue to believe today that we qualify for PPP loans based on the legislation and rule-making in place at the time our applications were submitted, continuous SBA rule changes and evolving opinions by Administration officials have led us to conclude that we may no longer qualify. As a result, the Ashford Group of Companies will return all PPP funds on or before May 7, 2020, in accordance with SBA's previously announced safe harbor.
Ashford management had no intention of crowding out any business from gaining equal access to the PPP funds, and could not have known that congressional appropriations for the program would be insufficient to cover the needs of all other businesses in the nation that have suffered similar harm. Congress and the Administration should have known but chose to restrict funding when the CARES Act was passed on March 27, only to provide additional funding later. In fact, Congress did not make any changes to the rules under which Ashford had already applied for and received funds when it passed its second version of the CARES Act nearly a month later on April 23. In the face of continuing confusion, the need for immediate government action to fix the PPP program and repair economic damage is acute and growing.
"The hotel industry has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting National Emergency," commented Monty J. Bennett, Ashford Inc.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Ashford Trust and Braemar. "Hotel industry executives met with the Administration at the White House on March 17, 2020 to plead for help for our industry. We are disappointed that, in an abundance of caution to avoid any risk of non-compliance with the changed PPP rules, our actions mean that our employees, vendors, communities and others in need will not benefit from the PPP as Congress intended. We call on Congress, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to provide assistance to the hotel industry to protect jobs and asset values that have been severely impaired as a result of the pandemic and the government's actions that have followed."
Ashford Inc. provides global asset management, investment management and related services to the real estate and hospitality sectors.

In fact, Congress designed the PPP to specifically allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property as a means to prevent the economic collapse of the hospitality industry that is now occurring. This is why Congress wrote the CARES Act to waive the SBA's standard affiliation rules for hotels and restaurants, as follows:
[A]ny business concern that employs not more than 500 employees per physical location of the business concern and that is assigned a North American Industry Classification System code beginning with 72 at the time of disbursal shall be eligible to receive a covered loan.
This specific provision of the law was referenced in the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQ") published on April 13, 2020:
Question 24: How do the $10 million cap and affiliation rules work for hotels and restaurants (and any business assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code beginning with 72)?
Answer: Under the CARES Act, any single business entity that is assigned a NAICS code beginning with 72 (including hotels and restaurants) and that employs not more than 500 employees per physical location is eligible to receive a PPP loan.
Ashford relied on the statute as passed by Congress and the guidance provided by the SBA to apply for PPP loans in good faith.  Ashford also relied on the SBA's view that its affiliation rules do not apply to any business entity that is assigned a NAICS code beginning with 72 and that employs not more than a total of 500 employees. Under these rules, qualified hotels and restaurants that are owned by a parent business are permitted to apply for separate PPP loans, provided that each property maintains a unique EIN. The $10 million maximum loan amount under the PPP applies to every eligible business entity.
Ashford applied for PPP loans for each qualified hotel property in full compliance with this guidance, and in the belief it was our obligation to protect our employees, vendors, communities, lenders and shareholders from unfair economic damage.
Since we submitted our loan applications, the rules have changed almost daily.  In fact, the SBA has issued numerous Interim Final Rules and at least 12 separate FAQs.  For example, the SBA added the following new guidance relating to public companies on April 23, 2020 (weeks after we submitted our PPP applications):
31. Question: Do businesses owned by large companies with adequate sources of liquidity to support the business's ongoing operations qualify for a PPP loan?
Answer: In addition…borrowers should review carefully the required certification that "[c]urrent economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant." Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.
Ashford companies do not have "substantial market value" compared to the majority of other publicly-traded companies or even Ashford's own market values before the government shutdown actions.  We also now have limited access to the capital markets across our companies.
More recently, the SBA issued a Fifth Interim Final Rule on April 30, 2020, with the following addition:
Can a single corporate group receive unlimited PPP loans?
No. To preserve the limited resources available to the PPP program, and in light of the previous lapse of PPP appropriations and the high demand for PPP loans, businesses that are part of a single corporate group shall in no event receive more than $20,000,000 of PPP loans in the aggregate. For purposes of this limit, businesses are part of a single corporate group if they are majority owned, directly or indirectly, by a common parent. This limitation shall be immediately effective with respect to any loan that has not yet been fully disbursed as of April 30, 2020. Businesses are subject to this limitation even if the businesses are eligible for the waiver of affiliation provision under the CARES Act or are otherwise not considered to be affiliates under SBA's affiliation rules.
While we believed then and continue to believe today that we qualify for PPP loans based on the legislation and rule-making in place at the time our applications were submitted, continuous SBA rule changes and evolving opinions by Administration officials have led us to conclude that we may no longer qualify. As a result, the Ashford Group of Companies will return all PPP funds on or before May 7, 2020, in accordance with SBA's previously announced safe harbor.
Ashford management had no intention of crowding out any business from gaining equal access to the PPP funds, and could not have known that congressional appropriations for the program would be insufficient to cover the needs of all other businesses in the nation that have suffered similar harm. Congress and the Administration should have known but chose to restrict funding when the CARES Act was passed on March 27, only to provide additional funding later.  In fact, Congress did not make any changes to the rules under which Ashford had already applied for and received funds when it passed its second version of the CARES Act nearly a month later on April 23.  In the face of continuing confusion, the need for immediate government action to fix the PPP program and repair economic damage is acute and growing.
"The hotel industry has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting National Emergency," commented Monty J. Bennett, Ashford Inc.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Ashford Trust and Braemar. "Hotel industry executives met with the Administration at the White House on March 17, 2020 to plead for help for our industry. We are disappointed that, in an abundance of caution to avoid any risk of non-compliance with the changed PPP rules, our actions mean that our employees, vendors, communities and others in need will not benefit from the PPP as Congress intended.  We call on Congress, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to provide assistance to the hotel industry to protect jobs and asset values that have been severely impaired as a result of the pandemic and the government's actions that have followed."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moratorium: Finance Minister asks banks to consider abolishing accrued interest on HP loans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 — Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz today requested that financial institutions consider abolishing the accrued interest on hire purchase (HP) loans, as well as profit from their fixed-rate Islamic financing, during the six-month moratorium period on loan repayments.
Taking to his Facebook page today, Zafrul said that though there are many banks that offer loan deferment without imposing the accrued or compounded interest, the leeway does not cover all loan products.
“Each bank, meanwhile, sets its own approach on matters related to interest imposition, during the moratorium.
“Taking into cognisance that there is a possibility that it can be implemented, and taking the people’s request into account, I would like to suggest that all financial institutions, especially those involved in this moratorium, to consider abolishing the accrued interest for hire purchase loans or profits for fixed-rate Islamic financing, for this six-month moratorium period,” Zafrul said.
He added that although the final say in the matter lies with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, has begun taking proactive steps to seek a solution to the issue, via discussions with BNM and banks, in the interests of the people.
“Given the challenging economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, I sincerely hope that this view can be given due consideration by BNM and other financial institutions in the country. I believe this move will have a positive impact on our people,” he added.
BNM yesterday said that it regrets the “confusion and anxiety” stemming from its announcement on changes to the six-month moratorium for HP loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing, on March 30.
In a newly released frequently asked questions (FAQs) list yesterday, the central bank denied that it had also backpedalled on its initial announcement.
In its explainer, BNM stressed that the payment deferment is still automatic for HP and fixed rate Islamic financing, adding that what is required now is an additional step to comply with procedural requirements under the Hire-Purchase Act 1967 (HP Act) and Shariah.
“This additional step is unavoidable, and is required to incorporate the changes to the payment schedule and/or amounts as a result of the six-month payment deferment in loan/financing agreements.
“We sincerely regret any confusion and anxiety that this announcement may have caused. The deferment of loan repayments is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers/customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This intent remains the same. The confusion arises because of the misperception that the repayment amounts for a HP loan cannot be changed,” it said.
BNM added that the misperception arose, due to an illustration provided in an initial version of the FAQs, “where certain assumptions and caveats were made.”
It said that it had later removed the example when banks provided their own illustrations.
BNM then provided an example of a RM50,000 HP loan with a remaining tenure of five years and a fixed interest of 2.71 per cent (or an effective rate of 5.36 per cent) per annum:
Before the deferment, the monthly instalment was RM712.
But should the deferment option be accepted, based on this example, the monthly instalment is now RM731, or an increase by 2 per cent or RM19. Consequently, the total interest increase incurred is RM1,130.
Several reports emerged on the evening of April 30, citing a BNM press release, on a purported reversal from what was initially announced with regards to deferment of HP loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing.
Financial website, Ringgit Plus, reported that the press release had “hinted of a big change that will affect millions of Malaysians currently servicing car loans or Islamic financing.”
The report, which was one of those widely shared by those angered by the announcement, reported that BNM had also implied that from May 1, 2020, the six-month moratorium will also no longer be an automatic opt-in for all customers.
Ringgit Plus reported that the press release further stated that BNM required that all borrowers “are provided with clear information on the process and changes to the terms of their agreements”, and that the banking institutions provide borrowers with “necessary steps that they need to take to complete the process of deferring their loan/financing payments”.
This was seen as a departure from what was announced initially, where customers are only asked to opt-out of the deferment, should they want to continue servicing their loans with their banks, as otherwise, banks would grant an automatic deferment.
BNM later said that any additional interest that some banks may charge on the deferred payment cannot be higher than the original hire-purchase contract signed.
The central bank reiterated that, as a regulator, it has from the very beginning, already indicated that there will be accrued interest or profit with regard to the six-month moratorium.
The announcement also saw social media users targeting Zafrul with criticisms coupled with the hashtag #bankerjagabanker.
The confusion further escalated and caused widespread anger; which even led to the start of an online petition denouncing the move by BNM and demanding for zero per cent interest on the deferred instalment payments.
Last month, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the government’s move to freeze loan repayments for six months due to the coronavirus disease, which he said will provide relief worth RM100 billion to Malaysians.
The prime minister said the unprecedented move BNM announced on March 24, was the government’s response to public concern about hardships they are enduring due to the movement control order (MCO). — Malay Mail

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBLIN — Ireland will allow firms impacted by the coronavirus crisis to warehouse tax liabilities for 12 months, offering a “lifeline” as part of an additional package of business supports that could reach 6.5 billion euros, the government announced on Saturday.
Commercial rates will also be written off for three months, a 2 billion euro credit guarantee scheme will be introduced for small and medium sized businesses and Ireland’s sovereign wealth fund directed to make 2 billion euros of equity available for bigger companies, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.
Ireland concentrated its initial 8 billion euro fiscal response on increased jobless payments and wage subsidies for affected employees, with 1 billion euros of liquidity supports offered directly to reeling firms. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin Editing by Frances Kerry)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commercial rates waiver and €10,000 restart grant - Government's financial plan to reboot economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Government ministers announced more financial measures today costing up to €6.5bn over the coming years to help “re-boot” the Irish economy.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said €2bn will be made available for loan guarantee schemes for small and medium businesses, a waiving of commercial rates for three months, and a deferral of tax obligations for a period.
The measures are:
“Today’s package of measures aims to help our businesses to restart, reconnect and rehire staff who have been laid off or furloughed,” said Minister Donohoe.
He said the Government has already brought forward a series of measures to support those impacted by this global pandemic.
They have included emergency income support such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. It is now necessary to introduce a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted.
Minister Donohoe said: “On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
“We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.”
Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to "minimise the damage" of the pandemic.
Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys said the economy had moved past the initial shock phase of the coronavirus crisis and was now in a stabilization phase.
The new measures announced today were to fund the third phase – “the re-boot phase.”
She said: “The roadmap announced by Government yesterday outlines a pathway to reopening our economy. This suite of supports represents the next phase in our ongoing response to support businesses through the pandemic and will assist them as they plan for the future’.
“We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.
“The new €250 million Restart Fund in particular will be a critically important tool to support small businesses in our towns and villages to reopen their doors and get back on their feet with supports of up to €10,000 available.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">VC firms can be liable if startups wrongly claim stimulus funds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While investors may see the CARES Act as a lifeline for their startup portfolio companies, there are certain traps to be aware of.
Under the False Claims Act, the government can seek both civil and criminal penalties against companies obtaining funding under false pretenses. On top of this, individual whistleblowers (with their hungry plaintiffs’ attorneys) also have standing to sue on behalf of the government.
It’s not just the companies that obtain funding that can be liable. Individuals, including directors, have the potential to become liable, as well.
Many popular CARES Act funding programs — like the PPP and EIDL programs — require an applicant company to make eligibility certifications. For example, the PPP loans require a certification that “the uncertainty of current economic conditions makes necessary the loan request to support the ongoing operations of the eligible recipient.” The SBA further clarified that “Borrowers must . . . [take] into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business.”
There has obviously been a spate of news stories about well-resourced companies obtaining PPP funding (e.g. Ruth’s Chris, Shake Shack). But in the VC and startup community, clients are questioning whether a VC-backed startup really “needs” the money. This isn’t just a moral question. Given the certification described above and the SBA’s recent guidance, it is an important legal question.
What happens if a company makes false certifications to obtain CARES Act stimulus funding? The answer is found under the False Claims Act.
The False Claims Act provides for civil and criminal liability for “knowingly” submitting a false claim to the federal government — including a request for a government loan.
Merely submitting a false claim is not enough. It must be “knowingly” false. But there need not be a specific intent to defraud.
False Claims Act liability arising from the CARES Act is not just a theoretical concern. The Department of Justice has already issued a press release asserting that it will be prioritizing investigations of COVID-19 related fraud. So, attention and resources are being put into ferreting out CARES Act fraud.
It’s not only the government that one needs to worry about. A member of the public can stand in the government’s shoes and file a suit under the False Claims Act. This is called a qui tam action.
Why would someone bring a qui tam claim under the False Claims Act? Because it can be worth a lot of money. A private plaintiff in a qui tam action may be able to keep up to 30% of the recovery in the lawsuit, plus an award of attorneys’ fees. The rest of the recovery goes to the government.
The plaintiff’s bar has already started advertising for whistleblowers to come forward for the obvious purpose of bringing a slew of qui tam actions under the CARES Act.
The False Claims Act doesn’t limit liability to just the applicant company. It can extend to directors as well as investors.
And remember — lots of startups are cash poor. Investors, however, are often not. Thus, VCs and other investors make attractive targets with big pockets for plaintiffs’ lawyers seeking to file qui tam actions.
Let’s focus on two important aspects of False Claims Act liability for VCs and other investors.
First, is the notion of “submitting” a false claim. You might think that given the potential liability an investor faces when a startup seeks CARES Act funding that the best thing to do is to insert yourself in the process. This might not have the desired result.
You are not automatically liable under the False Claims Act just because the company becomes liable. In fact, knowledge of the company submitting a false claim isn’t even enough to impose personal liability. Rather, the individual must have taken some affirmative steps to cause the company to submit the false claim.
This has different implications for VCs themselves vs. directors who may be appointed by a VC.
Investors are not generally expected to have any role in deciding whether to seek government funding. So, from a liability avoidance perspective, there is a strong case to be made to stay out of it.
For investor directors, it is more difficult to close your eyes and let the company do what it wants to do. That can raise fiduciary duty concerns. But the job of a director is to make sure the company has policies and procedures in place for the officers to make decisions on government funding, not to substitute one’s judgment for that of the company’s officers. Staying one step removed from day-to-day decision making — where a director ordinarily should be — is helpful in avoiding liability, while still meeting fiduciary duties.
Second, there is the knowledge element of a False Claims Act claim. The False Claims Act is not a strict liability statute, nor does it seek to punish negligence. To be liable, the government (or a private plaintiff in the government’s shoes) must show that the defendant acted “knowingly.”
As an investor director, you want to make sure you can demonstrate, at a minimum, that you have acted reasonably and in good faith. In that regard, documentation is always recommended.
In addition, make sure you are consulting with legal counsel in ensuring compliance with federal funding requirements. This is a particularly key when dealing with facing potential False Claims Act litigation. Reliance on advice of counsel can be, in itself, a defense to a claim that you violated the False Claims Act provided you made a full disclosure of the facts to your counsel.
For many investors, this guidance may be seen as coming too late — their portfolio companies already obtained stimulus loans when perhaps they weren’t really eligible. Thankfully, the SBA has provided a solution.
Any company that has received a PPP loan can return the loan in full by May 7, 2020. This safe harbor will allow companies to avoid liability for having obtained a loan when they were potentially ineligible.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Coronavirus lockdown has been accepted as a much needed action by almost everyone in the country, including celebrities. For the most part, the citizens have abided by the lockdown rules, with many celebrities encouraging people to do so.
However, according to reports, sisters Malavika Raaj and Sonakshi Raaj are said to not be taking the lockdown seriously.
A Mumbai Mirror report stated that Malavika Raaj, who played the young Pooja in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, and her sister Sonakshi Raaj have been flouting the lockdown. The report claimed that the two sisters have been visiting their family owned restaurant in Juhu, Mumbai, to soak in the sun. It also stated that stories of them visiting a Bollywood stylist and director have emerged.
Malavika is an actress whereas Sonakshi is a designer. Malavika made a comeback with the 2017 film Jayadev. She will next be seen in a film titled Squad, starring opposite debut actor Rinzing Denzongpa.
Meanwhile, other Bollywood celebrities have taken the lockdown in full stride. They are staying connected with fans through social media by posting entertaining pictures and videos, spreading awareness about the Coronavirus and have also been donating to relief funds set up to fight the virus and its economic impact on the weakest sections of the society.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus lockdown | CPI(M) offers suggestions for economy revival</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Saturday released a detailed note offering suggestions to the Union government on revival of the economy.
Full coverage on coronavirus
“Problems since the beginning of the lockdown and difficulties being faced by crores of Indians, especially migrant workers, daily labourers and the poor, unable to survive will deepen. This is what needs the Centre’s attention,” tweeted CPI(M) general Sitaram Yechury, while releasing the note.

Separately, CPI general secretary D. Raja told The Hindu, “The Coronavirus pandemic has not changed the neo-liberal economic trajectory of the BJP government at the Centre. And this has worsened the economic inequality. It has led to mass unemployment, growing poverty, hunger and despair. Solutions can’t come out of the current economic framework”, he said.
In another tweet, Mr. Yechury said, “It is sheer cruelty to expect workers who have absolutely no earnings for the last two months, because of the lockdown, to pay for their own train tickets. Nor can State Governments bear this financial expenditure when they have not received any help from the Central Government.”

In the note, the CPI(M) said: “How long this distress will continue is not known; but to start with, the central government must make available to every non income tax paying household Rs.7,500 per month for a period of three months, and to every individual 10 kg. of free grains per month for a period of six months”.
The party advocated providing cooked meals for the poor as well as giving a certain amount of pulses, cooking oil and other necessities. While the State governments were at the forefront of the COVID-19 fight, the Centre should transfer resources such as cash as grants and food grains.

“All this must be in addition to the substantial assistance that the Centre must give the State governments from the thousands of crores being collected in the private fund named after the PM for fighting the pandemic and for improving healthcare facilities like increasing the supplies of ventilators, masks, protective gear, testing equipment etc,” the CPI(M) note said.
The party also talked about looking at taxing the wealthy later and coming up with measures to stop the flight of foreign capital as countries like Spain had done.

Starting the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme, strengthening the MSMEs and agriculture actor, reviving the village economy, restoring the supply chain of essential goods and ensuring the return of migrant workers to their workplace were the other key suggestions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hairstylists launch petition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of B.C. barbers and hairstylists have signed a petition asking the provincial government not to single them out when COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease.
Premier John Horgan is expected to announce B.C.’s plan for reopening the economy next week.
However, the petition, launched on Change.org Friday (May 1), is urging the provincial government to not include hairstylists and barbers in the first phase of that economic reopening. Businesses in the personal service sector — including hair, nail, wax, spa and esthetician practices — have been closed since mid-March under a provincial health officer order.
As of 2:45 p.m. Saturday, 994 people, and counting, had signed the online petition.
The petition notes that it’s not possible for personal service businesses to practice social distancing with clients.
“Our government has made incredible strides in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and must understand that a decision to reopen salons first would put our communities and economy at greater risk than benefit,” reads the petition.
“We hope that businesses who operate in as close proximity to the public as nurses continue to remain closed at this time.”
It’s worrying, notes the petition, that hair salons and barbershops are allowed to reopen in the first phase of Alberta’s plan, while the rest of that province’s personal service industry will remain closed.  
The petition questions whether hairstylists and barbers will have “continued, unfettered” access to personal protective equipment and whether there will be better access to more widespread testing.
“Will workers and their families who are compromised be supported? Will people in a non-essential sector have to risk illness, death and heightened community spread because they have no choice but to touch large volumes of clients in enclosed areas?” the petition asks.
“It is essential that these questions are answered before hair professionals return to work."
However, B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the province won’t reopen sectors such as hairstylists and barbershops until they’re confident they can operate safely, and can implement health and safety protocols.
“We will not move forward with opening up different sectors until we’re ready, until we’re sure that they have a plan that is workable that have these precautions and protections in place,” said Henry Saturday.
Henry said the outbreaks at poultry plants are a “cautionary tale” for the province.
“That tells us that we need to make sure that we have the right safety measures in place in each different area of our economy to make sure we can all be comforted and understand that we are opening up safely, and slowly and methodically,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Republic announces €6.5bn package to support business struggling with pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Irish Government has announced a suite of measures to help businesses struggling in the coronavirus emergency.
Multi-euro recovery funds were agreed in a special cabinet meeting the morning after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a five-stage road map to reopening society.
The measures include a €2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund and a €2 billion Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years.
A €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses, a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses, the “warehousing” of tax liabilities for 12 months after recommencement of trading and a commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall were also announced.
The Republic's finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
“Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses and our economy have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality. But, by working together, we are minimising the damage,” he said.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.”
The Irish government has already rolled out a multibillion-euro package of assistance for employers and workers during the crisis.
Around 450,000 workers are receiving state payments through a temporary wage subsidy scheme, while around another 600,000 have applied for a special Covid-19 unemployment benefit.
The Government has also significantly expanded financial support for small and medium sized-businesses.
On Friday, Mr Varadkar announced the current lockdown has been extended until May 18, at which point phase one of the “journey to a new normal” will commence.
Each stage is three weeks apart, but the country will only move from one to the other when medical experts confirm it is safe to do so.
The fifth phase is scheduled to commence on August 10 if everything goes to plan.
While the majority of restrictions remain in place for another fortnight, two will ease in the coming days.
From next Tuesday, a travel limit that has forced people to stay within 2km of home when exercising will be extended to 5km, and self-isolating over-70s will be advised they can leave home for a walk or drive.
On May 18, outdoor work, like construction and landscaping, will resume.
Some retail outlets – like garden centres, hardware stores and repair shops – will also reopen.
Mr Varadkar said some outdoor sporting and fitness activities in small groups would also be allowed from that date.
Cafes and restaurants are set to reopen in phase three, which will start on June 29, but pubs are not due to reopen until phase five.
Phase four, which will start on July 20, will see hotels and hairdressers opening for business.
In terms of sport, golf and tennis will be permitted in phase one while close-contact sports such as rugby will have to wait until phase five on August 10.
Mr Varadkar has expressed hope that the show-piece All-Ireland GAA finals could go ahead this autumn, albeit behind closed doors.
In phase one, people outside of the same family unit can meet in groups of no more than four in an outdoor setting.
In phase two, starting June 8, visits to the homes of over-70s and other vulnerable groups will be permitted with strict social distancing and hygiene steps.
The plan does not include any timescale for lifting the cocooning advice.
Mr Varadkar said advice on wearing face masks or coverings in shops and public transport would be issued when the plan begins to roll out on May 18.
Mr Varadkar said schools and colleges will reopen in September/October at the start of the new academic year.
Education authorities are to assess whether Leaving Cert exams for final-year students could go ahead in July in the absence of the wider school population.
Mr Varadkar said it was still the plan for sixth year students to spend two weeks in class ahead of the exams starting.

Mr Varadkar said it was still the plan for sixth year students to spend two weeks in class ahead of the exams starting.
But he said other options, such as using predictive marking to allocate results, may be needed if sitting the Leaving Certs could not be held safely.
The five phase plan was agreed by Cabinet on the back of advice from experts on the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).
The current lockdown period had been due to expire on Monday.
The Taoiseach has stressed the blueprint is a “living document” and steps outlined in later phases could potentially be implemented sooner.
He also predicted that the two-metre social distancing guidelines could be reduced, potentially by half.
The total number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Ireland rose to 1,265 on Friday, after another 34 deaths were announced.
As of Friday, there had been 20,833 confirmed cases of the disease.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irish football stars Stephen Ward and Nathan Collins are urging fans to get involved in a new Heads Up charity challenge.
The Stoke City duo have teamed up with snooker legend Ken Doherty as well as TV star Simon Delaney to take part in the Variety initiative.
Fans are being asked to record themselves attempting to do five or more consecutive headers and donate and nominate friends to help the charity.
Variety, the Children's Charity of Ireland will celebrate their 70th anniversary next year, and currently focus on providing vital mobility and educational equipment.
Celeb Simon Delaney, Patron of Variety – the Children’s Charity of Ireland said: “The great thing about our ‘HeadsUp’ challenge is you can go do this in your own back garden then challenge family or friends to try and do as many headers as possible while donating to help children who are sick, disadvantaged or have special needs in Ireland.”
“HeadsUp is not only about having fun through football while donating to Variety. It also offers a subliminal message for the people of Ireland to ‘Get their heads up’ during these extraordinary times as we seek to find our way through this COVID crisis.”
You can text the word ‘Headsup’ to 50300 to donate €4 or go to Variety Ireland’s website or social media pages to make an online donation.
Use the hashtag '#HEADSUPVARIETY' and tag Variety Ireland on its social media pages.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Growth in craft beer sector slows, study suggests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The number of breweries has stalled for the second year in a row as growth in the craft beer sector slows after a period of explosive growth, a new study suggests.
Accountancy group UHY Hacker Young said the total had fallen by one over the last year to 2,273 amid increased competition from multinational brewers, and a trend away from drinking beer among younger generations.
Multinationals have increased their market share by launching their own craft beer varieties, as well as acquiring many of the emerging independent craft breweries, said the report.
UHY Hacker Young predicted the craft beer market may be reaching “saturation point” among its existing core customer market.
James Simmonds of UHY Hacker Young, said: “Stalling growth in the number of UK breweries is not the whole story, with the UK remaining one of the world leaders in craft beer.
“In order to help the sector bounce back as quickly as possible from coronavirus, the Government should consider expanding the Small Brewer Relief to include a wider group of breweries.
“An increase in the level of business rate relief for brewers and pubs would also be welcome.
“Brewers should make use of this support available to them to scale up their online platforms, in order to increase their online sales directly to customers.
“Consumer habits are likely to change even after the lockdown has ended, and brewers need to be able to capitalise on where consumers are now looking to buy their goods.”

“In order to help the sector bounce back as quickly as possible from coronavirus, the Government should consider expanding the Small Brewer Relief to include a wider group of breweries.
“An increase in the level of business rate relief for brewers and pubs would also be welcome.
“Brewers should make use of this support available to them to scale up their online platforms, in order to increase their online sales directly to customers.
“Consumer habits are likely to change even after the lockdown has ended, and brewers need to be able to capitalise on where consumers are now looking to buy their goods.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Government chiefs said the £2.1m support package will keep the tram system running to help frontline staff get to work.
It comes as part of a wider £30m funding package for metro services across England announced by the Department for Transport.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said:  "The best way to stop the spread of the virus and protect the NHS is to stay at home – but protecting key transport services is vital to enable essential travel.
"The Metro in the West Midlands has successfully served key areas and communities through Birmingham and connected the city to Wolverhampton for more than two decades.
"It plays a crucial role in getting NHS staff and emergency services to work - and it is only right that we offer operators support during this time of national crisis. 
"This package of support will help ensure light rail services continue to operate at this difficult time."
The funding, which covers a period of three months and will be backdated from mid-March, comes amid a reduction in use.
West Midlands Metro has seen a "sharp decline" in passenger numbers with people following Government guidance – which has also resulted in a "significant" drop in income.
The package of support has been tailored to Midland Metro Ltd to ensure it can continue to run the service.
It follows an announcement by the Department for Transport which has stepped in to sustain necessary rail services across England.
Normal franchise agreements have been suspended – with all revenue and cost risk being transferred Government for a limited period.
It is also offering free refunds to anyone holding an advance ticket to ensure passengers are not out of pocket.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Metrolink gets £11.6m government rescue package - but June could still be the end of the line</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The immediate future of Metrolink has been secured thanks to an £11.6m government bailout.
But the backdated emergency cash injection is only for twelve weeks and will run out in June.
Greater Manchester's tram network is currently losing about £5.5m every month because of the coronavirus lockdown, prompting fears from Mayor Andy Burnham that the entire system could be 'mothballed' without government intervention.
Today (Saturday) Transport Secretary Grant Shapps made good on a promise made last month to help help Metrolink by announcing funding worth £11.6m.
The cash injection is designed to keep Metrolink going for twelve weeks to enable key workers including NHS staff to work.
The announcement is part of £30m package to keep light rail services running across England during the crisis.
The Department for Transport has agreed twelve weeks of funding for Metrolink - £970,000 per week - enabling key routes to remain open for people travelling to hospitals, supermarkets or those who cannot work from home.
But the funding, backdated to the middle of March, will run out in the middle of June.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “The best way to stop the spread of the virus and protect the NHS is to stay at home – but protecting key transport services is vital to enable essential travel.
“Manchester Metrolink continues to provide the Greater Manchester area with an essential transport lifeline even through this time of national crisis. It plays a crucial role in getting NHS staff and emergency services to work - and it is only right that we offer operators support during this time of national crisis.
“This package of support will help ensure light rail services continue to operate at this difficult time.”
The cash injection follows a £397m package to ensure key bus services continue to operate.
The DfT has temporarily suspended normal franchise agreements and transferred all revenue and cost risk to the government for a limited period, and is offering free refunds to anyone holding an advance ticket to ensure passengers are not out of pocket.
Last month the mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said Metrolink could be shut down unless an urgent package of government funding was confirmed
Mr Burnham said at the time: "We are losing millions of pounds every month trying to run a public transport service in these circumstances.
"If there is no deal from the government in the way they've bailed out the bus and rail sectors, we are going to face the difficult decision of whether or not we need to mothball the Metrolink.
"It's not something we have any wish to do because we want to support those crucial workers, those minimum wage heroes, because they still need to get to work for us.
"In absence of that support, we are forced into a corner."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here are the Two Reasons Why Bitcoin Investors are Fleeing Exchanges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin’s intense uptrend seen in the time following its mid-March meltdown has ushered in a significant influx of new capital to the market – a sign that retail traders largely thought that the crypto was undervalued at its recent lows.
This can be seen while looking towards the fact that margin traders have largely moved to the sidelines while spot traders take the reins.
Many of these spot buyers have also been moving their BTC away from centralized exchanges and into cold storage wallets, and it appears that there are two primary factors driving this trend.
Bitcoin’s explosive rally seen throughout the past few weeks has reached a turning point as the crypto struggles to surmount its overhead resistance within the lower-$9,000 region.
It is important to keep in mind that this recent uptrend was driven primarily by spot buying pressure from retail traders, which makes this movement different than the margin-driven ones seen in previous months.
It appears that the bulk of these retail investors who drove this rally are taking a long-term investment strategy as well, as data from research platform Glassnode shows that exchange’s BTC balances have dived throughout the course of this rebound.

This means that this Bitcoin has been moved away from exchanges and towards cold storage wallets – a sign that the investors who drove this movement aren’t planning to sell their BTC anytime soon.
According to a recent research report from Arcane, it appears that there are two primary factors driving the massive decline in exchanges’ BTC balances.
They explain that the first reason could be due to degrading trust in centralized exchange platforms, as many investors have blamed BTC’s mid-March meltdown on the BitMEX “hardware issues” that led investors to see an overwhelming cascade of liquidations.
It could also be rooted in the bullish possibility that investors turning to long-term investment strategies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stock market to trade sideways this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share prices are expected to trade sideways this week on concerns about easing quarantine measures amid an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
BPI Securities president Haj Narvaez said equities market would also remain volatile on the possibility of a US market correction spilling over to the Philippine market in the coming weeks.
“If you’re taking a 6 to 18 months’ view, I still think that these levels are going to be good. That said, you have to be prepared for volatility, because the economic numbers are going to be quite grim,” Narvaez explained.
The Philippine Stock Exchange Index last rose 4.3 percent to 5,700.71 as it tracked upbeat regio­ nal markets as some territories started to lift restrictions rela­ ted to COVID-19 lockdowns.
“The week’s close at 5,700.71 still highlights near-term bounce as a mere technical rebound and is not sustainable. This may see more price action towards the retest of the 5,000 levels in the near-term,” BDO Unibank Inc. chief investment strategist Jonathan Ravelas said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Volume Trend Suggests Bitcoin is About to See Massive Volatility</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin’s recent uptrend appears to be far more than just a fleeting relief rally, as data suggests that it has been driven primarily by retail investors as margin traders flee the market due to the mass liquidations resulting from recent volatility.
This coincides with an interesting trend seen while looking towards the cryptocurrency’s daily volume, with the spike seen here potentially pointing to underlying strength behind the crypto’s recent price movement.
BTC’s 7-day volatility is also beginning to enter an uptrend following a prolonged period of decline– suggesting that the crypto could be poised to see further upside in the days and weeks ahead.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up over 2.5% at its current price of $9,000. The benchmark cryptocurrency is currently in the process of surmounting this previously strong resistance region, and a sustained break above it could lead it to see some immense momentum.
It is important to keep in mind that the crypto did face a few strong rejections within the region over the past couple of days, with resistance being established at $9,200 and $9,500.
The lack of an intense downtrend following these rejections is likely the result of this movement being driven primarily by spot purchases rather than by margin traders – a trend that is elucidated while looking towards the massive decline in open interest seen throughout the past few days.
It also appears that retail investors are beginning to grow more active as margin traders flee the market, as Bitcoin’s trading volume has rocketed higher as of late, as seen by data from Arcane Research.
Another interesting trend that Arcane points to in their report is that Bitcoin’s volatility appears to be starting to return to normal following a multi-week phase of declining.
Because the market is currently being controlled by spot traders, this increase in volatility could primarily favor buyers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">After oil's wild ride, could other commodities drop below zero?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After crude oil made headlines worldwide last week for trading below zero, many investors began to wonder if other commodities could become worthless.
To market historians, oil is not an aberration; many other markets have plunged below zero as well and serve as a warning that negative prices can come again.
Rotten food prices
As part of the coronavirus supply-chain disruptions, some dairy farmers are seeing demand collapse as processors are overwhelmed and unable to handle additional fresh milk supply. As cows continue to produce milk daily, farmers can be overrun with supply, forcing them to dump their milk on the ground, a sign that it has lost all value in the short run.
Similarly, as slaughterhouses have closed or reduced capacity due to coronavirus outbreaks, poultry and hog farmers have nowhere to take animals and are culling the animals they cannot sell.
One of the most famous examples of worthless commodities comes from 1956, when traders hoarded onions and then flooded the market with supply, driving prices for a 50-pound bag full of onions down to 10 cents per bag, less than the empty bag was worth.
Energy markets zapped
Energy markets have been prone to negative prices as well, as storing these products presents logistical issues.
Oil and natural gas producers have seen effective negative prices when pipelines or storage is full. Additionally, electricity prices in California can go negative when nuclear power and renewable energy flood the market, driving prices so low that producers pay end users to use up excess supply.
Get paid to borrow money?
Negative interest rates, heretofore thought impossible, have become commonplace in Japan, Northern Europe, and finally for short-term U.S. lending.
This week, for example, the European Central Bank announced they would loan money to banks at a negative 1%, paying banks to borrow money. In turn, some banks are now lending at negative rates, paying consumers to take out a loan!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coal India April Shipments Fall 25.5% as Lockdown Erodes Demand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Coal India Ltd.’s shipments in April slumped 25.5% from a year earlier after more than a month-long nationwide lockdown halted economic activity, eroding demand for India’s most dominant energy source.
Shipments dropped to 39.1 million tons in the month, the Kolkata-based miner said in a filing late Friday. Output declined 10.9% to 40.4 million tons.
Global coal demand is heading for its biggest annual drop since World War II with burning the fuel to make electricity becoming unprofitable and socially untenable in several countries. The pandemic has only served to hasten its demise. The lockdown in India has shut factories and offices slashing electricity demand by about a quarter, affecting the use of coal and causing inventories to swell to record levels.z
India extended the stay-at-home restrictions for most parts of the country for another two weeks starting May 4.
“Coal India’s output is expected to remain muted until demand starts picking up,” Rupesh Sankhe, an analyst at Elara Capital India Pvt. in Mumbai, said before the company reported the data. “It will probably look at new customers, especially those that depend on imported coal, to shore up shipments.”
Despite the demand for the fuel crashing, the miner has set a higher output and shipments target for the fiscal year that began April 1 on expectations of a revival after the lockdown is lifted, coal minister Pralhad Joshi said last week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett’s company reported a nearly $50 billion loss on Saturday because of a huge drop in the paper value of its investments, though the company is still sitting on a huge pile of cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That’s down from last year’s profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.
Berkshire’s revenue grew 1 per cent to $61.27 billion.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently
On Saturday afternoon, Buffett plans to lead an abbreviated online version of Berkshire’s annual meeting without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend. The company shifted to an online meeting and cancelled all the events surrounding the event because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Glencore's Zambia subsidiary to resume mining operations temporarily</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LUSAKA — Glencore’s Zambian subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) will resume mining operations for 90 days but still expects to go ahead with its initial plan to place its mining operations on care and maintenance, the local firm said on Sunday.
Glencore’s original announcement that it planned to put MCM under “care and maintenance” sparked a backlash from Zambia’s government, which threatened to revoke the firm’s mining licenses saying it had not given enough notice.
Mopani said in a statement that constructive discussions had taken place with the Zambian government.
“During the 90-day period, Mopani will continue to engage with the government on potential solutions to its current challenges,” the statement said.
It said the health and safety of the workforce and surrounding communities was a top priority and Mopani would engage with its employees, relevant contractors and local communities regarding the restart of operations.
Mines ministry permanent secretary Barnaby Mulenga said Glencore had told the government last month that it wanted to keep operating its Zambian copper mining subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) rather than shutter operations. (Reporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Edmund Blair)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN — The Chinese unit of Germany’s TUI , the world’s biggest tourism group, said on Sunday it has resumed offering holiday packages in China and urged the European Union (EU) to lift travel restrictions in place to curb the coronavirus.
The resumption of business in China, three months after TUI’s activities there were halted, is focused on short breaks in the mountains and beach resorts.
Other packages include trips in the vicinity of big cities.
“Our offices in Peking and Shanghai were open during the crisis but were not allowed to sell holiday packages,” TUI Chief Executive Fritz Joussen said in a statement.
“We now see a significant backlog of demand for holidays. TUI China will in the coming weeks broaden its offers step by step.”
The global tourism industry is closely watching trends in China for clues to travel patterns in other major markets once the virus, which has infected 3.44 million people and killed 243,00 worldwide, is under control and curbs on movement ease.
Since April, there have been signs of a recovery in China’s tourism market, and aviation experts expect domestic travel in most markets will recover before international travel.
Travel within China is also complicated by movement curbs retained in some regions, such as Beijing, the capital, to guard against a second wave of infections from aboard.
Joussen urged the EU to put in place a concept that allows for the resumption of holiday travel within the bloc, where border restrictions have been in place since March.
“The EU and its member states should develop a timetable for resuming travel within Europe and make holidays possible in 2020,” he said, citing Greece, Cyprus, Spanish islands, Austria and Bulgaria which have made progress toward reopening resorts.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer ruled out reopening Germany’s border with Austria to holidaymakers in an interview with mass-selling Bild newspaper, citing the risk of a second coronavirus outbreak.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New €6bn package of measures to help firms post-COVID</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Commercial rates are to be waived for three months for business impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A shortfall of €260m on local authorities is to be funded by the Government.
It is part of a new package of supports worth over €6bn agreed by Cabinet.
It includes allowing companies to get a low-interest rate loan to re-open their business.
The measures were agreed at a special Saturday Cabinet meeting, following the publication on Friday of a roadmap for re-opening business.
The Government has already brought forward a series of measures - such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment - but says it is now necessary to introduce a number of additional measures.
Those include a €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019.
A €2bn Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund will also be available within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).
This will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms.
While a €2bn COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme will also support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years with below market interest rates.
It will also see the ‘warehousing’ of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months after trading recommences.
During this time, the Government says there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue, and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.
The Revenue Commissioners confirmed that COVID-19 related VAT and payroll tax debts - due March 1st to the date when sectoral restrictions are lifted - will be parked for a period of 12 months.
It also said no interest will accrue on the tax debts during this 12 month period.
And after that period, the related tax debts will carry a reduced interest rate of 3%  - down from 10% - until the debt is paid.
Revenue added: "The timeframe allowed to pay the ‘warehoused’ debt will be flexible and determined by the ability of the business to pay both COVID-19 related debts as well meeting its ongoing tax liabilities as they arise in the normal course".
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said: "On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
"We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people."
Business Minister Heather Humphreys said: "We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.
“The new €250m Restart Fund in particular will be a critically important tool to support small businesses in our towns and villages to re-open their doors and get back on their feet with supports of up to €10,000 available."
And Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy added: "The commercial rates waiver is an important response from Government.
"This will provide relief to impacted businesses as well as certainty to local authorities as to their funding.
"Rates alleviation will be complemented by the establishment of a Restart Fund for micro and small businesses which would provide a further €250m to support ratepayers."

The Government had already brought forward a series of measures to support those impacted by the pandemic - including emergency income support such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.

Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
Minister Donohoe said: “Covid-19 has created a world that none of us could have imagined just a few short weeks ago. Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses, and our economy, have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality.
.
"But, by working together, we are minimising the damage. The hard work of the Irish people has ensured that we are getting to grips with this disease, our people are united in caring for one another under the most extreme of circumstances and our businesses are attempting to adapt to this new and most challenging environment.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.

"We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Utqiagvik sees record low after unusually warm April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UTQIAGVIK, Alaska — The temperature in Alaska’s northernmost city of Utqiagvik reached 20 degrees below zero on Wednesday, a record low for April 29 and the first record low since 2007.
“It’s also the latest in the season with a low of -20F or lower,” Rick Thoman said in a post on Twitter. Thoman is a climatologist with the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks. The previous record was a low of 24 degrees below zero on April 28, 1964.
“Of course, the record low is really just one day,” Thoman said. “For April as a whole, this was the sixth warmest April in the last century at Utqiagvik.”
Utqiagvik has also set or tied record high temperatures as well.
Thoman told the Alaska Energy Desk that “112 daily record highs have been set or tied.”
The most recent occurred on March 24, when a high of 22 degrees beat the previous record of 21 set in 2019, he said.
Utqiagvik is not the only one seeing this trend.
Sea ice plays a huge role in the fluctuations of temperatures, and with lower sea ice in the Arctic, record lows are harder to come by, opening up the Arctic to absorb sunlight and warmth, prolonging the warmer months and leading to a series of records high, KTVA-TV reported.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted a higher chance of warmer-than-normal temperatures for Utqiagvik during the month of May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Utqiagvik sees record low after unusually warm April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UTQIAGVIK, Alaska — The temperature in Alaska’s northernmost city of Utqiagvik reached 20 degrees below zero on Wednesday, a record low for April 29 and the first record low since 2007.
“It’s also the latest in the season with a low of -20F or lower,” Rick Thoman said in a post on Twitter. Thoman is a climatologist with the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks. The previous record was a low of 24 degrees below zero on April 28, 1964.
“Of course, the record low is really just one day,” Thoman said. “For April as a whole, this was the sixth warmest April in the last century at Utqiagvik.”
Utqiagvik has also set or tied record high temperatures as well.
Thoman told the Alaska Energy Desk that “112 daily record highs have been set or tied.”
The most recent occurred on March 24, when a high of 22 degrees beat the previous record of 21 set in 2019, he said.
Utqiagvik is not the only one seeing this trend.
Sea ice plays a huge role in the fluctuations of temperatures, and with lower sea ice in the Arctic, record lows are harder to come by, opening up the Arctic to absorb sunlight and warmth, prolonging the warmer months and leading to a series of records high, KTVA-TV reported.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted a higher chance of warmer-than-normal temperatures for Utqiagvik during the month of May.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government is investing $240 million to bring healthcare online amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
During his daily briefing on May 3rd, Trudeau noted that the government is expanding existing tools and creating new virtual platforms for mental health and primary care.
He stated that the online platform for mental health will include strategies to manage stress and also allow people to get support from a professional. Further, Canadians who are in marginalized communities and who require specialized tools will be able to get specific help.
The $240 million investment will also include funding for virtual primacy care. Trudeau said this is important for times when you don’t necessarily need to see a doctor in person.
“By helping doctors run appointments online, you can stay safe at home while getting care, and our hospitals can stay focused on those who need it most,” Trudeau said.
He stated that since Canadians are practicing physical distancing, now is the perfect time to invest in online healthcare.
“If we can use apps to order dinner, video chats to stay in touch with family, we can use new technology to keep each other healthy.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the money was meant to provide safer options for patients amid the pandemic.
“Over the last four months Canada has faced challenge and heartbreak in a way we never expected,” Trudeau said.
The federal government is also provided $175 million in funding to AbCellera Biologics Inc. after promising research on developing antibodies and a vaccine for COVID-19. Trudeau also confirmed the extra $300 per child in Child Benefit Payments for May.
More to come.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple's most important product launch in years could be in jeopardy, but Wall Street doesn't seem to care, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple provided its first glimpse at how the coronavirus has impacted its business on Thursday when it reported its second-quarter earnings. While Apple generated more revenue than analysts had expected, the quarter still looked far different than Apple had expected before the COVID-19 crisis upended daily life and rattled the economy.
The report provided some answers about how Apple’s core business segments are performing. But there’s still a big question lingering over the company’s business as the second half of 2020 approaches. And it didn’t come up once on Apple’s earnings call with analysts: How will the pandemic impact the development and reception of Apple’s anticipated 5G iPhone?
Recent reports have painted an unclear picture of what to expect from Apple’s typical fall iPhone launch. That’s critical because although Apple’s services and wearables divisions are growing, the iPhone still generates far more revenue for Apple than any other product. And the long-rumored iPhone 12, expected to be Apple’s first 5G iPhone, is projected to drive significant upgrades.
Some analysts, like those from JPMorgan and Wedbush Securities, think it’s plausible that Apple’s anticipated 5G iPhone could be delayed by a couple of months. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who has become the most reliable source of Apple leaks, has said some versions of Apple’s next iPhone may launch a few weeks later than planned, but will still likely debut in the fall timeframe.
If this is true, it wouldn’t be the first time Apple has launched new iPhones outside of its typical September release window. The iPhone X launched in November 2017 after being unveiled that September, while the iPhone XR debuted in October 2018.
Should that be the case this year, Apple would still benefit from launching its iPhone before the all-important holiday holiday season.
A bigger potential issue for Apple may not be whether the iPhone 12’s launch is delayed, but whether there will be enough demand for a high-end iPhone. With jobless claims in the US reaching 30 million over the past six weeks as the coronavirus has disrupted the economy, it’s unclear whether those in the window of an upgrade would be willing to pay nearly $1,000 for a new iPhone.
The Japanese financial news site Nikkei Asian Review reported in March that Apple has discussed delaying the release of the expected iPhone 12 because it’s concerned that “the current situation would significantly lower consumer appetite.”
Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed the current state of consumer demand on the call, saying that it has seen an uptick across the board in the second half of April. But for the most part, analysts didn’t question how the pandemic could impact future product development and demand.
Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, believes weak demand could be a risk for Apple and most other companies. Still, he doesn’t think Apple will be hurt in the long term.
“I think what’s important though is that [Apple] has a very strong balance sheet, and you have a management team that’s continuing to innovate and invest in their products and services,” Flax said to Business Insider. “It is likely that Apple is going to come out stronger on the other side.”
Given the high expectations around Apple’s 5G iPhone’s, it’s a little surprising that such concerns were not brought up when Apple executives fielded answers from analysts on Thursday. Even before the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro were announced last fall, analysts had pegged the upcoming 5G iPhone as being the jolt the company needed to pull Apple out of its iPhone sales slump.
It’s possible that the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro’s better-than-expected performance in Apple’s fiscal first quarter has calmed some of these concerns. Apple’s iPhone sales fell again in its fiscal second quarter, but expectations were already low considering Apple previously said it didn’t expect to meet its initial second-quarter revenue guidance.
Another possibility is that analysts didn’t want to bother asking a question that Apple wouldn’t be willing to address- or even have the answer to yet. When the subject came up on last quarter’s earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said global 5G deployment is still in its “early innings.”
Plus, there’s still time for production on a fall iPhone to ramp up, says Robert Muller, enterprise hardware analyst for RBC Capital Markets.
“The late July call will probably have questions on the issue,” Muller said to Business Insider via email. “However, again we know the answer will be ‘we don’t comment on future products.'”
While it’s true that Apple rarely if ever discusses upcoming products before they’re announced, that hasn’t stopped analysts from probing the tech giant about its roadmap in the past. Even on Thursday’s call, some questions about Apple’s forward-looking strategy did come up – just not as it relates to the 5G iPhone.
Overall, Apple’s second-quarter earnings didn’t reveal much that wasn’t already known. Yes, like just about every company, the COVID-19 crisis has posed challenges to Apple’s business. Yes, Apple’s services and wearables businesses are still doing very well, and are serving as a bright spot amid slowing iPhone sales as they have in other recent quarters.
And, above all, there’s still a lot of uncertainty about what the future may hold for the iPhone and Apple’s business more broadly. In an unusual move, Apple did not offer revenue guidance for the June quarter because of uncertainties around the virus in the near term.
Cook did say, however, that the company has adapted to working from home and that the iPhone SE and iPad Pro have proved the company’s business is continuing even during these difficult times.
“And so, while we can’t say for sure how many chapters are in this book,” Cook said, “we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one.”

Plus, there’s still time for production on a fall iPhone to ramp up, says Robert Muller, enterprise hardware analyst for RBC Capital Markets.
“The late July call will probably have questions on the issue,” Muller said to Business Insider via email. “However, again we know the answer will be ‘we don’t comment on future products.'”
While it’s true that Apple rarely if ever discusses upcoming products before they’re announced, that hasn’t stopped analysts from probing the tech giant about its roadmap in the past. Even on Thursday’s call, some questions about Apple’s forward-looking strategy did come up – just not as it relates to the 5G iPhone.
Overall, Apple’s second-quarter earnings didn’t reveal much that wasn’t already known. Yes, like just about every company, the COVID-19 crisis has posed challenges to Apple’s business. Yes, Apple’s services and wearables businesses are still doing very well, and are serving as a bright spot amid slowing iPhone sales as they have in other recent quarters.
And, above all, there’s still a lot of uncertainty about what the future may hold for the iPhone and Apple’s business more broadly. In an unusual move, Apple did not offer revenue guidance for the June quarter because of uncertainties around the virus in the near term.
Cook did say, however, that the company has adapted to working from home and that the iPhone SE and iPad Pro have proved the company’s business is continuing even during these difficult times.
“And so, while we can’t say for sure how many chapters are in this book,” Cook said, “we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Customers skip the line as warehouse, sample sales shift online amid pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER - Last year, more than 2,000 shoppers descended on a Toronto pop-up store, looking for deals at undergarment maker Knix's first warehouse sale. It was a success: the company sold out of most items during the three-day event and needed to double its staffing.
Knix planned a bigger event for April 2020 at a space four times larger, but scrapped that plan in favour of a virtual sale as the COVID-19 pandemic created insurmountable challenges for an in-person event.
"That became clear when we went to remote work and closed our stores," said founder and chief executive officer Joanna Griffiths.
Some retailers known for annual warehouse or seasonal sample sales are shifting those events online amid the pandemic and finding the digital switch offers new benefits such as broader customer reach, lower overhead and more consumer insights.
For Knix, the virtual event outstripped last year's in-person sale.
About 3,000 customers waited for the Knix site to go live at 10 a.m. April 23, the company said.
It sold more items in the first 10 minutes of this year's sale than over the three-day event in March 2019, and in just over an hour its sales outdid all of Black Friday. In the first 30 minutes, it rung up $500,000 in sales.
The success was welcome after the scramble to quickly shift the event online.
The company hustled to build two new websites for the virtual sale — one for Canadian consumers and one for Americans. It worked with its fulfillment centre, which was originally going to transport garments to the warehouse sale, to move inventory into the online system instead.
One of the biggest challenges to navigate would be managing the assortment of items.
The company had to work to remove or hide products from the website quickly as they run out, said Griffiths, to avoid frustrating customers.
Customers also couldn't try items on before committing to a final sale, meaning no returns allowed. Knix planned to make staff available for online support to help shoppers select sizes.
Sizing items virtually was also an issue for Hilary MacMillan, a Toronto-based womenswear brand, at a digital sample earlier this month.
The fashion brand founded in 2013 holds several such in-person events each year and had one planned for the end of April, said Lindsay Ditkofsky, the company's vice-president of brand development.
The coronavirus pandemic prompted the label to shift the sale online. The label, which sells runway samples initially created to clothe models much taller than the average consumer, knew sizing could be problematic in the virtual space.
"There's always a challenge when it comes to how does something fit a body," said Ditkofsky, adding the company attempted to overcome that problem by providing detailed item descriptions and accurate size charts.
Knix realized the online process would be smoother for customers in some ways.
In 2019, eager customers lined up around an entire block of downtown Toronto. With a virtual sale, there's no waiting in line, Griffiths said.
Shoppers didn't have to navigate a large space filled with clothes either. All the products were laid out neatly online with about 20 staff available over live chat to answer questions.
This makes for an easier shopping experience, said Griffiths.
Hilary MacMillan saw some benefits to the business as well.
"Any time you do something digital, there's sort of a paper trail," said Ditkofsky.
Website analytics showed the company where visitors were located, how many were coming to the site for the first time and other metrics that a brick-and-mortar sale doesn't provide, she said.
It also allowed the company to reach more customers than just those near its Toronto studio space, which it uses for the sales and personal appointments.
"We reached a totally new level of customer that we haven't been able to touch before with this kind of event."
Griffiths has started suggesting to her industry peers that they should think about moving warehouse sales online as well, though she's yet to hear of another company planning a similar move.
Vancouver-based clothing retailer Aritzia Inc. holds an annual, multi-day warehouse sale in Vancouver. The company declined an interview request.
"At this point, no decisions have been made regarding our warehouse sale," wrote Anna Cordon, senior manager of public relations.
For Knix and Hilary MacMillan, the switch to a virtual warehouse sale may become permanent.
Griffiths expects the company will hold next year's event online regardless of whether physical distancing restrictions are still in place.
"Now that we've done all this work and ... we think it's better for so many reasons, I think this will be a virtual, annual thing," she said.
The fashion label, on the other hand, wants to incorporate the digital component while continuing in-person events, said Ditkofsky.
Both women believe Canadian consumers, who are often criticized for lagging behind Americans in e-commerce, will become more comfortable shopping online during the pandemic, especially as more retailers move their stores online and finesse the digital experience.
"I think that Canadians are more comfortable shopping online than we give them credit for," said Griffiths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“The government is sending $1,200 to everyone,” I say to my husband. “Not everyone,” he says.
“Will we get it?” I ask. “Yes, we file jointly as a married couple, and we make less than $150,000. We will both get a check,” he says. “I know what I am doing with mine,” I say. “I am getting counseling.”
My husband and I have lost a portion of our income during the stay-at-home orders, but luckily we kept enough of it to cover our monthly expenses. We are some of the lucky few who can decide what to do with our stimulus checks.
We know many people have to use it to dig their way out of the total loss of their income. Many others will need to use it to try and catch up on rent or car payments, or to put groceries on the table.
Our stimulus checks haven’t even hit our bank account yet, and already I’ve signed up for counseling with an online service. Getting therapy is the best use of that money that I could imagine.
I have never gone so long worrying about my husband every time he touches his face, takes out the trash, goes to the garage in our condo to sort the recycling. Every time he leaves the safe bubble of our little condo, I prepare myself with Clorox wipes to wipe down the doorknobs, his keys, and anything he touches before washing his hands.
I am like a drill sergeant barking orders, “Don’t touch that! Wash your hands for 20 seconds! Leave your mask on until your hands are clean! Take off your shoes!” He knows I am highly anxious, and he responds to all of my commands, but he looks exhausted.
I need someone to walk me through the changes we are experiencing. I need someone to help me replace some of the fear and anxiety I feel with calm and acceptance. This situation is new. I can’t Google the best way to handle a pandemic. And although the market is wide open for it, I haven’t seen any self-help books on how to adjust or thrive during the biggest disruption of our lifetimes.
And it isn’t only what we are going through now. It is also about all that is coming. How do I adjust my fear when my husband goes back to his office? How do I accept brunch or dinner invitations at restaurants with friends? How do I resume my afternoon coffee break with my neighbor? Will I ever love and trust grocery shopping again? Will getting the mail ever be something that I look forward to instead of avoiding?
The virus has brought with it so many questions. How do I carry the grief? I have lost people I know. People I love have lost their parents. Family members have loved ones who are sick. There is no way to visit the sick or dying. My childhood friend’s mother died alone without the touch or comfort of her children. It is so much to process and work through, and we aren’t alone. We need to comfort those in our inner circle who are also struggling with their own grief, stress, loss of income, etc.
From the beginning of this pandemic, we have had to rely on people. We have taken our cues from scientists, cheered their research efforts toward a cure or vaccination. We have honored and tried to take care of our doctors, nurses, paramedics, grocery clerks, drivers, trash collectors, and all those people who are making a significant contribution to all of our lives. We have even had to count on our neighbors to stay home, to wear masks, to protect each other.
It is no surprise that with my stimulus money, I am once again turning to a human being to help me get through the most challenging and swiftly changing time of my life. I’m hoping to learn coping mechanisms for now and into the future. The money will be well spent.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(CNN) - The slowdown at meat processing plants from the coronavirus pandemic has led to a new wave of panic-shopping.
This has led some grocery stores to impose limits on meat purchases.
Kroger said it is limiting ground beef and pork purchases in some of its stores.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Leeroy Jenkins Of Tech Sends Tweet, Wipes $14 Billion Off Tesla's Market Value</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla stocks are too damn high, or something like that. At least that’s what Elon Musk said on Twitter earlier today, “Tesla stock price is too high imo.” It appears that, once again, the stock market was listening.
As Ars Technica points out, before Musk sent that tweet, Tesla stock was around $US760 ($1,184) a share, but 20 minutes later it dropped to $US722 ($1,124), or five per cent lower. As of the writing of this article, Tesla stock sits at $US702 ($1,093) a share, or $US80 ($125) less than yesterday’s closing price. At the moment, about $US14 ($22) billion has been wiped from the market value of Tesla.
This isn’t the first time Musk has tweeted something that got him in trouble. In August 2018, he claimed that Tesla had secured funding to take Tesla private at $US420 ($654) per share. But the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against him for that tweet (and others), saying that he violated market-manipulation laws. In the lawsuit, the SEC sought to remove Musk as Tesla’s CEO as well as one of its board members.
The SEC won the case, resulting in Musk and Tesla being ordered to pay $US40 ($62) million in penalties to harmed investors. The settlement included provisions that required him to have Tesla approve any and all of his communications (including Tweets) that could affect stock price before he made them public. However, the SEC made a second filling against Musk in March 2019 for not having any of his tweets officially approved. It seems like Musk would be in the wrong again here, given that Tesla stock prices fell soon after his ‘Tesla stock is too high’ tweet. (Hey, maybe he got that boneheaded tweet approved!) Tesla did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment, we’ll update this post when we receive a reply.
The original filing did not specify a time frame on that provision, only that Musk would be ineligible to be re-elected Chairman for three years, so not until 2021. It’s conceivable that he’ll still need a Twitter babysitter regardless. Or maybe just a babysitter in general. Today, The Wall Street Journal reached out to Musk to ask if he was joking or if he had his tweet vetted. He responded with a short, “No.”
It’s been a crazy week for Musk, to say the least. He went on an earnings call rant, claiming that covid-19 lockdown policies were akin to fascism, tweeted “FREE AMERICA NOW,” and pulled NASA into the mess by dismissing a reporter for asking a covid-19 related question. Oh, and he claims he’s selling almost all of his physical possessions, including his house, to devote himself to Mars and Earth. His GF is mad at him for saying that, but at least Musk made the stipulation that whoever buys his home can’t tear it down since it was once Gene Wilder’s home, and its soul must remain intact.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seed supply website connects local farmers and gardeners</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An online seed database created by a local organization has become a growing success with gardeners and farmers across Canada.
Seed Finder is a website residents can use to find and purchase seeds of locally adapted vegetables within their area. 
Created by Seeds of Diversity Canada in Waterloo, it features the names and locations of more than 200 seed companies and farmers across the country, organized by region. The website also offers an online catalogue for planters and home delivery.
Jane Rabinowicz is the executive director of SeedChange, one of the partners who helped create the website.
She says with a rising demand for sustainable food, Seed Finder aims to help Canada build its own supply of local vegetable seeds.
"What many people don't know is that the vast majority of vegetable seeds that are planted on farms across the country are imported, " She said, "So even if you're buying a carrot from your local farmers market, there's a high likelihood that that carrot came from somewhere else."
Besides encouraging the use of "Canadian made" seeds, Rabinowicz says the diversity of seeds available on Seed Finder provide a lot of nutritional and sustainable benefits for planters.
"The diversity of the genes within the crops help to withstand environmental changes, which is going to be more and more important as our climate continues to change." said Rabinowicz. "Anything from tomatoes to peppers to broccoli to chard and kale seeds are available for purchase."
According to Rabinowicz, gardening has historically seen a rise in participation after human disasters like the Great Depression and World War ll. 
"There has been such an enormous expansion in interest in food security.... seed stores have seen a six to ten times in the volume of demand." said Rabinowicz.
With a rise in gardeners during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rabinowicz says she hopes to see those same numbers after the crisis winds down.
"It's a healthy act, it's a useful act, it's also the awareness of the importance of local food has become during this pandemic." said Rabinowicz.
"With border closures, with more people becoming food insecure due to losing their jobs," said Rabinowicz, "With all the ripple effects that we have seen of the pandemic across the food system, people are so aware of the food supply, where our food comes from, and supporting our local farmers... and supporting their local seed companies."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Online classical music festival opens with Melbourne's best</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUSIC
FACES OF OUR ORCHESTRAS OPENING GALA ★★★★
Melbourne Digital Concert Hall, May 1
Amid the current devastation of the arts, Melbourne Digital Concert Hall, which has raised more than $100,000 for classical musicians since its inception less than two months ago, is a rare good news story. This week, Melbourne’s orchestral players are the focus of a festival of 14 concerts celebrating the breadth and depth of their talent.
Festivities opened with a program led by Melbourne Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Dale Barltrop. Barltrop and colleagues Isin Cakmakcioglu and Gabby Halloran shone in Dvorak’s Terzetto in C major for two violins and viola, Op. 74, giving an account that was both robust and refined. The admirably rich blend of the group’s tone revealed the composer’s grander, symphonic ambitions in this work, which was written as a piece of domestic chamber music.
After an introduction with neatly contrasted ideas came a nostalgic Larghetto whose long arc of melody was beautifully spun. A rustic scherzo, typical of Dvorak, was the perfect foil to the finale’s theme and variations in which Barltrop urged his friends on to an impassioned finish.
A brace of Bach’s two-part inventions played by Barltrop and MSO principal cello David Berlin, were well varied in mood and texture and displayed the players’ agile, keenly responsive ensemble skills.
Barltrop and Berlin were joined by MSO principal viola, Chris Moore for Beethoven’s String Trio in C minor, Op. 9, No. 3. The quicksilver energy that was evident from all three players at the beginning never flagged throughout the work, except in the Adagio where a beguiling beauty of tone prevailed.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MEDIA STATEMENT
Strong international demand for New Zealand’s food, despite the global effects of COVID-19, could help provide a springboard to get more Kiwis into primary sector jobs, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said.
“The latest provisional trade statistics show our apples and kiwifruit continue to be star performers, with $890 million of fruit exported between 1 February and 22 April 2020,” Damien O’Connor said.
“Our dairy and meat sectors are also holding their own into April and they shipped products to overseas customers worth $6.18 billion over the same period.
“Overall primary sector export revenue remains higher into April than for the same period in 2018, despite the forestry sector essentially being shut down over the past month. Now we’ve moved into Alert Level 3, industries affected by the lockdown such as forestry and wool are back into action and that will help.
“The strength of New Zealand’s primary sector coupled with the success of our health response to COVID-19 gives us a head-start on the world as we get our economy moving again.
“Our primary sector contributes over $46 billion dollars a year in exports to our economy and provides jobs for hundreds of thousands of people in our rural communities. These latest stats show the sector is in a strong position to help us reboot our economy.
Mr O’Connor said the primary sector will need about 50,000 more people in a post-COVID-19 world.
“There are jobs going all over the country ranging from hands on work in orchards, on farms, in forests and fishing boats, to professional roles in engineering, science and management.
“The Government is working alongside the primary sector to help ensure workers get to the places they are needed. We’re currently investigating further ways we can boost the primary sector workforce through the Government’s $100m redeployment scheme.
“I’ve been impressed by the way the primary sector, government agencies and others have come together to support each other, further reinforcing that our team of 5 million is just as important now as during the lockdown,” Damien O’Connor said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus impact: US sport shutdown will cost $12 billion, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The $100 billion US sports landscape will lose $12 billion in revenue due to the coronavirus shutdown, ESPN reported, with deeper cuts if National Football League (NFL) and college gridiron games are wiped out.
Analysis of the magnitude of business losses includes superstar salaries to pay for stadium workers but it might be a conservative estimate because it does not include outdoor recreational sport, gambling or such individual sports as golf, tennis and NASCAR, the most popular form of US auto racing.
Patrick Rishe, sports business program director at Washington University in St.
Louis, estimated the impact of the shutdown on major US pro and college sports leagues as well as youth sport for ESPN, which also had labor market analysis firm Emsi make sport-related job estimates.
Rishe estimated US pro sports would lose $5.5 billion from the shutdown while college sports would lose $3.9 billion and youth sport tourism would fall by $2.4 billion.
And those figures assume Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer can finish half of their scheduled seasons with spectators while the NBA and the National Hockey League cancel the unfinished part of their regular seasons and stage playoff games without spectators with youth sports resuming in July.

None of that is assured given the stay-at-home orders remaining in place over most of the nation as a result of the deadly virus that has killed more than 63,000 people in the United States and infected more than one million.
"As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that's taking place -- dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing. All of those phrases, they're all relevant becaus we just have never seen anything on this scale," Rishe told ESPN.
Figures include $3.25 billion that would have been spent by spectators on pro sports plus $371 million of income for stadium and arena workers and $2.2 billion in US television rights fees.
An NFL wipe out would cost more than $11.5 billion in television revenue while 65 major collegiate American football programs receive about $4 billion in TV money, about half the income that finances all athletic department budgets.
There are three million jobs nationwide that depend upon sports, from ushers and guards to scouts and trainers, according to the report.
Rishe said that should MLB play without spectators for half a season for its 162-games-a-team schedule, over $2 billion more in game-day fan spending would be lost.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: With sporting events across the globe either being cancelled or suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, sportspersons have been locked indoors and are spending time not just with family but also by interacting with fans and India's football team captain Sunil Chhetri received a message from a fan who wanted his Netflix ID and password.
Taking to Twitter, Chhetri posted the screenshot of the message he got on Facebook and wrote: "Jersey X Autograph on a picture X Reply to the post X Video wishing the neighbour's son's pet dog X
Here's someone who has priorities straight and it's really making me want to consider the demand."

Tennis star Sania Mirza had a good laugh on Twitter after seeing his post.
Earlier, in a series of tweets, Chhetri had announced that the members of the Indian team had come together and "put on table a sum that has been sent to the PM-Cares Fund" to help in the fight against coronavirus.
Chhetri added that the reason why he was mentioning this on Twitter was so that others who have the capacity to make donations are inspired to do so.
"We've always received more than we can give. Which is why in this time of need, all of us national team players have come together and put on the table a sum that has been sent to the PM-Cares Fund to help India's fight with the pandemic," said Chhetri in a series of tweets.
"It's been heartening to see everyone -- cutting across caps, goals, age and experience -- give, and give with a smile. When word got out, even some who have long stopped pulling on an India shirt, turned up and asked to be counted. That's what a team is all about. The ONLY reason we're talking about this here is so that it can gently prod those who have been fortunate enough to get, to give back. We're in this together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">6 New Predictions For A Post-COVID Economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
With economies around the world re-opening, it’s time to start thinking about what the post-COVID world will look like.
My investment philosophy for navigating macro events is to create a narrative guided by specific, verifiable predictions.
Focusing on verifiable information rather than emotion-driven opinion helps remove bias from the investment process. My initial macro article on 3/10 helped readers understand why S&P 500 earnings in 2020 would likely fall to $140, which would drive the index to 2,400 or below. This was controversial as 2020 estimates were $175 at the time, but estimates have now fallen to $134. My 4/1 article then helped readers understand why aggressive policy action and a near-zero risk free rate meant that the 3/23 lows on the S&P 500 were likely the bottom – a prediction that has held up so far.
For this particular crisis, I have created a narrative for the virus itself, for the economy, and for the market. Today, I update these narratives to include predictions for the post-COVID economy.
I expect April to be the height of the crisis in the northern hemisphere but then worsen in the southern hemisphere in May-August and re-emerge in the northern hemisphere in the fall. The world will have to endure partial or periodic forms of social distancing until an effective treatment, vaccine, or widespread testing becomes available. By Q4 2020, life in the Western Hemisphere will begin to have recognizable daily rhythms, though certain social changes will persist and have economic ramifications. We will, in essence, muddle through a second wave of the virus with far less disruption.
I am adding a prediction that there will be a second wave of deaths in the U.S. between October and December of this year. However, I am also predicting that the number of states with stay-at-home orders will be less than 10 on 11/15.
Exhibit 1. Predictions Regarding The Virus, Treatments, and Social Response

From the get-go, I have called for a GDP decline in Q1 with sharply negative growth in Q2. This has now become consensus. In the U.S., I expect sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4, and positive real GDP growth beginning in Q4 2020.
Beyond GDP growth, post-COVID economic thinking needs to consider the risk of rising inflation, the level of interest rates for “risk-free” assets, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, and permanent structural changes instituted in response to the pandemic threat and its social ramifications. My narrative is as follows:
Today, I am adding two predictions: that the inflation rate will average below 2% for 2020 and that the 10-year yield will still be below 1% on 12/31.
Exhibit 2. Predictions Regarding The Economy
Source: Viceni Investing
My thesis for the equity markets has been that low risk-free rates will drive the market multiple higher, despite earnings estimates that continue to deteriorate. I expect the forward multiple on the S&P 500 will generally stay above 20x while risk-free rates stay low, and it would not surprise me to see the forward multiple approach 25x.
This leads me to predict that the S&P 500 will surpass its prior high by 6/30/21 and that S&P 500 earnings will exceed $170 in 2021.

The week ahead will see another steady stream of earnings reports before the April employment report blazes in from the Labor Department on May 8. Economists expect the unemployment rate to be about 15% after 20M jobs were lost during the month. Average weekly hours are seen plunging to a new record low of 33.5. On the brighter side, the conference calendar picks up next week for investors with virtual events covering industrials, financials and infectious diseases. Economic activity will pick up again as more states open back up to varying degrees, although there are plenty of indications that consumer spending will be slow to return. Will investors sell in May and go away after the Dow rose 28% from its March 23 low and the S&P 500 shot up roughly 27%? Don't ask Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bethany Lily April Shows Off Cleavage And Curves In Snakeskin Bikini For New Bang Energy Video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Jona Jaupi
British bombshell Bethany Lily April sent hearts racing around the world after she posted a smoking-hot new video starring herself on Saturday, May 2. The model took to her Instagram account to share the sexy post with her 2.7 million followers, and it caught the attention of plenty of fans within minutes of going live.
The 23-year-old took center stage as she was recorded outdoors basking in the sun on what appeared to be a rooftop deck of a high-rise building. Bethany exuded a very seductive vibe as she switched between a number of sexy poses in front of the camera while sipping on a Bang Energy drink. Furthermore, she directed her glance into the camera’s lens throughout most of the video.
Bethany’s long blond locks were styled straight as they cascaded down her back and over her shoulders. She further added some glamour to the look by rocking a full face of makeup that complemented her fair complexion. The application included foundation, eyeshadow, eyeliner, bronzer, and a nude lipstick. What stole the show, though, was Bethany’s enviable physique, which she flaunted in a skimpy two-piece bikini.
Bethany’s swimsuit bra, which featured a green snakeskin-print design, tied around her neck. The tiny top tightly hugged her full-figured assets as it exposed plenty of cleavage, a bit of underboob, and sideboob.
The beauty paired the swimwear top with bottoms that were equally as revealing as they were cut in a classic Brazilian style thong that displayed most of her pert derriere. The high-waisted side straps, which were quite thin and raised up past her hip bones, also drew attention to Bethany’s flat midriff.
The beauty did not include a geotag in the post, however, she detailed in the caption that this video was a promotional shot for Bang Energy, a health and fitness supplement company, before tagging several accounts, including Bang Energy’s CEO.
The sizzling video was received with instantaneous support from thousands of Bethany’s fans, accumulating more than 4,000 likes and 5,000 views in just the first 10 minutes after going live. An additional 200 followers also quickly took to the comments section to shower the model with compliments on her beauty, her body, and her bikini.
“You look great in the bikini,” one social media user commented.
“Pure beauty as always, have a great weekend,” added a second fan.
“You are so beautiful, Bethany,” a third admirer chimed in.
“So so pretty,” complimented a fourth person.
Bethany has shared a number of sexy looks on her social media account as of late. On April 23, she wowed her fans after she sported a gold dress that did not leave much to the imagination as it showed off her assets and curvy figure, per The Inquisitr. That post has received more than 100,000 likes so far.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Retailer Lidl Ireland says it is to temporarily stop sale of certain items due to longer queues at some stores.
This includes a Crivit outdoor trampoline, Smoby garden slide, Gemini swingset and a wooden kitchen.
In a statement, the company says: "At Lidl, the safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority.
"We have implemented numerous measures across all of our stores over the past two months in order to ensure appropriate social distancing can be achieved.
"Due to unprecedented and exceptional demand on certain items in recent days, we have seen queues form outside our stores prior to opening.
"These queues have made social distancing externally more challenging".
It adds that the items, which were due to be sold on Monday May 4th, will go on sale at a later date.
It has apologised to customers - but says "the safety of our team and customers must take priority at this challenging time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Second Economic Stimulus Package Confirmed? PM Modi Meets Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman to Finalise Details</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: A day after the nationwide lockdown has been extended for two more weeks starting from May 4, with several relaxations at comparatively lesser risk zones, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a series of meetings with key ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and officials of economic ministries to firm up the second stimulus package for sectors impacted by lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, sources said.

While the first package was aimed at mitigating the hardships of the poor, the second package might have something for small and medium enterprises and India Inc.

The finance ministry, which deferred the release of monthly GST collection numbers on Friday, is also scheduled to make a detailed presentation to the prime minister later in the day on the state of the economy and several initiatives that it plans to undertake to stimulate Indian economy.
The prime minister already had meetings with different ministries including civil aviation, labour and power on Friday. He had detailed deliberation with commerce and MSME ministries among others on Thursday with focus on attracting both domestic and overseas investment and revival of small businesses in the country so that the recovery process is hastened.
During these meetings both the home minister and the finance minister were present.
The government had first imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown beginning March 25 and later extended it till May 3. The lockdown shut businesses, stopped air and rail travel and restricted movement of people and goods. While agricultural and industrial works are limping back to normalcy, owing to the embargo on inter-state transport, economic activities will continue to receive a hit in the third phase.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian industry need to undertake technological upgradation and import substitution to attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday.
The minister has been exhorting the industry to capitalise on growing "hatred" against China amid coronavirus pandemic.
Interacting with members of the FICCI Ladies Organisation in a webinar, the minister for MSME and Road Transport and Highways said recommendations for "another big package" have been shared with the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, and said he was "hopeful of a declaration soon".

Gadkari also expressed confidence that 25 lakh MSMEs will be restructured by the end of the year.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extended the restructuring of debt schemes beyond the deadline of March 31, 2020, to December 31, 2020.
Observing that big industries from nations including Japan, the US, Germany and other European nations do not want to deal with China anymore and want to shift their businesses out of the country, the minister termed it a "golden opportunity" for Indian industry and entrepreneurs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 99 per cent of the depositors in CKP Co-op Bank will get full payment of the deposits back from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a senior official of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tweeted on Sunday.
The RBI cancelled the licence of CKP Co-op Bank on April 28, and notified the cancellation on its website on Saturday. It said deposits up to Rs 5 lakh are guaranteed by the DICGC. This portion is 99.2 per cent.

“CKP Co-op Bank, Mumbai, has been under the all-inclusive directions of the RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 132,170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2 per cent will get full payment of their deposits from their DICGC,” tweeted Yogesh Dayal, chief general manager of RBI.
RBI, in a statement on Saturday, had said there was no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank and that credible commitment towards revival from the management was not visible.
The bank failed to meet the regulatory requirement of maintaining a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent and reserves. The RBI said the lender was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.
The affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest and the interests of depositors, the RBI statement said. CKP Bank's NPA is more than 97 per cent as it lent to real estate players in and around Mumbai who did not pay back. The bank's total deposits was Rs 485 crore, but the net worth was a negative Rs 239 crore.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cancelled the licence of Mumbai-based The CKP Cooperative Bank Ltd., with effect from the close of business on April 30, 2020, as the lender’s financial position had deteriorated and it was not in a position to repay depositors.
“The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of The CKP Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, and appoint a liquidator for the bank,” RBI said in a late evening statement on Saturday.
The depositors of the bank will get a maximum of ₹5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), as per law. The deposit insurance cover was increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh earlier this year. The bank has a deposit base of ₹485.56 crore, as on November 2019.
“The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible,” the RBI said, giving reasons for the decision.
The bank has negative networth of ₹239.2 crore. It has a customer base of 1,34,167 and has eight branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts.
The banking regulator said the bank did not satisfy the requirement of minimum capital and reserves and was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.
“The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest and interest of the depositors, and the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest,” RBI said.
The banking regulator observed that the bank’s efforts for revival have been ‘far from adequate’ though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations.
“No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further,” the RBI said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple falls after skipping forecast for first time in years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple Inc. reported quarterly revenue that grew 1%, but didn’t provide a forecast for the first time in more than a decade, sparking concern that performance will suffer later this year.
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said Apple experienced a “very depressed” period in late March and early April, in the depths of the Covid-19pandemic, but saw a “pickup” in the second half of this month. The company raised its dividend and expanded a share buyback plan by $50 billion.
Fiscal second-quarter sales came in at $58.3 billion, compared with $58 billion a year earlier. That beat Wall Street estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IPhone revenue was $28.96 billion, down 7%, but also topping analysts’ expectations. Services sales jumped 17% to $13.35 billion, while the wearables and accessories business climbed 23% to $6.28 billion. The shares fell 1.6% on Friday in New York.
“The last part of March and the first part of April were very depressed and then we’ve seen a pickup relative to that period of time in the second half of April,” Cook said in an interview. “I would attribute that partially to the new products that we were able to launch at end of March and early April, the economic stimulus and probably some level of people getting a bit more used to that this is going to last a little while.”
The Cupertino, California-based technology giant did not provide guidance for its June quarter due to the ongoing complications from Covid-19.
“It just spooks people about just how bad the second quarter is going to be,” said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Cannaccord Genuity.
During a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri suggested that challenges continue in the current quarter.
“On iPhone and wearables, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter,” he said. “On iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve.”
Apple has been uniquely impacted by the pandemic. In late January, many of its Asia-based suppliers and manufacturers ground to a halt as part of efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. That resulted in shipping delays for devices and supply constraints. Around that time, it closed all 42 retail stores in China, a key source of revenue for the company, then shut its other retail locations. It’s still waiting to reopen most of them.
In January, the company had projected fiscal second-quarter sales of between $63 and $67 billion, but it pulled the guidance in February as the pandemic starting spreading outside of China.
On Thursday, Maestri said digital content services, such as Apple TV+ and Music, will remain strong, but that the AppleCare warranty business and revenue from advertising deals would again dip. App Store revenue grew double digits in the fiscal second quarter, with paid subscriptions topping 515 million, he noted.
“Our active installed base of devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories,” the CFO said. “We are confident in our future and continue to make significant investments in all areas of our business.”
Apple is also sticking to its M&A strategy, Maestri said, while reiterating a pledge to invest $350 billion in the U.S. economy in coming years.
Apple’s sales in China during the quarter dipped by about $760 million, with increases reported in Europe and Asia Pacific outside of China. The company reported slight annual sales declines in the U.S. and Japan. It launched some new products in the quarter, including the new iPad Pro and a pair of Macs, but the iPhone SE’s debut was delayed about a month into the current quarter.

Cook said foot traffic to its retail stores in China hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. But retail sales hit a quarterly record because of strong online performance.
The CEO also praised the new iPhone SE’s $399 starting price, saying it will attract switchers from Google’s Android and appeal to fans of smaller smartphones.
Cook said Apple’s China-centric supply chain showed strength, but that the company would still investigate tweaks to its processes after the pandemic.
Net income was $11.25 billion, or $2.55 a share, compared with $11.56 billion, or $2.46 a share, a year earlier.
The virus is also impacting efforts to build future products. The company’s four upcoming redesigned iPhones with 5G will launch multiple weeks later than usual, but still by November, Bloomberg News has reported.

Cook said some parts of Apple are more productive when employees work from home, while some are less productive. He told Bloomberg News that staff probably won’t return to Apple’s main campus until early June at the earliest.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a report by Bank of America, lower home prices post-pandemic will be a result of lower household incomes.
While both the Payroll Protection Program and the CARES Act are expected to soften the economic blow to the housing market, BofA predicts the lower end of the housing market will feel the most heat as the hospitality, travel, and energy industries grapple with the economic impacts of the outbreak.
Prior to the pandemic, BofA had estimated that home prices would increase 4% to 5% in 2020, but now it forecasts that home prices will drop until they hit a bottom in April 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre waives cancellation fees after consumer watchdog threatens legal action</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The consumer watchdog was preparing to launch court action against Flight Centre for charging $300 fees to process Covid-19 refunds before the company agreed to end to the practice.
Flight Centre angered many of its customers by charging the $300 fee to each person for each element of their trip that was cancelled due to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions.
The policy led to absurd situations. In one case, a Gold Coast family were asked to pay $2,100 in cancellation fees to process a hotel refund of $1,600 for their seven-person Disneyland trip.
Flight Centre on Saturday announced it will no longer charge the fee if the travel provider cancels its service. In other words, if an airline or tour operator cancels a trip, a customer who booked through Flight Centre will no longer be charged the $300 fee.
Flight Centre is applying the waiver retrospectively to any bookings on or after 13 March, according to Flight Centre executive general manager, Allisa O’Connell.
“The decision to waive fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” O’Connell said.
On Sunday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission revealed the change was made in the face of looming court action.
ACCC chair Rod Sims said the regulator’s next step would have been to take Flight Centre to court, if it did not change its position. Sims said the company’s decision would allow the issue to be dealt with more quickly than legal proceedings.
“This is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre for thousands of customers impacted by Covid-19 travel cancellations,” Sims said on Sunday.
“We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.”
The sector has been thrown into crisis by travel restrictions. The industry’s peak body has lobbied government for additional support and made representations to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that stressed the sector’s reliance on giving credit notes, rather than refunds, in the case of cancelled travel.
In some cases, the crisis has prompted questionable behaviour from tour operators. Topdeck, the youth travel operator, altered its refund policy and applied it retrospectively in a way that denied customers refunds.
Intrepid also altered its refund policy and applied it to past bookings, and told some customers who still wanted a refund to wait three months before asking again. The company says it is not denying refunds and is still working with individuals to resolve their concerns.
The ACCC has received more than 6,000 complaints from consumers about the travel sector more broadly, and said thousands more had contacted their local state or territory fair trading agencies.
But Sims called for consumers to remain patient, given the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the sector.
“We ask consumers to remain patient and be mindful of the significant pressures on businesses at this time and, where possible, contact the business by email or website, rather than by phone,” Sims said.
“These are very complex issues and may take smaller businesses more time to respond.”
The ACCC has previously issued guidance warning the travel sector against changing their refund policies and applying them to old bookings.
“Travel providers must honour the terms and conditions agreed to at the time the consumer purchased their flights, cruises, tours or accommodation,” a spokesman told the Guardian last month.
“Informing consumers that they have no right to a refund when in fact they do is likely to constitute misleading conduct in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">While the west fixates on Covid-19, vulnerable countries pay the price</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">People in low-income and conflict-affected countries have so far largely escaped the high levels of Covid-19 infection seen in western Europe and the US, although this may be changing.The pandemic is killing them in different ways: lost jobs, ruined businesses, increased poverty, rising malnutrition and risk of famine, and a prospective increase in untreated, non-Covid preventable illnesses.
For many of the most vulnerable, the developed world’s cures are proving worse than the disease. At the extreme, families must choose between going hungry and getting ill.
And their plight is exacerbated by Covid-style “underlying conditions” – chronic, pre-existing political, security, economic, and climate problems that grow ever more unsustainable.
A Covid tidal wave may be about to hit sub-Saharan Africa and other less resilient regions, the International Rescue Committee warned last week. Without urgent international action, the virus could cause 1bn infections and 3.2m deaths in 34 fragile states, including Afghanistan and Syria, it said.The World Health Organization has issued similar alerts. Yet even if these worst-case outcomes are somehow avoided, poorer countries already face enormous collateral damage.
According to UN estimates, half a billion people, or 8% of the world’s population, could be pushed into destitution by the year’s end, largely due to the pandemic. The fight against poverty would be set back 30 years.
The crisis could produce famines of “biblical proportions”, with the number of people facing hunger almost doubling to more than 250 million, the World Food Programme (WFP) said. Shortfalls in donor funding and food aid meant 30 million people could die within a matter of months, it added.
Vanishing demand, collapsed distribution chains, and disrupted export markets are pushing people to the brink, affecting groups as diverse as Ethiopian and Kenyan flower producers, Sri Lankan tea-growers, and Bangladeshi garment workers whose contracts have reportedly been cancelled by UK supermarkets.The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, Venezuela and Haiti are among the countries most at risk, the WFP said: “Millions can only eat if they earn a wage.”War-torn Yemen is worse off than most. About 12 million Yemenis rely on food aid that is threatened by renewed fighting. A repeat cholera outbreak is under way. The detection last week of a Covid-19 cluster in Aden may be the least of its worries.South Sudan is another conflict-scarred country with little or no capacity to handle a Covid-19 emergency. In 2019, 61% of the population faced food insecurity. Drought and locust infestations were contributory factors.
Yet with only 34 confirmed Covid cases so far, and no deaths, South Sudan’s main worry at present is the pandemic’s indirect impact on humanitarian aid, food supply and livelihoods.This perspective is shared by many in South Africa, the continent’s second largest economy. The official death toll is just over 100, yet the government’s lockdown is said to be costing £570m a day. Some restrictions were eased last Friday amid fears that 1.7 million people could lose the means to make a living.Looked at globally, the pandemic’s impact on jobs is devastating. The International Labour Organization reported last week that 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy – nearly half the world’s total workforce of 3.3 billion – “stand in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed”.
“The first month of the crisis is estimated to have resulted in a drop of 60% in the income of informal workers globally. This translates into a drop of 81% in Africa and the Americas,” it said.If lockdowns continue or expand, this situation will only get worse. More than 436 million enterprises were at risk, the ILO’s Guy Ryder said. “For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security, and no future.”
The west’s self-absorption threatens to obscure the virus’s harmful impact on treatment of non-Covid, preventable diseases. Just as UK cancer deaths are forecast to rise due to a diversion of resources, so measles and other immunisation programmes in poorer nations are being undercut.
The WHO announced last week that polio vaccinations for up to 12 million children in Africa will be delayed as resources are switched to fighting Covid-19. It admitted the move would inevitably lead to more child polio cases.
Disrupted vaccination programmes have frequently led to “explosive” outbreaks of life-threatening diseases previously held in abeyance, warned vaccine specialist Edward Parker. “Without systematic efforts to maintain immunisation programmes, the virus’s legacy could include a disastrous surge in childhood deaths.”The pandemic is providing cover for malign governments to pursue or accelerate policies that place lives at risk, regardless of Covid-19. A striking example is Myanmar, where the army has renewed its repression of minorities in Rakhine and Chin states.
Yanghee Lee, the UN’s human rights rapporteur, said last week she feared a repeat of the alleged genocide in 2017 when 700,000 Rohingya Muslims were forced to flee. The resulting densely populated refugee camps created in next-door Bangladesh are potentially lethal Covid-19 hotspots.
And Kashmir reveals more Covid collateral damage. The continuation of last year’s illegal Indian government lockdown is now justified by the need to contain the disease. Spiralling mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicide, and domestic violence, are among the results.Not to be left out, the Trump administration is ignoring a UN call to lift sanctions on struggling, virus-hit countries such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela while also blocking a global ceasefire.World Bank and IMF billions offered in assistance and debt relief to poorer countries and fragile states cannot begin to repair all this hurt. Right now, western responses to the virus are imperilling more people worldwide than the virus itself.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Government offers $300m to boost hydrogen investment under clean energy financing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Morrison government will change the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, directing it to make up to $300m available for a new Advancing Hydrogen Fund as part of the national hydrogen strategy.
The Coalition’s move to create a dedicated hydrogen financing fund will be confirmed on Monday, and comes ahead of other changes the government intends to make to the CEFC’s investment program, including requiring it to support new investments in grid reliability.
Requiring the CEFC to support grid stability will require legislative change. It is unclear when that legislation will be introduced, given parliament is currently working on a reduced sitting schedule. The government will need to table a legislative instrument to update the investment mandate to facilitate the new hydrogen fund.
The independent MP Zali Steggall has recently asked the auditor general to investigate the Coalition’s scheme to underwrite gas, hydro and coal power, saying it lacks transparency and citing legal advice that the Coalition had no constitutional or legislative authority to introduce it.
In a joint statement, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the CEFC would provide concessional finance for projects to support a national hydrogen industry.
It would consider new investments in advancing hydrogen production, developing export and domestic supply chains, establishing hydrogen hubs and backing projects that build domestic demand for hydrogen.
Australia’s energy ministers signed off on a national hydrogen strategy in November at the Coag energy council meeting – the first meeting of the federal/state decision-making body for more than 12 months.
Hydrogen has been championed by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel. In a joint statement after the November meeting, ministers noted markets for hydrogen were growing in Asia and Europe, and said Australia could replicate its success “in becoming a leader in the global LNG market over the past 40 years”.
“We have the resources, technology, workforce and experience needed to be a world leading hydrogen producer and exporter,” the joint statement said. “Australia’s renewable energy generation capacity provides particular advantages in the production of green hydrogen.”
The ACT attempted to amend the national hydrogen strategy at the meeting to support only hydrogen produced from renewable electricity, but that amendment was not supported by other jurisdictions.
Taylor said the government had “a strong commitment to building a hydrogen industry which will create jobs, many in regional areas, and billions of dollars in economic growth between now and 2050”.
“Importantly, if we can get hydrogen produced at under $2 a kilogram, it will be able to play a role in our domestic energy mix to bring down energy prices and keep the lights on,” he said.
Separately to the hydrogen strategy, Taylor has been spruiking a gas-led economic recovery as Australia slowly recovers from the economic shock associated with Covid-19. But the government is yet to release a technology roadmap it was developing before the pandemic hit, which will guide the transition to lower emissions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway sells US airline shares</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines.
Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Buffett said "the world has changed" because of the coronavirus.
He then said he had been wrong to invest in the airline industry.
Mr Buffett's comments came just hours after Berkshire Hathaway announced a record $50bn (£40bn) net first quarter loss, Reuters news agency reports.
The conglomerate had an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines, 10% of Southwest Airlines, and 9% of United Airlines, according to its annual report and company filings.
The firm began investing in the four airlines in 2016, after avoiding the aviation industry for years.
Mr Buffett told the meeting, which was held virtually: "We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss.
"We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service.
Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit.
"It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up," he said. "It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country."
In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has "tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team".
The airline added that it remains "confident" in its strengths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: McDonald's seeks rent cut from UK landlords</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">McDonald's is in talks with some of its landlords in the UK about cutting rent payments as the fast food chain prepares to reopen some of its sites.
Businesses face their next quarterly rent bill on 24 June when they are due to pay for the next three months.
McDonald's said it has paid in full for the current quarter.
However, it said that "given the unprecedented situation", it was in talks with landlords about how they could "offer support" on rent.
McDonald's has closed all its outlets in the UK because of the coronavirus pandemic.
A spokesman for the company said: "We have opened dialogue with some of our landlords to discuss how they might offer support on rent and service charges for a short period due to our restaurants not trading."
McDonald's plans to reopen 15 outlets in the UK for delivery only services on 13 May.
Other food chains such as Burger King and Yo! Sushi did not pay rent to landlords in the UK when it fell due in March.
The government has implemented some measures to help businesses who are struggling to pay their rent.
But shopping centre-owner Intu said recently that it was considering legal action against some big brands who have money but are "not engaging" in rent negotiations.
Intu, which owns Manchester's Trafford Centre and the Lakeside in Essex, declined to name the brands.
In April, the British Retail Consortium and the British Property Federation both wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak seeking more support for shops and landlords.
They want the government to support a "furloughed space grant scheme" where businesses would pay some rent, landlords would agree to a reduction and the state would make-up the shortfall.
A spokesman for the Treasury said: "We recognise the current challenges facing commercial landlords and the significant impact recent changes are having on their business models. We also recognise that many landlords are working closely with tenants to find solutions that work for both parties."
"Our package of support for businesses currently includes our new bounce back loans, which provide quick and easy support for eligible companies that is interest-free for the first 12 months, our job retention scheme and other measures such as protecting commercial tenants from eviction."
Last week, McDonald's revealed that the coronavirus outbreak had sent first quarter like-for-like sales down 3.4%.
It said around three quarters of its outlets across the world remained opened and were serving people via drive-throughs, delivery or takeaway services.
But the UK is among a few of its markets where it has temporarily closed all of its sites. Others include France, Italy and Spain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Follow This New Chenot Spa’s Tips For Wellness At Home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ahead of its grand opening, the brand new Chenot Palace Weggis spa in Switzerland shares its tips for wellness at home.
Slated for summer 2020 debut, this luxury hotel and medi-spa follows in the footsteps of wellness centers such as Italy’s Espace Chenot in the gradually expanding Chenot Group. Each spa in the Chenot portfolio draws on the principles of the world-renowned Chenot Method developed by founder Henri Chenot to activate the body’s optimal power, strengthen defence and self-healing mechanisms, prevent disease and renew energy levels and inner harmony.
The soon-to-open Swiss spa commands dramatic views from its position overlooking Lake Lucerne, along with an immersion into the Chenot Method and time to revel in the luxury hotel and spa’s tranquil space. Once the new wellness hub is open, you’ll be able to experience one of three signature seven-day retreat programs: the Advanced Detox, Recover & Energise program or Prevention and Aging Well plan.
Until then, Dominique Chenot—co-founder of the Chenot Group and wife of Henri Chenot—is sharing her tips for staying well during this time at home, following the routine she recommends maintaining during lockdown. 
Here she shares her secret formula for maintaining a healthy body and mind:
The lowdown: “Nutrition is for me an essential pillar in building a healthy and fully active life. I always choose fresh, organic, seasonal ingredients and prefer wholefoods to processed foods. My own daily diet is rich in high quality proteins, preferably plant-based proteins and fatty fish, and I consume a lot of healthy unsaturated fats, which are essential for brain and cardiovascular health. These can be found in fatty fish, avocados, nuts, seeds and cold-pressed vegetable oils. I also reduce my sugar consumption to a minimum. A quick example of a healthy, fuss-free recipe loaded with healthy fats and proteins? I suggest trying an overnight chia pudding: soak half a cup of chia seeds in half a cup of almond milk overnight in the fridge and the result is a high-protein, high-fibre breakfast which is delicious straight out of the fridge with some fresh fruit or cinnamon.”
23:00: “A good day starts with a good night’s sleep before it. Sleep is necessary to regenerate the brain and the body, recharge the immune system, and prevent premature aging. Sleep for me is literally a “beauty rest” because it keeps my memory fresh, my mood balanced and my appearance youthful. It is very important to me to maintain a sleep routine, especially waking up at the same time every morning. I often use a sleep-monitoring app on my phone to measure the quality of my sleep and find what works best for me.”
07:00: “I start my day with exercise, as it is vital for my health and helps to set me up for the day. I use HIIT (high intensity interval training), which stimulates a strong antioxidant response providing the body with better resistance to stress and illness, as well as anti-aging benefits. I start with 20 minutes on an indoor bike, followed by core strength exercises and finish with stretching and breathing techniques. I do this first thing in the morning so that it does not interfere with my sleep later on.”
08:00: “I enjoy meditating, especially with the help of positive visuals and affirmations, which give me clarity and boost my self-confidence.”
08:30: “I always hydrate abundantly through the day, but especially so after my morning exercise. I use green juicing with spices, such as curcuma and black pepper or ginger and cinnamon, or citrus infused water.”
20:00: “I practice intermittent fasting and eat only during an eight-hour window each day. I would ideally skip supper each day. However, my busy social schedule most days means that I skip breakfast instead.”
Lifelong: “Last but not the least, I try to stay optimistic and reflect positive emotions. My life is best when I’m sharing and feeling love, so I make sure to spend time with the people I love and doing things I love. I connect with them regularly and express my appreciation for them. I am so grateful for all the joy they bring me.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Norwegian’s Future Hangs In The Balance As Bondholders Reject Debt Plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Norwegian Air’s bondholders have turned down a crucial part of a proposed debt-to-equity swap. Talks will continue, but the decision is a setback to the debt-riddled airline’s hopes of making it through the COVID-19 crisis.
While every major airline in the world is struggling due to reduced demand and travel restrictions, Norwegian’s problems run much deeper. For more than a year the airline has been in process of a major shift in strategy from growth to profitability. While there were signs the strategy was working, the airline is still saddled with enormous levels of debt.
Now, the company is set to run out of cash in a matter of weeks unless its comprehensive restructuring plan is approved by creditors and shareholders. The controversial debt-to-equity plan is required to meet the conditions of substantial government support., but it will severely dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.

In a last minute revision to the plan, Norwegian offered bondholders the right to receive preferred allocations should it launch a public equity offering, and a shortened time limit before any shares received in the conversion could be sold. However, it wasn’t enough.
In a meeting on April 30, holders of three of the company’s four bonds approved the plans. However, support among holders of the fourth bond was not strong enough. At 62.07%, the support fell just short of the two-thirds required. The support among owners of the three bonds was much higher, at 89.25%, 97.91% and 85.07%. As the vote was relatively close, the airline is optimistic a solution can be found.
“Our dialogue with the bondholders continues with the clear goal of reaching a solution. Unfortunately, we were not able to reach an agreement within the deadline. However, the discussion is continuing through the weekend to find a solution,” said Norwegian’s CEO Jacob Schram in a statement to the Oslo Stock Exchange.
Norwegian also announced that leasing companies, which own many of Norwegian’s aircraft, have given “strong support” to the plan of converting $550 million of outstanding debt into shares.
Despite the setback, Norwegian’s extraordinary general meeting will be held as planned on May 4. Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, the meeting will take place online. According to the statement, the company will call a new bondholder meeting on May 18.
MORE FROM FORBESThe New-Look Norwegian Airline Will Have Fewer Planes, Fewer Routes From 2022By David Nikel
Although the management has been focused on the restructuring plan, they have also found time to outline what a future Norwegian Air would look like post-COVID-19.
Among other things, there will be fewer routes on fewer aircraft. The revised strategy would see Norwegian's fleet of Boeing aircraft reduced by one-third.
Even if the company survives the coming weeks, most of the fleet will remain grounded throughout 2020. The airline will be put into a “hibernation phase” and only operate routes subsidised by the Norwegian government. During 2021, the company will step up operations, but an offer resembling "normal operations" will not resume until 2022.

    <h5 class="mb-1">11 Members Of Congress Urge Treasury Secretary Mnuchin To Use Blockchain For COVID-19 Stimulus Payments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Tuesday, a letter from eleven Members of Congress to the Secretary of the Treasury was made public that urged Secretary Mnuchin to consider the use of blockchain technology to help in providing COVID-19 stimulus checks to Americans. With the high-profile nature of suggesting the U.S. Treasury could deliver money owed to the public with both speed and security as a result of using blockchain technology is the equivalent of the ‘Super Bowl’ of blockchain use cases for the private sector.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provided for payments; however, timely delivery of the money to all who are entitled to the stimulus has proved a challenge. While 90 of the 150 million eligible individuals have received their payments as of April 17, the 60 million that remain include low-income families who do not normally file income tax returns and face issues with accessing basic financial services.
The letter urges Treasury to ‘...utilize private sector innovations such as blockchain and DLT to support the necessary functions of government to distribute and track relief programs and direct that all guidance support the use of technology to facilitate delivery of CARES Act benefits.’
The letter was spearheaded by Congressman Darren Soto (D-FL), Co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, as well as fellow Co-Chairs Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Congressman David Schweikert (R-AZ). Additional signers include Congressman Ted Budd (R-NC), Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH), Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Congressman Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH), Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), Congressman Ben McAdams (D-UT), Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL), and Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D-U.S. Virgin Islands). Delegate Plaskett is the first African-American woman to join the Congressional Blockchain Caucus last year.
The letter also addresses the need to stay competitive with China. Urging the Administration to promote blockchain technology is not new to Congressman Soto, who was part of a bi-partisan letter in July of 2019 to the Larry Kudlow, Chair of the National Economic Council in the White House. That letter urged the White House to take action on numerous fronts with blockchain, stating, ‘To continue its standing as a world leader in technological innovation, the United States should engage with policymakers, the private sector, and academia to promote the research and development of blockchain technology; explore its benefits for private and public use; collaborate on cross-sectoral policy, standard-setting, scalability, and implementation issues; and discuss potential regulatory approaches.’  
The Policy Leap From Bitcoin To Blockchain
President Donald Trump, during the hearings over Facebook’s potential Libra cryptocurrency, made his first public comments on bitcoin:
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin went on to explain his reservations on crypto when he stated, ‘I want to be careful that anybody who’s using bitcoin — regardless of what the price is — is using it for proper purposes and not illicit purposes...And there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes’.
However, Blockchain, a technology that enables the peer-to-peer transactions for cryptocurrency, has been explored around the world by major companies on how to process faster payments and save on processing costs. Forbes produces a list of enterprises known as the ‘Blockchain 50’, that encompasses ‘enterprises embracing the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and using it to speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save billions of dollars’.
MORE FROM FORBESBlockchain 50By Michael del Castillo
China, who recently announced its own ‘National Blockchain’, implements a very different policy toward cryptocurrency than it does for blockchain. While many times China looks to restrain the use of private cryptocurrencies, the country’s ambitious view of blockchain is such that numerous resources are provided to help accelerate the growth of this technology.
While not much has been heard about blockchain from the Administration yet, hopefully there will be the ability to understand the distinction and not have blockchain be conflated with the idea of bitcoin or lose focus on how many in the private sector believe blockchain can be used to help accelerate delivery of stimulus checks under the CARES Act.
Roger Brown, Head of Tax & Regulatory Affairs for Lukka, a firm offering an advanced virtual currency tax preparation program, noted, ‘Blockchain utilization serves as a compelling way for people to receive their stimulus checks as there are a myriad of scams present that deny the vulnerable from receiving aid.’
Erick Pinos, the Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology, a high performance public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform, notes, ‘ Blockchain allows for the fast and secure transfer of money from one individual to another for a very low fee and without the need for an intermediary. In a nutshell, blockchain-based payments do not require the sender or the user to have access to a bank account,’ said Pinos.
Alex Mashinsky of Celsius, a crypto lending platform, noted that blockchain is still in its infancy, stating, ‘There is not a blockchain anywhere in the world,’ that is ready to handle such an undertaking as the delivery of COVID-19 payments.
For those who do not normally file tax returns, the U.S. Treasury has offered a remedy to receive their money on the IRS website. However, the online method involves providing your name, address, and a bank routing and account number - the last of which is sometimes a major hurdle as low-income families tend to be either unbanked or underbanked and may not have a bank account.
Therefore, it is reasonable to foresee continued pressure from Congress on the White House and Treasury to find ways to deliver these COVID-19 checks to those most in need in a timely way and to bring the most sophisticated payments technologies to bear.
The letter is below and dated April 23 and was made public April 28.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stocks May Have Hit A Ceiling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The stock market averages had a great April with the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ up 11.1%, 12.7% and 15.5%, respectively, And even though all the indexes were down over 2.5% on Friday they have all risen at least 25% from their lows of March 23 with the Dow being the strongest, up 28%. The challenge will be adding to these gains as earnings estimates continue to fall against very high valuations.
S&P 500 as expensive as late 2001
Estimates for the S&P 500 companies earnings have fallen by 25% since the beginning of the year per John Butter, Senior Earnings Analyst, at FactSet. His weekly “Earnings Insight” shows that the Index is now trading slightly above a 21x PE multiple on 2020’s profits with late 2001 being the last time this occurred. And even on 2021’s forecast the S&P 500 has a PE of almost 17x.
Bear trap or truly sustainable?
Given what has occurred in the economy with over 30 million people filing for unemployment insurance in just six weeks; economic reports showing huge drops in retail sales and industrial production; to an explosion of the federal deficit it is not surprising the S&P 500 fell 35%. What is interesting, to a large degree, is that it has rebounded by 27% and is now only 555 points or 16% below its all-time high.
This is largely due to the Federal government pumping trillions of dollars into the economy, the Federal Reserve also throwing trillions of dollars to stabilize the fixed income markets and incremental better news in the fight against the coronavirus. While the stock market tends to be forward looking, the financial outlook is biased to earnings estimates continuing to fall, which will increase already multi-year record high valuation multiples.
Estimates are almost guaranteed to decrease
The first estimate for March quarter’s GDP came in at a negative 4.8%. This was the worst showing since the December 2008 quarter when the economy shrank 8.4%.
Unfortunately, the economy is forecast to have a much worse outcome in the June quarter. While only one month has elapsed in it, estimates range from at least a mid-teens drop to downwards of 40%.
Keep in mind that these are annualized numbers. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA, does a quarter-to-quarter comparison and then multiplies by 4 to get a yearly result. While down 10% to get to a 40% number is definitely not in any way “good”, it should be kept in mind when hearing about a negative 40% projection.
S&P 500 earnings estimates took another hit this week
At the beginning of 2020 Butters was estimating that the S&P 500 companies would earn $177.77. With the S&P 500 valued at 3,231 its PE multiple was 18.2x. Below is how the estimate for this year’s S&P 500 earnings has decreased, with the first meaningful decline occurring during the week of March 20.
Note that the S&P 500’s PE multiple has increased from 18.2x at the beginning of the year to 21.2x currently.
2021 S&P earnings estimates
The first time Butters published an estimate for next year’s S&P 500’s earnings was on January 10. He was forecasting earnings of $196.57, which translated to a PE multiple of 16.4x. Below is how 2021’s earnings estimate has changed since then.
While it is possible the S&P 500’s earnings could rebound and start to move higher, history and what is occurring in the economy makes this unlikely. As shown in the chart above earnings estimates tend to decrease over time and we are only in May 2020 with more than a year to go for 2021 to play out. Earnings only need to decrease another $5 to essentially match 2018’s and $7 to reach 2017’s level. Both of those amounts were eclipsed during April when 2021’s projection fell by almost $15.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deal For 200 Boeing 737 MAXs Impacted If British Airways Closes London Gatwick Base</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Airways told staff it could close its London Gatwick base, raising questions about the 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that the airline’s parent, IAG, signed a letter of intent to buy.
Gatwick was due to receive the first part of the MAX aircraft from IAG’s LOI placed last summer and still valid as of February, the group said.
Unlike airlines now deferring aircraft deliveries, IAG’s MAX aircraft are not due in the immediate future. IAG requested delivery slots between 2023-2027. That could see the MAX arrive after IAG expects markets to finally rebound from the coronavirus downturn.
IAG new narrowbody aircraft needed: 2023-2029 as of November 2019
IAG previously expected its airlines to need 215 narrowbody aircraft between 2023-2029.
The plan included flexibility as 62 of the deliveries would allow IAG to accelerate retirement of medium-life aircraft it did not necessarily need to withdraw. The capital expense of newer aircraft had to be weighed against the unit cost and environmental advantages.
Under the LOI for 200 MAX aircraft, the first batch were allocated to British Airways at London Gatwick. They cannot be transferred to British Airways’ larger base at Heathrow, which requires baggage be loaded via containers.
Baggage has to be loaded individually onto the 737 MAX, unlike the A320 that can accept containers. British Airways uses the A320 family at Heathrow.
IAG also provisionally allocated MAX aircraft to Vueling and said the group could deploy MAX aircraft to its other airlines. IAG did not disclose the exact number for Vueling or British Airways. But it is unclear if other IAG carriers could absorb the Gatwick-bound aircraft.
“We suspended our Gatwick flying schedule at the start of April and there is no certainty as to when or if these services can or will return,” said an internal British Airways memo and reported by local media.
British Airways publicly announced it was seeking “up to 12,000” job redundancies. Actual redundancies could be fewer depending on negotiations with unions, which British Airways said it was starting.
All 12,000 reductions would impact over a quarter of its workforce. Having even half of the 12,000 reductions would still leave British Airways with its smallest workforce in over 30 years.
British Airways operates around 140 A320 family aircraft and 22% of its A320 pilots are based at Gatwick, according to a separate recent memo from management to pilots. That suggests around 31 A320 aircraft are based at Gatwick.
The same post-coronavirus economic outlook that impacts the Gatwick base could also affect other IAG units and see them taper new aircraft delivery plans.
There are various fleet scenarios within IAG before considering greater complexity from Air Europa.
After IAG’s LOI for the MAX aircraft, it announced plans to purchase Air Europa. The Spanish carrier was due to receive 25 737 MAX aircraft from 2020 to 2025.
Air Europa and IAG 737 MAX fleet plan, as of November 2019
IAG is reportedly re-negotiating the Air Europa purchase, but if it goes ahead IAG’s group fleet will have 737 MAX aircraft.
That could be an argument to proceed with the Boeing 737 MAX LOI and increase scale on the 737 MAX fleet inherited from Air Europe.
Or the LOI could lapse, but it may be too good to pass up.
Financial terms of IAG’s LOI with Boeing are not disclosed, but it is widely expected IAG received higher than normal discounts and flexibility. IAG was the first blue-chip customer to do a deal for the MAX after the type’s grounding in March 2019.
Boeing also won over IAG, which earlier replaced 737 classics with A320s and not 737 NGs. Airframers especially prize “flipping” customers from a competitor supplier.
IAG also saw value in ending sole sourcing of short-haul aircraft from Airbus.
“One of the key factors for us in the 737 MAX is not only getting a good price, but it is also making sure that the supply is being competed over both Airbus and Boeing,” IAG CFO Steve Gunning said last November. “In a world where you have a duopoly and you convert it into a monopoly because you do not deal with both [Airbus and Boeing] on the short-haul aircraft, that does not seem strategically to make sense.”
IAG will eventually need new aircraft. The question is if IAG wants to spend capital in the medium-term on a good deal. Consumer advice may hold. A sale is not a sale unless you wanted the item in the first place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Libertine’s Wild Ales Enrich California’s Central Coast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For many beer drinkers, their first, second, third and even fourth taste of a sour beer can make them wince. They don't know how anyone can tolerate such a brew. 
But there are other beer drinkers who either get past those initial sour-filled setbacks or fall in love immediately and appreciate the wonders and complexities of sour beers. For many, a sour beer is a nice change from the heavily hopped beers that, for years, have become a craze throughout America. 
Wild sour ales have been the specialty at the Libertine Brewing Company since it was founded as a small brewery and brewpub in Morro Bay, California, by Tyler Clark in 2012. The beers' popularity grew, prompting Libertine to also open a 9,000-square-foot production and tasting space in downtown San Luis Obispo in 2015 and a tasting room in Avila Beach in 2018.
Clark left the company in December 2018 and opened a bar and music club, but the tradition of wild sour ales continues. 
"We are forever indebted to the founder and original owner who had the vision for a great sour beer on the Central Coast," says Mike Asmundson, Libertine's marketing manager. "He gave us our name and our culture. When he and the company parted ways, we carried the torch and moved forward."
Before the coronavirus crisis struck, Libertine, which produces about 500 barrels annually, had up to 22 of its own beers on tap in its tasting room and pubs. In addition, the San Luis Obispo tasting room served 50 guest beers on draft, and the Morro Bay pub poured 30 guest taps. Now, the Morro Bay and Avila Beach locations are temporarily closed, and Libertine is selling bottles of its wild ales from the San Luis Obispo facility and online.
"There are lots of breweries in California but not many that exclusively focus on wild ales," Asmundson says. "Lots dabble with a kettle sour here or there, but few true sour breweries match us in quality and quantity of wild, fermented barrel-aged ales. You can taste the difference."
The beauty of wild, sour ales is "the signature of the wild microfauna," he says. "Our yeast comes from the Central Coast, blown in on the ocean breeze, tying our unique flavor to this area much in the same way a wine is connected to its terroir."
While many breweries today have largely abandoned bottling beers in favor of canning, Libertine continues to bottle its wild ales in 750-milliliter and 375-milliliter sizes. 
"Wild ales are something unique in the beer world," Asmundson explains. "They’re somewhat unpredictable, given the nature of spontaneous fermentation, and there’s a craft to barrel aging. You work with unpredictable elements — with nature — rather than attempting to control the process. The result is a sum that’s greater than its parts. The flavor profiles are complex and nuanced — like art."
Wild ale drinkers have "a more refined pallet, in similar fashion to wine," Asmundson says. "We think that bottling enhances the experience. There’s something to the uncorking and the weight of the bottle. It speaks to the quality and the craftsmanship that went into creating the particular brew. It’s not beer meant to be thrown in a cooler and crushed one after the other on a hot day. We leave that to the beer lites of the world. Our beer is an experience. It’s not just about the buzz. It’s true craft brew, meant to be savored and appreciated."
The most complex beer made by Libertine was Broken Pomaces in 2018, says Sean Zurbriggen, the brewery's operations manager.
"That one was a challenge," Zurbriggen recalls. "We didn’t get the grape stems in time; they sat out in the Paso Robles heat, and it fermented in the tank too long. What an experiment it was, though, and how much we learned! We used zinfandel stems with some skins and a few clusters still attached. That went straight into the coolship to steep inside hot wort overnight. The next morning, the wort had cooled, and rings of krausen were forming around the stems. We transferred it into wine barrels that morning and let it age for six months, and, in the end, it turned out to be a pretty good brew."
The key to Libertine's success, according to Asmundson, has been "the passion" of its 70 or so employees. 
"Sean has been with us from the very beginning," Asmundson says. "Our head brewer, Audrey Sizemore, came from another local brewery and worked her way into the head brewer position. I started here as a beer tender, part-time. I had my first sour beer, fell in love and wanted to do more to bring this beer to the world. It’s all of us — from the cellar to the tap rooms and everywhere behind the scenes — and our passion and integrity that holds this company together and pushes us forward into the future."
Libertine's future aim is to get its beers "into more bars, more bottle shops and more homes," Zurbriggen says. "Presently, we’re well-represented throughout California with minor distribution to the rest of the Lower 48, Australia and Canada. Our beers have, at times, even made it as far as Italy and the United Kingdom. But we remain an underground brand. Those who know us love us, but there’s still a lot of sour beer drinkers who have yet to have the pleasure. We aim to change that."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forget The Halving—Is This The Real Reason Bitcoin Suddenly Soared Toward $10,000?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors are gearing up for the long-awaited bitcoin halving this month—which will see the number of new bitcoin entering the market cut by half.
The bitcoin price has soared this week and is now a strong contender for 2020's best performing asset, climbing to over $9,000 per bitcoin for the first time since late February.
However, while many traders are betting the bitcoin price will climb as a result of this month's cut to supply, the latest bitcoin bounce may have happened for entirely different reasons.

Shortly before bitcoin's 20% rally this week, a large transfer of the stablecoin tether was made to bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis with its creators claiming they keep one U.S. dollar in reserve for every tether token issued.
Tether tokens worth a little over $50 million were transferred to Malta-based Binance early on Wednesday, just hours before bitcoin began its $30 billion pump.
A Twitter bot that records major bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades, called Whale Alert, picked up the transaction.
Over the past month Tether Ltd, which controls the stablecoin tether and shares owners and senior staff with the British Virgin Islands-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, has ramped up the number of tether it's creating—minting over $1 billion worth of the stablecoin.
"[On Wednesday we] witnessed extensive buying activity and the high level of scalability and liquidity evident on our platform made us able to seamlessly service all these requests," boasted Bitfinex chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino—who also serves as the chief technology officer of Tether—in a statement that pointed to major U.S. bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's unfortunate outage during the sudden bitcoin rally.

There is currently some 6.3 billion tether tokens in circulation, compared to just 18 million bitcoin.
Last year, it was suggested around half of bitcoin's value between March 2017 and March 2018 was created by trades between bitcoin and tether—casting doubt over whether bitcoin's epic 2017 bull run happened organically.
Many have called for Tether's dollar reserves to be externally audited amid claims tether's dollar peg is "no longer credible."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fortnite And Travis Scott Provide Insights Into How To Go To Market When The Market Disappears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Much of my work, consulting, and teaching centers on so-called Go To Market (GTM) strategy. Essentially, GTM is an umbrella term that requires managers to coordinate product and business development, sales and marketing, and business intelligence. For me, it’s an incredibly exciting part of business — a time when you finally move from cogitation to iteration; where all of the ideas, emotions, and work coalesce, and an offering is put in front of customers.
We tend to think of GTM as limited to an initial product launch. It’s not. Any time a new feature is developed or a new territory is targeted, a new GTM strategy must be developed. In a well-run organization, the GTM strategy should adhere to an 80/20 rule, where the overall purpose of the product remains mostly constant (80%) irrespective of new features or territories, but the strategy can change on the margin (20%) to accommodate for variance. This concept has been generally described as “Commander’s Intent” in articles from HBR and books like Made to Stick, where it is presented in this manner:
At high levels of the Army, the [Commander’s Intent] may be relatively abstract: ‘Break the will of the enemy in the Southeast region’. At the tactical level, for colonels and captains, it is much more concrete: ‘My intent is to have Third Battalion on Hill 4305, to have the hill cleared of enemy, with only ineffective remnants, so we can protect the flank of Third Brigade as they pass through the lines.
I’m not a fan of war metaphors, but keeping in mind the cascade-type relational flow from purpose to strategy to tactic is imperative when devising and executing a GTM plan.
But, what happens when the “Market” you had planned to “Go To” disappears? For example, a short time ago, many artists were planning their tours, and getting ready to literally go to the market with their music. COVID-19 rendered those plans moot; the market — not only for selling tickets to live events, but also for selling merchandise to fans who were to attend these shows — vanished overnight.
Many artists have attempted to find an online path to this disappeared offline market. I continue to find the Grateful Dead’s Shakedown Series a remarkable example of how to redefine the Job To Be Done of Music in the COVID-19 era. The series provides a date and time-certain and an uninterrupted “escape” during this time when nothing seems to be certain and the magic of most musical “escapes” are broken by the constant distraction of artists reminding listeners of precisely the things we can not possibly forget.
Thus, because the majority of these types of online performances are overly skeuomorphic, they fail with respect to the spirit of Commander’s Intent, both from an impact and revenue generation perspective and do not represent a viable go to market strategy to replace traditional touring or merch sales.
However, one example that does hew much closer to the correct approach of keeping the purpose constant even while the strategy and tactics remain fungible enough to ensure success is Travis Scott’s recent Fortnite collaboration.
Epic Games, the company responsible for Fortnite, increasingly looks like the very definition of a “Purpose Not Product” driven company. Is Fortnite a video game? Yes, but it is also a communication tool, where a large percentage of users converse about all sorts of things and generally stay connected even while “playing” the “game.” In fact, in the Apple App Store the description for Fortnite is “Battle Royale & Party Hub.”
Epic realizes that their purpose is far more than “simply” being a video game product manufacturer; like all great companies it understands that its purpose is to make the user feel better about herself when interacting with their product, and that while the product can and must change, its purpose must not. At my consulting firm, we refer to this as “The Mirror of Desire.”
Viewed in this manner it is easy to see why adding “venue/music market” to the ever-growing list of products flowing from Epic’s purpose makes sense.
While Travis Scott’s recent performance was the most high-profile music-related event on Fortnite, it was not the first. Fortnite tested and refined their thesis and appear to be rapidly achieving product market fit. Importantly, these refinements have moved the events from fairly skeuomorphic in nature — Marshmello and Weezer essentially replicated their live performances in a Fortnite environment — to something completely new. The Travis Scott event was not a skeuomorphic online rendition of an offline event; in fact, it was really unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. It was a collision (rather than a curation) of two seemingly orthogonal mediums, but while the tactic changed, the purpose remained the same, and in this manner, Travis Scott found a way to go to market even when that market had apparently disappeared.
And did he ever go to market.
The Travis Scott event had astonishing numbers: 12.3 million concurrent viewers; 28 million unique views; 46 million total views (people watched more than once). It’s hard to imagine Travis Scott reaching anywhere near these numbers over the course of a long tour, and inconceivable that he would have been able to do so for a single event; no physical venue could hold a fraction of these people.
Of course it wasn’t just massive awareness this event created. Scott premiered his music video on the platform, and it now has over 26 million views on Youtube. This has certainly generated revenue via the monetization of his streams on the DSPs.
This event also managed to — in a non-skeuomorphic manner — address a key element of any music touring revenue generation plan: merchandise sales. In the Fortnite store, the Travis Scott skin Sells for 1500 V bucks and the Astro Jack for 2000; this equates to $15 and $20USD, respectively. While the numbers of sales of these skins and emotes are not public, it is fair to assume, he’s sold millions of them; certainly more than the number of t-shirts that he would have sold during an entire tour, and, of course, these virtual sales had higher margins because there are little-to-no COGS.
Only rarely do markets abruptly disappear in the way that the touring market has due to COVID-19, but markets are always evolving and changing. Savvy brands and artists must continuously revise and refine their GTM strategy, and do so from a “Purpose not Product” approach to increase the likelihood of continuing to succeed through the constant of change.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore Airlines Seeks Fleet Flexibility, In Talks For Deferrals And Sale And Leaseback On Aircraft</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Singapore Airlines has fared the best of global carriers receiving state support in the coronavirus crisis so far. It has strong options as it next evaluates aircraft deferrals and sale and leaseback transactions.
“We are also in commercial negotiations with the aircraft manufacturers to try and refine our delivery stream in view of the prevailing market conditions,” Singapore Airlines told investors. It said it was additionally looking at secured financing and sale-and-leaseback transactions.
Singapore Airlines owns 66% of its group fleet, including 83% of widebodies – higher than the industry average. That gives it young assets to sell and leaseback or use as security. It did not disclose how many are unencumbered.
Singapore Airlines Group aircraft directly owned, as at March 31, 2019
Singapore Airlines has received 24 further widebodies since its last full fleet update in March 2019, used for the chart above. It has taken delivery of over 80 widebody aircraft in recent years, all directly owned.
Despite the large number of new aircraft deliveries, Singapore Airlines is still in the middle of a re-fleeting program and has outstanding orders for 140 aircraft, including 73 widebodies, its accounts and industry data show.
Singapore Airlines Group aircraft on order, estimated at May 1, 2020
Singapore Airlines does not provide a yearly breakdown of delivery plans or capital expenditure. It had S$22.4 billion of committed future capital expenditure as of April 1, 2019. From then through December 31, 2019, it spent S$4.1 billion. Singapore Airlines releases annual results on May 14.
Widebody ownership is expected to increase as Singapore Airlines withdraws its A330s, all leased, and takes direct ownership of new A350s and 787s. Of its 24 leased widebodies as of March 2019, 17 were A330s.
Singapore Airlines Group in-service fleet composition at March 31, 2019
The group fleet includes 777-300ERs and 787s that have been used in sale and leaseback transactions during the coronavirus downturn.
United Airlines UAL had a sale and leaseback of six 787-9s while Cathay Pacific sold six 777-300ERs and leased them back. Qantas Airways secured debt on 11 787-9s.
Singapore Airlines mainline only flies the 787-10. Budget arm Scoot has -8s and -9s but not all are in the more standard long-haul configuration that includes crew bunks.
Singapore Airlines’ 777-300ERs do not have the standard sized aft cargo door and so cannot carry pallets in the rear hold.
A high share of owned aircraft often implies strong enough finances to directly purchase aircraft and save lease rentals over the long-term.
Singapore Airlines tapered investor expectations by noting sale and leasebacks “would create more cash outflow obligations on the airline.”
Its comments came in response to shareholder queries about a S$5.3 billion rights issue and bond raising of up to S$9.7 billion.
Singapore Airlines said these sums could not be replaced by secured financing and sale and leasebacks, which “remain limited in the current climate and it would not be possible to raise a similar quantum from these channels.”
The rights issue and bond raising received 99% of shareholder approval on April 30.
Singapore Airlines expects to allocate 38% of proceeds to acquire new aircraft and make aircraft related payments. This represents S$3.3 billion out of the S$8.8 billion, comprising the $5.3 billion rights issue and S$3.5 billion initial bond.
The airline is committed to taking new aircraft but stopped short of explicitly saying it would receive all outstanding orders.
“The rationale for these purchases remains valid even under the present scenario,” Singapore Airlines told investors. The fleet orders “would enable SIA to proceed with its adoption of new-generation aircraft, both as replacement for existing fleet and for growth.”
Singapore Airlines is 55% owned by sovereign wealth fund Temasek, whose CEO Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara said, “We fully support SIA’s plans to transform itself. This includes the modernisation of its fleet.”
He said Singapore Airlines would grow as aircraft deliveries would “meet its capacity expansion strategy.”
Besides Temasek subscribing to the rights issue, the government has a wage support system Singapore Airlines can avail of.
“Air transport is fundamental to Singapore’s role as a global and regional hub,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on April 30. “It is a strategic sector. This is why the government is providing extra support for aviation.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Investors Rotate Into Bonds And Gold After A Historic Month For Stocks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the rally in stocks continued, albeit with last week providing plenty of volatility, ETF fund flows had some big surprises. Or, maybe not, given that the week was filled with a flurry of corporate earnings, a Federal Reserve meeting, and a month-end of April that had exceptional returns.
The biggest inflow of the week belonged to the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG), with almost $1.6 billion in new assets gathered. Given that the Federal Reserve pledged to keep rates at or near zero until full employment and inflation return, it makes sense that investors flocked to higher yielding bonds. With less risk of interest rate hikes soon, and inflation dropping, there is a good chance that HYG remains attractive for the foreseeable future.
This was combined with more bond funds that received massive inflows last week, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) all among the top names receiving inflows last week. They gained $1.1 billion, $834 million, $456 million, and $451 million, respectively as investors (and the Fed) added liquidity to the bond market.
A massive inflow also went into the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) this week, as investors added over $1.4 billion to the holding. Given that Microsoft Corp MSFT , Apple Inc AAPL , Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc, and Facebook Inc all reported last week among others inside the top 10 holdings of QQQ, it makes sense there was a large inflow to try and take advantage pre- and post-earnings release.
We also saw some decent flows into the shiny metals, with the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) gaining just under $1.1 billion in the last week. It has been a steady gainer this year in assets, with $5.35 billion inflows over the last month, and just over $8.7 billion inflows over the last 3 months. Gold has done well this year, with GLD up 11.8%, as investors are looking for non-fiat type assets as central banks and governments expand their balance sheets and print currency to battle a recession.
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) gained assets in the last week of $877 million, as the holding gained just under 14% for the month as investors looked to smaller market-cap companies for a boost to their portfolio. After a couple of bad trading days, though, the holding has pulled back and is a big underperformer this year, down 24.4%. That helps explains the outflows of $954 million in the last 3 months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire’s Massive $50B Loss May Mislead Investors, Here’s Why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B has captured headlines for its massive $50B loss for just the first quarter of the year. This may seem extreme. It is. In fact, the loss is entirely accounted for by swings in the market value of Berkshire’s investments. March 31, when the values were taken was in the midst of the market’s coronavirus panic. The S&P 500 was down around 20% for the year at that point.
Furthermore, since the end of Q1, the S&P 500 is now up 10% from the level of March 31. Of course, the markets are volatile, but as it stands the Berkshire’s Q2 results could show, very roughly, a $20B to $30B gain due, again to investment swings if the markets remain around their current level until when Q2 ends at the end of June. Of course, just as the Q1 swing isn’t that bleak, nor is the potential for a major Q2 gain all the positive. It’s potential a distracting from the operating performance of Berkshire businesses.
This is deeply ironic. Two things that Warren Buffett abhors are focusing on short-term performance, such as quarterly earnings, and too much attention to temporary swings in the sentiments in financial markets. However, with changes in accounting rules in 2018, Berkshire must run changes in the value of its investment portfolio through the income statement, creating these massive swings that dwarf the operating performance of the businesses. In fact this quarter’s swing in asset values is ten times the value of the operating performance of Berkshire’s companies.
Berkshire owned companies are still largely churning out their products and services as best they can in the current environment, but the swings in the stock prices of certain of those companies vastly dominates the earning picture. Though these are accounting rules, this is likely frustrating to Buffett because he is a long-term holder of virtually all asset that he purchases, and cares far more about operating performance than day-to-day valuations. Berkshire is not a hedge fund rapidly trading in and out of positions. If Berkshire were indeed holding assets for just a few months, then short-term investment swings might be very relevant, but since its likely current Berkshire holdings will remain so for decades, the quarterly swings are less impactful than they may first appear, especially if you have a positive long-term view on financial markets.
Furthermore, though Berkshire has lost $50B in an accounting sense, the cashflows of the business are unchanged. Berkshire has not written a $50B check this quarter and sent that m0ney out the door as operating losses might otherwise imply. Equally if the current situation holds it won’t receive a check for $20B-$30B next quarter for investment gains either.
In fact, Berkshire do care about this issue, such that the first page of the earnings statement includes the below is bold font. “The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules.” Those are pretty strong words in the otherwise pretty esoteric field of business accounting.
Of course, there is a debate to be had about the pros and cons of Berkshire Hathaway as an investment. However, looking at the headline quarterly earnings result is unlikely to inform it. As that’s really telling you is, broadly, whether the S&P 500 has a good or a bad 3 months. This is because investment valuation swings dominate the underlying operating performance. Of course, Berkshire have to follow the accounting rules, but that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily informative for Berkshire’s long-term holdings or overall business strategy. What will matter for that are decisions such as what major investment Buffett makes next.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European Founders “seizing The Day” Amidst Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A surprising number of both founders and VCs are taking the (possibly apocryphal) advice of Winston Churchill to “never let a good crisis go to waste.” In their recent weekly VC and entrepreneur sentiment surveys, Chausson Finance has produced some timely insights into how investors and founders are behaving and a weekly sentiment gauge.
A full two thirds of European founders are seeing the crisis as an opportunity, with a whopping peak of 85% of founders surveyed in the UK saying the adoption of digital tools is a driver for their business. A surprising 44% are also still growth focused, with the rest pulling back into cash preservation mode. A healthy 42% of the companies say they may take advantage of state support when it comes to subsequent funding but a majority still think they can rely upon VC backers to fill the coffers
While founders are optimistic about opportunity and financing potential they still face headwinds as investors slow their pace of investments. The survey shows while investors are generally optimistic their capacity for deals is slowed by the inability to travel and meet founders in person.
A striking percentage of European VCs, 70%, think the recovery will follow a ‘U’ shaped curve but still has yet to bottom out. This means only half of funds really are operating at their usual capacity, as many still do have fires to fight among existing portfolio companies and are otherwise slowing their new investment pace assuming a market bottom is still yet to come. Further, given that at least one-third of investors say they are not comfortable making investments remotely, the other two-thirds are likely to limit their investments mainly to founders they’ve previously known or previously worked with in earlier investments.
Founders, especially those without existing venture financing or previous relationships, will see some of their optimism dampened when it comes time for them to seek that financing. First time founders especially will struggle to build these relationships when they can only do Zoom meetings for the indefinite future. The consensus amongst surveyed investors was that it would be 14-19 months until business was “back to usual” so founders should heavily consider that timing in their own fundraising plans. Even when isolation restrictions are lifted many VCs will still choose to limit their time in the office and prefer virtual meetings, so it could be a substantial wait before these founder relationships can be fully developed enough to drive investment decisions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The U.S. Economy Will Beat Coronavirus, Buffett Says: ‘Never Bet Against America’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, speaking at Berkshire Hathaway’s first-ever virtual shareholders meeting on Saturday, said that he is optimistic that the U.S. economy can bounce back and overcome coronavirus. 
While Buffett admitted that “we haven’t faced anything that quite resembles this problem” before, he said that the United States has “faced tougher problems” and overcome them in the past.
“I remain convinced… nothing can basically stop America,” he said. “The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again.”
Buffett acknowledged that the virus is “still hard to evaluate” and “we’re learning as we go along,” though he says that he does take solace in the fact that it is “not as lethal as it may have been.”
While he is optimistic about America’s economic future, Buffett said that the fallout from coronavirus is still unclear—and hard to compare to past crises: “In 2008-2009, our economic train went off the tracks,” he described. “This time, we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on a siding.” 
The Oracle of Omaha took a big-picture view to demonstrate his optimism about the economy: The United States today is “an incredibly more wealthy country than we were in 1789.”
He calculated that the net worth of the United States in 1789 amounted to around $1 billion, while the wealth of the country today is well over $100 trillion: “That’s mind blowing,” he said.
“In the end, the answer is: Never bet against America,” Buffett said.
That’s how much Buffett’s investing conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B , lost in the first quarter. The company reported a massive net loss of nearly $50 billion, as the coronavirus-driven market sell-off took a significant toll on the company's stock holdings.
U.S. economic activity plunged during the first quarter, with GDP contracting by 4.8%—the biggest downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. The benchmark S&P 500 index had fallen over 30% by late March, before recouping some of those losses in April: It’s now down 13% so far in 2020. What’s more, with corporate earnings season well underway, many companies are also disclosing the damage the virus has done; Even some of the biggest companies in the world, such as AppleAAPL and AmazonAMZN , have felt the impact.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Sells Airline Stocks Amid Coronavirus: ‘I Made A Mistake’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told shareholders on Saturday that he had sold all of the company’s airline stocks, admitting that he had made a mistake and that coronavirus had changed the business in a “very major way.”
Buffett confirmed that he had sold all of his stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines: His positions in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines were cumulatively worth north of $4 billion.
“The world has changed for airlines,” Buffett said, noting that the industry has been “really hurt by a forced shutdown” due to the coronavirus.
With the pandemic effectively halting global air travel, U.S. airlines are now receiving portions of $25 billion in federal grants and loans.
Buffett said Berkshire originally invested between $7 billion and $8 billion for large stakes in the major airlines, but the company didn’t get anywhere near that in return for its investment.
“It turned out I was wrong,” the Oracle of Omaha said, adding that he’d made an “understandable mistake” given the unforeseen downturn in the industry.
“I don’t know that three, four years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year,” Buffett warned. “You’ve got too many planes.”
“When we bought [airlines], we were getting an attractive amount for our money,” Buffett said. “It turned out I was wrong about that business because of something that was not in any way the fault of four excellent CEOs. Believe me. No joy of being a CEO of an airline.”
That’s the value of stocks sold by Berkshire in the month of April. Buffett’s conglomerate only bought $426 million worth of equities during that period. “We did very little in the first quarter,” he admitted. “That isn’t because we thought the stock market was going to go down,” he explained. “I just decided that I’d made a mistake [with airlines].”
Berkshire Hathaway reported a massive net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter. The coronavirus market selloff that occurred in late February and through most of March took a significant toll on the company's businesses. Berkshire’s cash pile rose from $125 billion to $137.3 billion, as the Oracle of Omaha continues to look for an elephant-size acquisition.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 4 Reasons Why Reopening Could Crush The Restaurant Industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While 97% of the US Population is still under some form of shelter in place order, restaurants are beginning to reopen in 62% of the USA. Two highly-populated states, Georgia and Texas, are allowing for patrons to dine inside at restaurants with a 25% capacity restriction. While restaurant owners nationwide take precautions and diligently strive to stay safe, significant risks remain. Risks that, despite our best efforts, could crush the restaurant industry. Here’s why:
Some states, like Montana, South Dakota and Florida are already seeing declines in the number of coronavirus cases. However, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is watching cases spike in his home state, since economic easing began on April 27. Regardless of your state’s stats: if you contract COVID-19, the odds of you getting sick are exactly 100%. Whether restaurant, bowling alley, shopping mall or any other enterprise, business leaders, workers and hungry consumers have to ask: are we really ready for this? The truth is, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the way this virus works.
Reopening is the way forward, there can be no doubt. Here’s hoping that we do so safely and in a way that protects small business owners, workers and the folks who just want to grab a little dinner. In reaching for prosperity, pub owners could get crushed in the process. Because, right now, restaurants have more than bad Yelp reviews to consider. A lot more.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Shares Latest Views On The Markets At Shareholder Meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B ’s annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett shared his views on the markets. Despite recent events, his overall message was broadly consistent with past years. He emphasized disciplined, long-term investing over decades rather than any short-term market for the next day, month or year.
Buffett continued to stress his belief in betting on America for the long term. However, he pulled back from making any short-time market call. He remains very bullish on the U.S. on a 20-year view. He believes the range of outcomes for the pandemic were extraordinarily broad. Now the range of outcomes has narrowed somewhat, but remain highly uncertain over the next 6-12 months with the possibility for follow-on impacts or the virus returning after the summer months. Still, he didn’t want to make an explicit call on the virus itself, joking that he did ok in accounting but was a disaster in biology.
As such Buffett stressed that over the long-term America can be expected to prevail. That said over the over the short-term he wanted to make it clear that the markets can do anything. He gave examples of times during history when the the stock exchange temporarily closed, and in 1987 when the markets fell over 22% in a day. He also reminded people that those who invested in the U.S. in 1929, around the time he was born, had to wait until the 1950s to get back to even. Again, he wasn’t making a prediction but stating that negative outcomes in the markets were quite possible in the shorter term.
As such Buffett stressed that any investor should invest based on their own mind, and not the advice of others, and with a long-term view and with a stomach for inevitable declines along the way. He also stressed his belief that most people will do fine with low-cost index funds, rather than more sophisticated strategies. He also believes that investing with borrowed money or on margin is potentially dangerous. These themes are consistent with past years, though it is also very clear Buffett is trying to avoid any short-term bullish pronouncements.
Berkshire owned shares in the four large U.S. airlines, specifically American Airlines AAL , Delta Airlines DAL , Southwest LUV and United Continental UAL . They have now sold their entire stakes in each. Buffett sees airlines as “really hurt” in the current environment. Even if Berkshire owned an entire airline he mentioned it would be a “tough decision” whether to keep it. In Buffett’s view a low-probability event happened in terms of how the coronavirus has impacted air travel. He doesn’t want this to be viewed as verdict on the management of the airlines. Furthermore, he doesn’t want it to be viewed as an verdict on the broader markets either which is why he explained the move in some detail.
Buffett outlined his logic that if airline capacity comes back to 70% or 80% of prior levels, then the planes aren’t going to disappear. This makes the future for the airlines a lot less clear than it was previously since we’ve seen what happens in the past when airline load factors decline, in Buffett’s view. Furthermore, the airlines now have more debt than previously, and may well need additional funding beyond that.
So those hoping for a short-term market call from Buffett did not get it, nor did he hint on what his next big deal might be. That said, his view on airlines is implicitly bearish. One of his clearest statements was on the debt markets, he feels that now is a good time to borrow given low interest rates.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Super-Rare Moon Meteorite Found In Sahara Desert Goes On Sale For $2.5 Million</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Moon is covered in craters from impacts by asteroids. Everyone knows that. Sometimes rocks get flung into space, and just occasionally, they find thier way to Earth.
Then someone gets rich.
NWA 12691, one of the largest known Moon rocks of all at a hefty 13.5kg/29.7 pounds, went on sale this week at London auction house Christie’s for £2 million/US$2.5 million.
Why so expensive? Between 1969 and 1972, NASA’s six Apollo missions brought back 382 kilograms/842 pounds of Moon rock. Meanwhile, only about 650kg of lunar meteorites have been found—of which NWA 12691 is the fifth-largest.
Moon rock is among the rarest substances on Earth; after all, it has to first make a had to travel at least 384,400 km/238,900 mile journey through space to get there.
Much larger than anything returned by the Apollo astronauts, NWA 12691 was found in January 2017 around the Western Saharan, Algerian and Mauritanian borders. It was actually one of 30 lunar meteorites found—a haul weighing 103.77 kg in total.
Available for immediate purchase via Christie’s Private Sales, NWA 12691 was part of a large meteorite shower across the region, which is responsible for nearly half of all known lunar meteorites.
“I’ve been lucky enough to handle a few lunar meteorites at Christie’s over the years, but every time I see this specimen in the warehouse the sheer size of it bowls me over,” said James Hyslop, Christie’s Head of Science & Natural History. “Weighing over 13.5kg, it is so much larger than anything else that has ever been offered before. The experience of holding a piece of another world in your hands is something you never forget.”
The biggest Moon rock brought back to Earth by Apollo astronauts was one called “Big Muley,” which weighs 11.7kg/26 pounds and was found by Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke at Plum Crater at the Moon’s Descartes Highlands in 1972.
Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">One Key Reason Why The S&P 500 Doesn’t Fully Reflect The Economic Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The S&P 500 is now down just 13% for 2020. The more tech-focused NASDAQ NDAQ index is off just 2%. At the same time economic indicators are breaking records in the most negative sense as a global recession hits. So what’s going on?
Indices like the S&P 500 are constructed in a particular way. All indices implicitly choose, based on rules, what stocks to include and how to weight them. So far this crisis has had clear winners and losers, this is perhaps different to a usual recession.
In a typical recession the question for the fast majority of firms is how bad they get hit. In this crisis, though many firms are experiencing enormous shocks, others are actually benefiting. For example, while oil companies are seeing oil demand drop substantially, tech firms are seeing increasing demand for online tools and services.
Now here’s the thing, while I.T. makes up 26% of the S&P 500, energy comprises 3%. Therefore what happens to the tech sector matters more than eight times as much for the S&P 500 than what happens to energy right now.
So the market, especially when expressed by benchmarks such as the S&P 500, isn’t ignoring the pain, but the weighting structure matters. Yes, energy stocks, in aggregate, have more than halved in 2020, but their weighting in the index isn’t large enough to really move the needle all that much. In contrast certain tech firms are actually benefiting economically from certain aspects of the crisis and their stocks have fared better as a result.
Of course, having a few stocks dominate the S&P 500 isn’t a new thing. Historically though the names have change it is absolutely normal for the largest companies to have weights of 5% in the index or more and the largest handful of stocks to make up 20% of the market or more. What’s relatively new for this recession is that the largest names happen to be in tech, and tech is holding up better than many industries. Therefore, the S&P 500 is not the best barometer for the state of the economy right now.
To test this we can look at different, less followed indices. For example, while the S&P 500 is down 13% an equal-weighted version S&P 500 index, where each stock carries the same weighting, rather then larger companies having a greater weighting, is down 20%. Also, U.S. small caps are off 23%. While we can still debate the disconnect between the economy and the markets, even on these numbers, we can see that part of the reason the S&P 500 is holding up reasonably well is a function of its composition.
The S&P 500 has a very significant weighting for those stocks that are seeing a less bad crisis than others, namely tech stocks. And what’s the second largest sector behind tech? It’s healthcare. So the composition of the index you look at matters and today broadly 40 cents of every dollar in the S&P 500 index by value is made up of tech and healthcare shares. Exactly those companies that are often holding up better in the crisis.
Therefore, don’t be too surprised when the S&P 500 doesn’t match the underlying performance of the economy. This crisis is somewhat different in that there are some relative winners at this point, and those companies are over-represented in the popular S&P 500 index.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Congress Could Reverse IRS Denial Of Tax Deductions For Paycheck Protection Expenses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On April 30, the IRS ruled out tax deductions for wages and rent paid with forgivable PPP loans. The IRS views it as a double dip. But some Senators and Congressmen are pushing back, saying that expenses funded with small business loans should be tax deductible after all, disagreeing with the IRS. The stakes clearly matter to businesses who have scooped up Paycheck Protection Program loans of up to $10M to keep their employees on the payroll during the shutdown. If you comply with the rules, you don’t have to pay the loan back. What’s more, there is no forgiveness of debt income when your loan is forgiven, which is normally when "loans" are taxed as income. There are exceptions to the rule that written off debt is taxed as income if you are insolvent or bankrupt, but otherwise cancellation of debt income hurts.
However, IRS Notice 2020-32 says you cannot claim tax deductions when you use the loaned PPP money to pay wages, rent, etc. The IRS says “this treatment prevents a double tax benefit.” Of course, the PPP loans are supposed to be used for exactly that purpose. Obviously, even in normal times, business expect wages, rent, etc. to be fully deductible. So who is right? It can be debated, and in fact was debated in tax circles before the IRS made its grave announcement. When the PPP came out, the allotted money ran out fast, but Congress eventually came to the rescue by authorizing more money. One wonders if there might be a third chunk of funding too. But tax deductions are plain vanilla for business wages and rent, aren’t they?
On the tax deduction point, some advisors cite support for the deductions, since the CARES Act did not expressly say otherwise. That is really the issue. This is clearly a relief provision for businesses in trouble, and surely Congress would have said no deduction if it meant that, correct? The CARES Act does not say one way or the other, but the IRS has a point when it cites several traditional tax principles for the usual notion that if income is tax exempt, you usually cannot also claim deductions relating to it. Applying the rules consistently, the IRS says, you shouldn’t be able to get the free money, not pay discharge of debt income, and still deduct the payments of wages and rent made with the free money. The IRS notice confirms their view that this no double benefit rule applies.
Still, there are good arguments for deductions too. There could be a dispute about what Congress really meant in the hastily passed CARES Act, and the push-back from some in Congress suggests that. Despite the IRS statement, some people have said they may try to deduct these expenses anyway and fight with the IRS about it if needed. And the tax law is sufficiently debatable that some of those taxpayers could win, too. The latest from some congressional leaders could embolden some people in that direction. The CARES Act expressly says that the PPP loan forgiveness amount are not to be treated as taxable income, and proponents of deductions say the IRS denial of deductions is flatly inconsistent with that. Maybe it even makes it meaningless?
Of course, the PPP loan money still is the government funding the wages for that time, so the IRS has a point too under the tax law. But Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa stated,“The intent was to maximize small businesses’ ability to maintain liquidity, retain their employees and recover from this health crisis as quickly as possible. This notice is contrary to that intent.” Sen. Grassley has not said if Congress will try to reverse the IRS deduction nix by statute. However, House, Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., announced with his spokesperson Erin Hatch that “We are planning to fix this in the next response legislation.”
The Paycheck Protection Program allows loans of up to $10 million at 1% interest to employers with fewer than 500 workers to cover two months of payroll and overhead. If you keep your workers and do not cut their wages, the government will forgive most or all of the loan and even repay the bank that actually made you the loan. The loan amounts will be forgiven as long as: (1) The loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs, and most mortgage interest, rent, and utility costs over the 8-week period after the loan is made; and (2) Employee and compensation levels are maintained. Payroll costs are capped at $100,000 for each employee. SBA lenders have details.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin briefly surged past $9,000 this week to its highest since February, mirroring the stock market rally in the middle of the week as Fed chair Jerome Powell said he’s willing to take more action to prop up the economy. With less than two weeks until bitcoin’s halving, investors were uncertain about which direction the price would go as the event approached. “At this stage, it appears that the bulls have prevailed,” digital asset researcher Denis Vinokourov says. If bitcoin responds like it did after its previous two halvings, this could usher in a new class of crypto millionaires.
Other major cryptocurrencies recorded impressive gains Wednesday as well, and Stellar was up more than 75% since the beginning of 2020 at its peak. The market receded slightly as investors took profits toward the end of the week.
With precarious food supply chains becoming front-page news during the coronavirus pandemic, the World Economic Forumreleased a report more than 18 months in the making this week detailing how blockchain can help. The 244-page study lays out a toolkit of how processing plants, distribution centers, retailers, banks and regulators can all work together more efficiently to streamline future supply chains.
An eye-opening report published Monday in the Financial Analysts Journal argued that arbitrage opportunities offered $384 million in risk-free profits to bitcoin investors in the first quarter of 2018. With many unregulated exchanges routinely showing significant price differentials, savvy investors could buy low and immediately sell higher. Arbitrage opportunities like this typically shrink as professional traders enter markets, but this paper found the opposite to be true for bitcoin—market inefficiencies have increased over time.
Social distancing and stay-at-home orders have made in-person voting impractical, so Utah’s Republican convention picked its nominees for the state’s June primary using Voatz, a blockchain-based voting service that uses facial recognition to verify voters’ identities. Voatz was criticized in an MIT study in February for being vulnerable to hackers, but it seemed to go off without a hitch in Utah.
Politicians have shown a keen interest in blockchain all the way up to Washington D.C., where 32 bills addressing cryptocurrency and blockchain policy have been introduced since the 116th Congress was sworn in in January 2019.
Sony announced the launch of its Blockchain Common Database this week as a new high-speed processing technology that can execute and store 7 million transactions per day. The company simulated a real-world scenario in its announcement where buses, cars, bikes and taxis can all share their location on the platform.
Target TGT and General MillsGIS will be among retailers adopting a Hedera blockchain system to prevent coupon fraud through their partnership with the non-profit Coupon Bureau.
Meanwhile, digital asset manager Wave Financial has partnered with the Wilderness Trail Distillery to tokenize 25,000 barrels of Kentucky Bourbon. Investments in the tokenization will be open to the public through a specialized closed-end fund, which Wave Financial hopes will return 20% annually over six years through the strategic sale of barrels.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Macy’s, Costco, Trader Joe’s, Zappos Approaching Return Of Retail From Many Angles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most big American retailers have been shut down tight for more than six weeks. They closed in a seemingly random order across the country, leaving only stores selling essential goods – like super markets, drug stores and discounters with household products – and some outliers like those selling guns, crafts, liquor and sporting goods, open.
Just as randomly, as we perhaps start to enter what some are calling the PostPad period, we are now seeing some of these retailers – both ones that were shuttered and some that remained open but were making it up as they went along – adapting policies and procedures to address what entrepreneur Mark Cuban has called The New Abnormal.
And similar to the shutdown these are all over the place too. Here’s a look at how four of the major national retailers are moving onto the next stage of this economic crisis:
Macy’s
On Monday Macy’s plans to open 68 of its approximately 775 stores, choosing states like Georgia and South Carolina where governors have relaxed restrictions, even as these states are not meeting federally suggested guidelines for reductions in infection levels. About a quarter of these stores will be located in malls operated by Simon Properties which aggressively opened 49 of its shopping centers last Friday, coincidentally the day May rents were due from its tenants.
The reopening Macy’s stores will have reduced hours, all kinds of social distancing and health and safety measures including having employees wear masks. Masks for shoppers appear to be optional.
Mall-based stores are expected to have an especially tough time restarting as surveys show as much as 45% of the population says it will avoid going to these places, at least at first. Shopping centers in China and Europe that have reopened have had mixed results in getting shoppers to return.
Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette understands none of this is going to be easy. He told CNBC, “I retain this optimism for our role in American retail…but everything was affected … all of us, are going to have some tough years."
Costco
Unlike the mask-optional policy at Macy’s, Costco has moved to a mandatory mask requirement. Though the warehouse club has remained open during the pandemic it said last week that starting on Monday it will require employees and shoppers to wear masks when they are in the store.
As such, they are believed to be the first major retailer to make this required even though many stores are having at least their workers wear masks and many shoppers are doing that as well.
“The use of a mask or face covering should not be seen as a substitute for social distancing. Please continue to observe rules regarding appropriate distancing while on Costco premises,” the company said.
One can assume that if you don’t happen to have a mask on hand, Costco will be glad to sell you 144 of them.
Trader Joe’s
Another retailer that has remained open selling food and essential merchandise, the eclectic super market is also taking a contrarian position when it comes to adapting some of the techniques like home delivery and curbside pick-up that other grocers have employed: it’s not doing either.
In a company podcast reported on in the online site SF Gate, the company offered unusual reasoning for the decision. “Creating an online shopping system for curbside pickup or the infrastructure for delivery, it's a massive undertaking. It's something that takes months or years to plan, build and implement and it requires tremendous resources. Well, at Trader Joe's, the reality is that over the last couple of decades we've invested those resources in our people rather than build an infrastructure that eliminates the need for people."
And while Trader Joe’s employees and the company culture that supports them is one of the most treasured cornerstones of their business one has to wonder if this is the real reason. Other retailers, like Michael’s, have rolled out curbside pick-up systems in a matter of weeks and home deliveries are exploding across the entire retail spectrum.
It’s a noble thought to place that much value on the personal experience of shopping at a Trader Joe’s but these are unprecedented times that seem to call for unprecedented measures, even if they are only temporary.
Zappos
As an online-only seller, this footwear and fashion accessories e-com that is owned by Amazon has been up and running the entire time. One has to assume that running shoes are not a top-of-mind purchase when so many people are quarantined in their homes but no doubt Zappos has been maintaining some level of business over this crisis.
So, its latest move has to be both a little out of left field and somewhat inspired. A little while ago it introduced a Customer Service for Anything – yup, that’s its name – phone number where anybody can call to ask about anything. Yes, it can be regarding a Zappos purchase but it doesn’t have to be. As the name implies, it can be about, well, anything. No doubt questions regarding toilet paper, what to stream this evening and questionable remedies suggested by a certain Washington DC resident have been popular topics.
Zappos has always taken a somewhat different approach to things, from its management structure to its merchandising so this service seems to be consistent with its credo. Maybe the most remarkable part of this whole thing is that it has a phone number you can call at all. Trying to get a human life form on the phone at its Amazon parent is somewhat akin to finding the Ark of the Covenant.
Many other retailers are putting into place policies and programs as they seek to welcome shoppers back into their stores and websites. One has a feeling we’ve only just begun to see exactly what kinds of things they will do to make that happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Debt, Overcapacity Are Why Warren Buffett Sells Airline Stocks During Coronavirus. Berkshire Hathaway Divests American, Delta, Southwest And United</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B has sold at a loss its entire portfolio of U.S. airline stocks comprising American Airlines AAL , Delta DAL Air Lines, Southwest LUV Airlines and United UAL Airlines.
“We put, whatever it was, seven or eight billion into it and we did not take out anything like seven or eight billion,” Buffett said during Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 2. “That was my mistake.”
“We have sold the entire positions,” he said. “When we change our mind we don’t take half measures or anything of the sort.”
Berkshire had an 11% stake in Delta, 10% in each American and Southwest, and 9% in United. It sold some of the Delta and Southwest stakes in April. Berkshire started accumulating holdings in 2016, a reversal from Buffett’s long disdain for airlines.
The Oracle of Omaha professes no insight to the long-term outlook of travel and the aviation business. But Buffett sees the immediate future negative for investors since airlines are accumulating debt, diluting shareholder value by issuing equity, and could have overcapacity.
“It’s obviously changed in the fact that the four companies are each going to borrow perhaps an average of at least $10 or $12 billion each,” Buffett said. “You have to pay that back out of earnings over some period of time.”
Buffett does not fault airline management.
“We were not disappointed at all in how the businesses were being run,” he said. Current problems are “through absolutely no fault of the airlines themselves but something that was a low probability event.”
Buffett expects further short-term aviation weakness from over-capacity. “The airline business has the problem that if the business comes back 70% or 80%, the aircraft don’t disappear,” he said. “You’ve got too many planes.”
American and Delta are exiting around 100 aircraft and evaluating further retirements. United and others are also assessing their future sizes.

Buffett was displeased shareholder value in airlines could be diluted from new equity.
“In some cases they’re having to sell stock or sell the right to buy stock,” Buffett said. “That takes away from the upside.”
U.S. airlines agreed to give the government warrants in exchange for the $25 billion of loans authorized under the CARES Act. The warrants generally equate to around a 1% stake.
United Airlines is raising $1.04 billion of new equity, so far the only U.S. airline to do so. Outside of the U.S., Singapore Airlines raised S$5.3 billion (US$3.74 billion) in new equity. But most governments are only giving loans.
By accepting the U.S. government loans, airlines are prohibited from issuing dividends until one year after they repay the loan.
The loans also went to smaller airlines like Alaska and JetBlue, but Buffett only invested in the big four: American, Delta, Southwest and United.
“We would have bought other airlines,” Buffett disclosed. “But those were the four big ones and the ones we could put some money into.”
U.S. airlines are further raising debt by tapping private markets, often in amounts that exceed the loans from the U.S. government. The CARES Act separately authorized $25 billion of direct grants to cover payroll expenses.
Buffett did not disclose the size of losses by selling his airline portfolio, but said it was “relatively minor.”
There is considerable attention on Buffet’s proclamation “the world changed for airlines.”
But Buffett said he had no insights. “I don’t know how it’s changed,” he conceded.
“I don’t know whether Americans will have now changed their habits or will change their habits,” Buffett said.
“It’s been seven weeks since I’ve had a haircut,” he said. “I’ve been just a question of ‘Which sweatsuit I wear?’ so who knows. Who knows how we come out of this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Auto Sales Crashed In April But There Are Reasons For Optimism, Experts Say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an auto industry that has been wracked by the coronavirus, there is now a reason for optimism. That’s the word from two companies that spend a great deal of their time tracking and predicting auto sales. In an exclusive interview with forbes.com, TrueCar CEO Mike Darrow said that the raw data he monitored in the last several days of April was growing more positive, and just-released data and analysis from J.D. Power suggests the used-car market began to rebound in the final two weeks of last month.
Barring a sudden, unexpected nosedive, it appears that new- and used-car sales reached the bottom of the COVID-19 trough over the four-week span between mid-March, when lockdown orders began to take full effect, and mid-April. Since then both J.D.Power and TrueCar data suggest a decided sales uptick.
Of course, one shouldn’t minimize the depth and suddenness of the downturn that was brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the severe measures local and state governments put in place to ward off its effects. Sales results for April reported over the past 24 hours indicate new-car sales could be down 50% versus the results of April 2019. But that is not as bad as it might have been. Darrow told us that a little over a week ago, sales results TrueCar monitored suggested that April sales might be down as much as 70%. Then came an upturn later in the month, and Darrow said that, when all is said and done, April 2020 sales, though down significantly, won’t drop 70% and perhaps not even 50%.  
“What we're seeing is much more optimistic than that,” he said. “Our latest forecasts had the industry down about 50%, and what we're seeing with the early reporting today is that potentially it's moving closer to the mid 40s, or maybe 40%.”
Still, TrueCar’s ALG, the lease guide that many financial institutions depend upon for auto sales projection and residual values, has predicted that 2020 auto sales might tumble to a total 12.5-6 million units. That’s a long way from the 17 million cars sales the U.S. enjoyed the past five years. Darrow suggests that the most recent information could cause that prediction to be revised upwards. 
“The other indicators we look at seem to be optimistic as well,” he said. “Our organic traffic over the past couple of weeks has returned to pre-COVID levels. So people are out there searching on automotive terms, and they're doing some shopping. That's an early indicator of demand.”
As some states reopen for business, that itself provides room for optimism that the worst is over. One sign that car dealers feel the hardest days are behind them is increased prices for used cars at auction. Wholesale auction prices grew by over one percent on a weekly basis for the week ending April 26, according to Jonathan Banks, J.D. Power vice president, vehicle valuations & analytics. 
While it was only a slight uptick, Banks said the positive result was the first improvement since the virus reared its ugly head in March. As we enter May, sales of used cars are slowly recovering as more dealerships re-open the sales showrooms and return to more conventional operations. Vehicle sales at wholesale auctions were up sharply during the end of April, J.D. Power said, more than doubling the sales rate of the week that ended April 5. 
One thing was was obvious from the auction results was that stay-at-home orders didn’t just impact retail sales to consumer car-buyers. They also proved very damaging to physical auctions, while virtual online auctions fared better. 
While the April sales numbers are a jolt — even a 40% sales drop can only be regarded as catastrophic — the tea leaves suggest the April drop is not indicative of a long-term trend. Instead, it’s a profound symptom of a pandemic and the unprecedented reaction to it.
TrueCar’s Darrow remains optimistic about the future, and he has plaudits for the auto manufacturers who immediately recognized the problem and stepped in with strong incentives to spur consumer sales.
“They're doing a great job right now, making it possible for consumers who are in need of a vehicle to get a good deal on one,” he said. “The whole ecosystem starts pulling together in times like this. The OEMs put advanced incentives out there. Sites like ours look for ways to help dealers modify their retail process to meet consumers needs. So everybody's pitching in to make this market the best we can.”
One thing to remember is that before the pandemic hit, 2020 was shaping up to be a pretty car sales year.
“There's some pent up demand out there,” Darrow said. “There are some people who have to buy vehicles and they're going to find a way to do that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">China Won’t Rescue Embraer. Boeing May Remain Its Best Hope.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The collapse of the Boeing-Embraer airliner joint venture leaves the Brazilian company in a difficult position. As the smallest commercial airframe prime, Embraer faces a structural disadvantage in competing with large players, particularly Airbus, in a global market.
To put a brave face on the situation in the midst of a global aviation industry meltdown, Brazilian officials and observers have posited the notion of China as an alternative commercial aviation partner for Embraer. Brazil’s Vice President Hamilton Mourao stated, “It’s a blessing in disguise … It’s an inevitable marriage. We have the know-how, they [China] have the demand.”
However, the road taken by Western supplicants to China’s purported aviation largesse is well-trodden, and problematic. As I wrote eight years ago, just before the failure of a pathetic attempt by a Chinese company to purchase Hawker Beechcraft, “There are many other cases where the mention of China brought dollar signs to peoples’ eyes, followed by disappointment.”
In this case, there are four reasons to doubt that China will rescue the jilted bride:
No Evidence That China Will Fund Big Aerospace Acquisitions. It wasn’t just China’s failure to acquire Hawker Beechcraft. There is very little evidence that China is interested in any high-value aviation acquisitions. So far, they’ve purchased relatively small (and sometimes distressed) assets, such as FACC, Cirrus, Continental Motors and AIM Altitude. Strangely, many years ago a Chinese investment firm was able to buy Fairchild Dornier out of bankruptcy for a pittance; the remnants of this once-promising regional jet manufacturer promptly sank without a trace.
Product Overlap And National Pride. China’s first national jet, Comac’s ARJ21, is basically a failure – it’s heavy, technologically obsolete, and very late. After several decades of existence and four years of production, just a handful have been delivered to a few marginal Chinese airlines. However, in theory, it directly competes with Embraer’s E175. It would be a remarkable – and unlikely – admission of failure for China to give up on that national jet, yet that would be the inevitable result of acquiring Embraer since the E175 is vastly superior.
Similarly, one of Embraer’s reasons for seeking a partnership is to develop a new large turboprop, notionally designated the E-3. But China’s MA700, due to enter service in the next few years, is in exactly the same market segment. There’s clearly considerable overlap between Embraer’s planes and China’s long-gestating indigenous airliners.
This same dynamic also makes Japanese industry a non-starter. Mitsubishi, with extensive assistance from other Japanese companies, airlines, and the government, have been developing a regional jet for over a decade. The recently renamed and redesigned SpaceJet is actually the world’s only new-generation regional jet design that can hope to compete with Embraer’s very strong E175. There’s no scope for cooperation here.
Contradictory Political Messages And Goals. Hamilton Mourao, and his boss, President Jair Bolsonaro, are former Brazilian military officers who promulgate hard right wing, evangelical Christian, and very pro-U.S. (and pro-Trump) policies. Selling a core component of the nation’s largest defense and aerospace company to a communist government seems a bizarre contradiction of this message. If any of these allies and constituents push back against a proposed sale (and they probably would), this scandal-plagued government would likely quickly back down.
China Doesn’t Have What Embraer Needs. The strongest argument for the Boeing JV was that the U.S. company would bring serious muscle to the E-Jet supply chain. Only a behemoth like Boeing would have the kind of leverage needed to pressure suppliers to bring costs down, and therefore jet prices too. This, in turn, would allow the E190 and E195-E2 to compete with Airbus’s A220, which went through exactly the same process after the European jetmaker acquired it (as the CSeries) from Bombardier.
But China offers none of this. Its aerospace industry has very little experience in managing complex supply chains, and it lacks any kind of commercial critical mass. All it offers suppliers is the virtual certainty that their intellectual property will be put at risk. These suppliers will have no reason whatsoever to cut prices for a Chinese-owned Embraer, so there will be no boost to the E-Jets’ competitiveness.
For these four reasons, China is a very unlikely option for Embraer. And I can’t identify any other potential major partners, although there could certainly be some smaller ones out there.
But unlikely as it sounds, we shouldn’t rule out the idea of Boeing reconsidering, particularly if Boeing’s story – that it walked away because Embraer did not satisfy key terms and conditions of the JV agreement – is accurate. After all, without Embraer, Boeing is abandoning the growing 100- to 130-seat market segment to its archrival Airbus. Also, one day, if Boeing actually does launch a new jetliner (the odds aren’t looking good right now, but that could change) Embraer offers impressive engineering and flight test resources. 
Clearly, as Embraer and Boeing enter the post-JV failure arbitration process, it would be in both sides’ interest to keep acrimony at a minimum, and to keep all doors open.

    <h5 class="mb-1">3 Insights From Warren Buffett At Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 Annual Meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Note: If you want to dive in deeper and discuss insights from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway 2020 Annual Meeting, please reserve one of the few remaining spots at the free live webinar on Monday.
Warren Buffett is idolized by many as the world’s greatest investor of all time. This is well-deserved based on the amazing amount of wealth that he has created for himself and others over decades. Unfortunately, if you were expecting that Buffett’s wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual meeting was going to yield easy answers about the current investment landscape, you are likely to be disappointed.
There were 3 clear themes that struck me as I listened to the livestream of the meeting on Saturday. They left me with an impression of a man who is cautious and appropriately uncertain about the future developments of the world from here. It was also quite clear that Buffett did not think there were any opportunities of size attractive enough to invest in, either now or earlier this year. This is in stark contrast with the carefree stock-market rebound that has been occurring since the March lows, and should leave you quite a bit worried if you bought in to the narrative that there will be a quick economic and stock market rebound that is sustainable longer-term.
1.      Warren Buffett Does Not Know, And Neither Do You!
Warren Buffett: “The range of possibilities has narrowed now vs. when this started. It is not as bad as it could have been nor is it as good as it could have been.”
Warren Buffett: “The range of possibilities is still extremely wide on the economic side. I don't really know of any parallels of the most productive country in the world sidelining its economy and workforce.”
If you think that you know how this is going to play out, you are kidding yourself. You should always be thinking in ranges, and this time is no different. One thing that is clear is that there are still many surprises that can occur.
The question isn’t even so much about the virus itself. The stock market is reacting, incorrectly, to the evidence that we have gotten that the health impact of this disease is not as bad as initially feared. That is likely to be true. What nobody knows is the second and third order consequences of our approach to the cure.
Will people spend freely once the restrictions on life are relaxed? Will businesses hire workers back? Will there be social unrest as the losers in our society impoverished by the way things have played out through no fault of their own protest this outcome? Will the government’s unprecedented printing of money cause huge unintended consequences? Nobody knows, but the range of possibilities is wider than most of us can imagine.
2.      The Investment Opportunities In Large Securities Were Unattractive At March Lows, Which Means They Are Even Less Attractive Today.
Warren Buffett: “We have not bought anything because there was not anything attractive to do.”
Warren Buffett: “We did not see anything attractive. A lot of companies got the chance to refinance because of the actions of the Federal Reserve.”
Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of equities this year, through the end of April. That should surprise you. It is certainly a very different take than the market’s which has rallied sharply off the March lows.
Many stock market participants are now wistfully talking about the March lows as some kind of once in a generation investment opportunity. It was not, at least not on a wide scale in securities of large companies. At least not according to the man who has been most successful at investing across generations.
That is not to say that there were not or are not good opportunities. There were and there are. However, these are not ones that Buffett can deploy billions of dollars in. Rather, they are only available to those who have much smaller pools of capital to deploy, and even in those circumstances the current opportunity set is far from amazing.
Buffett has shined the light on the carefree complacency of many stock market participants who have not yet fully grasped the severity of our current situation. Those who think that what has happened is only a small bump in the investment road might be in for a rude shock to that perception and the value of their investment portfolios.
Think about it, given the magnitude of the economic shock that we are experiencing, does it make sense that the U.S. stock market is down only 12% year to date? After having started at a very expensive level following a long bull market? I am no market expert – I am a value investor whose expertise is investing in individual securities, not market analysis. However, this picture makes little sense to me and smacks more of wishful thinking than of a sober assessment of all the possibilities.
3.      Berkshire Hathaway’s Intrinsic Value Has Decreased
Warren Buffett: “I don't think that Berkshire shares are a much more compelling value now than they were 3 months or 6 months ago.”
Warren Buffett: “The amount of litigation that is going to be generated out of what has already happened, much less what is still to happen, is going to be huge.”
That Warren Buffett thinks that Berkshire’s value has declined by a roughly similar amount as its stock price (which has declined roughly 19% year to date) is surprising. After all, part of the premise of the company’s construction is its rock-solid balance sheet, its ability to invest for the long-term in times of distress, and its managerial prowess which should allow many of its subsidiaries to increase their competitive advantage while their competitors are retrenching. Buffett talked about almost none of that, at least not in as far as suggesting that there hasn’t been a major hit to Berkshire Hathaway’s value.
The question that you should be thinking about is that if one of the strongest companies in the world has seen such a large value impairment, what does that imply for many other companies that are less resilient?
If there is one punchline from all of this for investors groping for a sense of what the future may hold, it is this: Be careful. The worst is unlikely to be behind us and caution will serve you well in preserving and growing your wealth.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Parks And Recreation’ Special Scores On NBC; Raises $2.8 Million For COVID-19 Relief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five years after concluding, the cast of NBC comedy Parks and Recreation reunited for a new episode last Thursday, April 30. The half-hour, sponsored by State Farm and Subaru of America, has currently raised $2.8 million for Feeding America, the renowned hunger relief organization. Including in the tally, to-date, is $500,000 in matching donations from State Farm, Subaru of America, NBCUniversal and the producers, writers and cast of Parks and Recreation.
This new episode of Parks and Recreation focused on Amy Poehler’s character Leslie Knope as she caught up virtually with her former Parks department co-workers to see how they were doing following the outbreak of COVID-19.
By the traditional Nielsen ratings, Parks and Recreation, also featuring Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O’Heir, Retta and Ben Schwartz all reprising their roles from the original series, scored the network’s top sitcom result in the Thursday 8:30 p.m. half-hour in total viewers since Oct. 26, 2017. It averaged 3.7 million total viewers and a 1.4 rating in adults 18-49, based on the Live+Same Day data (which excludes DVR usage) from 8:30-9:02 p.m. ET. Comparably, Parks and Recreation ranked first for the evening in adults 18-49 and adults 18-49.
Earlier in the evening on NBC was 8 p.m. ET half-hour special, The Paley Center Salutes Parks and Recreation, which averaged 3.4 million viewers and a 1.0 rating in the demo. Comparably, this was the most-watched Paley Center special since the salute to drama This Is Us on Sept. 18, 2018, and highest-rated in the demo since the Will & Grace salute on Sept. 19, 2017.
Despite opening the evening on an improved note, it was downhill for NBC from 9-11 p.m. ET care of an encore telecast of the pilot episode of Council of Dads and the second installment of the new drama at 10 p.m. ET. This regularly scheduled 10 p.m. time period premiere of Council of Dads dipped to a modest 2.0 million viewers and a 0.3 rating in adults 18-49.
Overall, CBS was the most-watched network on this final April evening, with an average of 6.35 million viewers with its combination of sitcoms Young Sheldon, Man With a Plan (two episodes) and recent entry Broke, followed by Edie Falco crime drama Tommy. ABC topped the evening in adults 18-49, with an average 0.8 in the demo with its combination of the 8 p.m. ET time period debut of the revival of game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, followed by dramas Station 19 and soon-to-conclude How To Get Away With Murder from 9-11 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global Stock Markets Could Predict Economic Future Post Covid-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world is confused and panicked about Covid-19. We are awash in data. But the data, while accumulating fast, is wildly incomplete and too often sensationally misinterpreted. Where to turn for truth? A famous investor friend of mine, who runs a $100-plus billion fund for more than 2,500 clients, likes to say that global stock markets are the best predictor of the future—not only financial trends, but of all important trends. That includes this year’s monster, Covid-19. Long before Wikipedia, the global stock markets embodied what is now called “the wisdom of the crowds.” Markets are vast storehouses of data, analytics, algorithms and predictions of the near-term future.
In other words, you’re safe in assuming that today’s global stock markets have already absorbed and processed as much information about Covid-19—pessimistic and optimistic—as have Imperial College, Johns Hopkins, the World Health Organization, and all the world’s medical universities, hospitals, health services and governments combined.
That is not to say the global stock market is a perfect predictor. It can be crazily optimistic (e.g. 1929, 1999) or pessimistic (e.g. 1932, 1974, 1997 in Asia, or 2009) at any given time. Its horizons can be short in a bear market or long in a bull market, then suddenly switch. As Warren Buffett likes to say, the stock market is like a voting machine in the short run, but a weighing machine in the longer run. It always swings back to some approximation of the truth. It does so generally faster than any health service, research foundation, or government can do.
Think of it this way: global stock markets and investors command more computing power, better software, faster networks, and the intense focus of tens of millions of individuals betting their own money. Most investors are highly accomplished, numerate and analytical, representing in their aggregate a vast and virtual supercomputer. This supercomputer likes nothing more than to bulldoze those acting on bad data or their own confirmation biases.
My friend, the one with the fund, likes to say, “Mr. Market is the Great Humiliator of us all.” The market rewards good decisions and punishes bad ones harshly. Can we say the same of most health services, research foundations, and governments?
Covid-19 is a global crisis, first spotted in China, then the rest of Asia and Europe. Now it is surging in the Americas. The global stock markets—around $60 trillion in size as of April 1—respond daily to news about Covid-19 whether awful or promising. That includes policy responses, whether good or bad. While global stocks have seen dramatic declines so far in 2020, China’s stock markets are down by comparatively modest percentages this year—Shanghai down 7%, Shenzhen up 2% and Hong Kong 15% lower—reflecting China’s first-to-suffer, first-to-recover status.
Now let’s look at the U.S. stock markets. The S&P 500, Russell 2000 and Nasdaq 100 are down 15%, 29% and 4% respectively. What does that tell us? The sagging Russell 2000 says small companies will suffer the most over the next several months; many small companies will cease to exist. On the other hand, Nasdaq 100 says big tech companies are in the best shape. They have the cash. They are not dependent on physical labor or foot traffic.
Tech’s expanding role in all industries hints at why the Nasdaq 100 has fallen less than the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 since markets turned bearish. Precisely because Covid-19 has pushed all other stories off the front page, it’s easy to forget the huge digital transformation wave in front of us. Don’t make that mistake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drs. Fauci & Birx: Here’s A Way To Contain Covid-19 And Reopen The Economy In As Little As One Month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drs. Fauci and Birx, you are working tirelessly and heroically to fight Coronavirus. Everyone thanks you. But you are ignoring the obvious way to actually save American lives and livelihoods. It’s PCR-based household-group testing. The protocol, developed by Cornell’s Operations Research professor, Peter Frazier, can contain and kill Covid-19 in one month!
Dear Drs. Fauci and Birx,
You are working tirelessly and heroically to fight Coronavirus. I and hundreds of millions of other Americans thank you for your efforts. Yet I find myself totally perplexed as to why you are ignoring the obvious and sure way to eliminate the scourge of Covid-19 in just one month.
The solution is PCR group-household testing of all American households every week. Doing so will require running only 6 million tests per week, which is eminently and imminently feasible. Group testing was developed by economist Robert Dorfman during WWII to test for syphilis in army recruits. It's used routinely to test blood donations. It's also been used in PCR testing of animals. Its sensitivity to Covid-19 has been clearly established by Israeli scientists.
Testing all American households every week won't just save the economy, which is literally at death's door. It will save tens of thousands of lives. Compared to what you two are effectively sanctioning — each state opens up while paying lip service to your, at best, hopeful guidelines — bulletproof group testing is a godsend.
PCR group-household testing entails combining (mixing together) household samples and performing a test on the combined mixture. Given the new FDA-approved Rutgers University saliva test, all household members can spit into a single container and deliver or mail that container to a test-collection site with a filled out label detailing all contact information of all household members.
Suppose at the testing facility, the samples from 62 households are mixed together and tested. Further, assume the combined sample tests negative. In this case, we can clear 155 people (assuming 2.5 people per household) with a single test! That's a 155 to 1 efficiency factor relative to testing each person separately!
If a household tests negative, each household member would be notified to go to their local pharmacy to receive a green wristband coated to change to red after one week. After one week, everyone in the household would provide a new sample and be re-group tested.
This system is voluntary. But if you choose to have your household tested and receive your green wristband, you'll be permitted by your employer to return to work, by your teachers and professors to return to school, and by proprietors to enter their restaurants, shops, cafes, etc. You'll also be allowed to frequent the beach, attend concerts, go to the movies, ... .
Any household that tests positive will be required by the local board of health to quarantine in place for two weeks and then be re-tested. Households that don't voluntarily get tested will be free to come and go as they wish. But without their green bracelets, they will have a hard time entering into workplaces and other establishments. Employers who hired the untested could face legal liability. The same holds for any business serving the public who lets someone onto their premises without a green bracelet. Moreover, no one will eagerly enter into a restaurant, board an airplane, attend a university lecture, head to the mall, or go back to work unless they can see with their own two eyes that everyone they are encountering is sporting a green bracelet.
Is there something magical about the number 62? Yes. It's the optimal number of households to be included in a single test according to a carefully worked out protocol developed by Cornell University Professor of Operations Research, Peter Frazier, and his colleagues. (Note, under Frazier's protocol, the optimal group size changes by the week with the long-run optimal size stabilizing around 40.)
Professor Frazier’s protocol has two great advantages. In the process of doing the group-household testing, it identifies, with no extra tests, precisely those households that are positive. It also handles false negatives, assumed, very conservatively, to run at a 30 percent rate (ignoring intra-household correlation), via repeat testing. The repeat testing ensures that after four weeks virtually 100 percent of those wearing a green bracelet will, in fact, have correctly tested negative in their most recent test.
Why is a 30 percent false negative rate very conservative? First, because it’s at the high end of the studies out of China. Second, many of the false negatives may reflect inexperienced sample takers who didn't properly swab the very back of subjects' noses. With saliva testing, there is far less chance of collecting an improper sample. Third, by combining the saliva of all family members in one sample, the chances that the entire household sample will test negative when at least one household member is positive is much smaller than 30 percent. The reason, which Frazier’s protocol incorporates, is correlation. If one household member is infected, the chances are good that other members are infected. Moreover, they may have enough viral load collectively, whereas individually they may not. 
Professor Frazier's protocol will release 96 percent of the American public back into the economy in just one month. Thereafter, this percentage rises. Moreover his protocol works whether the true nationwide prevalence rates is high or low. (We still have no idea about the national prevalence rate, but would quickly learn in the process of group testing all U.S. households.) Remarkably, the protocol can achieve the same four-week release rate with six million tests regardless of whether the degree of prevalence is higher or lower than Frazier’s assumed 1 percent.
Surprisingly, cities or states with higher prevalence require fewer, not more tests. Intuitively, the higher the prevalence, the larger the share of households initially quarantined for the two weeks assumed for the disease to run its course. Yes, fewer green bracelets would be issued in the first three weeks, but by week four, 96 percent or more of households would be back to doing their normal activities.
By the way, companies like immunipass.com, can provide a modern equivalent of green bracelets. Households that group-test negative could receive a QR code on their phones that could be read and verified by employers and proprietors as individuals enter into their premises.
How does PCR group-testing relate to antibody screening, now available, and antigen testing, which may become available? The best estimates, based on the current allegedly sketchy antibody testing, indicates that from 3 percent to 17 percent of the population has, by now, contracted Covid-19. Even 17 percent is miles away from what is needed for herd immunity, namely about 66 percent. Going from a 3 percent to a 66 percent share of the population that’s survived Covid-19 entails another 800,000 deaths. Going from a 17 percent survivor rate to a 66 percent rate entails another 180,000 deaths. Hence, anyone counting on herd immunity to save the day is countenancing an enormous number of additional Covid-19 deaths.
If we can come up with an antibody test that's highly reliable and that shows that the antibodies are protective against reinfection, such individuals would receive bracelets that permanently stay green or turn to red only after a few months. This would reduce the requisite number of tests needed to return 96 percent of the population to normal life within four weeks. We'd need roughly 5 million, not 6 million tests per week. As for antigen tests, they are, to my knowledge, less accurate than PCR tests. Nor, as I understand it, can antigen tests be done on a highly efficient group basis.
Can we conduct 6 million group PCR tests each week? Yes! We're now running close to 2 million tests per week. Ramping up to 6 million tests per week should be easy. Our country built B-24 bombers in 53 minutes in WWII and cargo ships in four days. Germany will shortly be testing 4.5 million people per week. Scaled by our relative populations, that's 18 million tests per week in the US.
The issue is not getting to a reasonable number of tests in short order. The question, Drs. Fauci and Brix, is whether you are going to make proper use of those tests by testing everyone — the healthy as well as the sick. That means, to repeat, testing all households every week and providing negative household members with green turning-to-red bracelets or the electronic equivalent. This should be your, the President’s, and the governors’ sole game plan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bear Market Returns As The S&P 500 Tests Risky Level Pre-FOMC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week the stock market peaked as the S&P 500 tested its monthly risky level for April at 2,944. This occurred as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released is statement following its meeting.
The problem is that all five major averages are below risky levels without value levels suggesting that May could be a repeat on the March bear market.
Here is the scorecard for the major equity averages
Describing the Weekly Charts
The weekly chart for the Dow Jones Industrial Average is neutral with the average below its five-week modified moving average at 23,846. It is just below its 200-week simple moving average at 23,782. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 42.97 last week, up from 39.35 on April 24. The Dow is below monthly, quarterly, annual and semiannual risky levels at 25,781, 26,091, 29,964 and 30,361, respectively.
The weekly chart for the S&P 500 is positive with the index above its five-week modified moving average at 2,810.6. This index is above its 200-week simple moving average or “reversion to the mean” at 2,660.5. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 45.53 last week, up from 41.02 on April 24. Its quarterly, monthly, semiannual and annual risky levels are 2,979.6, 3,068.0, 3.303.4 and 3,466.5, respectively. 
 The weekly chart for the Nasdaq is positive with the index above its five-week modified moving average at 8,349.8. The Nasdaq is well above its 200-week simple moving average or reversion to the mean at 7,078.7. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 49.08 last week, up from 42.05 on April 24. Its quarterly pivot is 8,559 with semiannual, monthly and annual risky levels at 9,074, 9,177 and 9,352, respectively. 
The weekly chart for the Dow Jones Transportation Average is neutral with the average below its five-week modified moving average at 8,336. The average is way below its 200-week simple moving average or reversion to the mean at 9,864. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 31.33 last week, up from 28.74 on April 24. Transports set its all-time intraday high of 11,623.58 back on September 14, 2018. Its monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual risky levels are 9,220, 9,269, 12,155 and 12,755, respectively. 
The weekly chart for the Russell 2000 is neutral with the average below its five-week modified moving average at 1,265.11. It is well below its 200-week simple moving average or reversion to the mean rose to 1,477.73. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 31.37 last week, up from 28.31 on April 24. The small-cap index set its all-time intraday high of 1,742.09 back on August 31, 2018. Its quarterly, monthly, semiannual and annual risky levels are 1,424.48, 1,448.21, 1,831.9 and 1,910.58, respectively. 
How to use my value levels and risky levels:
The closes on December 31, 2019 were inputs to my proprietary analytics. Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.
The second quarter level was based upon the March 31 closes. The monthly levels for May were established based upon the April 30 closes.
New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week.
New quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year. Annual levels are in play all year long.
My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in.
To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.
How to use 12x3x3 Weekly Slow Stochastic Readings:
My choice of using 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon back-testing many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.
The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading and I found that the slow reading worked the best.
The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold.
A reading above 90.00 is considered an “inflating parabolic bubble” formation that is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months.
A reading below 10.00 is considered as being “too cheap to ignore” which typically is followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Investors Should Interpret Shell’s First Dividend Cut In 75 Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week Royal Dutch Shell did something that would have been nearly unthinkable at the beginning of this year. The company cut its dividend for the first time in 75 years.
This is remarkable considering the ups and downs of the oil industry of the past few decades. Prices have collapsed many times since then, albeit we have never before seen a major benchmark turn negative.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has hit oil demand in an unprecedented way. A few days ago Bloomberg posted an article showing that energy demand has just dropped by the largest percentage since World War II (which was the last time Shell cut its dividend).
That’s true, but in 1945 global oil demand had yet to reach 10 million barrels per day (BPD). In contrast, COVID-19 has sidelined an estimated 30 million BPD of oil demand. Thus, the global oil industry is coping with the largest demand collapse, by far, in its history.
This demand collapse is impacting both refiners and oil producers. Shell, as an integrated supermajor, is both. Refiners often benefit from falling oil prices, because they generally see margins expand. That’s why an integrated oil company is usually more stable during the ups and downs of oil prices. Upstream (oil and gas production) and downstream (refining) generally perform out of phase with each other, which helps balance out the cycles.
But the current collapse is hitting both ends — oil demand and finished product demand. This creates one of the most challenging economic climates the integrated oil companies have faced — perhaps ever.
Norway’s Equinor previously announced a two-thirds dividend cut, and now Shell has followed. Chevron CVX ’s CEO has publicly stated that the company has enough cash on hand for now to maintain its dividend, but it will also come under increasing pressure as long as oil prices remain depressed.
The oil producers and the refiners will remain under the most pressure, while the integrated companies won’t be far behind. The midstreams — the pipeline companies — are in somewhat better shape. However, they are no immune to the forces impacting the rest of the energy sector, as Plains All American Pipeline showed when they recently announced a distribution cut.
I think investors should heed the underlying warning in Shell’s first dividend cut in most of our lifetimes. Consider the pressure they must have been under not to break their 75 year streak. That is evidence that they see the current crisis unlike others the oil industry has faced in recent decades. They aren’t sure when oil demand will recover.
Thus, investors should be exceedingly cautious in the energy sector for the foreseeable future. This is especially true of oil-weighted producers, and refiners.
Safer bets are the midstreams and natural gas producers. The latter have shown much greater strength than the oil producers, because associated natural gas production is falling as oil producers shut in production. That means natural gas supplies will continue to tighten in the months ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">British Airways At The Forefront Of Change For A Post-COVID-19 Airline World</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Airways plans to emerge from COVID-19 with greater efficiency even if the rest of aviation does not. That is good news for its passengers and shareholders, but not employees.
The airline has announced up to 12,000 job losses. Most redundancies are due to British Airways planning to be smaller and needing fewer staff.
But it also wants to establish a more efficient underlying base, which will make existing flying cheaper and allow future growth to be less costly.
“Further structural change is proposed,” British Airways told its pilot union in a memo.
British Airways and its staff will have to find balance. Reducing job losses in exchange for greater productivity would mean being over-staffed in the short-term but achieving a more efficient base for the long-term.
Initial proposals are open to “reformulating them where viable to do so,” British Airways told the pilot union.
Management wants to “mitigate the impact and need for redundancies.” Any redundancies, management further warned, would be paid out at minimum statutory obligations.
British Airways may already be more efficient than Air France, but lags others, partially due to unnecessary complexity. COVID-19 becomes a change catalyst. Don’t let a good crisis go to waste.
Consolidating British Airways’ three Heathrow flight attendant pools into one could create flexibility, a plan reportedly being considered. Even if the lowest contract does not prevail, average cost should come down.
Pilots are targeted for greater productivity. British Airways wants “flexibility and efficiencies” across its pilot workforce, and improve “headcount per hull” – how many pilots are needed to fly one aircraft.
Two-thirds of British Airways pilots fly widebody aircraft. Employment numbers cited by British Airways imply there is a similar ratio of long-haul pilots at each aircraft group. There is not one fleet that is especially under-productive, so efficiency drives would seemingly affect all.
“Those remaining in employment are also likely to be impacted,” British Airways said.
British Airways pilots per aircraft based on company and industry data
The A380, 747 and 777 have about 22 pilots per aircraft. British Airways appears to have managed staffing well despite differences in scale. It has only 12 A380s but 57 777s.
The 787s have a slightly higher headcount with 23 pilots per aircraft, but this might be explained if the 787s on average fly longer sectors and require more relief pilots. Breakdowns between captains and co-pilots are mostly consistent with top-level figures.
Staffing on the A350 fleet is technically high with 27 pilots per aircraft, but British Airways received its first A350 last year and now only has five. It is common to start a new fleet over-staffed.
That leaves the short-haul pilots. They are one-third of British Airways’ pilots but fly just over half of all aircraft.
Whereas the widebodies have around 22-23 pilots per aircraft, each narrowbody has only 10 pilots. The inherent differences of short-haul versus long-haul make it difficult to compare pilot efficiency between the types.
While most airlines are, at best, planning for their immediate future, British Airways wants to restructure for the long-term.
It is rare for an airline to have so much negotiating leverage. Damage is evident and public sympathy is dampened, unlike last year’s pilot strike that came during a multi-billion pound profit period.
“The challenge is two-fold,” British Airways told its pilot union. But it might be more one-part challenge and one-part opportunity.
The challenge: British Airways will need fewer staff, including pilots, as it plans to emerge from COVID-19 a smaller airline with fewer aircraft. Its starting proposal is eliminating 955 pilot jobs, or 22% of its workforce.
Numerous references to this being initial suggests pilots have negotiating room depending how many concessions they grant for British Airways’ second objective: the opportunity.
Efficiency will bring a further 175 pilot job losses, British Airways said, making total proposed losses 1,130 or 26% of current pilots.
Staff costs last year were £2.5 billion, or 22% of operating expenses. There is a limit to how much extra cost British Airways is willing to carry. It warned that after COVID-19 it will have “higher debt levels and lower cash positions than usual.”
Early in the coronavirus outbreak there was a brief window for sector consolidation if weak airlines did not receive government support.
As damage increased, state aid became common. This shifts the outlook from which airlines survive to which airlines are advantaged by out-sized help. British Airways fears such a “distorted market.”
British Airways and other IAG carriers have not asked or received for state help, but most others have.
“Many of British Airways’ competitors in Europe and globally are receiving state aid in various forms,” it told the pilot union. “Some of those competitors will have the option to provide overcapacity and lower fares.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">May Is The Month Of Reckoning For Retail Landlords, Tenants</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s May and this is the month of reckoning for retailers and their landlords.
With malls and stores across the country closed since March, and half of those stores in default on their April rent, retailers and landlords have tough decisions to make.
This month, if they can’t find a way to share the pain, they risk mortally wounding each other.
As the COVID-19 pandemic shut down non-essential retail, and restaurants, movie theaters and entertainment venues, landlords have responded in different ways.
Some have taken a hard line, taking non-paying retailers to court.
Some have offered to defer rent payments until the stores reopen, or to let tenants spread out missed payments over the course of a year or more.
And some have proactively decided to forgive all or part of the rent and fees during the shutdown period.
‘Compassionate capitalism’
Ophir Sternberg, founder and CEO of Lionheart Capital, LLC, is giving retail tenants of his retail real estate subsidiary, Out of the Box Ventures, LLC, a break on rent in April and May. Out of the Box, which has 30 retail properties in 17 states, is forgiving 60 to 70% of tenant’s typical rent during April and May, and asking them to only pay the landlord’s fixed costs - the common area maintenance (CAM) charges and property taxes. Tenants will not have to repay the forgiven rent after stores reopen.
Sternberg said he made the rent-forgiveness decision as stores began shutting down and he saw “there was a battle brewing between a lot of retail landlords and their tenants.”
“I thought that was not the right approach, especially not in this type of crisis,” Sternberg said. “We should all be working together. If we’re going to come out of this stronger than we really have to work together,” he said.
By making the offer, which Sternberg said will apply to between 400 and 500 tenants, Out of the Box is foregoing its typical profits for the two months. He calls the strategy “compassionate capitalism,” and says survival depends on landlords realizing “we are in the same boat as our tenants. Their success is our success.”
If the closings extend beyond May, “we’ll revisit and have some further conversations with our tenants and see what we can do,” he said.
Bedrock LLC, the Detroit real estate company owned by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert, is suspending all rent and fees for the small business retail and restaurant tenants in its portfolio of downtown stores for April, May, and June.
“We wanted to give people the confidence that they could start working on the relaunch of their business” rather that have to worry about their immediate cash flow, Matt Cullen, Bedrock CEO told Crain’s Detroit Business.
A more common offer from landlords is rent deferrals. Unibail Rodamco Westfield, which owns powerhouse U.S. malls including Garden State Plaza in New Jersey, told tenants they could delay paying their April rent for 90 days, or through July 1.
Even the landlords, like Taubman Centers, that have notified tenants that they are expected to pay rent even while the malls are closed, are leaving the door open for negotiation, saying through a spokesperson that it is willing to talk to retailers about their challengesand help them come up with a plan.
‘I am my retailers’ partner’
The crisis has highlighted the symbiotic relationship of retail tenants and landords, said Yaromir Steiner, founder and CEO of Steiner + Associates, which has developed more than 9 million square feet of mixed use space, and owns Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio.
There are two kinds of retail real estate now, Steiner said: Need-based, or replenishment retail properties, with retailers such as Walmart or Kroger, and want-based, or discretionary retailers such as the typical mall and lifestyle tenants.
In the want-based real estate of malls, the tenant pays a higher rent and the landlord, in turn, spends to draw customers and drive up the retailer’s sales.
“In the want kind of environment, I make lots of investments to attract the customer, to keep the customer, to beautify the project,” he said. “Why am I doing this? Because I am my retailers’ partner. I need to make sure that people love coming here to spend their discretionary dollars. My retailers, in return, say ‘Ok, you are delivering me the higher volume of sales, I have no problem paying the higher rent’.”
“Because we have a symbiotic relationship, the death of either one of us will not be beneficial to the other one,” he said. “We succeed and fail together.”
That means, Steiner said, that retailers who have the ability to pay rent must pay, to keep the mall and retail ecosystems alive. Landlords, in turn, can forego their return on capital during the crisis in order to make some concessions to tenants, or to allow tenants to defer payments.
Most leases, Steiner said, put the landlord in a strong legal position to demand rent, and to take action against non-paying tenants. While some retailers have claimed that the pandemic is a force majeure that eliminates their obligation to pay rent, most of the leases Steiner has with his tenants “have crystal clear language that force majeure does not allow for non-payment of rent.”
But nobody wants to be tied up in lawsuits or incur legal fees at this time, Steiner said. “That’s another reason why we need to work together.”
‘Everybody’s a troubled retailer now’
Andy Graiser, co-president of A&G Real Estate Partners, a Melville, N.Y. real estate advisory firm, agrees that legal battles and evictions are the last thing landlords want now.
“The cost of replacing these tenants is not going to be cheap,” Graiser said. “There’s going to be a lot of down time. When landlords factor in broker’s fees, and new tenant construction costs, “you’re probably better served by working with the retailers you have to keep them going,” he said.
Retailers who were struggling before the shutdowns began may not be able to be saved, he said, but landlords who get too aggressive with viable tenants “may overplay their hand a little too much and it may just force the retailer into an early bankruptcy,” he said.
A&G is getting calls from numerous retailers looking for advice on how to manage their lease obligations at a time when stores are closed and no sales are taking place.
“We’ve been doing this type of work for 29 years for troubled retailers but right now almost everybody’s a troubled retailer,” Graiser said.
Retailers and landlords, he said, are engaged in a bit of a staring contest, with each side trying to preserve their rights, in order to protect their bargaining position in negotiations.
“For the month of April we’re seeing a lot of landlords just reserving their rights and sending out default letters. It’s almost like checking a box,” he said.
The most common concession landlords are offering at this point is to defer rent, and to allow retailers to pay it back in 12 equal payments starting next year, Graiser said.
But “we’re in early innings,” still, he said. The real negotiations may start after stores reopen and “the landlord realizes they might be only doing 20 to 30% of their sales. I think at that time there might be a more holistic discussion to fix everything to make sure the retailer can operate.”
‘If they don’t take care of their tenants, they don’t have a business’
The rent forgiveness offer from Out of the Box Ventures “definitely helped out a lot,” said Matt Jeffery, owner of five Vendors Village stores in Indiana and Kentucky, including one in the Haute City mall in Terra Haute, IN owned by Out of the Box.
Jeffery said some of his landlords have been more understanding than others, but “Out of the Box has been the most proactive of anybody.”
Jeffery, in turn, is not making the vendors who rent booths to sell collectibles, crafts, and other goods in his stores pay rent while the stores are closed.
“The people at Out of the Box realize the same thing that I realize, that if we don’t take care of our vendors, we don’t have a business,” Jeffery said. “If they don’t take care of their tenants, they don’t have a business.”
Graiser of A&G believes the retailer-landlord standoffs will come to a head this month. “Because the May rent will not be paid. So they have to start coming together because at that point they will be two months delinquent,” he said.
“People will be coming together in May, and if they don’t I think we’ll start seeing a bunch of bankruptcies starting in June.”
