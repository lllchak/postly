    <h5 class="mb-1">What's it's like spending lockdown in the Home of the Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Where better to spend lockdown than in Home of the Year?
Ethna Dorman couldn’t agree more. She has just returned from her daily walk along the nearby Royal Canal and as she surveys her converted 19th-century carriage house, the winner of the 2020 series on RTÉ One says: “I’m having a ball. I’m still celebrating — although on my own!”
The Clonsilla property stole the hearts of judges Deirdre Whelan, Hugh Wallace and Peter Crowley last month and its owner watched the grand finale along with her children, grandchildren and sisters, on Zoom, she reveals. “My home is a peaceful sanctuary and never more so than during these times, but I miss the hugs, I’m a hugging type, so I really miss that,” Ethna tells the Irish Examiner.
Ethna wanted the style of the dwelling to reflect her life’s journey. That voyage has whisked the former Wall Street high-flier across the Atlantic and back. Her career took her from Roscommon to Dublin and London before she moved to New York. “I was transferred to Wall Street where I worked as a commodity broker for many years,” she says.
She got engaged to William, a widower with three daughters, while living in the United States. They were married in 1984 and they went onto have two more children. The family relocated to Ireland in 1994, renting a residence outside Fethard, Co Tipperary. This property had a courtyard which William was keen to develop.
But when their son and daughter were picked on because of their American accents, Ethna decided it was time to up sticks. “I combed the country for a suitable school and found the John Scottus School in Dublin — so we moved to Dublin,” she says. “We lived in Castleknock’s Deerpark Drive for a few years and were looking for a place to do up.”
They discovered The Courtyard, Beech Park, in Clonsilla and moved in 1998. This 19th-century property was once part of the Beech Park House estate and encompasses five buildings, including a double cottage. The west side of the property backs into the famous Shackleton Gardens which have been restored and will be reopened to the public later this year by Fingal County Council.
And it has always been a “haven”, Ethna says. At one point, it was home to Ethna and William, their five children and Ethna’s dad, Michael Cox, who spent the last two years of his life with them.
The Dormans renovated the two-storey cottage on the site but did not get to develop the courtyard as they had hoped, due to busy family and work life.
Ethna has had many different careers in her lifetime, from accountancy to trading to investment banking. She trained in real estate by night when the children were very young.
Her most recent career is one she is passionate about. “I was a hospice chaplain. I went back and studied theology at Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy and did chaplaincy at Saint John of God Hospital, the Mater and St Vincent’s. I absolutely loved it,” she says.
William died of leukaemia in 2010 and Ethna’s training and experience meant she “was able to be chaplain to my own man”: “It was a privilege.”
Following William’s passing, Ethna was determined to realise their dream of restoring the courtyard and converting the carriage house, which also includes a hayloft, along with an adjoining stable building, into her own 120sq m, two-bedroom retirement sanctuary.
Ethna created a partly open-plan living room and kitchen, separated by the old stable wall screens and retained the original wainscoting on the walls. She lowered the floor upstairs in the hayloft to give enough room for the bedrooms and bathrooms.
Most of the furniture was made by William, including a desk and the dining room table. “My husband, when we met, when we were courting, took me on a tour of his house and showed me this desk and told me he made it himself,” she said. “If I had any doubts before that they vanished. He made all of the furniture in the kitchen. He was very handy.”
Memories are everywhere in her abode. As she speaks, Ethna picks out sculptures and other items made by family members, including statues of the Virgin Mary and Gráinne O’Malley or Gráinne Mhaol, crafted by her brother-in-law, sculptor H. Reed Armstrong, who died on April 11, and, outside, the gazebo, constructed by her son Liam, using stable dividers formerly in the area that is now the kitchen.
Ethna retained a stable theme in the kitchen, seeing as two horses once resided there, and the living room reflects that fact that it is in this space the carriages were kept.
During lockdown, Ethna is keeping busy. She continues to attend her classes in Sanskrit and Philosophy online with the School of Philosophy and is also involved in her local church community, St Motchta’s (“everything’s online at the moment!”). “And I have my daily walk, all along the banks of the Royal Canal,” she adds.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A week's worth of meals - Happy Gourmand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In ordinary times, I would write about the traditions of May Day around the world, celebrating the advance of spring and in France a holiday for workers. But these are not ordinary times. Additionally, since there is another meaning of the expression, I thought I’d take heed from that and do my part to help.
I’ve spoken in recent columns about feeling the challenge of being able to share, and about feeling useful in a time of great need. Staying home just didn’t seem to be enough. It finally dawned on me that doing my part is doing what I can. As a food geek, that means sharing food, or ideas on what to do with it. 
When my cousin sent me a desperate message via Facebook this week saying, “my creative spoon is struggling,” I decided I should answer the call to battle. This week I’m offering a whole week of meal planning, using the kind of meals that can be made up easily and quickly. 
I’m also including a pantry list, to help you keep a par stock of ingredients, so you have plenty of options.
Your pantry stock helps you make many basic recipes without shopping and keeps you prepared for last-minute changes or inspiration. Especially in a time of minimal trips to the store, having these goodies on hand is a great stress-reliever.
PANTRY BASICS
Once you have your pantry stocked, your grocery shopping is simpler, and you can make a few meals even when you have “nothing in the fridge.”
When planning for a week, we always look at preparing one dinner that provides us with leftovers that make another meal. If plans change, these leftovers can usually be frozen for later use. We also look at a few breakfast or brunch ideas that are more on the hearty side; starting the day with a bigger meal can mean lunch is more of a snack or maybe even not needed.
A WEEK’S WORTH OF MEALS
Breakfast or brunch ideas can include baked items (these can be made ahead on a day off and warmed up, remember). Cinnamon buns with some fruit salad make a great start to the day, as do biscuits with cheese and jam – or ham, if you prefer. Yogurt parfaits are a fun break from cereal. Breakfast burritos will likely take you all the way to dinner or could be dinner one night. Recipes can be easily Googled, or found using a recipe app like Yummly, if needed.
Here are seven more suggestions:
Meatloaf or Burgers with your choice of ground meat (or veggie protein) – season as you like, make a sauce that fits your theme, and serve with roasted veggies that cook at the same time. *Leftover veggies and cooked ground meat can be used in an omelette (for breakfast or dinner) or quesadillas.
Buddha Bowl – go vegetarian: use a grain base like quinoa, farro or rice; top with chopped veggies, toasted nuts or seeds, fruit if you like (dried or fresh) and/or cheese or legumes for protein. Top with a dressing that has plenty of flavour to make it all sing.
Grilled cheese sandwiches – kick them up a notch by using more than one kind of cheese and adding a bit of ham or bacon. Make them funky with a spread of chutney or spicy chili sauce. Serve with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, or soup if you like, to round out the meal.
Grilled fish – buy fresh if you can or look for FAS (“frozen at sea”) for best flavour. Serve with sautéed vegetables that cook as fast as the fish, or a simple salad. The fish can have a squeeze of citrus or a spice rub for flavour. Cook until medium (internal temperature 137 F) and it will be tender and moist.
Dinner Salad – think “kitchen sink” here: any and all greens are good (we love arugula and spinach for flavour), any veggies you have, canned tuna, cheese or cooked bacon or ham for protein if you wish. Make the salads on a dinner plate to get the right amount (everyone can build their own if you like). The sky’s the limit with dressing – Google your heart out for ideas.
Roast Chicken or Pork Tenderloin – here’s another main dish that offers leftovers. Serve with fried rice, baked potatoes or couscous and call this your fancy meal. Chutney or sauce that’s open in the fridge can accompany roasted meat at dinner or in a sandwich. Serve those warm if the meat is warm for added flavour.
Pasta – so many types and so many sauce ideas, it’s mind-boggling. Mix up your styles from week to week – a pasta casserole, then simple noodles with tomato sauce, then maybe alfredo with peas… Make Jamie Oliver’s fresh-made pasta – it takes a few minutes with only flour and water and will knock everyone’s socks off.
So, there you have it. Thank you for letting me share what I can. I hope it helps make your week a bit easier. One last tip for you – at our house, when it’s salad for dinner, that means it’s ice cream for dessert. We all deserve a treat now and again. (Just remember to add your favourite flavour to your grocery list.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Looking at the Wild West through different eyes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The day in 2015 when C Pam Zhang was laid off from her first job out of college, she celebrated with friends, then promptly made plans to move to Bangkok.
She had been working at a tech start-up in San Francisco for several years, she says, ‘‘kind of stress-testing this question of whether I could be happy doing something that was not writing’’. But the layoff felt liberating, so she decided to live off savings for a while and give writing a real shot.
‘‘I’ve been complaining all this time about not having the time to write. Will I actually write when I have the time, or am I just a big fake?’’
Over seven months in Thailand, she wrote more than a dozen short stories, in the process landing on the sort of work she wanted to do: speculative fiction that dealt with themes such as death, migration and loneliness.
She also drafted a novel. Set during the US gold rush with elements of magical realism, it focuses on two orphaned siblings who are fending for themselves in an American West where tigers roam. How Much of These Hills Is Gold is inspired by the emotional currents of Zhang’s upbringing, particularly the loneliness and insecurity of a childhood spent moving around. It also reckons with grief, something she experienced after losing her father when she was 22.
‘‘The death of a parent has this really strange gravity, no matter how many years you get away from it,’’ Zhang, now 30, says. ‘‘It warps everything else around it.’’
In How Much of These Hills Is Gold, the siblings, Lucy and Sam, go into survival mode after their father dies and they are left penniless in a hostile town. ‘‘One thing I wanted to reflect on in the book was how when you mourn in a way that is repressed, it will haunt you,’’ Zhang says. ‘‘You can’t get away from it.’’
Born in Beijing (the C in her name is short for Chenji), Zhang moved to the United States, where her parents were already living, when she was four. She had 10 different addresses by the time she was 18, as her parents sought out better job opportunities or school systems for her and her younger sister.
But one move stands out. When Zhang was eight, the family packed up their car and drove from Lexington, Kentucky, to Salinas, California: ‘‘I was so struck by the landscape of America,’’ she says, recalling areas where they were pounded by torrential rain or in the plains of Oklahoma, where she could see weather patterns from miles away. ‘‘It’s really beautiful but also, in many parts of the country, extremely bleak and kind of scary.’’
Those lasting impressions informed her reading habits. A fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder and John Steinbeck, she says ‘‘eventually I realised that the people in these books that I loved were always white. I wanted to write a great American epic in which I saw myself reflected’’.
The gold rush and its aftermath, and Chinese Americans’ role in it, is ripe for reexamination. Until recently, the roughly 15,000 Chinese American labourers who worked on the first Transcontinental Railroad, built in the 1860s, were all but erased from the historical record and were later barred from obtaining citizenship by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
A well-known photograph from the inauguration of the Transcontinental Railroad inspired a moment in Zhang’s book. Lucy, one of the main characters, ‘‘hears the cheer that goes through the city the day the last railroad tie is hammered. A golden spike holds track to earth’’, Zhang writes. ‘‘A picture is drawn for the history books, a picture that shows none of the people who look like her, who built it.’’
How Much of These Hills Is Gold is not meant to encapsulate the Chinese American experience of that time, but rather to portray ‘‘the loneliness of being an immigrant and not being allowed to stake a claim to the place that you live in’’, Zhang says. In light of the discrimination Asian Americans are facing as the coronavirus has disrupted life, however, she feels her book is more relevant than ever.
When she began writing it, ‘‘I actually worried that the book’s depictions of naked racism and violence would seem too extreme, too maudlin,’’ she says. ‘‘Now I’m reminded that these ugly attitudes toward Asian-presenting people have always lain just under the veneer of the country, and that they are erupting now.’’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mark Andrews on Saturday: Why it's a bit Rich for Branson to ask for help</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Read the latest musings from Mark Andrews.
Now maybe I'm being unrealistic in expecting social media to be in the vanguard of intelligent and discussion and good taste, but even so, where did the latest craze of people filming themselves downing a pint in tribute to the NHS come from?
Clapping, yes, I get that. A minute's silence in memory of the medics and care staff who gave their lives helping others, completely appropriate. But guzzling a pint in one go, without pausing for breath? That's just crass.
Apart from the fact it is a waste of good beer – or nasty lager in most cases – perhaps someone could enlighten as to how that is a tribute to the NHS? Particularly as the NHS spends is usually telling us to cut down drinking.
Bad news for Zachary Bowler, a prisoner who arrived at Leeds jail with a Kinder egg full of drugs up his backside. Zach, who had been given two-and-a-half years for beating his girlfriend with a cricket bat, has now had another 14 weeks added to his sentence for drug offences.
Boris Johnson is said to have grimaced in horror when he was shown the X-ray scans. At least until somebody explained it was the prisoner's, and not Carrie's.
Now that would be a Kinder Surprise.
Meanwhile, the shy and erudite Janet Street-Porter feels the congratulations about Boris's latest son are a bit over the top, given his louche lifestyle, affairs and failed marriages. For a few moments I thought she had a point, until I realised Janet has been divorced four times, with three of her marriages lasting just two years. Pots, kettles, glasshouses, Janet.
Probably everything has been said about the flamingo which found lockdown so frustrating it decided to make a break from Dudley Zoo, and was seen wandering outside the Hippodrome last week.
But, still, it's a good excuse to retell the old Tommy Mundon joke about a lion escaping from Dudley Zoo, and being spotted by a member of the public as it headed towards Tipton.
"What yo' gonna to do abaert it?" inquired the resident, in a frantic phone call to the police.
"Nothing," replied the desk sergeant. "I'm sure it can fend for itself."
Sir Richard Branson is asking the Government to bail out his ailing airline, which faces an uncertain future because of the coronavirus crisis.
It has been rightly pointed out that Sir Richard has not paid any UK income tax for 14 years, after moving to the British Virgin Islands, so it is a bit rich for the billionaire to ask the hard-pressed British taxpayer to bail him out now he's hit a spot of bother.
The trouble is, though, that if Virgin Atlantic does collapse, it won't be Sir Richard signing on down the labour exchange or worrying about how he is going to pay the mortgage. The ones who suffer will be his staff, the ordinary working people who have been diligently paying their taxes for years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When I began hearing news about the coronavirus outbreak in China in January 2020, I dismissed it as something that couldn’t reach me. It was my ignorance and perhaps naivety that convinced me to believe so. 
Fast forward three months, it has become the biggest story of all our lives. There is no conversation that takes place without mentioning the ‘C-word’. 
I was scared at first when I was included in the team assigned to carry out on-the-ground coverage of the pandemic. However, I have been a journalist just shy of one year, and this was not an opportunity I even considered letting go of. 
When I learnt that I was being sent to Punjab with my colleague Urjita Bhardwaj, there was a sense of relief. Although I have spent my entire life in Delhi, Punjab continues to feel like home, the people feel mine.
Both Urjita and I are fluent in Punjabi, and, after a brief conversation with a police officer about the roots of our ancestors, we were welcomed as if coming back home. That is just how warm the state and its people are. So much so, that we had to force the hotel owner to let us pay for our rooms. 
With the whole country under a lockdown, our main concern was managing essentials like food, water and a safe space to stay. Our trip was planned at the last minute.
However, true to all the cliches and stereotypes about Punjab, food was never a problem for us. In fact, on some days, an excess of it was. 
Our trip would not have been nearly as smooth as it was if not for the relentless help offered by Punjab Police. From arranging accommodation for us in Ludhiana, to ensuring we get food thrice a day (even though lunch was hardly ever had for the nine days on ground), they took care of everything. 
Cooperation was not limited to police — wherever we went for whatever story, people were ever so welcoming. I have lost count of the number of times we were offered chai and biscuits.
One of the most worrying trends to come out of Punjab last month was the Covid-19 death rate, which hovered higher than the national average.
To delve deeper, we decided to visit the Government Medical College and Hospital in Amritsar, one of the nerve centres of the state’s battle against coronavirus. It was a two-hour drive from Ludhiana, so we left early in the morning, hoping to get plenty of time on the ground. 
However, when we reached the hospital, numerous day-long meetings were underway behind closed doors, and the medical superintendent and the principal — the only two people authorised to speak to the media — were busy. 
So, we had to wait. It was unbearably hot and the mask on my face was giving me trouble breathing. As we waited there for over five hours, the mask caused my face to swell up. 
We tried to use our time by doing a recce for other stories around Amritsar, but had to return empty-handed. It was a hard day, not just because we left early in the morning but also because it didn’t turn out to be as fruitful as we had hoped. 
But then, there were the fruitful days too. While covering a story about textile factories in Ludhiana and how they’re helping the fight against the pandemic, we built a lot of contacts through Google searches. 
It also led to an epiphany as we saw the labourers hard at work churning out personal protective equipment (PPE), risking their lives in the line of duty. The health workers are definitely leading India’s fight against coronavirus from the front, but there is an entire army strengthening the effort from the sidelines.
While travelling through the state, we saw multiple people getting tested for Covid-19. The nasal and throat prodding looked terribly uncomfortable, and we realised it could soon happen to us.
But even then, the fear hadn’t set in. 
Wearing masks and gloves all day long, sanitising our hands and equipment every chance we got, washing our clothes the second we got back, wiping our bags and phones, we took all the necessary precautions we could think of. 
The fear eluded us when we visited hotspots and hospitals that were nodal centres for Covid-19 patients, but hit home on Day 4, when we arrived in Malerkotla, which emerged as a beacon of peace even as discussions about the Tablighi Jamaat acquired communal overtones in other parts of the country. 
There is a reason why the media is considered an essential service. It is our job to bring stories to people from the ground, pandemic or not. Like I said, we took all the necessary precautions because we had to do our job, but I only had control on what I could do. 
As we entered a narrow lane in Malerkotla, a group of residents made its way towards us, seemingly enamoured by the camera.
While we tried our best to ask people to maintain distance, our calls proved futile. I couldn’t spend nearly as much time there as I had wished. 
While that fear subsided soon as we headed back to Ludhiana, another crept up a few days later. After a really long day of following a police officer to see how the lockdown is being enforced, Urjita began feeling a little unwell. It became a point of concern because her complaints fell perfectly in line with Covid-19 symptoms. 
Our trip was cut short as we headed back to Delhi the following morning and got tested as soon as possible. Thankfully, we tested negative, but have chosen to remain in self-isolation.
While we had a story-rich and adventurous trip, I can’t help but think how lucky we got. My colleagues Praveen Jain and Simrin Sirur took exactly the same precautions as us but have unfortunately tested positive. 
It may be the biggest story of our lives, but one cannot forget that we are fighting an invisible enemy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Irrfan Khan’s old interview about Islam goes viral</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Among the several pictures and videos of the late Irrfan Khan that surfaced after his demise, another featuring his heated discussion with a religious cleric went viral on social media.
In the video Khan starts off by saying, “When I was told to pray five times a day I said I don’t know the meaning of it, but my mom insisted I pray regardless. My father, however, told me to understand the meaning of it.”
He then went on to relay how the people who believe that suicide bombing will get them into heaven are the ones who don’t question to understand – and are thus, taken advantage off by certain individuals who lead them astray.
He is then seen arguing with another cleric about how people are misconstruing the teachings of Islam because of such people and so the misunderstandings surrounding the religion need to be clarified.
“If a bunch of people are conspiring to ruin the image of Islam then we should defend it. Our religion does not teach hatred.” To this the personality argues that the people they clarify to, should also be willing to listen. “Their ears should be open, if someone is deliberately sleeping, then you can’t wake them up.”
Resorting to his earlier claim, Khan responded that in order for a person to do that, he needs to be awoken first, “Of course, how can anyone wake anyone else up if they themselves are asleep?”
He then went on to relay how there can be several interpretations of the Quran and certain people use their narrow minded interpretations to mislead others. Further quipping that for him his religion is the harmonious one, the one that is for the entire humanity and not just a certain group of people.
Khan also said that he has removed the word ‘proud’ from his dictionary and does not even tell his son he his proud of him anymore cause he feels that may actually instigate pride in him.
“Our religion also does not teach us pride and think we are the only ones who know better.” Khan went on to add that if does anything that is deemed sinful he will take the onus of it on himself and not try to justify it with his religion.
Further concluding with one of the quotes from his film Life of Pi, “Adult Pi Patel: Faith is a house with many rooms. Writer: But no room for doubt? Adult Pi Patel: Oh plenty, on every floor. Doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marni Jameson, All for Art’s Sake – Couple Donates Everything They Own to Museum</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not having kids is a good way to save a bunch of money. Not that I would know. Besides, I wouldn’t trade my kids for a bigger bank account — on most days.
Being childless can also be really good for the arts. Ask Virginia and Ed Fultz, of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fifteen years ago, the married art lovers decided to leave their entire estate to their local museum. That is everything — their house, car, investment portfolio, and their considerable art collection — altogether worth a few million, give or take.
“If we’d had children, they would have been our priority,” Virginia told me last week, when I called her and Ed to talk about their gift. “But that didn’t happen, so we went in a different direction.”
They put their money where their hearts are.
Ed and Virginia met as teenagers while attending West Texas State College. They married during their junior year, 55 years ago. After college, they taught high school in El Paso for 10 years, and made the most of their summers off by traveling.
“We didn’t grow up in homes with art,” Virginia said. “What we knew of art, we’d learned from books.”
However, during the summer of 1968, that changed. Over three months they visited every country in Western Europe. “We did the Europe-on-$5-a-day plan because it fit our teacher budget,” she said. They hit every major museum.
"That first trip to Europe was so eye opening,” Ed said.
“It was like this grand feast,” Virginia added.
Indeed, on their first visit to the Louvre, in Paris, she recalled, “We could barely afford lunch there. Then the waiter brought this lovely hors d’oeuvres tray and two glasses of wine that we couldn’t afford. We saw this nicely dressed gentleman sitting nearby and knew it was from him.”
Art patrons are a generous bunch. Virginia and Ed are paying those moments forward.
Ed left teaching and took a management job with a trucking company, and in 1981 was transferred to Albuquerque, a city he and his wife loved for its art and culture. Because no teaching positions were available, Virginia began selling real estate.
They continued to travel and buy art. Today their large (and growing) collection includes pieces from other countries, and many from their native Southwest.
“We don’t buy what someone else likes,” Ed said. “We buy what we love. It doesn’t have to have value, nor do we need to think it will become valuable,” although some of their pieces are by artists who have become known.
As for whether any of it will wind up in the museum, the Fultzes have no expectations. Though the Albuquerque Museum has first dibs, “if they say they don’t want anything, we will not be offended,” Virginia said. “We’ve gotten our enjoyment.”
Meanwhile, they continue to appreciate their local museum’s collection.
“We often go and spend a couple hours there, have lunch and a glass of wine at the café and talk about art,” Virginia said. “Every time I go, it thrills me to know they will benefit from us someday. They’ve given us so much more than we’ll ever give them.”
To prepare their art collection for the ultimate handoff, when items will either go to a museum or be sold for cash, the Fultzes have an art file. Each piece has a folder with information about the artist and the artwork, and the story behind how they got it.
“The problem is we have to quit collecting,” Virginia said.
“That’s not going to happen,” Ed said.
“We are so behind on our files," she said.
“If you saw our walls, you would laugh," he said.
“Truly, we are not allowed to go to an art show for a year,” she said.
“We’re going to one next week,” he said.
Deciding to leave your estate to a cause you love is step one. The next challenge, the Fultzes found, becomes how. Here’s what they learned:
• Name the right entity.
In 2005, the Fultzes named the Albuquerque Museum as their beneficiary, but last year, they met Emily Blaugrund Fox, executive director for the museum foundation, and learned they should name the Albuquerque Museum Foundation as beneficiary. The city owns the museum and so controls donations to it.
“We didn’t want some city mayor to use the money for another project,” said Ed, who updated his will accordingly. The foundation is set up solely to support the museum.
• Don’t do it alone.
Work with an attorney to make sure your will conveys what you intend, and is valid under your state’s law. An attorney can also make sure your will spells out exactly what you want to leave and to whom, lists all assets, and names the executor.
• Be specific.
Make clear how you want your gift to be used. The Fultzes earmarked their donation for art acquisitions.
“Others may designate funds to support exhibitions, capital improvement or education,” Fox said, “but don’t restrict the gift too much.”
• Find a trustworthy representative.
Naming your executor, or personal representative as they’re called in some states, is a pivotal choice.
“We did not want a relative to do this,” Ed said. “We did not want to inconvenience our nieces and nephews or cause any infighting.”
Initially, they’d asked a younger friend to handle their estate. After that relationship changed, they asked Fox if she would do the honors, so all the money could go to the museum. That posed a conflict, so Fox declined.
“We need the separation in case the family has questions later. We can’t open the museum to liability,” she said. Finally, the Fultzes hired a trust company. For a percentage of the estate, the company will handle the sale of the art and other assets, and disburse the proceeds.
• Tell the recipient. Do let whomever you’re leaving an asset to know you’ve named them in your will, Fox said. Be sure they want it.
“We may not want grandma’s hanky collection, cherished as it is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mark Andrews on Saturday: Why it's a bit Rich for Branson to ask for help</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now maybe I'm being unrealistic in expecting social media to be in the vanguard of intelligent and discussion and good taste, but even so, where did the latest craze of people filming themselves downing a pint in tribute to the NHS come from?
Clapping, yes, I get that. A minute's silence in memory of the medics and care staff who gave their lives helping others, completely appropriate. But guzzling a pint in one go, without pausing for breath? That's just crass.
Apart from the fact it is a waste of good beer – or nasty lager in most cases – perhaps someone could enlighten as to how that is a tribute to the NHS? Particularly as the NHS spends is usually telling us to cut down drinking.
Bad news for Zachary Bowler, a prisoner who arrived at Leeds jail with a Kinder egg full of drugs up his backside. Zach, who had been given two-and-a-half years for beating his girlfriend with a cricket bat, has now had another 14 weeks added to his sentence for drug offences.
Boris Johnson is said to have grimaced in horror when he was shown the X-ray scans. At least until somebody explained it was the prisoner's, and not Carrie's.
Now that would be a Kinder Surprise.
Meanwhile, the shy and erudite Janet Street-Porter feels the congratulations about Boris's latest son are a bit over the top, given his louche lifestyle, affairs and failed marriages. For a few moments I thought she had a point, until I realised Janet has been divorced four times, with three of her marriages lasting just two years. Pots, kettles, glasshouses, Janet.
Probably everything has been said about the flamingo which found lockdown so frustrating it decided to make a break from Dudley Zoo, and was seen wandering outside the Hippodrome last week.
But, still, it's a good excuse to retell the old Tommy Mundon joke about a lion escaping from Dudley Zoo, and being spotted by a member of the public as it headed towards Tipton.
"What yo' gonna to do abaert it?" inquired the resident, in a frantic phone call to the police.
"Nothing," replied the desk sergeant. "I'm sure it can fend for itself."
Sir Richard Branson is asking the Government to bail out his ailing airline, which faces an uncertain future because of the coronavirus crisis.
It has been rightly pointed out that Sir Richard has not paid any UK income tax for 14 years, after moving to the British Virgin Islands, so it is a bit rich for the billionaire to ask the hard-pressed British taxpayer to bail him out now he's hit a spot of bother.
The trouble is, though, that if Virgin Atlantic does collapse, it won't be Sir Richard signing on down the labour exchange or worrying about how he is going to pay the mortgage. The ones who suffer will be his staff, the ordinary working people who have been diligently paying their taxes for years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Learning from the best - The Nation Nigeria News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
What a week. Hectic? Yes it was despite the lockdown occasioned by the Corona virus pandemic. Fortunately, my job as a journalist permits my movement to work and back home. Mention must be made of the security operatives who have been very polite.
They have done the job of policing in the routes that I use. Thank God something good can come from our security operatives.
I don’t intend to discuss the damage the Corona virus has done in the world. I would rather join the multitude praying for a quick discovery of vaccines to cure the disease.
Last Saturday, I purposely put my phones on silence to avoid calls because of the piece I did  on this page. I knew I had roughened feathers.
I also knew that the critics’ knives would be drawn. But that wasn’t the reason for writing the column. It was to remind our league organisers, not to insult our sensibilities with such fantasies as watching the domestic league on telephone, despite all the debates surrounding the return of the English game, which bother on the losses clubs would incur from television rights on English Premier League (EPL) games, if the season ends abruptly.
With 92 games left for the season to end, EPL chieftains are toying with a lot of possibilities such that the competition would end without any overlap into the new season. The message underscores the importance of terrestrial rights.
According to a Daily Mail report Monday: ‘’On May 7, the government is set to hold its next review of the current lockdown restrictions. If games are to go ahead, then the Premier League will have to ensure that measures are in place to prevent fans from gathering outside stadiums.
The Premier League are hopeful that they will be given approval from the government to play the games, which they feel would help to boost the mood of the nation.’’
What an interesting perspective to the Corona virus – matches to be played to help boost the mood of the nation. Brilliant. It means the game belongs to the people. Without the people, the games won’t attract the followership which clubs enjoy.
This movement of people towards the clubs fill their stadia and in turn become huge revenues bases  for them to buy players of their choices.
Sports is business, meant to be administered by those who can think, not cronies of governors. That is the way things are here. Hence the quagmire in our sports administration.
‘’In addition, players will have to be tested for Corona virus and venues for the games will have to be decided, with England’s training base of St George’s Park one possible option.’’
EPL chieftains understand the importance of the government in arriving at a final decision. Yet, they have proposed ideas which would meet all the fears expressed by all the sides in the dialogue.
It is true that the French have cancelled their league seasons. But the English game is driven by weighty sponsorship packages signed over the years, with the sponsors to make demands on infringements on their contracts with the EPL.
The correlation between the EPL chiefs and government rests with the volume of taxes which increase the country’s revenue, beginning with taxes of players’ coaches, and ancillary staff’s wages, television rights, merchandising, and other marketing platforms of the EPL which make it one of the most lucrative businesses in modern history.
Government has the discretion to rule like the French minister did on Monday. But, the backlash would be unimaginable, beginning with the next transfer window.
Conversely, it took the Nigerian government’s intervention for our domestic league organisers to tell us their plans, many of which are laughable.
They need to study the daily reports from our leagues troubled by the Corona virus pandemic to know how to re-direct their plans to be in sync with others.
The EPL eggheads have visualised how the Barclays English Premier League would be played as reported by the Daily Mail during the week.
‘’ A minimum of 300 people will be needed for a Premier League fixture to take place behind closed doors. As England’s top flight looks for safe ways to resume in the coming weeks amid the Covid-19 pandemic, an official estimate has calculated how many will need to be inside each ground on match-day.
‘’This includes 40 players, 32 coaching and medical staff from the two teams, 12 match officials, between six and eight doctors and medical personnel, three Premier League officials and 130 or more media personnel.
‘’Of that figure, 210 have been exactly accounted for, according to The Daily Telegraph, though the precise numbers of club directors, media, security, stewards, ground staff and scoreboard operators have yet to be worked out.
‘’The additional 90-100 in attendance is based on estimates made in Germany, where the Bundesliga could resume on May 9 if given the green light by health authorities.’’
Two striking things have come out of the pronouncements in the other leagues, which show that the media are adequately briefed unlike ours where until is revealed, except such statements put the organisers on the spot.
Besides, references are made to what others have said by way of comparison. Why not? You copy ideas which you cherish instead of celebrating mediocrity like we do here. Sadly so.
The organisers should tell us how much the game is worth; also how much the domestic league is worth. They should tell us how much they realise from inter and intra club transfers? They should disclose what comes into their coffers as percentages on stadia gate-takings.
 
Will it be asking for too much to disclose what they have generated as revenue from the different marketing initiatives that have brought into their coffers?
The time to transform the leagues is now. They need to shop for sponsors for the league by showcasing the marketing windows the corporate world can key into while stating the merits of keying into them.
No firm would invest in a business without bountiful returns that would raise the adrenalin of stakeholders at end of the year.
It is always saddening watching the domestic league matches with the inner circumference panels empty unlike in the European leagues where such platforms are used for different things with sponsors enjoying quality time as their products and services are advertised.
Viewers and those inside the stadia get to read about the club’s gate-takings for the day and the number of those who watch the games from the scroll messages on the inner perimeter platforms.
Other vital information about the clubs including their next matches can be tracked while also watching the games since the messages are repeated in the course of 90 minutes.
Rather than delude themselves with the fact that they held virtual calls with members, the organisers should tell us why the league venues’ pitches are still synthetic? Don’t they know the damage they expose the players to weekly, playing on plastic pitches with the wrong pair of boots? I hope people won’t be shocked in future when many of them become orthopaedic patients due to injuries on their knees and ankles.
It is because of this clubs in Europe go the extra miles to nurture their playing pitches and also  re-grass those  balding as a result of constant use.
This is to achieve players ‘optimal performance. Non-match-day visitors to  Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, for example, would always see  gadgets on the main playing pitch used to nurture the grasses and keep them lush.
Globally, pitches are made of lush green grasses not what we have here. Is anyone surprised that our players struggle to compete with other African nations in the continental competitions? Our league administrators should be ashamed when North African force our encounters with them here to be played on grass pitches, since they know the laws of the game and insists on its application?
Does it not occur to our administrators the importance of functional electronic scoreboards in all match venues? What would it cost us to persuade teams to install VAR at league venues? Is it forbidden to start this VAR culture in Nigeria, even if it means installing them in select venues as starters?

    <h5 class="mb-1">RuPaul's Drag Race season 12 queens ranked after Superfan Makeover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Happy Makeover week, RuPaul’s Drag Race fans!
It’s another one of the firm favourites of every season, and this year they brought in the superfans for a surprise glossy transformation – and it was every bit as wholesome as we would’ve hoped.
Given six excited an eager cisgender women to slap a mug on, there were a lot of happy and sad tears as the series heads towards its final stages.
The fans brought a new lease of lives to the queens and gave them a much needed reminder of just how fun this show can be – which is nice, considering some of the frontrunners have fallen under the pressure of the competition.
Now they’ve taken some drag babies under their win and gave them the opportunity of a lifetime – complete with a lipsync extravaganza.
Throw in Star Wars starlet Daisy Ridley, clearly as much as a superfan as the rest of them as she sat on the judges panel (seriously, this series’ celeb guests have been almost complete perfection), this latest instalment was just pure joy.
Due to events after the episode was filmed, Sherry Pie will not be in our rankings.
She might not have won this week, but Crystal bringing a glam Bert and Ernie to the runway? We have no choice but to stan.
Crystal and her partner Opal Methyd was the driving force of pure fun this week, and they seemed to be loving every second of getting to know each other.
Over accessorised clown realness by way of the late 80s is this year’s look and we’re buying it.
Every moment of the queen and the kindergarten teacher bringing everything they had on and off the runway made us beam.
She was our winner this episode, and we love it.
Jaida absolutely killed the couple ups this week, and she earned her spot at the top of the leaderboard, landing her third win.
Her new drag daughter Jazz Essence Hall was definitely struggling a little bit on the runway in those heels, but mama knows best and she definitely showed that with her pep talks.
Stunning as always with curves and swerves to die for, Jaida is now one of the frontrunners for the crown with good reason.
This week was almost made for Gigi, whose costume design background and high fashion eye is well established in this competition.
But yet again, she seemed safe as the others started taking bolder risks in order to stand out and rise up.
Bebe Badde definitely looked stunning and the pair earned their place as safe, but we’re going to need you to step up your game, girl, you’re in the semi-finals!
Heidi N Closet is a great name and it is a CRIME that they keep trying to make her change it – but saying that Heidi Afrodite has a little bit of a ring to it.
Nicole/Honey Almighty definitely had a bit of trouble with her self-esteem, but if anyone can rise her spirits in this competition, then it’s Heidi.
But we already done knew that make-up and design wasn’t necessarily Heidi’s strong suit, and she missed some valuable opportunities to make them look more like family members.
Like Ru and Michelle pointed out, it was the little things, like painting on a gap, or using the same material for both their outfits, that would’ve made all the difference.
Landing in the bottom two for the third time, Heidi is now treading on thin ice to keep herself in the competition, and we all know ‘if they have to lip sync for their life every week they will’ never gets anyone to the final.
Let’s just hope she manages to keep herself in the game enough to make it to the final.
Jackie Cox and Tiffany (like the jewellery) were definitely not bad this week – which makes this lowest position so frustrating because, as the judges consistently say, it’s ‘splitting hairs at this point.’
They just weren’t as strong as their competitors for some reason, with Ru and Michelle rightly saying there was something in their chemistry that just didn’t gel as much as the others
They both looked bleedin’ fabulous though, and new drag daughter Lil Snacky Cox fully brought it on the runway as a lifelong Drag Race fan.
We’re glad that Jackie managed to bring it for another day because our heart broke at the idea of our two faves going head-to-head, but we’re need to keep our fingers crossed that she’ll up her game next episode.
RuPaul’s Drag Race continues Fridays on VH1 in the US and Saturdays on Netflix in the UK.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Q&A with broadcaster Mairéad Ronan: 'I dream of having Marty Whelan's Eurovision gig'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Finglas-born Mairéad Ronan is a broadcaster with Today FM and presenter of Ireland's Fittest Family on RTÉ. She studied media at Ballyfermot College and started her broadcasting career on The Ray D'Arcy Show and produced The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show on TodayFM. She won the 2019 RTÉ series of Dancing with the Stars. Mairéad has three children, Dara, from her first marriage and two daughters, Eliza and Bonnie, with her husband, Louis Ronan, whom she married in 2015.
What's your earliest memory?
Christmas 1984, when I was four. I'd asked Santa for a baby doll and he left me a moses basket at home but he left the baby doll at my Nana Murphy's house. Apparently he was shocked when he saw it still in his sleigh!
What was the first book you loved?
Under the Hawthorn Tree by Marita Conlon-McKenna. It was a wonderful but harrowing history lesson on the Irish famine.
What's your best holiday memory?
My first girls holiday to Cyprus aged 20. I paid for it myself by working in Arnotts and I remember the feeling of freedom and thinking I was so grown up. But really I hadn't a clue about anything other than having a good time.
What is your biggest fear?
Dying before my three children become adults.
What are you most proud of?
I should say something really profound here but really it's winning Dancing with the Stars last year. No one thought I had a chance (especially the bookies who had me at 33 to 1). I'd had a baby three months before we started training. But I worked really hard and the public supported me right to the very end.
What's your least attractive quality - and what is your most?
You'd need to ask my family to answer this one.
What's the first thing you'd do if you were Taoiseach?
Ask Leo for a pint.
What's your biggest insecurity?
Physically, it's my skin. I had acne as a teen and have spent a fortune over 20 years trying to fix it. Emotionally, my biggest insecurity is work because when you have a job in radio or television, there is generally no "security". I've been in radio 18 years and 14 years in television so I should try relax a little.
Who would you most like to go for a pint with?
Right now, in lockdown, I want to go for a pint with everyone. But usually my dream would be the tennis player Roger Federer. He's the coolest sports person in the world.
What fictional character do you most identify with?
Amy Schumer's character in I Feel Pretty. When I watched that film, I felt like I could have been her before she gets knocked on the head.
What is your most treasured possession?
My husband, he's all mine.
What's your guilty pleasure?
Eurovision, the greatest competition on the planet. I dream of having Marty Whelan's job.
What's the best piece of advice you've been given?
Don't give up what you want most for what you want now. I had to say this to myself every day I was saving for a house.
What item in your wardrobe do you wear the most?
The honest but unsexy answer is my nude bra.
Who are your heroes?
My teachers are my heroes. I loved my time at school, even though I wasn't a straight-A or B student. From Martha Savage in primary school to Miss Russell Kennedy and Mairéad Garvey, my music and English teachers in St Michael's Holy Faith secondary school in Finglas. They always had words of encouragement and were of the opinion that there is far more to learning than grades.
When did you last cry?
Last week, during lockdown. My dad is 81 and lives alone. We're lucky he's extremely healthy.
How are you coping with lockdown?
Chocolate and Rioja.
What are you going to do right after this interview?
Make myself a Dingle gin and tonic.
What keeps you awake at night?
I've been told I have a gift for sleeping. Usually, the only thing that wakes me is the baby or the night before I have a new gig.
What's your greatest passion in life?
Radio. I always wanted to work in radio. I'm still a huge radio fan and had many people tell me, because I didn't know anyone who worked in radio, that I had zero chance of getting a job in any station (including an ex-boyfriend!).
If you had to choose three adjectives to describe yourself, what would they be?
Honest. Ambitious. Mother.
What's your favourite film?
I've two films. Gone with the Wind - I got my daughter Bonnie's name from it. When Harry Met Sally - I adore this film and the soundtrack and the whole idea that men and women can never be friends.
What's the last TV show you binge-watched?
The Tiger King. Each character is more bizarre and awful as the last.
What one piece of advice would you give your 18-year-old self?
Believe in yourself a little more and stop thinking you are fat, you idiot!
If you could have a super power, what would it be?
To be invisible.
What does your dream weekend look like?
Eggs for breakfast, walk Murphy the dog, get the paper, a trip to St Anne's Park with the kids, then get a babysitter and head out with Louis to our local, The Baths, and have some yummy cocktails and enjoy the stroll home.
What job would you be terrible at?
A baker. I have tried so many times to bake something very basic and it always ends up in the bin.
Do you believe in a God?
Yes, I like having chats with him every so often.

    <h5 class="mb-1">For One Joyous Episode, 'Drag Race' Forgot It Was A Competition Show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the few downsides of watching RuPaul's Drag Raceis that amid the strain of competition, the joyful, celebratory nature of drag is sometimes lost. But in the May 1 episode, the show got back to what it's all about.
A spin on the seasonal makeover challenge, Ru surprised six superfans by fulfilling their Drag Race fantasy and giving them their very own drag mothers, aka the Season 12 queens. To hear their nervous laughter when Ru entered the room was moving enough — but the women came out of the experience with so much more. As he Top 6 queens — Jaida Essence Hall, Sherry Pie, Gigi Goode, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Crystal Methyd — made them over, Jaida and Bethany ended up in tears, Crystal and Grace shook out their nerves together, and Heidi helped Nicole confidently stand out after blending in for most of her life.
When they all finally walked the runway, there was one more surprise: the superfans got to lip-sync for their lives on the main stage. "Shantay you all stayto slay another day," Ru announced after they finished.
Little did they know, that announcement foreshadowed the real lip-sync battle between the bottom two, Jackie Cox and Heidi N Closet. Rather than working against each other, the two performed "Kill The Lights" by Alex Newell as one unified force — right down to an air kiss from across the stage at the song's end.
It seemed more like a choreographed dance number than an elimination, and Ru took note by using his seasonal double save. That means they both get another week to compete, and more importantly, extra time with their newfound drag daughters, who never stopped cheering from backstage.
More warm and fuzzy episodes like this, please!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Never Have I Ever Season Finale Recap: It’s a Beautiful Day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After its emotionally explosive penultimate episode, the Never Have I Ever finale has a lot of work to do. All of the relationships central to the show have been severely damaged over the course of the season. Devi moves out of her house and in with unexpected ally Ben, leaving Nalini and Kamala alone. Fab and Eleanor are still on a “friendship break” from Devi, still hurt by the ways she didn’t show up for them when they needed her most. Despite their kiss, Paxton is pulling away from Devi. The finale starts with everything in disarray and then gradually pieces things together, repairing some relationships and making way for new ones. It’s an episode that’s low on jokes, but it still finds humor in unexpected places. And the finale impressively tackles complicated things like grief, forgiveness, and familial trauma with all the depth and poignancy of a serious drama. Never Have I Ever is at its best when it digs into grief.
On the surface, Devi’s life at Ben’s looks pretty nice. He has a big house and pool, and she has a room to herself. Kamala brings her some stuff at school and tries to get her to come home, but Devi remains firm. She won’t return home unless Nalini promises not to move them to India. She even asks Ben’s dad for help with emancipating herself, which is of course a ridiculous request since she doesn’t have a job or even know how credit cards work. Ben realizes how serious the whole situation is when Devi’s little run-away-from-home stint starts to look more permanent. 
She goes so far as to call up Rebecca and try to get a job at Old Navy, which prompts a sweet scene between Rebecca and Paxton. His sister fully calls him out for being a douche when he suggests that he can’t be with Devi because she isn’t cool enough, but buried beneath that, there’s also his insecurity about what her mother said about his intelligence last episode. The rom-com through line in the finale—which ultimately sees Devi choosing Ben over Paxton—is honestly the least interesting bit, but it sets things up for a pretty straightforward love triangle, and Mindy Kaling certainly knows how to craft one of those.
Nalini has an emotional breakthrough when she visits Dr. Ryan, her initial resistance to therapy eventually relenting. Dr. Ryan gently suggests that moving a kid across the globe isn’t exactly good for grieving, and Nalini shares that Devi said she wished she was dead. But she softens, lets down her guard a bit, and admits that she knows she’s tough on Devi but that it comes from a place of fear. She was the tough parent, but now that Mohan is gone, that means all Devi gets is the tough parent, which isn’t fair to anyone involved and just creates more tension. Dr. Ryan encourages her to let Devi see her break a little. Devi needs to see her mother’s weakness in order to embrace her own. Maybe she wouldn’t be so in denial and quick to deflect if she had permission to break down, and Nalini letting down her strong facade would do just that. Nalini reaching for a ceramic vase on Dr. Ryan’s table and fiddling with it as she reveals that Mohan’s birthday is the next day is a lovely touch. This show is consistently good at making the emotions of its characters fully seen and felt through little details. 
Nalini having to awkwardly explain that Mohan passed away to her realtor when she calls her up to tell her she’s thinking about putting the house on the market also evokes a specific side of losing a loved one: Nalini and Devi constantly have to relive their trauma by having to explain the loss to others. Memories of Mohan crop up all the time for Devi and Nalini, and they’re not necessarily wholly sad or wholly happy; they’re both at once. Nalini remembers buying the house with Mohan and how thrilled he was. Sendhil Ramamurthy is truly so freaking charming in this role. The specificity of Mohan hearing the song “Beautiful Day” by U2 and taking it as a good sign is excellent writing and has a huge payoff at the end of the episode. Devi, meanwhile, is just casually scrolling through Instagram when her phone gives her a memory notification for her dad’s birthday with photos and videos from the year before. Phones really do love to remind us of traumatic things, don’t they?! 
Nalini makes an initial attempt to reach out to Devi, showing up at Ben’s house and saying she doesn’t want to fight anymore. She’s still initially stern with Devi, and Devi shuts down a bit because of that. Nalini says she wants to spread Mohan’s ashes on his birthday, but it prompts a bad flashback for Devi to the day he died. She tells her that she and Kamala will leave for Malibu at five if Devi wants to join. 
Devi does not want to join. Devi is stubborn. She’s quick to anger and slow to apologize. This show unearths the messiness of grief through Devi, a wonderfully flawed character. She sees her mom’s attempt at getting her to spread the ashes as emotional manipulation. But there’s more to her hesitation. She isn’t ready to say goodbye. 
Ben has to tap in some backup, reaching out to Eleanor and Fab. Even though Devi wasn’t there for them, they end up showing up for her, because they’re good friends and they know how much Devi will regret it if she doesn’t go to Malibu. Master deflector Devi uses it as an opportunity to address Eleanor’s recent personality change and get her to reconsider her acting dreams. She even apologizes to them. It’s meaningful and genuine, but it’s also yet another attempt by Devi to avoid her own problems. Still, with things mended with Fab and Eleanor, they urge her to go. “I’m not ready,” Devi says through tears, but Eleanor and Fab convince her of her own strength. 
Then the finale uses a pretty common rom-com trope, albeit in an unexpected context: a race against the clock to meet up with someone to confess that you love them. In this case, it’s Devi rushing to her mother. Ben volunteers to get Devi to the house, but he drives terribly and slowly in his father’s Porsche, so they miss Kamala and Nalini. Then he offers to drive her all the way to Malibu. She gets there with no time to spare, and she tries to call out to them on the beach, but they can’t hear her shouting. 
So John McEnroe shows up. It’s a satisfying gimmick that leans into some of the weirder parts of the show’s voice, and it’s surprising how organic it ends up feeling to have him here. Devi’s “Oh fuck” moment is also perfectly executed. She explains to him the situation, and he uses his signature McEnroe yell to get Kamala and Nalini’s attention. It’s funny and weird, and then the scene crashes into a true emotional whirlwind. 
Devi apologizes to her mother, and her mother apologizes to her. They both know they said hurtful things, and they both love each other despite any of it. Nalini finally does have her breakdown, and admits that she herself sometimes wishes she had died. It is all so brilliantly written and acted, making for a perfect emotional climax for the series. “Beautiful Day” plays, and it’s the best musical cue of the show. More flashbacks to Mohan reiterate his role in their lives as a constant source of joy and light. Never Have I Ever pays tribute to loss and grief with such earnestness and specificity. Devi and Nalini’s relationship arc ends up being the show’s finest.
But Devi kissing Ben in the car while Paxton tries to call her does feel like the appropriate bookend for the series, given that Devi poured so much of her time into her romantic prospects in the beginning, hoping for a distraction. She has implicitly learned that you can’t force romance, though. Instead, what has unfolded between her and Ben is something she never could have planned or predicted. But it’s really the show’s handling of grief and trauma, rather than young romance, that makes Never Have I Ever a special show.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Help Our Neighborhood Restaurants: Vinatería Remains Harlem’s Living Room—At A Distance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are restaurants that feel like family gatherings, and then there’s Vinatería, where—before coronavirus—owner Yvette Leeper-Bueno’s mother could be found bobbing from table to table, as much a mainstay as any of its delectable menu items.
“She's the connector,” says Leeper-Bueno. “She is really the one that is just that wave of hospitality as you walk in the door.”
Though the Spanish-influenced Italian joint debuted on 119th Street and Frederick Douglass in 2013, Leeper-Bueno’s familial ties to the area date back decades: as a child, she’d often visit her grandparents in Harlem or pop into her parents’ clothing boutique on 104th Street. Years later, she went to college up the hill at Barnard, and now lives just a few blocks from the restaurant; her husband runs a mindfulness center around the corner.
Harlem was already changing when Vinatería’s doors first opened seven years ago. Down the street on Cathedral Parkway, a glassy condo with park views sprouted in an abandoned lot that used to be a gas station; up on 125th, a new Whole Foods opened down the street from Jimmy Jazz. As the neighborhood wrestled with gentrification amid renewed prosperity, Leeper-Bueno aimed to recreate the feeling of an inclusive dinner party in her living room.
“I wanted it to be the place that was comfortable for longtime residents that had been here for 40 years, as well as a new influx of people coming in,” she says. “That it would be the place that could be welcoming and feel relevant to all.”
Before the shutdown, Vinatería’s menu and ambience simultaneously exuded comfort and sophistication. It was a place that offered homemade pasta alongside rare Argentinian reds (and a waitstaff that would top you off on the house). But atmosphere can’t really be taken out or delivered.
So Leeper-Bueno has focused on adapting her cuisine to the current moment: a new range of $15 pastas joins chimichurri skirt steak and whole-roasted branzino with Calabrian chili. Vinatería’s cocktail bar, one of the finest in Harlem—if not the entire city—rivals the kitchen with its inventiveness (try the herbaceous Basilisk, or its smokier off-menu cousin, the Fleur de Harlem).
Like many restaurants in Manhattan, Vinatería remains open in large part to serve a greater purpose: providing jobs (albeit a reduced number) and feeding first responders. The restaurant delivered nearly 800 such meals in the last two weeks, a mix of donations by customers and by Leeper-Bueno herself.
“Opening, and continuing to stay open,” she says, “was, in my mind, where we could make the most impact.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Art Opens Doors to the Reclusive Filipino Mental Health Issue</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“I’m fine, you don’t have to worry about me,” a good friend of mine shared to me.
This was the response I got from a friend who shared to me about her sudden emotional outbursts because of fear from losing her job. She is one of the many Filipinos who belong to the ‘no work, no pay’ scheme of several manufacturing companies.  She relies on her daily output to be able to earn a salary for the day.
Here in Asia, or at least in the Philippines, mental health remains to be rarely discussed.  We grow up in a society that shines negative light to the people who go through some form of anxiety or depression.  In fact, while we belong to a community-based society where individuals come from large families who are viewed to have strong emotional support, more often than not, it is the very relatives or family members who would quickly dismiss thoughts or opportunities of discussion about mental disorders.
Just last April 2020, an army veteran was shot dead alleged to be reaching for his gun. The army veteran was later on identified to be a mentally ill former soldier who suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  He was formerly stationed at Marawi – a city sieged by terrorist insurgents back in 2017.
Aside from the close-knit family culture of most Asian countries, common causes such as community shame, lack of understanding, and judgement from society all stems from deep-rooted cultural constructs. It is quite prevalent, up until now, within Filipino context that asking for help might bring shame to the family once the community finds out about a family member being ‘broken’.  Family pride supersedes any member’s mental disorder.
From ‘you don’t have to worry about me’ to making doodles.
When I posted that I was offering psychological first aid to Covid-19 first responders, entrepreneurs with businesses that were on operational shutdown, and for employees who are going through emotional instability, one of my friends shared her acute distress.  At first she was hesitant to share details about it, which I fully respected. Eventually, I asked her to get a pen and paper and make scribbles and doodle whatever she felt at that moment. There was no need for her to share details of what she was going through. 
And immediately, she started to create doodles. There were no words needed. She looked for a pen and paper and started to doodle. It was a sight of relief looking at her expressing her thoughts in thick and jagged lines.  It was a relief that it only needed a pen and paper for her to realise how distressed she was, but kept it under lock because of fears of embarrassing her family.
Growing up in an Asian household, we have to constantly prove our worth – by attaining high grades, achieving that degree, landing a highly coveted 8-5 job, getting married at a certain age, or having kids for the grandparents to enjoy. As much as it is of life’s highlights, much of it is also about saving face for the family.  Now, that most people are filing for job losses and businesses are running bankrupt, it is hard to save face when everyone is going through exactly the same thing.
Whenever I conduct psychological first aid to company employees and entrepreneurs, I always find the Asian cultural context as the largest wall to overcome. Yet, while being an artist, I was able to leverage on personal expression and creativity to break this wall.
In the middle of scribbling and doodling, our conversation started to go deeper about the emotions running inside of her.  She soon realised that her doodles were the exact visual representation of the chaos that’s been inside of her ever since the pandemic began. She gave a sigh of relief. Though it was not an immediate fix, we understood that it was a huge weight which needed to be out of her system.
In psychological first aid through art, we understand that we can’t fix people’s problems. We are here to support and mitigate acute signs of distress, and based upon evidence of the disposition of the individual to function effectively in the wake of the current pandemic. A decision is normally made if there is a need to facilitate access to a higher level of care, and it is here we conduct art therapy sessions.
Right now, I am happy to share that my friend is back on her daily routine – back to being productive by doing small food delivery business. It was that simple act of compassionate care and deciding to pick up a pair of pen and paper that allowed her to be back on track.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amazon doesn't need you; Naas does. The coronavirus has no endearing qualities but the response of the community to those worst affected by its impact gives us hope, even inspiration.
Across the water, 99 year old Tom Moore did laps of his garden and raised £25m for the National Health Service in the UK.
This was a story that had everything for the British media. They love to honour those who took part in wars.
But the man captured the imagination and had to wait until almost his 100th birthday to become a genuine hero. You have to love him.
On a much smaller scale locally much good work is being done to help those who have to stay at home, cannot attend medical appointments, are lonely or just badly off.
This effort is being coordinated by Kildare County Council and the local authority too deserves much credit for its efforts to ensure that the deleterious impact on the community is eased and managed as best as it can be.
There are other groups too.
There are too many to mention but include Naas GAA and Civil Defence as well as individuals either helping out in a practical way through human contact or by donating money at a time when unemployment, hopefully temporarily, has risen as fast economic activity has shrunken.
And, of course, we have Elizabeth Kenny from Clane. Lizzie didn’t fight any wars that we know of but she’s made of strong stuff.
The amount generated by her fundraising laps of the patio is now well north of €4,000.
The money will help the Naas Care of the Aged centre at Newbridge road but the real value of what she did was to get us thinking about other people and to help forge a wider community spirit. When we read about people like Elizabeth Kenny we know we’re not alone.
There will be an end to this and it can't come soon enough.
The economy will improve because it always does and it was in a strong position before the virus arrived. Naas town centre will survive too but it would help if we all helped.
There is much to like about the town centre. It has some of the finest buildings, like the bank, premises and Town Hall of any town anywhere. But its traders have been buffeted by one gale after another.
First the shopping centre in Monread opened and then we had economic collapse; neither of which were the fault of fhe traders in Naas. Now they have to deal with the virus.
If we want a town centre in Naas we have to support the businesses there.
Many of the businesses there are unique and enough of those brave souls who open business — and yes, even if it’s another coffee shop — need support .
And it’s not a call for charity because if business is not viable they die and the disappearance of enterprises from the middle of the town diminishes us all.
There are many fine businesses in the town and — pre coronavirus — the town had a healthy nightlife (for which it won an award).
Again there are too many good businesses to mention but one of these is Barker & Jones, another is Lawlor’s Hotel or the Lemongrass restaurant.
B & J is more than a bookshop, it sells all manner of things including obscure publications.
It is a beautiful place and its unique view of part of the town from the front upstairs window is a design charm.
Places like Barker & Jones deserve to prosper. They are more like places to go than commercial enterprises.
If it’s a straight question between soulless concepts like Amazon or a some place like Barker & Jones, there’s only one answer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to Set Limits During Quarantine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A couple of days ago, when I refused to let my six-year-old play more video games, he declared that he was having the “worst day ever.” He didn’t just say it, though. He shrieked the words before he stormed away and slammed his bedroom door. Yesterday, after I told my four-year-old that he couldn’t have another snack before lunch time, he squinted in my direction and told me – slowly and deliberately – that I am “a mean, mean mommy.”
How we set limits during this strange and stressful time is a theme that's coming up over and over during my virtual workshops and sessions with parents. In the past week alone, I've gotten the following questions:
It’s not about leverage. I promise.
In pre-pandemic life, I spoke a lot about the importance of parenting with both love and limits, the two L’s. I cited decades of research suggesting that children thrive when parents are loving and warm, while also structured and boundaried. It’s a myth, I would say, that when either love or limits go up, the other must come down.
All of this still holds during the pandemic. I’ve written a lot on this blog about the first L – love – and about the primacy of the parent-child connection during this time. I’ve given less attention to setting limits, in part because I’d rather parents double-up on love right now than double-down on “discipline.” That said, no matter how much I don’t like the word (hence, the quotation marks), it’s a concept that has been coming up again and again, and one that’s important.
I like to think about limits as a container of sorts, or a fence, inside which our children feel safe. It’s their job to push up against the outside of the container, and ours to ensure the walls don’t fall down as a result – even if they do sometimes need to bend a bit. Right now, that metaphor is more important than ever; during this time of uncertainty and instability, our children need to feel that we, their parents and caregivers, can hold and contain them. The love, I like to say, is the way we say to our kids, “I get you.” The limits are how we say, simultaneously, “I’ve got you.”
So how do we show our children we’ve got them during this stressful time? Here is a four-step guide.
1. Take our cues from pre-school and elementary school classrooms.
When you walk into a classroom for young children, some of the first things you see are visual prompts that remind children of desired expectations and behavior. Pictures of children with their fingers to their mouths remind kids to speak in their inside voices. Posters about kindness and friendship abound – they are part of the culture.
There’s a schedule for the day and a calendar for the month. You will notice teachers using phrases like “listening ears” and “thinking caps,” along with songs like “the clean-up song,” to reinforce important messages. Young children are constantly reminded of what’s expected of them in bright, colorful, fun ways. They are “in the soup” of the values and expectations that are most important.
No one has the bandwidth to turn their home into a classroom right now (see this article for more on this), but investing time, energy, and maybe even a small amount of money (Amazon has a laminator for about $20 or, better yet, support a local business) in creating some of these prompts (and learning or making up some accompanying rhymes/songs) is well worth your time.
2. Get to the root of the behavior, the why.
Trite as it may be, now is the time to think about the iceberg analogy more than ever. Your children’s negative behaviors — defiance, whining, explosive outbursts — are the tip of the iceberg, the part that’s visible. What’s hiding underneath the water’s surface? All of the thoughts and feelings that underlie those behaviors. Given everything going on right now, I can guarantee you that those include uncertainty, instability, worry, confusion, overwhelm.
Your child may not be able to put these feelings into words, or even have them in conscious awareness, but just as we are in the middle of a collective trauma, so are they. That is taking its toll on them, just as it is on us.
3. Put Yourself in your child’s shoes.
This is perhaps the greatest tool we have at our disposal as parents; it builds on the point above and embodies the very essence of empathy. It also helps us understand why, for example, typical behavioral approaches likely won’t be effective right now.
The exercise itself is quite simple; let’s say you were, consciously or not, feeling stressed, uncertain, or unstable. As a result, you snapped at someone you love, such as your partner or a close friend. What would you need in that moment? What would feel containing, that is, help you feel safe and secure? Because that’s what your children are going to need. They need quiet tones, understanding, acceptance, nurturing. What they don’t need, what will likely even make things worse, is your coming down hard on them.
“But then what if they think it’s OK to act that way? That anything goes? Don’t I need to take something away from them, to show that this behavior is unacceptable?”
Go back to you snapping at your loved one and remember what was at the root of it. Did you snap because you knew it would be OK? Because you thought to yourself, “Hey, it’s totally acceptable for me to call my partner an idiot, so I think that’s what I’m gonna go ahead and do”? Of course not. Right now, our children are acting out because they are stressed, not because they are learning that it’s OK to do. The more we can re-regulate their nervous systems, foster their feelings of calm and safety, the more likely those behaviors will decrease over time. To the extent there is a time and place for behavioral tools, now is not it.
4. Reiterate the limit in a moment of calm.
OK, so you snapped at your loved one, and maybe they snapped back, or maybe they were able to contain you by maintaining their state of calm. Either way, they might come back to you later, when you’re eating dinner or sitting together on the couch. “I really didn’t like it when you spoke to me that way earlier,” they might say. And you’ll be able to hear it. You won’t get more dysregulated (read: angry, anxious) because you’ll feel safe and connected. And then your loved one will remind you of the posters around the house about kindness, and the “Importance of Not Snapping” song. Oh wait, you’re not five. But you get the idea.
Which is to say: circle back to step one. Wash, rinse, repeat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">So you’ve tested positive - Why Not Say What Happened?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was Wednesday evening after the first rain in weeks when the chance presented itself. There have been precious few excursions during this lockdown beyond delivering some daily essentials to a once-close neighbour who is properly cocooned on a very large estate in Wicklow, and there’s usually something given in return.
“Bet you can’t work this into the sports pages,” he said, handing me a well-read copy of the book ‘Why Not Say What Happened?’ The cover flap was missing and in truth I’d never heard of Ivana Lowell until he briefly explained her family background and the absolute madness of it all.
Why Not Say What Happened? has nothing whatsoever to do with sport, although it does feature episodes of binge drinking and some drugs. Lowell certainly isn’t sporty either but does have some links with this part of Wicklow, her grandmother being Maureen Guinness, whose sister Oonagh was gifted the Luggala Estate by her father, later passing it down to her son Garech Browne.
Lowell has spent most of her life between London and New York with summer holidays in Ireland and her memoir, published in 2009, is by turns of the page shockingly upsetting and hilariously real. From the sexual abuse and near-fatal burns in her childhood, to the eating disorders and raging alcoholism and the quest to find out who in fact was her father, Lowell doesn’t hold anything back.
Her stepfather was the American poet Robert Lowell, and she got the title for her book from the last line in his poem Epilogue. She also dated Bob Weinstein, brother of Harvey, and the account of their wedding at the Rainbow Room in New York is utter buffoonery.
In the end it all comes across as a reminder that the truth may sometimes be stranger than fiction, or that there are some things you really couldn’t make up. Both of which were reasons for its timely reading on Wednesday evening, the day after the latest anti-doping report from Sport Ireland, capped off by the latest doping offence within the GAA.
This was my chance, because every year it seems there are parts of this report you couldn’t make up, or certainly come across as strange. Of the 1,303 anti-doping tests carried out across 36 sports in 2019 – a 17 per cent increase on the previous year – there were seven rule violations in all, four of which are still considered “pending” (including the case of Munster and Ireland rugby prop James Cronin and the mixed-up medical prescription that resulted in a positive test for a banned steroid).
The three doping cases now concluded were 21-year-old amateur wrestler Peter Newti and 31-year-old motor racing driver Stanislaw Ukieja, who both tested positive for traces of cannabis, and League of Ireland footballer Brandon Miele. He failed to submit a sample when required to do so last April, later contesting that he’d struggled to provide a full sample and then left out of concern for his four-year-old daughter after being informed by his partner that she had fallen.
In 2018, there was only one single doping case in Irish sport, amateur boxer Evan Metcalfe also testing positive for traces of cannabis at the National Elite finals, later claiming he unknowingly ingested the substance after being offered what he thought was a cigarette at a party in a friend’s house three days earlier.
Sport Ireland has been running anti-doping here since 1999, the year after one of those doping cases you still couldn’t make up: swimmer Michelle Smith, who won more individual gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics than any other athlete from any nation, producing a sample that contained an alcohol level that could have been fatal if consumed by a human.
Not forgetting the fact her sample also contained androstenedione, a metabolic precursor of testosterone. Fina – the international swimming federation – pressed for the more clear-cut charge of sample tampering, which also carried the higher punishment of a four-year ban, which is exactly what she got.
In the years since it seems the truth and fiction around doping has become increasingly blurred. Martin Fagan’s confession in January 2012, after injecting himself with EPO in his apartment in Arizona and feeling the low of the junkie, has been one of the few efforts to come at least partly clean.
Others typically resort to the old dope tricks, the sport of cycling traditionally leading the way with excuses such as the “vanishing twin” (Tyler Hamilton), the “pigeon pie” (Adri van der Poel), the “poppy seed muffin” (Alexi Grewal), and another of the “too much whiskey” (Floyd Landis). Not forgetting Chris Froome’s malfunctioning kidney.
Sex often features too. US sprinter Dennis Mitchell, who back in 1998 tested positive for testosterone but claimed that was because he’d drank five bottles of beer and had sex with his wife at least four times. His excuse was accepted by US Track and Field, although World Athletics banned him for two years.
There also my old favourite: Canada’s 2015 World pole vault champion Shawn Barber was cleared to compete in the Rio Olympics despite testing positive for cocaine at the Canadian trials, claiming it was “inadvertently ingested” during a sexual encounter with a woman he met via an on-line personals site (before later coming out as gay).
Some prefer to say nothing at all, although confirmation on Thursday that Carlow footballer Ray Walker is not appealing his four-year suspension after testing positive in February of this year for the banned substance Meldonium has presented more questions than answers. Not least how or indeed why a 35 year-old coming to the end of his career would have a heart-defect medication in his system that is not licensed in Ireland and known to be performance-enhancing under World Anti-Doping Agency Rules (Wada).
All Walker is saying is that he was talking an anti-inflammatory for an upset stomach, which seems a very long way from Meldonium, first developed by Latvian scientist Ivars Kalvins in the 1970s and intended to boost the stamina of Soviet troops fighting at high altitudes in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
Or maybe it’s all a little closer to home, Walker is the fourth GAA player to test positive for a specified banned substance, only to claim he knew nothing about it. One of these days there might be something given in return. Even if the truth is stranger than fiction, one of those things that you really couldn’t make up, why not say what happened?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tim Dowling: Oh no! I’m being visited by ghosts of bosses past</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a dream, all my former bosses appear, one after the other. I think the enforced idleness of quarantine has summoned them, to query the gap between my nose and the grindstone, and give me shit about my timekeeping.
From somewhere in 1986, Ron Wasson shouts my surname. He calls me into his office, a glass box in the corner of the mailroom, and tells me to shut the door. Ostensibly this is about me being late, but really he’s going to tell me a long dirty joke. This isn’t just a dream; it used happen at least once a week.
Even sitting up in bed with my eyes open, it takes me a few moments to accept that Ron is no longer my boss, that I don’t have to laugh at his joke before he will sign my timesheet. I decide to get dressed, even though it is not quite 6am. I don’t want sleep, and the mailroom, to claim me again this morning.
I recall that Ron liked to encase his dirty jokes in a thick veneer of non-fiction. He would first ask me if I knew John from the traffic department – Johnnie Z, not Johnnie C. Yeah, I’d say.
“Johnnie went to the Polish club for lunch last week,” he would say. “You ever eaten at the Polish club?”
“No,” I would say. “I thought you had to be Polish.”
“Nah, you don’t have to be Polish. Anyway, he sees this guy at the bar. And he’s like, a perfectly normal guy, except that he has an incredibly tiny head. Now, you know Johnnie, he would never say anything…”
“Miaow!” the cat says. I am standing in the kitchen, holding my shoes. A sideways morning light catches the dusting of ground coffee on the worktop. You might never notice it otherwise.
“It’s the little things,” I say, to no one.
“Miaow!” the cat says.
“Of course,” I say, pulling open the cupboard where the cat food is kept. “Your bowl is full, but whatever. Let’s just pour more food on top, and then you can eat yourself sick.” The cat’s ability to ignore sarcasm is prodigious. I pour, it eats.
I step into the garden, which still holds a chill. The squirrel hanging from the bird feeder doesn’t run away at my approach; he just watches as I pass under him. The animals are slowly reclaiming the outdoors.
I sit at my desk in my office shed, recalling how a few Polish beers would erode Johnnie Z’s normal reserve, until he was moved to ask the man on the next bar stool about his miniature head.
“I was in the marines,” Ron would say the man said. “I got shot down, and I ended up alone on this desert island. I found this old bottle on the beach, and when I opened it out came this beautiful genie.”
For his one wish, Ron says, the marine requested sex with the genie, but this was against the rules. It took, on average, 20 minutes for Ron’s joke to reach its unprintable denouement.
My coffee is cold. On my way back to the kitchen I find the tortoise lying on his back in a puddle of his own urine. He cranes his neck and fixes me with a look that says: please don’t write about this. “What happened?” I say, turning him over. Evidently he took a shortcut over brick edging and got unlucky. He rests for a minute, catching his breath, and then pushes himself into the tulips.
Half an hour later, my wife finds me sitting at my desk, arms folded, mouth ajar, in a glass box in the corner of the garden. “Busy?” she says. I think about telling her about the tortoise, but it seems disloyal.
“Come in and shut the door,” I say.
“Why?” she says.
“You ever eaten at the Polish club?” I say.
“What are you talking about?” she says.
“It turns out you don’t need to be Polish,” I say. “Anyway.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I Don't Care That I'm Really Small' &#8211; Craig Casey Proving The Doubters Wrong</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Well, obviously it’s not the 21st you think you’re going to have,” Craig Casey laughs as he recalls the celebrations on what is a significant milestone in any young man’s life.
The Munster scrum-half turned 21 just over two weeks ago and due to the new reality which we’re all currently experiencing in Ireland, the celebrations in the Casey household were a little bit more restrained and muted than what you would originally expect.
“It was fairly chilled out. A few of the family drove by the house and beeped and that was it. Handed cards out the window. We just sat down as a family for dinner and that was that then.”
Casey, like the rest of the Munster squad, is currently on lockdown and training remotely but due to his respiratory condition, he has been conducting social distancing a lot longer than the rest of us.
“I have asthma so I was one of those who would be under threat if I get it. Since the first time it was mentioned in Ireland, my father and my mother have been really diligent with not allowing me to do anything bar train anyway.
“When we went into lockdown, I was basically on lockdown for the few weeks before then. Nothing has changed there other than the fact that we’re training really, really hard by ourselves.”
Casey provides an insight into the training regime the Munster squad are undertaking; running sessions, gym work and skills challenges are all par for the course.
If you have seen Casey’s actions on the pitch, it will come as no surprise to learn that his competitive edge emerges when undertaking the challenges provided by Munster senior coach, Stephen Larkham.
Rising to a challenge, overcoming it and learning lessons is ingrained in Casey’s DNA. This attitude and determination has put him on an exciting path which has already yielded an Ireland U20 Grand Slam, a senior debut for Munster and a maiden try on his first taste of European action at Thomond Park.
There are multiple factors which have contributed to Casey’s rise and to get a clear understanding of this, we must take a look at a certain famous Limerick rugby club with a record nine AIL titles which has helped produce 20 Ireland internationals and three British and Irish Lions.
“I think my first training session was when I was four years of age and my father was actually the coach. He was training the U20s as well at the time. He was always training Tuesday and Thursday nights so I was out with him from a very young age.
“I think my very first game was against Richmond on the Well pitch in Coonagh, I remember that vaguely enough. Then my father started coaching the Shannon seniors so I was in and around the Shannon senior teams every Tuesday and Thursday and travelled with them on game day on Saturdays.
“I was never not around the club. Obviously, we had training ourselves on Sunday. My father coached me all the way up through U14s with Shannon and then I went into the schools system when you’re club-tied. I still remember the AIL final in 2009 when my father was coaching.”
That 2009 final, Shannon’s most recent AIL title, gave Casey an inkling into what it takes to succeed and thrive under the greatest pressure as he explains how he was present during the pre-match team talk and the post-match function at a local hotel.
Of course, Casey’s family have deep roots with the club. In addition to his father, his uncle Mossy Lawlor had a distinguished career in the blue and black jersey as well as making 65 appearances for Munster.
“In terms of my family, with Mossy playing for Shannon growing up and then playing senior for Munster, he was always someone that I looked at and wanted to emulate. Obviously, like you’re saying, the Shannon family traditions and constantly kids of players in the past have come through the club as well.
“Shannon have played a huge part in my rugby career to date and it still has. I still go there most Tuesdays and Thursdays to watch training even if I’m not playing. You can’t really get out of the club if you’re in it!”
One of Casey’s greatest strengths or his “point of difference” as he will later describe it, is his pass. The 21-year-old throws a terrific pass; quick and accurate from both sides as evident from any of his games for Munster this season or last year’s exploits with the Ireland U20s.
The Limerick man explains that the club also had a role to play in the development of this core skill and in particular, Shannon legend Andrew Thompson.
“I remember turning up to a Shannon senior training when I was young, I think it was Andrew Thompson who said to me, “Jesus, you have a really nice pass off your left, what’s it like off your right?”
“So that was something that really drove me on when I was young to be able to do it. And then it just started taking off from there. My father and my uncle have always said that the scrum-half’s biggest thing is your pass, so, it’s something I’ve been working on since a young age and it’s something that I will always do.”
Like many children who are entering adolescence, a decision was made on what sport to stick with. Casey was a keen footballer. He played football for Caherdavin Celtic, Fairview Rangers and Coonagh United in Limerick. He impressed so much that he was selected to play for the Limerick District Schoolboy League (LDSL) side in the Kennedy Cup, the national inter-league competition for U14 players.
In 2013, LDSL reached the semi-finals and Casey has a rather painful memory of the 3rd/4th place playoff against Cork, one which no doubt still lingers somewhat based on his description of that day.
“I was playing Kennedy Cup soccer and then Junior Cup rugby. The last time I kicked a soccer ball was when I missed a penalty in the Kennedy Cup 3rd and 4th place playoff.
“It was actually in a penalty shootout and I was the only one to miss. So it was fairly devastating!”
Casey explains that the oval ball was always likely to be his choice but that day at the University of Limerick probably provided a bit more clarity on his decision.
The scrum-half entered Ard Scoil Rís, one of Limerick’s rugby nurseries with Paul O’Connell, Seán Cronin, Mike Sherry and Dave Kilcoyne among the North Circular Road’s school’s alumni.
Once Casey got a taste of what a professional-esque rugby setup was like, which he experienced playing Junior Cup with Ard Scoil, he was hooked.
He would then go on to represent a Munster Schools U17s Development side under the tutelage of Johnny Lacey who is now the IRFU’s High-Performance Referee Coach. In Casey’s own words, his game came on “leaps and bounds” that summer and chasing down the dream of becoming a professional rugby player would now be his sole focus.
As we know from Casey’s actions on the pitch over the last year or so, the 21-year-old looks like he will carve out a very successful career in a Munster shirt in the years ahead but at times, it didn’t look like that was going to happen.
Captaining Ard Scoil Rís to a Munster Schools Senior Cup semi-final would soon be followed by securing a place in Munster’s Academy.
From the outset, everything was going according to plan but Casey suffered some horrible injury luck which would keep him on the sidelines for 14 months.
It all began with a match against Leinster.
“We were playing Leinster and I was the captain of the U19s team, that was the biggest game ever at that time. It was the first game of the Interpros. I took a bit of a bang in the warmup to my knee. I thought it was nothing really. I played the full match and then the next day I could not move my knee at all.
“I was on to the physios and they checked me out. They decided that they would bring me up to Santry to meet a consultant, Ray Moran, and he said I’d be better off getting it surgically repaired then. That was the first thing.”
The first thing?
“Then I had an ingrown hair on my lower back which going with the knee rehab, they had to decide which one to operate first. So they did the knee first and two weeks after they did the lower back. So trying to work the two hand in hand in rehab didn’t really work.
Nine months later, Casey was fully healed. Back into another summer preseason until…
So many setbacks, severe ones at that, would deflate the strongest willed of us. Nevertheless, Casey persevered. He credits some of Munster’s staff; Marc Beggs, Owen Tarrant, Lorcan Kavanagh, Damien O’Donoghue and Shane Malone to name just a few, as instrumental in his recovery.
But it was seeing his own sister, Aimee, recover from her own serious surgery due to scoliosis which put things into perspective.
“My sister had fairly serious back surgery during that as well. I say my mother and father were stressed to the gills but in fairness, they did all they could to keep me in high spirits.”
Casey added:
“It was easier to keep your spirits up, especially when you’re looking at [Aimee] trying to walk again as I said before.”
Although Casey’s time in the Munster Academy was hampered by injuries, Munster were clearly aware of the Shannon man’s quality and potential. After just two years in the Academy, Casey was upgraded to a development contract ahead of the 2019/20 season (he will rise to a senior contract next season).
Perhaps the defining moment came last year when Casey excelled with the Ireland U20s with his all-action displays in a green shirt helped Noel McNamara’s side to a Six Nations Grand Slam.
Casey’s performances were soon the talk of rugby circles nationwide with everyone wanting to know more of this 5’5″ bundle of energy.
That 2019 Grand Slam journey will be remembered fondly for a long time by Irish rugby fans and in terms of Casey’s career to date, he’s no different.
“That was the night we won the championship. That night was just crazy. To think that France went on to win the World Cup as well and we had already beaten them. It’s a bit surreal.”
As we’ve seen over the last 12 months, Casey’s pass is what sets him apart which is no surprise from what we have learned about his influences in Shannon. Yet, even in the confined environment he currently finds himself in, his practice in this regard is not letting up one bit.
“Well, I would say I’m absolutely obsessed with passing, to be honest. It’s definitely my point of difference and it’s something I’ve worked on since I was four.
“Now that we’re in lockdown, I’ll probably get about 2,500 passes a week in. It’s not something I’m letting go of, it’s not something that I’ll ever let go because it is my point of difference. That’s what will take me places, I think.”
Casey’s “point of difference”, as he describes it, immediately raises the question as to why he needs it and whether if it is due to his stature. Standing at 5’5″, he will most likely always be the shortest man on the pitch and in a sport which has often put an increasing emphasis on size and power in recent years, there are some who believe this could be seen as a potential weakness.
The Limerick man refutes this with absolute conviction.
“It’s funny because I actually don’t really care that I’m really small. Obviously, there will be a lot of people that will say, “Jesus, he’s too small” and stuff like that. But growing up, I was always the smallest kid on the field and it just made me work harder at the basics of the game like you said like my pass.
“I’ve always kind of taken it as a challenge to me. I love the challenge of being small. You look at Faf de Klerk and Aaron Smith, probably the two smallest in the world and they’re absolutely brilliant as well so they’re the two that I’ve looked at to try and grow my game as well.”
From listening to Casey speak about overcoming adversity, it’s clear that he’s a passionate person. This is also evident in how he plays the game, often roaring at his pack to present clean ball or even giving the opposition some stick as Welsh flanker Dan Lydiate will attest.
It’s certainly an old-school way of going about things but it’s something which is undoubtedly appreciated by the Munster faithful, that never-say-die and underdog attitude. And as Casey explains, it’s in his DNA and always has been.
“Yeah, I’ve definitely always been like that growing up,” Casey says with a chuckle.
“Whether its tag rugby on the street or a game in Thomond Park, I’m probably all the same. I remember, someone texted me after one of the games and said, ‘This is ridiculous, this is like when you were playing tag rugby in Kilkee on the beach.’
“The same amount of competitiveness. It’s something that I won’t let go. It’s probably in the family as well. Myself, my mother and my uncle are probably known as bitter people! It probably comes from there.”
As the conversation draws to a close, thoughts are cast to the future and getting back on the pitch. Casey admits that the current pandemic has made him realise even further just what sport means to people which only increases his desire to run out once again at Thomond Park or Irish Independent Park.
The excitement in Munster circles around Casey’s development and potential will increase once again once rugby resumes but the 21-year-old recalls a piece of advice he received which is closely aligned to the late Anthony Foley’s mantra when it came to dealing with the media and public perceptions.
“I think the best piece of advice was, ‘You’ve got to take the good with the bad’. So if you’re taking all the good articles and stuff like that about yourself, then you’ve got to believe the bad articles about yourself.
“I don’t really take much notice of them in general. Now, my mother would probably, she’d be the one that loves reading articles and stuff like that. But she’s been warned that if you’re reading all the good articles, you’ve got to read some bad comments as well.
Looking back on Casey’s career to date, there’s little that has gotten to him and if it has, even for the briefest of moments, he has overcome it.
It’s what he does.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In lockdown, Shreya Ghoshal spends time composing music</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shreya Ghoshal’s singing is always on point. But not many know that there’s also a composer in her. Just before the COVID-19 lockdown in India in March, she had unveiled a single ‘Nah woh main’ in Hindi.
“I was not sure how long the lockdown would go on, so I released it on my YouTube channel. It’s co-composed by me and my brother [Soumyadeep Ghoshal],” said Shreya.
She wants to use the lockdown days to create more content for her YouTube channel: “It takes a little while to crack a good song. I am more of a singer than a composer. I do have a lot of projects that are coming to me — some nice compositions from friends — so, I am collaborating with people and I am ideating.”
“I have always wanted to create something that I want to sing. I don’t always want to depend on a film. Film songs are limited to the story or the setting of the film,” she added.
She doesn’t have a preference when it comes to the genre of songs, “The kind of music I listen to is quite versatile. I don’t limit myself. But I like slightly challenging songs,” said Shreya.
Sharing an example, she said ‘Ghar more pardesiya’ from Kalank was a tough song to sing. “It’s a dance song but all the ‘harkat’ and nuances were there. It also had to sound cinematic. It was a challenging song. I hope these kind of songs happen more. Whether it is classical or not, it should be challenging.”
She is also keeping the artiste in her alive during these tough times by doing virtual concerts. She recently participated in YouTube’s One Nation initiative that saw over 75 music artistes and Indian YouTube creators uniting for a live concert.
“Everyone is at home, their morale is down. It’s been over a month of lockdown. We needed to do something to cheer up people. Also, we are raising funds. I want to help as much as possible. A lot of underprivileged people are there who need support,” she said.
“By doing this [the virtual concert], I am also keeping myself happy. There was a time when I felt 24 hours were less in a day, now I feel there is so much time and less to do,” she added.
Shreya has also been experimenting in the kitchen and going the household chores during lockdown.
She hasn’t given much thought to what she will immediately do once the lockdown is over, but she misses travelling within India: “I want to see my country. I want to travel. I miss going to the airport,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Annalise Murphy readjusting her focus as Olympic dream is put on hold</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We interrupt this interview to bring you Annalise Murphy’s just-invented recipe for a scone for one. Seems only fair, since this interview interrupted her in the eating of said scone and she was good enough to take the call nonetheless. May as well let daylight in upon magic, given the intrusion.
“I was sitting there thinking, ‘Aw, I’d love a scone right now’. I’m in the mood of making stuff that requires minimal effort and can be done very fast. It wasn’t the best scone in the world but it was still sort of a scone. I got a bowl and put in a bit of flour, an egg, milk, some raisins and a bit of baking powder and some butter and then mixed it all around.
“It wasn’t exactly scone consistency. It was somewhere between scone and pancake. I put it on a tray and put it in the oven and it came out and I ate it. And it wasn’t bad. I don’t know if it’s a good thing to find out I can make a scone for one in the space of three minutes and it’s out of the oven 10 minutes later. I’m not sure that’s great. But there you go.”
Such is the stuff of lockdown life.
In a parallel universe, Murphy is 12 weeks out from the Olympics and each day has been mapped out and detailed. Hour and minute, chapter and verse. Nothing exists beyond the last weekend in July and every meaningful thought she has in her head feels the pull of Tokyo in some way. The glorious mysteries of the scone for one don’t arise.
But we are when we are. Stuck in the here and now with no real sense of what the end of it looks like or when it might come around. The straws in the wind suggest that single-handed sailing might be one of the sports to come back sooner than the others, possibly even in the coming week or two. If so, she’ll be back on the water. For what purpose, however, is a far more complicated matter.
“Uncertainty has a big effect. Because you just don’t know. Is my next competition going to be as far away as the Olympics next year? Am I going to be able to compete in September or October? That’s something you don’t know. I am just going to have to keep semi-fit and then when I’m able to get back out on the water, start sailing by myself. And then hopefully be able to start sailing with the other Irish sailors in time. And then maybe by the end of the year be able to go away somewhere and train.
“You just don’t know. There’s no certainty. Two months ago I was basically counting down the days to the Olympics. I knew all the points I had to be at, I knew what the next six months would entail for me to get there. Now it’s just . . . who knows?”
The not knowing takes some adjusting to. When you pour every bit of you into something that comes around once every four years, shifting gears is no simple task. Murphy hadn’t yet guaranteed herself the Laser Radial spot reserved for an Irish woman in Tokyo but she was asserting herself in the field of four who are in contention. She was rounding into form and very nearly nabbed a world title in Melbourne in February.
But then everything stopped. For those of us on the outside, it’s easy to think of the sports world just now as one where the tap has been momentarily turned off. But for the people who are actually involved, it’s more that sport has frozen over on the way down. The tap is still running through them, there’s just nowhere for it to go.
There are bigger problems in the world, of course there are. And yet this is something all sportspeople are trying to square just now so it’s surely worth examining. How do you wrap your head around it? There’s no manual for this kind of thing, no seen-it-all, been-it-all ear to bend. And every human is different. Everyone’s timeline has its own squiggle.
“I think a lot about the Olympics,” Murphy says. “I finished the World Championships in Australia in February and I was so disappointed on the last day. I basically just messed it up. I had this chance to win the worlds and I didn’t. But I was able to also accept it because I was sailing really well and I was on the edge of breaking the rules and I got caught and I got disqualified. That’s racing – you have to be pushing to try and win.
“So I came home from it feeling pretty good. I was able to say to myself even that it was maybe a good thing. Maybe if I’d won the worlds, I would have been complacent going into the Olympics six months later. I could have spent those six months thinking I was class and not really having the right tools to actually go and win.
“And I was also thinking, ‘I can be world champion some day’. Initially, I was very much thinking I was going to retire after the Olympics. But after the worlds I was going, ‘Well, I don’t know if I can retire now – I need to go and try to win a worlds before I retire.’ So actually now I’m going, ‘Oh shit, I really wish I had won the worlds because I don’t think I’d have been complacent for 18 months!’”
Like the rest of us, she has a lot of thinking time now. Unlike the rest of us, she has had a bit of training for it. Doing the Volvo Ocean Race in 2018 provided her with months of experience in the fields of isolation, monotony and getting through a day. This is like that, she says, but with added Netflix, decent food and the ability to shower whenever she wants.
“Which, it turns out, isn’t that often! Who needs to wash your hair? You’re not going to see anyone!”
But the mind, in its lonesomeness, will pick at us all. Every Olympic event has been moved by 364 days but nothing is that simple. First of all, it remains entirely possible that they won’t happen at all. Second of all, even if they do, who will she even be come July 2021? You never step in the same river twice.
“I worry about if I’m going to have the right motivation to keep on training at the same level, to be in the best possible shape of my life, to have the best possible mental attitude for the Olympics if they do happen next year. Am I going to have that right kind of drive? I do worry about that a little bit alright.
“Like, I do really miss sailing right now. But there are definitely days when I find myself thinking, ‘Actually, it’s quite nice not to have to go out on the water every day’. And that also freaks me out! As in, maybe I’ll just get used to not going sailing and then I won’t want to go sailing when the time comes. It’s hard. When you’re not in the full thick of it, you realise how full-on it is.”
Still, she trains away. Every day. It might take until eight o’clock in the evening for her to go out into the garden for a gym session but she’ll get there. She’s not always sure why but even so, she hasn’t gone a day without training in almost eight weeks. Some of it is out of habit, some of it is jonesing for endorphins, some of it is just because she doesn’t know any other way.
“I think if I was to stop, I would be really miserable because I just wouldn’t be used to it. But then, some days I’m there and I’m like, ‘Why am I doing this?’ Sometimes I think it’s probably just peer pressure. There’s a virtual cycling app call Zwift. I did three and a half hours on Saturday morning and three hours on Sunday on it. And the only reason I kept on doing it was because I was cycling with other people.
“In my head I was going, ‘If I give up here, they’re going to be saying that Annalise The Olympian has just quit’. So I couldn’t quit. Even though 20 minutes into both sessions I just want to get off the bike. It’s actually awful. People presume I have this incredible level of fitness and stamina and like, ‘Aw, Annalise is able to do this no problem’. Meanwhile, the whole way through it I’m going, ‘Ugh, why am I here?’ And feeling like I can’t quit because then the others will go, ‘Why is Annalise quitting? If she’s quitting, I’m quitting’.”
There comes a time, all the same. You can train away every day but you can’t fool yourself that this is normality. Or that that your reaction to it should be to continue your regime as if you will automatically just be one year better, fitter, stronger when it’s all over. Experience is the name we give to our mistakes. She’s at it long enough now to know when and how to cut herself some slack.
“Something that I find really hard is, I’m not the right weight for Laser Radial. I’m always having to watch what I eat. This was something I had been working really hard on from last September up until the end of February, I was on a really good track and I knew that by the time I got to the Olympics, I was going to be the right weight to compete, the best possible weight I could be to be competitive across all the conditions. And now I’m like, ‘Well, I guess I can just eat cake for a while’.
“It was hard, those six months, it really was. Christmas dinner, I was just going, ‘I’ll just have a bit of turkey please’. And so part of me is going, ‘Oh, I don’t know if I want to have to go through another Christmas dinner like that. Am I going to have to do that all over again next year?’
“For me, it was really a case of what I was doing wasn’t sustainable. For me, at least, it wasn’t sustainable that I could keep that level of watching every single thing I’m eating and the entire time being a little bit hungry, which is how it was for me all the way through those six months. I couldn’t do it indefinitely, especially when there’s no real certainty over when the date is going to be.”
That’s the thing with pressing pause on your life – there’s no way of knowing when you’ll get back to it. In the meantime, you fill your days how you can. Train in the garden. Walk the dog. Invent a scone.
Whatever gets you through.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holy Shit, It’s Been 10 Years Since Kate’s Birthday Party In Adelaide Copped 72K RSVPs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remember when we could *checks notes* leave the house and see other people? Yeah, me neither. But today, I was reminded that this weekend marks the 10th anniversary of quite possibly the most iconic party of all time: Kate’s Birthday Party in Adelaide.
Although we’d all love to throw a party this weekend, I can’t help but shed a tear for poor ol’ Kate Miller, who should be celebrating her birthday by throwing another quiet shindig with 72,000 attendees.
So, in lieu of the party our queen Kate deserves, I thought we could all take a little stroll down memory lane at the event that changed Facebook forever.
Facebook events are, and always have been, a great way to tell all of your mates about your upcoming gathering. But as we all know, you’ve gotta make that shit private or you’ll end up with a Kate’s Birthday Party saga on your hands.
It was Saturday May 1, 2010 in the city of churches and *really* big silver balls. What started out as a small gathering of friends turned into the hottest party in town at “Our Apartment,” or so it seemed.
The event was created on April 24, 2010 by serial online prank king David Thorne (under the alias of our queen, Kate Miller). According to SMH, the event amassed a whopping 5,000 attendees within 10 minutes, growing to 60,000 within 24 hours.
By the time Thorne unveiled the event as his latest hoax, a staggering 72,000 people had clicked “attending” to the local Adelaide shindig. The huge virtual crowd even prompted IRL police officers to stand by on Adelaide’s North St in preparation for a riot-sized group, the Adelaide Advertiser reported at the time.
But despite the hefty guest list, only a handful of people actually tried to attend Kate’s Birthday Party, which hits painfully close to home for many of us who have tried to throw a party.
But it turns out the whole thing was David Thorne’s way of teaching us all that you’ve got precisely fuck all privacy on social media.
Before the days of Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All Of Us, there was Kate’s Birthday Party, the original meme Facebook event.  Ahh, if only David knew that we’d still be “attending” dumb meme events like the Area 51 Raid and Wall Of Death When The Veronicas Play Untouched At Good Things (which turned out to be a real thing) a full decade later.
Kate’s Birthday Party will go down in history. One day, your grandkids will sit down in front of your rocking chair and ask you to recite the story of where YOU were on the eve of the infamous Kate’s Birthday Party.
Happy Birthday Kate (David Thorne), here’s hoping you can knock back a few cold ones on Hindley Street soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jack Knox: Cancer-stricken mom feels the love and runs a marathon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dozens of hand-made signs dotted the 10-kilometre trail ringing Elk and Beaver lakes Friday.
“You can do it.”
“Run, Lise, run.”
“You’ve got this, Lise”
“Feel the love.”
Then there was the edgier “[Bleep] Trump” with the U.S. president’s name crossed out and the word “cancer” written in.
Right, that’s why Lise Berube was running down this path. The 38-year-old mother of two has stage-four cancer, just finished five rounds of radiation on her brain and is soon to start a new combination of chemotherapy drugs — a good time, she reasoned, to attempt her first full marathon.
She completed it, too, four laps of the lakes plus a couple of kilometres to bring the distance to the regulation 42.2 km. Actually, they misjudged things a bit, so when Berube hit the makeshift tape held by her children Benoit, 6, and Maelle, 4, she and good friend Grace Lore had run 44.4. Berube said those last two kilometres hurt the most.
But then, fate has given her experience with hurt. The question is: How does a young mother, or anyone, respond with such a life-affirming effort when struck by the kind of random cruel blow that would cause many of us to crumble?
Berube, who works for Island Health, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016. At the beginning of 2019, she discovered the disease had metastasized to her heart and lungs. The diagnosis came after Berube, who describes herself as a casual recreational runner, had completed a couple of half marathons in the fall. “I noticed in the second one that my breathing was laboured. That was my first inkling that something was off.”
More tough news came at the end of this February, when a CT scan showed a progression of cancer in her lungs and spots on her brain. Her response was to ask Lore to join her in signing up for October’s Goodlife Fitness Victoria Marathon.
“I googled ‘how to run a marathon’ and printed off a training schedule.”
Last Sunday, a combination of coronavirus uncertainty and the trajectory of her treatment caused Berube to change plans.
“I don’t know how I’ll be feeling after the next round of chemotherapy drugs,” she said.
As it is, she has good days and bad.
So, instead of the big fall marathon, she and Lore would run their own race Friday, using it as a fundraiser for the Callanish Society, a small Vancouver-based non-profit that supports people living with and dying from cancer. Sure, said the ever-game Lore, who called the chance to spend trail time with her friend “a gift.”
It was a COVID-rules marathon, just Berube and a 10-feet-away Lore, with a couple of friends joining for parts of the route. Other friends posted those trailside signs (given the demographic of their peer group, many of the messages were on flattened diaper boxes) but then mostly stayed away.
Park users who stumbled across the run were gobsmacked when they learned what was happening.
“That’s so heartbreaking and inspirational,” a young mother said, putting into words what many were feeling.
In the end, Berube found the marathon hard, but easier than expected.
“Definitely easier than living with stage-four cancer.”
The post-run scene was pure joy, a scattering of distanced onlookers cheering as Berube beamed happily, Maelle in her lap, family dog Lucky licking her face while husband Chris Brandt found her a bottle of water.
Victoria Goodlife Marathon race director Cathy Noel, who had caught wind of Friday’s run, showed up with medals for the runners.
Having blown past the initial goal of raising $4,200 for Callanish, Berube reset the target to $42,000; the total had topped $30,000 by the time she had completed the marathon distance in a highly respectable time of four hours, 23 minutes. (To learn more and to donate, go to callanish.org.)
What an accomplishment for someone who says that even three months ago, she had no desire to tackle a full marathon. That she chose to do so, to respond this way, didn’t shock her husband, though.
“I wasn’t surprised at all,” said Brandt. “It fits.”
Lore spoke in similar terms: “She’s bold and courageous and positive and energetic and she’s like that in all aspects of her life.”
Berube herself paused a second before saying why she chose this path: “It’s about doing what you can while you have the time to do it, and appreciating your life while you have it, and just going for it while you can.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Let's Revisit The Seven-Minute Workout</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first time I heard of the Seven Minute Workout, I thought it was a great idea. But then I did it, and couldn’t hang. On paper it looked too easy, and yet the side planks at the end were killer. I didn’t keep up with it, even though it was designed to give you a day’s exercise in just a few minutes, enabling everyone to stay fit with a simple routine.
This month in the Lifehacker Fitness Challenge, we’ll be revisiting classic home workouts from Lifehacker’s history. The Seven Minute Workout was a blockbuster hit of 2013, first published in the May/June issue ACSM’s Health and Fitness Journal and brought to the public consciousness by a New York Times article shortly afterward.
The NYT explained that this workout “essentially combines a long run and a visit to the weight room into about seven minutes of steady discomfort—all of it based on science.” A hack was born.
So I tried it again today. I’m stronger now than I was in 2013, so I was secretly hoping I’d be better at the workout than when I first tried it. It was a bit easier, yet still frustrating in many ways.
Let’s say you’re trying to do 30 seconds of push-ups. If you can do, say, 15 pushups, you might find yourself at muscular failure before the timer is up. Do you get to rest for the rest of the time? Or should you push yourself to squeeze out a few more reps? The timing was still a bit odd.
The whole workout felt challenging on my upper body and core, but light on the legs. 30 seconds of lunges and a 30 second wall sit are nowhere near the effort level of 30 seconds of push-ups and 30 seconds of dips. The authors of the workout are both men, and I can’t help thinking that if it were designed by women or by a mixed-gender team, it would be more balanced for those of us with less upper body muscle.
I know some people love the idea of short workouts, but I have a major gripe with them: If something’s gonna make me sweat, I’m going to want to change into workout clothes, including a washable sports bra. So then add five minutes of changing clothes to either end of the seven-minute workout, and maybe even a shower. With all that, the short duration of the workout just makes me feel silly, not efficient.
But maybe that’s just me. So, tell me: if you tried the Seven Minute Workout back in the day, did you stick with it? If you’re a devotee, I want to hear why you love it. And whether you’ve tried it before or not, what do you think of it now?

    <h5 class="mb-1">I am not a born composer: Playback singer Shreya Ghoshal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Shreya Ghoshal's singing is always on point. But not many know that there's also a composer in her.
Just before the coronavirus lockdown in India in March, she had unveiled a single "Nah woh main".
"I was thinking of releasing it later but I was not sure how long the lockdown would go on, so I just released it on my YouTube channel. It's co-composed by me and my brother," Shreya told IANS.
She wants to use the lockdown days to create more content for her YouTube channel.
Watch the video here:
"I am trying to work on some stuff. It takes a little while to crack a good song. I am not a born composer, I am more of a singer than a composer. I do have a lot of projects that are coming to me -- some nice compositions from friends -- so, I am collaborating with people and I am ideating," she said.
"I have always wanted to create something that I want to sing. I don't always want to depend on a film. Film songs are limited to the story or the setting of the film," added the "Teri ore" hitmaker.
She doesn't have a preference when it comes to the genre of songs.
"I am as fluid as one can think of. The kind of music I listen to is quite versatile. I don't limit myself. But I like slightly challenging songs," said Shreya.
Sharing an example, she said: "'Ghar more pardesiya' from 'Kalank' was a tough song to sing. It's a dance song but all the 'harkat' and nuances were there. It also had to sound cinematic. It was a challenging song. I hope these kind of songs happen more. Whether it is classical or not, it should be challenging."
She is also keeping the artiste in her alive during these tough times by doing virtual concerts.
She recently participated in YouTube's One Nation initiative that saw over 75 music artistes and Indian YouTube creators uniting for a live concert.
"Everyone is at home, their morale is down. It's been over a month of lockdown. We needed to do something to cheer up people. Also, we are raising funds. I want to help as much as possible. A lot of underprivileged people are there who need a lot of support. This is for that and also to bring a smile on a lot of faces," she said.
"By doing this, I am also keeping myself happy. There was a time when I felt 24 hours were less in a day, now I feel there is so much time and less to do. So doing virtual concerts keeps people positive," she added.
She has learnt a new skill too!
"I think my cooking skills have definitely improved. I have been experimenting in the kitchen. Some dishes have turned out to be very successful. So I pat my shoulder. I have made some really tasty stuff," she said with a laugh.
Household chores have been keeping her occupied, too.
"Although I am saying that I have a lot of time, the fact remains that most of the day goes in doing the household chores. And it is difficult. So from cleaning to cooking to keeping the house tidy, I am doing it all.
"Some form of home exercises keep me occupied, too. I watch news regularly, a lot of people are affected in this pandemic. I am trying to do my bit by actively trying to help out the needy through donations," said Shreya.
She hasn't given much thought to what she will immediately do once the lockdown is over, but there's one thing that she's missing a lot.
"I want to see my country. I want to travel. I miss going to the airport," she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: World sport may have ground to a standstill because of the coronavirus pandemic but 160 athletes will take part in a virtual shot put competition on Saturday.
One of them, British champion Sophie McKinna, has been hard at work in her back garden.
Using a portable circle and feedback from her coach via a video link, McKinna says that she has been able to train pretty much as normal, despite the country being in lockdown.
""I've got my portable circle that I put down and throw in," said McKinna, whose personal best is 17.97 metres.

"I'm quite positive mentally, because I can still train. If I couldn't it would be a different story."
This weekend's Valhalla Virtual Shot Put Competition will include an elite head-to-head as McKinna and British men's champion Scott Lincoln take on top under-20 athletes Lewis Byng and Serena Vincent, with that duel to be streamed live.
"It will be like a normal competition, we don't know when we will be able to compete again so this is like a mock-up," she said. "It will be a bit of fun."
Entries for the event, backed by athletic equipment supplier Neuff, have come from as far afield as New Zealand, South Africa and Costa Rica with throwers ranging from under 13s to over 70s.
And if you don't have a shot? No problem.
"There are so many athletes who don't have their own implements," former discus thrower Paul Wilson, who runs the Valhalla Throws Academy and thought up the virtual event, says.
"What I have suggested to these people is, just throw a tin of beans or, if you're in a park, find a rock!"
Participants can throw at any time of day on May 2 but the elite competition will start at 1300 GMT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crime Week: Professor marks her tale of triple murder...but it all seems too realistic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Before we begin, I want you to know that I never meant to kill Joyce. It was an accident. Claire, on the other hand – her I really did mean to kill.’
Leonard sat back in his chair and stared at the sheet of paper in his hands: A4, double spaced, Times New Roman 12 point, exactly the same as every other submission from his students.
Well, except for that idiot David Fettes, who always insisted on using Comic Sans and was in for a nasty surprise when the end-of-term marks came in.
No, the formatting was nothing unusual.
And while it was solid enough, as opening paragraphs go, that wasn’t what made the air thicken in his small shared office. It was the words.
Well, two of them, anyway.
His eyes flicked to the framed photograph, sitting in the corner of his clean and clear desk. Claire grinning for the camera, wearing a red silk shirt and blue jeans, golden hair curling around her heart-shaped face like a halo.
Joyce sitting on her lap, gazing up with the kind of rapt adoration that only a three-year-old can muster, scruffy old bear clasped to her dungareed chest.
Dickinson’s furry head just visible, poking around Claire’s leg, tongue lolling out.
‘Before we begin, I want you to know that I never meant to kill Joyce. It was an accident. Claire, on the other hand – her I really did mean to kill.’
“Leo? Hello? Are you OK?”
Leonard blinked. Raised his nose and frowned down it at the obese Neanderthal slouched at the room’s other desk. “I beg your pardon?”
Little beige flecks of biscuit nestled in the thicket of Andrew’s beard, dark curly hair pulled back in a ponytail.
The kind of forehead you could crack walnuts on. His half of the office was the antithesis of Leonard’s – piled high with unmarked coursework, abandoned mugs evolving their own ecosystems, waste bin overflowing with the hollowed-out corpses of crisp packets and chocolate bars.
“Only you’ve been sitting there, staring off into space for about an hour.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Also, you look like someone’s stuffed a Tunnocks tasty caramel wafer up your Dictionary Corner.”
Puerile, toilet humour. But what else could you expect from someone who didn’t read Classics and English Literature at Oxford? Someone who didn’t even arrange his bookshelves by subject category, never mind alphabetically by author.
“I’m fine.” Leonard straightened his glasses. “Just been a long day.”
“Yeah.” Andrew stood, grunting as he stretched his full height, fingertips nearly touching the ceiling tiles as a slash of hairy belly appeared between the untucked T-shirt and his cargo pants.
 “I’m getting a coffee. You want anything? Picnic, Snickers, or the machine’s doing Topics now?”
“Which part of ‘allergic to nuts’ do you have a problem with?”
“Only being nice.”
“Four years, Andrew. Four years in this horrible little office and you still haven’t got it through your thick head that I – can’t – eat – nuts!”
A shrug. “Fair enough.” And Andrew scuffed from the room, humming something annoying as he went. Leaving blissful silence behind him as the door swung shut.
‘…I want you to know that I never meant to kill Joyce…’
Had to give whoever wrote that credit – as a piece of fiction it had definitely struck a resonant note in its reader.
Who had written it? There was no name on the cover sheet, and none in the header or footer. Just the rather unimaginative title: ‘Crime Fiction Short Story’ and a page number: ‘1 of 12’.
Hmm…
‘…I never meant to kill Joyce…’
Well, it wouldn’t hurt to check, would it?
He pulled out his mobile and called the house. Tapped his fingertip on the desk as the phone rang and rang and rang and—
His own voice: ‘You’ve reached the home of Leonard and Claire Woodburn-MacPhail, I’m afraid we can’t come to the phone right now, but you can leave a message after the beep.’
“Claire? It’s me, Leonard. Nothing urgent, but call me back.” Then, just to prove he had actually been listening to their marriage guidance councillor, “Please. Thank you.”
He placed the phone back in its cradle. Drummed his fingers a little more.
Perhaps a text?
Claire, I am just checking to see if you and Joyce have had a good day. I shall be a little late (marking), but am looking forward to seeing you both at dinner.
Send.
There, now no one could say he hadn’t made the effort.
Not that there was anything to worry about. After all, these short story assignments had been handed in yesterday, while Claire had been in rude health this morning – making boiled eggs and soldiers for him and Joyce, making sure Joyce took her vitamins and he took his pills, making what she thought was sparkling conversation about Sylvia Plath and Gwendolyn Brooks.
His wife and daughter had both been in rude health when he’d left for work this morning, so this was simply one of his students getting a bit too creative for their own good. No one had killed his lovely daughter or his … wife.
Poor, frustrated, stay-at-home, mother-of-a-small-child Claire. Never getting any of her own writing done.
Shame he’d had to take down the photos of when they’d got together, back when she was two stone lighter and gravity had yet to sink its claws into her ivory-pale skin.
But in these #MeToo days, the idiots from Human Resources insisted it sent out the wrong message when a professor had a relationship with a former student.
Good job they’d never found out about Leonard and Claire before she’d graduated with a first in Creative Writing – if you could call “Poetry” creative writing. And even better that HR didn’t know about any of the other students he’d ‘mentored’ before her. Or the ones since…
‘Of course, you’re probably wondering why I killed them.
I don’t blame you.
Well, Joyce was a mistake, like I told you. Wrong place, wrong time.
Claire took longer than I thought. I’d only just finished with her and when I looked up: there was Joyce. Angelic, lovely, sweet little Joyce, staring at me with her eyes stretched wide, mouth hanging open, that tatty old bear of hers dropping to the kitchen floor – limp as her mother’s corpse.’
Leonard licked his lips. Glanced at the framed photograph again.
Claire. Joyce. Their elderly Skye Terrier, Dickinson. There was something about Dickinson’s lolling tongue that … it … that big pink slimy slab, dangling out the side of his mouth. Bile fizzed at the base of Leonard’s throat. He washed it down with a swig of cold tea.
Shuddered.
Perhaps it wouldn’t be too much to give the home number another go? Not that he was worried. No, of course he wasn’t. Rational, sensible, intelligent men didn’t let things like this get to them. It was a work of fiction, that’s all.
God knows he’d done his best to dissuade the faculty from including a crime-writing module on the course, but apparently you had to give the students what they paid for, these days.
Because why celebrate all that was great and noble about proper literature when you could wallow in the lowest-common-denominator illiterate filth that filled supermarket bookshelves? What use were Nabakov, Faulkner, Hemingway, Woolf, and Salinger when all the unwashed masses wanted to read about were alcoholic policemen with a bitter ex-wife, a troubled past, and a penchant for cliché?
Still, no one could say he hadn’t tried to understand the genre, but how was anyone supposed to write the vile stuff if they hadn’t experienced it? Whatever happened to ‘write what you know’?
Madness.
Anyway…
He called the house again: ‘You’ve reached the home of Leonard and—’
Hung up.
Still no reply to his text.
But everything would be fine … wouldn’t it? It was just a story. A pointed one, admittedly, one that had managed to provoke a proper emotional response.
Mind you, if you thought about it, that only went to show how good a teacher he was. How well he’d done with this year’s students.
Just a shame the writer of this particular gem hadn’t channelled their creative energy into something a bit more … worthwhile. Something where – every – single – little – thing didn’t have to be resolved, tied off, and presented to the reader in a neat little package, as if they were morons.
Something where a little ambiguity could be left for artistic—
The office door bumped open and Andrew backed in, two mugs clinking together in one hand, a cardboard box secured with brown tape in the other, and a packet of Wotsits dangling from his clenched teeth. “Mmmnnnghh fnnngn, mmmnnnffff?”
Perhaps he should call Stephen and Michelle? They could pop over and make sure everything was OK. It wasn’t as if they had anything better to do, was it? Not now the grandkids were off to secondary school.
Andrew spat the packet of crisps out onto his own desk, then dumped the cardboard box on Leonard’s. About eleven inches square – big enough to hold a complete leather-bound set of Dickens.
“Zoë from Business Studies signed for it. Said some bike courier dropped it off for you at the main gate.”
He placed one of the mugs next to the box. “Even though you’re a grumpy arse.” Then flopped into his chair and swivelled it from side to side, his elephantine weight making the bearing squeak. “A ‘thank you’ would be nice.”
“Needing external validation of one’s actions is a sign of weak character. You should work on that.”
“Hmph!” Andrew stuck his beard in the air, turned, and went back to his marking.
Good.
Leonard found Stephen and Michelle in his contacts. Set it ringing. Pinned the phone between his ear and his shoulder as he turned the cardboard box around, so the address label was the right way up.
Prof. Leonard MacPhail
School of Critical Studies
Dundas University
Oldcastle
He weighed it in his hands. Heavy. Not this-has-got-rocks-in-it heavy, but heavier than it looked. No return address. Didn’t even have a job-label from the courier service. And it … smelled.
Hard to say what of, but something dark and familiar. Like the damp needle-strewn loam in the depths of a lonely forest. Somewhere no foot has strayed for a long, long time. Not since that horrible thing happened, leaving faint traces of copper behind.
‘Hello?’ A woman’s voice, wobbling a little as it crackled out of his mobile.
“Michelle, it’s Leonard. Can you do me a favour? I need to get hold of Claire and she’s not answering the phone. Any chance you could nip next door and give her a shout?”
‘Oh. I was in the middle of… Do you want me to do it now?’
Of course he did, daft old bat.
“Please, if that’s not too much trouble?” Not giving Michelle enough time to answer. “Thanks. Really appreciate it.”
A sigh. ‘All right. Hold on.’ Then some muffled crunching and thumping noises.
Back to the anonymous submission:
‘Strangely, the dog was the hardest one to kill. Isn’t that silly? Taking a human life should be the biggest challenge of all, but they were simplicity itself compared to the dog.
I would’ve let him live, I really would, but he made so much noise. Especially when I started … breaking the other two down into smaller bits.’
The ellipsis, creating a little hesitation, before ‘breaking’ was a nice touch, as if the narrator was troubled and ashamed at dismembering a woman and her child. To be honest, it was a bit more accomplished than the dross his students usually handed in.
More polished. Assured. But they clearly didn’t know the old adage about never killing a family pet in fiction. Things like that existed for a reason, especially when they were writing about killing his dog.
So whoever it was had just lost ten percent off their mark.
‘And I had to break them down, because it’s surprisingly difficult to send a whole human body through the post.’
Ah.
The cardboard box sat squarely on his desk, lined up with the edges. Eleven inches, by eleven, by eleven. Big enough for complete set of Dickens. Or something much, much worse…
‘Leonard?’ Michelle’s voice wobbled in his ear, shakier than ever, breathless, as if she was having a seizure.
“Is Claire—’
‘Leonard, there’s been a terrible… It’s… I have to call the police.’
He stat upright, mouth dry as ash. “Michelle? Where’s Joyce? Where’s my little girl?’
‘The living room. There’s blood and bits of dog and—’
The phone slithered from his clammy fingers, bounced off the desk and clattered to the floor.
Bits of dog.
Bits of Dickinson.
Andrew swivelled around in his chair. “Leo? You OK, man?”
Oh God, it was true. It was all true.
He grabbed the short story and flipped straight through to the end. Crime fiction’s only redeeming feature was its predictability: everything was always laid out and explained to the reader in the denouement.
The villain unmasked and brought to justice. Every loose end tied up tight as a tourniquet.
Leonard stared at the last page.
‘10 of 12’
There was a page missing. The last paragraph ended mid-sentence:
‘Because, you see, I’ve been planning this for a long, long time. You think you’ve got away with so much over the course of your life, but I know your dirty little secrets. I know what you did, because’
‘Because’ what?
Leonard turned the A4 sheet over, but there was nothing printed on the back. Perhaps it’d got jumbled up with the other submissions?
He dragged them out of his in tray, dumped everything on his desk and scrambled through the lot, tossing each on the floor in turn.
“Leo, come on, man, talk to me. You look like—”
“SHUT UP!”
There had to be a last page. But every story finished where it was supposed to: no extra sheets mistakenly stapled onto the end. Perhaps he’d thrown it out by mistake?
He dragged the bin out from beneath his desk and upended it all over the cheap laminate, straightening out the crumpled up sheets of paper. Memos, class register, minutes of the last faculty meeting. No page twelve.
“We’ve talked about this, Leo: you have to calm down.”
The class register! All he had to do was match up who’d written what with the list, and whoever was left over had to be the author of Crime Fiction Short Story.
Leonard snatched up all the other submissions from the floor and crossed the writer of each off in turn.
“Come on, Leo, talk to me. Please.”
They were all there. Everyone had handed in their assignment, even the idiot David Fettes.
That was why Crime Fiction Short Story seemed so much more accomplished than the others – it wasn’t written by one of his students. It was written by someone else. Someone who actually knew what they were doing…
He raised his head and there was Andrew, staring at him. Andrew with his three-book deal from a big London publisher. Andrew who only worked here two days a week, because he ‘enjoyed the challenge.’
“Leo?” Andrew pulled his chin in, making his beard stick up. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
Andrew who hadn’t come in till half eleven, even though he was meant to have one-to-one tutorials all morning. Andrew who knew Leonard was allergic to nuts, but kept trying to make him eat them.
“Leo, you need to breathe, OK?” Both hands out. “It’s going to be—”
The mug was hot against Leonard’s palm, then it flew, shattering against the wall beside Andrew in an explosion of sweet-bitter coffee. Was that hazelnut? Did Andrew put hazelnut syrup in his coffee?
“JESUS!” Andrew uncurled, staring at the brown blood spatter as it dripped down the office wall. Then turned his stare on Leonard. “Enough, OK? That’s it.” Jabbing a finger at the mug’s jagged remains.
“You’re not supposed to come to work if you haven’t taken your medication!” Andrew grabbed his jacket and stormed out. “I’m going to HR!” Slamming the door behind him.
Medication?
But he was taking his medication.
Wasn’t he?
Leonard slid open his desk drawer. There, in the plastic tidy, among the pens and paperclips, was a scattering of little yellow pills. Had to be three, maybe four weeks’ worth. Had he been palming them again? Pretending to take them so Claire wouldn’t worry?
His eyes returned to the blood spatter coffee stain.
Dark red, spreading across the living room floor.
The wet thunk of a heavy blade cutting through flesh and bone.
That obscene pink tongue, lolling.
Ah…
Right. Of course.
His mobile buzzed at him from the carpet: a new text message coming in.
Claire:
Leonard you have to come home now!
Someone’s broken into the house! They did HORRIBLE things to Dickinson, Joyce is distraught!
Come Home!
Yes, he should go home.
But there was something he had to do first.
Leonard called up his Documents folder and navigated through to the short story he’d been fiddling with for the last week and a bit. Deleted it. Picked up the nine pages of Crime Fiction Short Story, folded them in half, and slipped them into his jacket pocket.
He hadn’t killed Claire and Joyce after all. That’s why he couldn’t finish it. Rule number one of creative writing: write what you know.
Leonard laid a hand on top of the cardboard box with no return address. “Good boy.”
Then turned and walked out of the office.
It was time to get working on the second draft.

    <h5 class="mb-1">British champ ready for virtual shot put showdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World sport may have ground to a standstill because of the coronavirus pandemic but 160 athletes will take part in a virtual shot put competition on Saturday.
LONDON: World sport may have ground to a standstill because of the coronavirus pandemic but 160 athletes will take part in a virtual shot put competition on Saturday.
One of them, British champion Sophie McKinna, has been hard at work in her back garden.
Using a portable circle and feedback from her coach via a video link, McKinna says that she has been able to train pretty much as normal, despite the country being in lockdown.
""I've got my portable circle that I put down and throw in," said McKinna, whose personal best is 17.97 metres.
"I'm quite positive mentally, because I can still train. If I couldn't it would be a different story."
This weekend's Valhalla Virtual Shot Put Competition will include an elite head-to-head as McKinna and British men's champion Scott Lincoln take on top under-20 athletes Lewis Byng and Serena Vincent, with that duel to be streamed live.
"It will be like a normal competition, we don't know when we will be able to compete again so this is like a mock-up," she said. "It will be a bit of fun."
Entries for the event, backed by athletic equipment supplier Neuff, have come from as far afield as New Zealand, South Africa and Costa Rica with throwers ranging from under 13s to over 70s.
And if you don't have a shot? No problem.
"There are so many athletes who don't have their own implements," former discus thrower Paul Wilson, who runs the Valhalla Throws Academy and thought up the virtual event, says.
"What I have suggested to these people is, just throw a tin of beans or, if you're in a park, find a rock!"
Participants can throw at any time of day on May 2 but the elite competition will start at 1300 GMT.
Vinco Sport will stream the action live at https://www.runjumpthrow.com/live/42748

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Whitington's TV pick of the week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The post-Office work of Ricky Gervais seems to divide fans along bitterly partisan lines. The Office (co-written with Stephen Merchant) was a masterwork, no question, a kind of drab symphony of English awkwardness that made you love a banal, talentless, egotistical middle manager and made you cry, too, from time to time. When Ricky made The Office he was 40-odd, and had been knocking around in bands and on obscure radio shows for years. Suddenly, he was a star, and the big question was, what would he do next?
He did Extras, which I rather liked, set in the eternally eclipsed world of TV and film extras doomed to flutter hopefully in the orbit of actual stars. He did Life's Too Short, an observational comedy that didn't really work; followed by Derek, a rather touching comedy about a naive animal lover who still lives with his mother; and he made a couple of very decent high-concept films -The Invention of Lying, and Cemetery Junction. And, of course, he became the disruptor in chief of Hollywood smugness as recurring host of the Golden Globes.
In all his work is a dark streak underlying misanthropy, and never more so than in After Life, season one of which led to angry disagreements. In it, Ricky played Tony Johnson, a features editor of a local newspaper who vows to take revenge on the entire world when his beloved wife dies of cancer. He goes around saying terrible things to innocent passers-by, even throwing the 'C' word at an unfortunate kid, but his efforts to spread unhappiness are constantly thwarted by the decency of ordinary people.
Season two sees him still grappling with grief and facing impending unemployment but at least contemplating becoming a better person. It's dark stuff, for sure, and not everyone likes it. When I interviewed Stephen Merchant a few months back, he told me that Ricky never really cared about being successful or becoming famous. In other words, he does what he wants: you like it or you don't, but either way there's only one of him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People Recap: Look at All the Lonely People</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In another interesting deviation from the book, Connell is not just going to therapy but is actually getting something out of therapy. I, for one, think this is great! Everyone on this show should be in therapy. Niall, the allotted one (1) decent human being in Connell’s friend network (Marianne’s is Joanna), suggested it, when two months out from a massive trauma Connell was still not sleeping or feeling well. 
Rob, Connell’s friend from high school who never left their hometown, killed himself on New Year’s Eve. Though Connell was home for the holidays, it doesn’t seem like the two got together, and at midnight Connell was kissing Helen, who walked home later in this soft pink hat to further establish her brand as Not Marianne. 
Over the course of the episode, in the spare but warm office of this therapist, Connell starts to peel back the layers of his misery. Though this bout of deep pain and sorrow was set off by Rob’s death, Connell admits that he has not been happy, really, since leaving home and getting to Trinity; that he is lonelier than ever and yearns for this time and place in his life to which he knows he can never return; that he thought college would make everything better and bring him around “like-minded people” but instead he has met almost no one he can talk to or even really like. (I do wonder, what ever happened to those friends Niall had over, the first night Connell started socializing? Marianne ran in an insufferable rich-kid crowd that was never going to accept Connell as one of their own, but they aren’t the only students at Trinity. But I guess to Connell the orbit around Marianne is the only one worth occupying.)
Connell brings Helen home for the funeral, not really because he wants to, which becomes extremely apparent from the jump. He doesn’t introduce her to anyone. He doesn’t refer to her as his “girlfriend.” As they walk into church I must note I am finding the score in this episode kind of excessive. Don’t know that we really need this level of dramatic sad piano to get the vibe. It’s a funeral for a 21-year-old; pretty sure we know it’s tragic. 
When Connell sees Marianne he blurts out her name and drops Helen’s arm like he wishes she didn’t exist. They wrap themselves in a deep, closed-eyes hug that almost makes my arms ache. (COVID life, week six: I miss people so much!!) I know this is inappropriate but I laughed a little bit when Helen went over to tap Connell out of the hug and then, like, barnacle herself to his arm with her entire body. 
That night, trapped in Connell’s twin bed, Helen asks why Connell behaved like he didn’t want her to be there. And I mean, I see her totally valid points but also … maybe the night of his friend’s funeral is not the time? “If you didn’t want me to come, you shouldn’t have asked me,” she says, to which he replies, “I’m sorry I asked you then.” Ooof, I’m sure that’s just the answer she was looking for. This is an interesting fight because they are both right, but also Connell is being willfully obtuse about her obviously legitimate concerns regarding his “friendship” with Marianne. This is the place their fights always go. Of course it is. Helen wants to know why Connell is “weird” around Marianne, but Connell insists that is his “normal” personality, which would suggest he is his weird, untrue self around Helen. I’m sure they’ll both be getting a grand night’s sleep hating each other in that twin bed. 
In the weeks that follow, Connell sits by himself in class. Sounds swirl and screech in his brain. Helen breaks up with him. Which is fair! Again with the timing, but all her points are valid and Connell can’t even muster the strength to fight her on it, or get out of bed to look her in the eye while she graciously frees him from a relationship his heart was never really in. 
Over Skype, Marianne says she is sorry to hear they broke up. OKAY. Connell needs to sleep so Marianne tells him to just bring the laptop to bed and she’ll watch him sleep on Skype. Yup, just a super appropriate friendship with boundaries! Connell does not know how to describe Marianne to his therapist but he does infuse the words “we went to school together” with that intense power of “we dug coal together.” THIS is when we finally learn Marianne is only away for a year, which is information I could’ve used an episode and a half ago, but here we are. 
Pretty much all my stars for this episode’s review go to Paul Mescal’s performance as Connell has a breakdown explaining to his therapist — and really says out loud to anyone for the first time — how disappointed he is in how his life is turning out. Sobbing, he says he came to Trinity “thinking I could have a different life. But I hate it here. And I can never go back because those friendships are gone and Rob is gone and I can’t see him again. I can’t get that life back.” 
Connell walks out and it does seem a little brighter outside, no? He is taking some deep breaths and telling Marianne on Skype about how he went to therapy. She is supportive and admits to petty rage at the performative grief of their classmates who are writing messages on Rob’s Facebook wall. Hearing about this makes Connell smile for the first and only time this episode.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'The Wax Pack' chronicles baseball card-fueled road trip</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) - Brad Balukjian tore open a pack of 1986 Topps baseball cards, chewed the stale, brittle bubblegum and then planned a road trip most sports fans could only dream about.
The college biology professor set out to meet every player whose image appeared on those old pieces of cardboard - from Garry Templeton to Rick Sutcliffe to Carlton Fisk - and see what life after baseball has been like.
“Whether it’s musicians or artists or baseball players, I’m just fascinated by what happens when they’re done after the spotlight,” Balukjian said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “I always wanted to do something about those guys I grew up with. And I saw the pack as the perfect device to get a random sample of players from that era.”
The self-funded trip in 2015 cost about $8,000 and took him and his 2002 Honda Accord across 30 states over 11,341 miles in 48 days - fueled by 123 cups of coffee. What Balukjian learned is vividly documented in his recently published book, “The Wax Pack,” which has quickly become a favorite among baseball-hungry fans during the coronavirus pandemic.
“When I actually started doing the trip and talking to these guys, that’s when it really became something a lot bigger,” Balukjian said. “It was transcending baseball and talking about these bigger themes like what is our relationship like with fear, which is a universal question that we all deal with. Baseball players and athletes, in general, they have to master fear to be successful. Call it fear, call it anxiety, whatever you want to call it, it’s all fear.
“And the lessons that they passed on to me about what their relationship was like with fear, it’s something we can all benefit from.”
“The Wax Pack” journey began in 2014 when Balukjian was sitting in the upper deck of Oakland Coliseum watching an Athletics game and realized he wasn’t as familiar with the players on the field as he once was. As a kid growing up in Rhode Island, he followed the game religiously and baseball cards - boxes of them - provided easy links to his heroes on the field.
So, Balukjian ordered a few unopened packs of Topps cards on eBay from 1986, the first year he recalls collecting. The 15-card pack he picked included a mix of stars (Fisk, Sutcliffe, Dwight Gooden and Vince Coleman), solid players (Templeton, Lee Mazzilli, Steve Yeager and Gary Pettis) and non-stars - called “common” cards in the hobby - such as Rance Mulliniks, Randy Ready, Richie Hebner, Jaime Cocanower and Don Carman, Balukjian’s childhood favorite player. Also included were a checklist and the late Al Cowens, whose chapter is arguably the book’s most intriguing.
“I didn’t mix cards between packs because that would definitely be cheating,” Balukjian acknowledged. “Also, I didn’t keep opening packs until I got Don Carman because that would be kind of cheating, too.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Clapping the NHS is all very well, but with my sister on the frontline, I need to speak up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">My sister is a junior doctor in a big hospital. I don’t have much to say about how work has been for her during the coronavirus pandemic, because she tells me nothing about it. Or, to be more specific, she tells me things are “fine”. This is how things are with us. I’ve always held out my problems for all to see, dumping them on friends and any poor sod who happens to sit next to me on the train, like a dog presenting its latest kill from the garden. But my sister operates in a lower key, as my parents and I discovered when she casually mentioned one night in her early 20s that she had been held up at gunpoint a year or so ago. She hadn’t thought to tell any of us at the time, because she didn’t want to worry people and, honestly, she was fine.
So I don’t hear much about the goings on at hospital from her, but I don’t really have to: I read about them in my newspaper every morning. Even aside from the whole global plague situation, which would be a big enough portion on any doctor’s plate, there are the now notoriously dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE. I’d previously thought PPE was merely an acronym for Politics, Philosophy and Economics, one of those weird Oxford degrees studied by people who fantasise about running Britain one day.
And perhaps that’s what the people who run Britain thought, too, because they were rather cavalier about our supplies: we don’t need any more PPE – we’re already chock-full of those degrees! Except it turns out the other kind is quite useful and the government missed not one, not two, but three chances to bulk-buy it for healthcare workers. As a result, while EU doctors were getting £1.3bn of PPE this month, NHS staff were being told to make do with aprons and snorkel masks.
As I write, at least 100 NHS healthcare workers have died from coronavirus. By the time you read this, it will be more. Doctors are now forced to make an impossible decision: continue doing their job and risk infecting themselves and their families, or walk away from their patients and colleagues. This is not a choice those of us who are related to healthcare workers can make for them, as much as we would like to.
So what do we do, aside from lying awake at 3am, wide-eyed with the effort of trying not to think about worst-case scenarios? There are the rainbow paintings, of course, which my children duly made in the early days of lockdown and we hung in the front window, their aunt’s name written in the sky. And there’s the clapping – oh, the clapping. The first two weeks I enjoyed it, for the collective experience and the chance to check my neighbours are all OK. But as the news from hospitals has worsened, it has felt increasingly and pointlessly performative, something we all do because we don’t know what the hell else to do.
Maybe there is something more we can do, besides tweeting photos of ourselves applauding on our front steps. Wide awake at night, I often think of certain women, such as Rose Gentle and Susan Smith. You may not recognise their names, but they were a frequent presence in the media in the early years of this century. They lost sons in the Iraq war because, they said, the Ministry of Defence had failed to provide the British army with sufficient equipment. The Chilcot report later backed them up, saying that the armed forces had been put in danger due to “wholly inadequate” preparation, and the families successfully sued the MoD.
Is that where all this will end? Because anyone with a brain can see that this is a scandal unfolding in real time, and that where the government neglected one public sector, it is now neglecting another. Some 179 British servicemen were killed in the invasion of Iraq; we have already lost more than half that in the NHS – and doctors, unlike soldiers, are not called upon to risk death to do their job. Already the letters pages of newspapers are filled with messages from desperate families, terrified for relatives who went into healthcare in order to help others. And it’s up to the families – us, me – to speak for them, given that NHS workers are being warned by their employers not to speak to the media.
And so we stay at home, full of anxiety, knowing that whatever fears we have are nothing compared with what our relatives are going through on their daily rounds in hospital. We read the newspapers, and in our heads we are being ever so brave, proud of the risks our closest family members are taking. But in our hearts we desperately try to shut out the truth, and momentarily kid ourselves into believing our sisters, brothers, parents, children when they tell us that, honestly, everything’s fine.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EastEnders actor Adam Woodyatt has revealed he will be just as “rude and offensive” to people who bodyshame him in public.
Woodyatt, who has played Ian Beale on the BBC soap since its very first episode in 1985, said he “[tries] to avoid attention”, but does not mind engaging with fans if they are polite and kind.
However, a recent experience left him furious. He told ‘How Do You’ podcast: “One of the best examples of somebody being rude is when we were at BBC Good Food.
This woman looks at me and says, ‘You’re fatter than you are on the telly’. I said to her, ‘If I had said that to you, you could go to the papers and say I was being rude, this and that. I’m sorry, I don’t like the way you spoke to me’. She said ‘I didn’t mean it’ and went off.
Woodyatt continued: “A little while later a bloke leaned across the stand and literally patted my stomach and said, ‘You’ve put on some timber’.
“Because of what had happened with this woman, I turned around and said, ‘You’ve lost all your hair, haven’t you?’ and walked off.
“What gives somebody the right to say that to someone just because you’re on TV? If somebody comes up to you and they’re nice, I’ll be nice.”
He also urged fans to “have some manners” if they see him eating and to wait until he’s done before they ask for a selfie.
“If I’m having a meal, I’ll ask someone to wait until I’ve finished eating. At this point it usually turns to, ‘You’re just like your character, you’re rude’.
“Actually no, you’re the one who is being rude. You’ve come up and interrupted somebody while they’re in the middle of doing something.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Naked Cowboy still strumming amid coronavirus: ‘I’ve never missed a day’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’ll take more than a little pandemic to get the Naked Cowboy to put his clothes on.
The Times Square fixture is still strumming through the coronavirus — and even with far fewer tippers, he’s staying positive.
“I’ve never missed a day and I feel very fortunate to, just to have my routine, and my rituals,” the street performer, Robert Burck told Reuters on Friday.
“My message is – get out every day, do the most you can to keep up your passions and your instincts and the things you want to accomplish,” he said.
The Trump-supporting guitarist is covering up just a little more, though, donning a stars-and-stripes facemask to compliment his Trump 2020 stickers plastered over his instrument.
Burck said he at least doesn’t have to compete for attention in an eerily empty Crossroads of the World, the epicenter for the United States’ COVID-19 outbreak.
“Basically with so few people, I’m able to capture the attention of every single one of them. So it’s like there’s less people but [it’s great] just to be able to hit every single person and cheer them up and get them honking the horn,” he said.
As unemployment soars in New York and across the country, Burck felt confident a bounce-back was looming.
“These tough times actually build the character for the upcoming economy booming back and everything else.”
Like the buskers still lingering around Times Square, the crooks apparently are, too. A Florida nurse volunteering in the city had her cell phone swiped right out of her hands after she left her shift last weekend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Imogen has a heart of gold’ says proud mum as daughter supports charity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This young girl has brought some colour into her Suffolk neighbourhood by making rainbow friendship bracelets to raise money for the NHS.
Imogen Leeds is just nine but is already giving back to her community by fundraising during the coronavirus lockdown.
Her mum, Laura Collins, said it was all her daughter’s idea and said: “I wasn’t surprised when she said she wanted to do this.
“Everyone in the area has been so nice about it and they’ve all come along and bought some.
“Imogen has a heart of gold she really is the sweetest little girl and she makes me so proud – she is very thoughtful and thinks about others a lot.”
This is the first time the Needham Market youngster has done any charity work but she has already raised £70 towards her £100 target.
She is selling the bracelets for 50p each and leaves them in a tub at the front of the house for passers by.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What is ‘COVID toe’? Maybe a strange sign of coronavirus infection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Dr Lindy Fox, a dermatologist in San Francisco, used to see four or five patients a year with chilblains — painful red or purple lesions that typically emerge on fingers or toes in the winter.
Over the past few weeks, she has seen dozens.
“All of a sudden, we are inundated with toes,” said Fox, who practices at the University of California, San Francisco. “I’ve got clinics filled with people coming in with new toe lesions. And it’s not people who had chilblains before — they’ve never had anything like this.”
It’s also not the time of year for chilblains, which are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions. “Usually, we see it in the dead of winter,” Fox said.
Fox is not the only one deluged with cases. In Boston, Dr. Esther Freeman, director of global health dermatology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said her telemedicine clinic is also “completely full of toes. I had to add extra clinical sessions, just to take care of toe consults. People are very concerned.”
The lesions are emerging as yet another telltale symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. The most prominent signs are a dry cough and shortness of breath, but the virus has been linked to a string of unusual and diverse effects, like mental confusion and a diminished sense of smell.
Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called COVID toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. (COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.)
Several medical papers from Spain, Belgium and Italy described a surge in complaints about painful lesions on patients’ toes, Achilles' heels and soles of the feet; whether the patients were infected was not always clear, because they were otherwise healthy and testing was limited.
Most cases have been reported in children, teens and young adults, and some experts say they may reflect a healthy immune response to the virus.
“The most important message to the public is not to panic — most of the patients we are seeing with these lesions are doing extremely well,” Freeman said.
“They’re having what we call a benign clinical course. They’re staying home, they’re getting better, the toe lesions are going away.”
Scientists are just beginning to study the phenomenon, but so far chilblain-like lesions appear to signal, curiously enough, a mild or even asymptomatic infection. They may also develop several weeks after the acute phase of an infection is over.
Patients who develop swollen toes and red and purple lesions should consult their primary care doctor or a dermatologist to rule out other possible causes. But, experts said, they should not run to the emergency room, where they risk being exposed to the coronavirus or exposing others if they are infected.
“The good news is that the chilblain-like lesions usually mean you’re going to be fine,” Fox said. “Usually it’s a good sign your body has seen COVID and is making a good immune reaction to it.”
Patients who get the painful lesions are often alarmed. They appear most frequently on the toes, often affecting several toes on one or both feet, and the sores can be extremely painful, causing a burning or itching sensation.
At first, the toes look swollen and take on a reddish tint; sometimes a part of the toe is swollen, and individual lesions or bumps can be seen. Over time, the lesions become purple in colour.
Hannah Spitzer, 20, a sophomore at Lafayette College who is finishing the academic year remotely at her home in Westchester County, New York, has lesions on all 10 of her toes, so uncomfortable — painful during the day, and itchy at night — that she can’t put anything on her feet, not even socks.
Walking is difficult, and she has trouble sleeping. “At first I thought it was my shoes, but it got worse and worse,” Spitzer said. “Most of my toes are red, swollen, almost shiny. It looks like frostbite.”
She has used hydrocortisone and Benadryl to alleviate the discomfort, and said ice is also helpful. Doctors say the lesions disappear on their own within a few weeks.
Adding to the mystery is that some teens and young adults with the lesions have tested negative for the coronavirus.
Dr Amy Paller, chair of the department of dermatology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said one possible explanation is that these patients had such a mild disease and that viral replication was limited, making the virus undetectable.
Another possibility, she said, is that the lesions are what is called an epiphenomenon — a symptom may accompany a disease without being causally related. For instance, perhaps more people are developing the lesions because they are staying inside and walking around barefoot more than usual.
But she also dismissed that idea as highly unlikely. “I don’t think that’s it — I think it’s a mild inflammatory process manifesting in this way,” Paller said. “It’s a real phenomenon. We don’t really understand it at all.”
Spitzer had a test shortly after developing the lesions, and the result was negative, but she is convinced the toe lesions are a delayed response to an earlier infection that was so mild she barely noticed it.
“I’ve never had anything like this,” she said. “It’s completely new.”
A recent paper by doctors in Spain, published in the International Journal of Dermatology, described six cases of patients with toe lesions and included pictures of the chilblain-like bumps that patients had emailed to their physicians.
Most of the patients were teens or young adults, including one 15-year-old who found out he had COVID-19 pneumonia when he went to the emergency room seeking medical attention for his toes.
Another patient was a 91-year-old man who had been hospitalized with the coronavirus three weeks earlier, and had recovered and returned home.
While dermatologists say it’s not unusual for rashes to appear along with viral infections — like measles or chickenpox — the toe lesions surprised them.
Other problems like hives have also been linked to the coronavirus, but COVID toes have been the most common and striking skin manifestation.
Patients with viral infections often get a pink bumpy rash called morbilliform, or hives, Fox said, but added that the toe lesions were “unexpected.”
The toe cases make up half of all reports filed by skin doctors around the world to a new international registry started by the American Academy of Dermatology, which is tracking the complications.
No one knows exactly why the new coronavirus might cause chilblain-like lesions. One hypothesis is that they are caused by inflammation, a prominent feature of COVID-19. Inflammation also causes one of the most serious syndromes associated with the coronavirus, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Other hypotheses are that the lesions are caused by inflammation in the walls of blood vessels, or by small micro clots in the blood. (Clotting has been another feature of the disease.)
The lesions seen in otherwise healthy people appear to be distinct from those that doctors are seeing in some critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care, who are prone to developing blood clots.
Some of these clots may be very small and can block the tiny vessels in the extremities, causing rashes on the toes, said Dr. Humberto Choi, a pulmonologist and critical care physician at the Cleveland Clinic.
Some experts now believe COVID toe should be recognized as sufficient grounds for testing, even in the absence of other symptoms.
“This should be a criteria for testing, just like loss of smell, and shortness of breath and chest pain,” Fox said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Attenborough gives humankind one last chance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rocking in my rocking chair – which is what they’re for – I looked out through the branches of the big willow tree and there, framed in a distant triangle of twigs, our neighbour’s children were out-rocking me on their garden swings.
On the television in the corner, Andrew Marr was quizzing David Attenborough about his latest, perhaps his last, and undoubtedly his most passionate film, A Life on Our Planet. It frames his view of humankind’s “last chance” at living on Earth.
“Our lot,” said Attenborough (93), “are finished anyway. “It’s up to the young to do things better.”
“Some people,” Marr offered, “think that Covid-19 could be the reckoning the human world deserves.”
Attenborough backed off from anything so biblical. He countered merely that a densely living, overpopulated species was much more susceptible to plagues.
His film, soon for Netflix, is apparently a properly terrifying catalogue of what we’ve been doing to the natural world. For all the years of brilliant films exploring and celebrating nature, he or his producers were slow to invite much public outrage about the darker destructions.
Attenborough’s recent Blue Planet II, with its nightmare of plastic in the ocean, was the one that really touched some anger. What, Marr asked, was the one bit of change that ordinary people could effect. “Waste!” was Attenborough’s explosive reply.
A breeze stirred the willow twigs and their first fringe of green. As the old tree drops her catkins, flushing fully into life, I’ll lose the playing children, along with the view of the mountain and the rising of the moon.
It’s quite a veteran as willows go, couched in the stream’s ravine, its elbows propped on the banks. Nowhere else on the hillside could it possibly exist, so safe from people, from sheep and the worst of storms.
But willows are everywhere on this soggy island – at least 18 kinds that botanists can divine, often with some difficulty. A tree that reached here naturally in perhaps six or seven forms has been added to by garden introductions and multiple hybridisations.
If we had to choose one as the national tree (as I think it richly deserves), it should probably be the common “goat” or “pussy’ willow, Salix caprea. Like the one in my painting, it is ablaze with yellow catkins in early spring. The “goat” stems from an early role as fodder, and the flowers still offer nectar to bumblebee queens fresh out from hibernation.
In the sort of little cameo captured by many readers alert to events in their gardens, Paul Dunne, of Lettermore in Co Galway, sent a photograph of ants perched on willow catkins and wondered how unusual this was.
They had climbed the tree, he surmised, for pollen or nectar. But the ascent of ants on willows, in particular, is a well-known phenomenon. The ants’ attraction is more usually for aphids, or rather, the sweet liquid known as “honeydew” exuding from their fundaments.
This sugary waste is extruded from the aphids’ extraction of sap in the willow’s youngest, most tender, shoots. Googling “ants on willows” offers a graphic Flickr close-up of ants in close attendance.
No aphids appear on Dunne’s catkins, but bluetits I see foraging along flowering twigs of our own willow confirm that they abound. A score or more of different species suck at the shoots of sallies in these islands, and since the salicin in willows converts to salicylic acid, a natural aspirin, one may wonder if both aphids and ants are seeking to be spaced out.
Of far more urgent consequence in the appetite of aphids is that of the grain aphid, Sitobion avanae. It sucks at the sap of spring-sown barley seedlings, barely greening the field, and flies around to spread the dreaded “yellow dwarf virus”. It is also evolving resistance to pyrethroids, the chemical ingredients of most modern pesticides.
Teagasc, the farmers’ oracle, has long encouraged “integrated pest management”. Its advice at the national tillage conference in January was to sow early and spray once “if warranted”.
For better news, my recent column on the reported decline of urban house sparrows brought many reassuring emails from readers with abundant chirping residents. This ties in well with the latest Big Garden Watch survey of the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
From returns by nearly half a million people in late January, the house sparrow was the most commonly seen (or, perhaps, readily recognised) garden bird. With new mild winters to help survival, the society hopes “that at least a partial recovery may be happening”.

RANT to grocery stores that don’t train their clerks well enough to ask customers to observe the 6 feet rule while waiting to have their groceries checked out. The customer behind me refused because he said no one dies from COVID-19 and laughed. Get real people. It is real.
RAVE to our seldom-mentioned social workers. Their position is very difficult. Helping so many get through this tough time. They work long hours, sometimes dealing with people who don’t have a place to go when they get sick and don’t understand social distancing. They are heroes too.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mum is making colourful face masks for Birmingham Children's Hospital staff after learning kids are becoming scared of the regular personal protective equipment.
Jo Higgins, from Bournville, was more than happy to do something for the hospital at Steelhouse Lane where she is a regular visitor due to the complex needs of her three boys, Kye, seven, Kori, 14 and Ethan, 17.
She took on the project after taking Kori last Thursday, this time with a broken wrist after he had been playing football in the garden.
Jo said: "We are shielding at the moment and my son was anxious about going and didn't want to go.
"But I said we'll put our masks on that I'd made at home and it'll be fine. When we arrived the staff were fantastic. They treated us like royalty.
"A couple of the nurses commented how colourful and fantastic the masks were. I had a snail on the front of mine. They said they were really child-friendly and asked if I had any more because the normal PPE is a bit scary for children.
"These can go over the top of the normal PPE and they just bring a bit more joy to them."
She added: "I just wanted to give something back in return for all their life-saving help and care over years with all my three boys."
Jo, who is also making NHS wash bags for a Bournville Covid-19 support group, has already put together more than a dozen items for the hospital.
But she is running low on material and appealed for anyone who wanted to help to donate things like elastic, ribbons and buttons.
Jo said she would be willing to pay for postage or arrange a local collection. If anyone wants to help they can email her at jojobournville@gmail.com

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who looked after Ellen DeGeneres at the 2014 Academy Awards has spoken out about the talk show host, saying that the experience of working with her was “kind of demeaning.”
Bodyguard Tom Majercak said that he was hired to guard Ellen, her mother and her wife Portia de Rossi at the ceremony, which she was hosting, and at events before and after.
He told Fox News that he has worked with a number of high-profile clients but that he did not find the talk show host to be especially friendly.
“Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to – and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities – that has never taken the time to say hi to me,” he said.
He said that he and Portia de Rossi carried on a pleasant and friendly conversation but that things “started going negatively” when he spoke to the host. He continued:
He claimed that he was inspired to say something about his experience after seeing various stories about Ellen circulating online in recent months:
Dutch beauty YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, otherwise known as NikkieTutorials, recently spoke about her own experience on Ellen’s show, calling her “cold and distant.”
Let’s also never forget this iconic interview with Dakota Johnson, in which the pair squared off about whether the hos was or was not invited to Johnson’s birthday party:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mother and blogger, Molly DeFrank, has managed to do what a lot of parents haven’t yet: limit her children’s screen time to a bare minimum. She backs her decision and the effects of it with surprisingly strong positive results that prove that the less your kids spend in front of a screen, the better it is for their health.
Bright Side is here to show you this story so you can see that it really does work. And as a bonus, we have a list of guidelines for children’s media use at the end of the article.
Molly saw that her children were too consumed by their devices and decided to take action. She wrote, “My precious babies were acting like Demogorgons.”
According to her, even a 1-hour limit was still muting her kids’ creativity, causing grumpiness, fighting, and whining. So she and her husband decided to pull the plug completely. After some protesting, her children finally moved on.
What initially had started as a 30-day screen detox has become a lifestyle change in her home of 5 children under the age of 10. Molly has created a plan of how to take screens out of children’s lives. It consists of 5 steps that have already been proven to work.
According to Molly, quitting screens was surprisingly easy and her 9-year-old daughter had told her that she was actually glad they had been cut out of her routine. Furthermore, her daughter has advanced 5 reading levels in just 7 months and is able to read books faster than Molly can buy them, while her son has given the family art classes.
“My kids play together better, are more creative, more obedient, happier, and sleep better. Sure, they’re still human beings and can fight with each other like any siblings. But the change in their attitudes overall was instant, noticeable, and for the better,” she explained.
Kids can, indeed, live without Netflix, YouTube, and all their favorite videogames that they love to spend hours playing. Technology is, of course, very useful, but we need to teach our kids to not become dependent on them and obsessed. Molly’s children are proof that your kids can be happy without being on their devices all day long. And not only that — they’ll actually benefit from it!
In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatricsannounced a list of recommendations that can help you do what Molly did.

“You Are the Champions” was released early Friday on all streaming and download services, with proceeds going to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.
“I thought, this is a great way to use the legacy that we have to do some good in the world,” May said. “You know, we don’t really need to make money anymore. We don’t need to be any more famous. We need to use what we have in the best possible way.”
For May the release comes at a time of great sadness. The guitarist earlier this week lost a friend who he likened was like a brother to him, to the virus.
“That’s the closest it’s come to me physically,” he said, adding it’s given real meaning to the death tolls broadcast daily on television.
“Each one of those is a family tragedy,” May said. “Each one of those people lose a loved one. “I think psychologically the human race is going to be very damaged.”
For Taylor, the song also has personal significance as his daughter Rory Eleanor Taylor works as a doctor in a London hospital.
“She’s actually in the video with her little cards, displaying advice about isolating, etc.”
The music video shows caregivers and frontline workers from across the world as well as empty city scenes and the band performing in their homes.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe or fatal illnesses, including pneumonia.
Lambert, who joined the track from his Los Angeles home, thinks the song really hits a positive note that everyone is in this together.
“There’s a sense of unity that’s happening around the world, even though it’s, you know, in a negative, scary time,” Lambert said. “I think that we’re all understanding each other a little bit more right now. And it’s sort of leveling everything out a bit.”
“It’s only through our connection and our love for each other are we going to get through it together,” he said.The band hopes the charity single will provide some consolation after the pandemic forced them to cancel the 27-show UK and European leg of their biggest ever tour.
“It was pretty heartbreaking to have to let it go. We have rescheduled for next year and we’re all crossing our fingers. We don’t know do we? We don’t know if it’s going to be appropriate to get thousands of people in one room, even in 12 months from now,” May said.
Taylor remains optimistic that live music will survive.
“I can’t believe that festivals and live music won’t come back. It’s part of our … DNA really now.”In the meantime, Taylor and May remain in lockdown in their respective homes in the UK. Like many, May is struggling with the loss of freedom.
“It doesn’t get any easier as time gets on. It’s getting worse if anything. I feel like everything that I worked for in my life has been kind of taken away and put somewhere where I can’t reach it,” he said.
It’s not all bad, as Taylor noted.
“I think people have found lots of good things to do,” he said. “I think there’s been a lot more contact within families and friends.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Canadian doctors notice recent uptick in so-called COVID toes cases in children</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Toronto doctor is suggesting that parents look at their children’s feet to see if there are unusual lesions around the toes that could be a sign of possible COVID-19 infection.
Dr. Elena Pope, the pediatric dermatology section head at the Hospital for Sick Children, said there has been an uptick in skin presentations of this nature – so-called COVID toes – in otherwise asymptomatic kids over the last few weeks in North America.
“The kids are not really bothered by those lesions and I think that’s why it took a while for this to come to the forefront,” she said. “If they were not bothered by it, they maybe didn’t actually report it to their parents … most of the lesions disappear on their own. They fade over time.”
Pope said there have been some cases where fingers are affected as well. The lesions have a red or purple colour and look similar to frostbite.
The Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) issued a public health alert to clinicians this week, advising that these skin lesions should prompt COVID-19 testing. Pope and Dr. Irene Lara-Corrales, a pediatric dermatologist at Sick Kids, helped craft the alert.
“Over all I would emphasize that this seems to be an unusual manifestation in children who potentially have COVID infection and potentially are contagious at the time of the diagnosis, but they’re otherwise asymptomatic and that it seems to resolve spontaneously over several weeks,” Pope said.
Pope suggested that if lesions are discovered, virtual doctor care would be a good first step.
“From what we have gathered so far is the kids present with either itching or some mild pain in their toes associated with some swelling, and then they develop red or purple bumps that are persistent afterwards,” Pope said. “Very few of them may actually have skin breakdown.”
Definitive research in the area is still in the formative stages and specifics on case numbers have not been released. Registries have started around the world to track skin condition cases that may be connected to the novel coronavirus.
Pope said it was unusual to see such a significant uptick in similar skin presentations on a regular basis.
“I might see maybe less than five cases a year and nowadays we’re seeing many, many, many patients with this manifestation,” she said, speaking about the uptick here and in other countries.
They have decided that if the lesions are within the first two weeks of onset, it’s worth testing those patients for COVID-19.
“There have been case reports from other highly endemic areas of the skin manifestation in association with the positive swabs from COVID. And also, in some of the cases, there was evidence of antibodies. So in other words, there was evidence that the patients were exposed to COVID and had antibodies to the virus.
“So I think it’s fair enough to say that based on all those reasons, this is a true association with COVID. What is unusual about this presentation is that children are otherwise asymptomatic. So they don’t have the classic symptoms of COVID.”
Lesions may resemble chilblains or perniosis, a condition that doctors sometimes see in the spring when children are a little too eager to take off their boots and freeze their feet by wading in puddles of cold water, said Dr. Chantal Bolduc, a dermatologist at Universite de Montreal hospital centre.
“We are not sure it is a sign of COVID, but we think so because of the context,” Bolduc said. “We see a little more cases than usual, and cold temperatures aren’t a factor, and it’s happening at the same time as the pandemic.”
The majority of children showing the lesions don’t have a cough or a fever, she said.
“From what has been reported so far, this is something that seems quite benign. The children are not sick. It suddenly appears and it seems a little odd, the children are in good health, it goes away on its own in two to four weeks,” Bolduc said.
Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. They may also include cough, fever and shortness of breath.
“The good news for us is that the kids don’t seem to have any other major manifestations and they simply recover quite fast from this, so that’s reassuring,” Pope said. “But it would be important for us to understand more about the mechanism and why this is happening and why it’s happening primarily in children.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple is Doomed. No It Isn’t. Services Are Hot Stuff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Without further ado, let’s jump right into the week’s Apple news debris.
• With the COVID-19 virus taking its toll—and around for awhile—surely Apple is finally, assuredly doomed. Who will be able to afford its products? That’s the subject explored by Ben Lovejoy at m9to5Mac. “The ‘Apple is doomed’ messages are booming, but are entirely wrong.”
After discussing the issues and possible, challenging scenarios, author Lovejoy concludes:
In just two months, Apple has shown great business savvy, creativity and nimbleness. This thoughtful read helps us focus on what Apple is doing to adapt, innovate, and serve us.
• In that vein, I should note that Apple’s services have come along at just the right time. Jason Snell takes us through the numbers with a series of beautiful graphs. “Apple Q2 2020 results: $58B revenue, but no guidance.” Check out the 9th graphic for services.
• Here’s more good speculation on the Apple Watch 6 major features. Eventually the Apple Watch will have blood sugar monitoring. Combined with pulse measurement, ECG, SPO2 and sleep monitoring, it will truly be the killer wearable.
• Last week, I discussed HBO Max. Now, we’ve learned that “HBO Max Will Be Free for Hulu’s Current HBO Customers.”
• Peacock isn’t yet on Apple TV, despite this lurid headline. “How To Download and Sign Up For Peacock on Apple TV.” But it will be, so read up on this semi-click-bait, semi-useful article and hold your nose.
• Cybersecurity is a hot topic in education. Those skilled in it are just about guaranteed a job. So get your kids, being schooled at home, onboard. “This new cybersecurity school will teach kids to crack codes from home“. The subtitle tells it better. “Online initiative looks to inspire a new generation of cybersecurity talent to bring out their ‘digital Sherlock Holmes’ while schools remain closed.”
• Finally, this review of the Apple Magic Keyboard “changes the iPad all over again.” Ian Fuchs writes:
A little birdie told me that this evolution is not a planned effort destined to deprecate the Mac. Rather, it’s simply a response to what iPad oners have pleaded for. Finally.
Particle Debris is generally a mix of John Martellaro’s observations and opinions about a standout event or article(s) of the week followed by a discussion of articles that didn’t make the TMO headlines, the technical news debris. The column is published most every Friday except for holiday weeks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kelly Clarkson's Patience Is 'Being Tested' Amid Quarantine Life, News of Murder Hornets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kelly Clarkson is shaking her head along with everyone else stuck at home in quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic, especially with the news riddled with yet another thing to worry about in 2020: murder hornets.
The singer revealed that her dryer is broken and joked that she's been forced to hang her laundry outside to dry "like I'm living in Dr. Quinn Medicine Women times" on Twitter on Saturday (May 2).
"I feel like my patience and tolerance is being tested lately and, well, all I can say is I’m not thriving," Clarkson admitted before providing an update: "My stuff that’s drying outside just flew away with the wind HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh dear Jesus.... I’m officially saying goodbye to today and I’m gonna start fresh tomorrow."
"And now a new problem is “murder hornets,'" she quipped later, along with a meme of Seth Meyers saying "sounds about right."
The singer was talking about the Asian giant hornet, the deadly pest that has made its way to the United States for the first time and is making headlines this weekend. Nicknamed "murder hornets" by researchers, the insect can grow to two inches long and can "wipe out a honeybee hive in a matter of hours," according to the New York Times. Victims have said its potent venom and stinger feel like "hot metal driving into their skin."
On Friday, Clarkson announced that her postponed 'Invincible' residency in Las Vegas was now among the canceled concerts that will be pushed back further. The show was previously rescheduled to begin in July 2020 but will now take the stage in 2021. "There is just too much uncertainty going on right now, and we want to make sure everybody's safe and we want to make sure everybody can have a good time when you come see me in Vegas -- no one's worrying about anything," she said. "We should be good by then, right?"
Commiserate with Clarkson in her latest tweets below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rising Star Charles Lott Jr.: “Actors shouldn’t be afraid to stand up! If you see something wrong with our industry say something; cause awareness”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I had the pleasure to interview Charles Lott Jr. Charles is best known for his upcoming role in the feature film THE WAY BACK alongside Hollywood-veteran Ben Affleck. THE WAY BACK is set to premiere March 6, 2020. From early on, Charles Lott Jr. has been successful from his scene work, monologue performances, and modeling on the runway. In addition to national commercials and campaigns with Vitamin Water, Charles has booked roles in “Modern Family,” “68 Whiskey,” FORGIVENESS, and EXTRA CREDIT (2020).
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?
For the most part pretty good. I was raised in a two-parent household with all of my siblings. Of course, I’ve had some tough times in my life, but overall I eat every day, I have clothes on my back, and I have people around me that love me. If I have those things I feel as if I have nothing to complain about because there are so many people on this earth that will kill to have a life that I have.
Can you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?
It’s so crazy because I never tried to be an actor. My whole life I tried to make it in professional sports. I wanted to be a football player, I wanted to go to the NFL and be a first-round draft pick like most other boys that play the sport. I got signed to an agent and manager for a talent competition I won on accident and I still didn’t want to act. People have always told me that I should get into acting and that I was always a character. I always had a big personality and I should display that to the world but I wasn’t thinking big enough when my senior year started. I got a lot of injuries so college coaches stopped calling, and I didn’t know what to do. I called my dad and asked him what does he think if I got into acting again and he supported the whole way through. I never hated acting, I was just so caught up into the “football is life” thing and once my run was over I got more realistic, and I just wanted to be a kid. The acting was the better choice and the best choice I’ve ever made because I fell in love with it. I’m still mad to this day that I didn’t get into it earlier.
Can you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
It was a few weeks before Christmas. While we were shooting the movie, and Al Madrigal who is in the movie with me invited me to a Christmas party at his house. He told me out of all the kids in the group that he only invited me and don’t tell any of the other kids, so I didn’t. He also invited some of the older guys from the set. I got a ride with my co-star Jeremy Radin and we went into the house together. Madrigal’s house was extremely huge and elegant. I noticed very quickly I was the only black person in the party. Jeremy and I walked out into Al’s big and ginormous backyard, and I told him, “Man I’m the only black dude in an all-white party this feels like I’m in the movie Get Out” and literally three seconds later there was a knock on the door. Al walked and opened it and guess who it is, Jordan Peele! I completely freaked out! I still can’t believe I called it, Bill Burr was there I freaked, Dave Holstein was there and I almost had a seizure, he created one of my favorite shows “Kidding” with Jim Carrey. That might’ve easily been the best party I’ve been to.
Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?
This will be my answer till the day I die, getting Ben Affleck to “adopt me.” It was our first scene together with him and the other guys on the team. The scene where they introduce him to the team, and the first time we ran it through I got ready to say my line and he cut mine and started his right away. I didn’t know if he did it on purpose or not (probably not) so I didn’t say anything. After a few tapes of me not being able to get my line out, I got angry. The first words that came out of my mouth were “Oh hell Nah” so I walked over where he was sitting while he was on his phone. I tapped his shoulder and told him don’t step on my lines again. He looked up at me like “who is this kid” he frowned a bit. And once I realized how big and statuesque he was. I had got very frightened and put the script in his face and tried to show him what his lines were. And I forget I was mic’d up, so the guys in the back heard me, everyone gave me hell for days and said, “you don’t talk to Ben Affleck like that!” And when our next scene came around again days later, he told me how he respected me for telling him not to step on his lines. We became best friends I would ask him 100–200 questions a day from that point on. Al Madrigal told him “Since you love him so much you might as well adopt him” and he did. Now he calls me his “son” and I call him “dad.” The best story ever am I right!? Batman is my father.
What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?
I have two screenplays that I am working on. I am finished with one and currently editing the other. The second one I am 60 pages in and they’re both comedies!
I’m very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?
1. It will help the younger generations. Two years ago I saw a movie called Black Panther and I was mesmerized seeing a black superhero. He looked like me, he sounded like me, he acted like me. He was so relatable to the black community. He was strong and fierce, it was an exhilarating experience. Growing up most superheros I saw were white. Seeing white men as powerful and strong did not have the same effect as Black Panther. I was 17 when I saw the film and imagined the hope and inspiration for young black boys and girls felt. Superheroes aren’t real and they do the impossible, but seeing a person like you doing the impossible makes you feel like you can do anything. A lot of white people might not understand it because everyone they watch on TV, for the most part, looks like them. They don’t know what it feels like to have a lack of representation. But growing up seeing that could potentially move mountains, and I commend Hollywood for making a push for more diverse characters.
2. They can start helping minorities and people of color be exposed to more roles. If you look 30–40 years ago people of color would only be cast for stereotypical roles. But now we see minorities being able to play anything and it gives the audience and the industry a chance to see more talent come in from all races. Let me tell you it’s been a pleasure to watch. So many new talented black, white, Mexican, Asian, etc. actors and actresses come out.
3. Having diversity would be normalized years from now if we continue to push for more diverse roles and representation. We won’t be mad or shocked if we see Idris Elba playing “007.” The people won’t be mad if Halle Bailey is cast to play Ariel in The Little Mermaid. We will only be going by the actor’s talent, not what color their skin is. Period pieces would have to be accurate, but having diversity in films is so important to me. I’m so happy to see Hollywood making an effort for change. Things don’t happen overnight, it takes time.
From your personal experience, can you recommend three things the community/society/the industry can do help address some of the diversity issues in the entertainment business?
There are so many things that need to be done but it’s hard to just narrow it down to three. But, I would say the community and society need to be more open-minded. Don’t judge a book by its cover, there have been a lot of people cast for roles that society didn’t like and they absolutely killed their roles.
Heath Ledger for example, when he got cast for The Dark Knight people were screaming, “they cast the 10 Things I Hate About You guy!?” And look, he’s easy, at least in my eyes, the greatest Joker ever. They’re getting a lot better but, Hollywood needs to be more open-minded.
The last one for me is the actors shouldn’t be afraid to stand up! If you see something wrong with our industry say something, cause awareness. Don’t feel scared to be the first, actors and actresses to take responsibility too. It’s our industry, we can’t sit around and hope someone creates diversity for us.
What are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why. Please share a story or example for each.
I don’t have any I wish someone told me moments. I’m fairly new at this. I do not regret any decision I have made. It made me who I am today sometimes it doesn’t seem good to make decisions that don’t pan out but it’s actually a good thing, it builds character!
Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”?
This is a heartbreak profession when you sign up to be an actor or actress. You have to know that most times when you get an audition. Statistically, you are most likely to not get the part than to book it. But acting is like baseball your swing and a strikeout, and strikeout, and strikeout, then BOOM! you hit a home run. You have to be ready to grind and be persistent and resilient. If not you will quit immediately. You have to be used to being told no more than yes.
You are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. 🙂
Oh my gosh, where do I start? Black Lives Matter, Slow Food Movement, Children, and Nature movement, One Million Women movement, Keep the Oil In The Ground movement, Idle No More movement, Save the Turtles, Save the Rhinoceros, I can keep going on!
None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?
Right now, my dad. He has been there 100% through my mission of becoming an actor. He has supported me. A few weeks ago I told him I needed a laptop for my screenplay the next day he bought me one. It’s great to see him do everything he can to help me accomplish my dreams and will do whatever it takes for me to succeed.
Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?
It’s not really a quote but a story. You have two gold miners under the ground digging for gold. You have one guy that kept digging, kept digging, and kept digging and one day he just had enough of it. He decided to quit because he’s put all his effort into one thing and has gotten zero results, and he was ONE more big hit away from finding the gold. The other guy stayed persistent, kept digging, kept grinding, and next thing you know all of the gold he was looking for was found AND some. The moral of the story is never quit what you’re doing because you never know how close you really are to achieving your dream!
Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them 🙂
This is so hard to narrow it down to one person but if I had to pick one it would be Will Smith. I’ve loved that man since I was a kid. If I could have anyone’s career it would be his. Another would be Jordan Peele. He’s an amazing director I would love to work with him in the near future.
How can our readers follow you on social media? This was very meaningful, thank you so much!
Thank you these are the best questions I have gotten so far! And my Social Media is @Charleslottofficial

    <h5 class="mb-1">9-year-old uses down time amid virus to create business</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Alaina Stifel is like any other new business owner. She came up with a business plan, a name for her company and a product that she’s been selling out of her makeshift office at home.
But there’s one major difference between her and most other small business owners.
Alaina is 9 years old.
“Alaina amazes me every day,” said her mother, Leah Stifel. “She is so bright and loved by so many and she just has such a kind heart. I’m so proud of her. She works hard at everything she does. She always is successful when she puts her mind to it. When she gets determined, whatever she wants done, it gets done.”
Alaina, a fourth-grade student at Hubbell Elementary School in Des Moines, has found a unique way to stay busy and help families in need while kids are at home during the coronavirus pandemic. She started her own business called AJ’s Magnificent Minis, which sells homemade polymer miniatures that she turns into keychains, earrings, charms and figurines.
“It’s actually really, really fun,” Alaina told the Des Moines Register.
The idea started when Stifel saw her daughter was getting ready to ask for money in hopes of buying some AirPods. She told Alaina if she was going to get the money, she had to earn it.
One of the ways Stifel suggested her daughter earn money was by selling things. Alaina, a talented young artist, came up with an idea to create clay miniatures.
It seemed like the perfect idea to Stifel, a teacher in Des Moines, who thought it would be a good lesson for Alaina and help her pass the time while stuck at home.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Narcissistic Family Legacy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When a child is raised by a narcissistic parent, they may become orbital to the parent – focused on meeting the parents needs and losing their own sense of identity in the process. However, some children of narcissistic parents become narcissists themselves and it’s easy to understand why.
Adopting the family values
When you’re raised in a family where the emphasis is on being better, brighter, more beautiful and richer than everyone else, you may internalise these values. This is how the world is, isn’t it? Mum or dad has brought you up with the belief that unless you make people laugh the hardest, or wear the best clothes or go to the most expensive school, then you’re not worth as much as you might otherwise be. “Success” is measured by these external markers and if you were raised in this type of environment, it’s no wonder you may place a high value on these types of external markers too.
Learning to be loved in the conditional way
Another reason why children of narcissists may become narcissists themselves is because they learned long ago that, in order to be deserving of love and attention from their parent, they could do so by being an extension of their parent’s efforts to be the best. This isn’t the case for all children of narcissists – some parents want their children to remain in the background, orbiting around them – but some bask in the glow of their children’s attainments. The child learns that by doing well in school, being regarded a beauty or excelling in some area of their life that they will receiving attention and praise from their parent. They have lived up to their parent’s expectations.
Being caught up in manipulation and secrets
The narcissistic family is all about maintaining outward image and, in order to do so, whatever happens in the family must stay in the family. Children of narcissists may be ashamed not only about aspects of the treatment they receive from their parent, but also about stuff that must remain hidden. For instance, the narcissistic family may not really have much wealth at all, but it’s important to project an image of wealth to the rest of the street. In addition to the secrets presented to the outside world, there are probably countless secrets within the family. Narcissistic parents can be highly manipulative of their children. They may favour one child on the basis of that child meeting their needs and, instead of treating all their children equally, may bind a child to them in various ways such as sharing confidences or rewarding them financially or in some other way. When you’ve been brought up to think it’s ok to have a favourite child and to have secrets in this way, it’s understandable that you might repeat these patterns in your own family.
Seeing only the positives
It’s possible, perhaps within your own family, to see generations of narcissism. When you’re raised with narcissistic values, it can be very difficult to see anything wrong. In fact, you may see your family values as positive. Perhaps the narcissistic tendencies in your parents or grandparents was what drove them to take certain steps which benefitted you financially.
One of my clients, a woman in her seventies with anxiety, described her mother who was, in later life, diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. My client’s mother had come from a poor background and raised a family where the whole emphasis was on ‘bettering’ herself. Working long hours as a cleaner, she managed to send her children to private school. My client and her two siblings were not allowed to talk like the local kids and were under great pressure to hide where they came from, taking long routes on the way home from school to throw their classmates off the scent that they lived in a council house. This caused considerable pressure and my client recalled how her brother wet the bed until well into his teenage years. My client displayed strong narcissistic traits herself and failed to see anything wrong with her mother’s obsession about presenting this image to the outside world – at the cost of a happy and secure family life. “Mum was amazing, what an achievement”, she told me. She had so deeply internalised her mother’s values that she saw nothing but positives in them. The fact that she was the only one of her mother’s children who spoke to her mum at the time of her death, and the fact none of the children in this family spoke to each other, failed to change her opinion of her mother as a “wonderful person” based purely on the fact that her mother had sent her children to private school and set them on the path to wealthy lives.
Choosing partners who will orbit around you
Narcissists are often drawn towards partners who will orbit around them. Instead of seeing marriage as a team effort, they see themselves in the driving seat and seek a partner who will allow them to be the dominant force in the family. If you’ve been raised by a narcissistic parent, you may find yourself similarly choosing a partner who will allow you to operate your family in the way you want without being challenged. Marianne, a client in her forties, described how both she and her sister had been single parents for years. “I don’t think it was an accident, somehow”, she told me. “I chose single parenthood. My dad played no role in the family and I think mum liked it that way. I thought men were unnecessary within the family structure and used one to get pregnant. I suspect my sister did, too”. Even if you don’t go down the route of single parenthood, you may find yourself regarding your partner as the lesser parent compared to yourself and then pass this message onto your own children.
Seeing your children as an extension of yourself
If your mother or father saw you as an extension of themselves, you may see your children in a similar light. Their achievements reflect well on you. Their ‘failures’ make you look bad. When your children do well or are complimented by other people on their looks or abilities you are validated as a parent and that sense of identity as a parent is extremely important to you.
If you have been raised by a narcissistic parent, it can take a long time to realise that you are raising your own children in the same way. It may well be that it’s not until you face problems in your own life – such as being under pressure to act in a particular way, unsatisfactory relationships or a sense of lacking a deep sense of self and security which is derived internally rather than externally – that you identify the negative impact that being raised by a narcissistic parent has had on your life. If you are at this stage, this is the first step in breaking the narcissistic legacy and ensuring that subsequent generations of your family adopt very different values.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Life has to go on, but differently!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
When SERS and MERS came, they didn’t get us. So when I heard of coronavirus in  Wuhan in January, I simply called it OPP – other peoples property. Yes, property!
But Coronavirus is here and if our recent daily jumps and the news from Kano are anything to go by, then the virus came with an entourage. We must, therefore, look back and thank Ebola for prepping us. Perhaps had  Ebola not come around in 2014, we would have received Coronavirus without a single lab, with our eyes closed, without respect.
It was after Ebola we got an NCDC. Perhaps after Coronavirus, we might become again a West African centre for medical tourism. Because, I see billions flowing freely into medicare in Nigeria. And If you believe, simply say, Amen! I know our big men, you only need to scare them to get them to act. And once frightened, they overdo everything. Big hospitals to serve West Africa are coming.
Other things are coming too. And they will come like they have been stampeded.
The implementation of Oransaye report has been approved by the president. We must praise President Buhari.
President  Jonathan commissioned the Oransaye committee in 2012. When the committee submitted a report to him he set up another committee to review the report of the other committee. And when that committee presented what was to be the white paper in early 2014 he put it in a file and left it there. Anyway who would blame him? We had money then. Oil had gone below 100 dollars a barrel but people were still buying it. So he could take his time. Perhaps he thought he would win in 2015, and do it later.
The Oransaye committee recommended the scrapping of NECO. It recommends the scrapping of FRSC. It recommended the merger of EFCC, ICC and CCB. It recommended the upgrading of CCT to a full anti-corruption court. It recommended the scrapping of HAJJ and Christian Pilgrims boards. It recommended the immediate cessation of wasteful sponsorship of pilgrimages.
The Jonathan government committee rejected all these lofty recommendations.
We will wait to see what Buhari has approved. But we can be hopeful.  With the strangulating hold Coronavirus on the nations jugular arteries  Buhari will act more comprehensively and will now act in a hurry. Buhari no longer has oil revenues. The NNPC has abolished petrol subsidy and has promised to build six regional hospitals.
Coronavirus is making even things that would have happened, happen feverishly.
Opponents used to say Buhari was slow. But when he addressed the nation and allowed Lagos and Abuja to begin gradual re-opening from May 4, many critics said he was too fast. He wasn’t.  We all know it is safer to hide in a bunker till December. I would have recommended that if we were UAE with a sovereign wealth fund of about 1.3 trillion dollars for their one million people. We are 200 million with nothing in our savings. Our only means for foreign exchange is in a coma. We have to restart cautiously.
Our figures appear to be jumping but I think it’s an illusion of a steep rise. We have been locked down for over a month. We tested only about 5000 in 5 weeks. There was no way we could have got a proper picture in that tiny sample size. If we continue testing 0.001 percent of our population per week, we will continue to see apparently rising figures for some months to come. Our level of testing cannot give us a picture we can rely on.
But there are two ways to assess the actual situation.
The first is by testing, otherwise knowing the approximate number of infected people. The second is knowing how many people are dying from the disease.
We didn’t and don’t have the resources to know the first. The second can’t hide once it’s huge. The mortuary spaces in Lagos, for instance, are limited, perhaps about 1000. If we had the sort of thing that happened in Lombardy Italy happening in Lagos Nigeria, we would have seen it. So we can say that since we have been locked down in Lagos and people aren’t conducting funerals as before, after 10 weeks of the arrival of the Italian, Lagos has not seen hell.
That is a safe assumption because in other places- Spain, Italy, Wuhan, England, New York, 10 weeks was more than enough time for the picture to become nightmarish. We don’t have such a picture. So the conclusions are that we have slowed the spread or we aren’t as vulnerable as the other mentioned. Either way, we are not in in the valley of the shadow of death.
So let us reopen cautiously. Any action we take either way carries a risk and has a cost.  Hiding the population in a bunker would lead to thousands dying every week because of hunger. We will not throw away the gains we might have made in slowing the actual spread of the disease. We will reopen cautiously and watch out for flare-ups.
I have been wondering. Is there anything Coronavirus can do to stampede the provision of centric power to the people of Nigeria?

Prevention is better than cure." "Anybody with a cough or cold and anyone sneezing in and sneezing out (okweskyamura) should not go into public space." "Mama Janet and I did the scientific wedding back in 1973 and we have never regretted." "When it comes to health, it is better to be a coward and be on the side of caution." "Logically, the faster we run the better." "The virus enters the body through the soft parts of the body -the nose, eyes, and mouth." "There is time for everything. There is time for survival and this is time for survival. This is not the usual way of life." "People should stop talking a language of normalcy in a period of abnormalcy." "Handle issues firmly but legally, if you beat people, you give our security a bad image. You are now weakening us not strengthening us." "Those who are playing with this fire should stop. They should stop talking nonsense." "The lockdown is not a matter of convenience, we are talking about life and death." "If I hear that there is not enough maize or beans because people are hoarding from the market, then I will import and forget about you, because you are crocks." "The economy should move, but move without the disease spreading." "We have defeated the locusts, we shall defeat coronavirus." "In 1893, there was an outbreak of smallpox.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hafthor Julius Bjornsson: Game of Thrones star says he ‘could have done more’ after breaking deadlift world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The actor who played The Mountain inGame of Thrones, is celebrating after successfully deadlifting more than any other human in history.
However, shortly after Icelandic star Hafthor Júlíus Björnsson broke the world record, he admitted he “could have done more”.
Björnsson, who won fans for his portrayal of the towering Clegane brother in the HBO series, deadlifted 1,104 pounds live on ESPN – that’s 501 kilograms – with relative ease.
The previous record was 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds), which was lifted by Eddie Hall in 2016.
After breaking the record, he wrote on Instagram: “I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone.
“I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible.”
Björnsson​ had previously shared his training experience on his YouTube channel.
In 2018, he was named the World’s Strongest Man. He finished silver at the contest in the past two years.
In 2017, Björnsson – who played The Mountain from season four onwards –​ told Entertainment Weekly about the bizarre requests he kept receiving from fans of Game of Thrones.
One viewer asked him to “squeeze [their] eyes out” in reference to a famous season four scene in which his character is shown doing exactly this to another.
“That’s very popular,” he added. “Or pick them up over my head. But the most popular is to squeeze their eyes out.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Game Of Thrones” Actor Hafthor Bjornsson Breaks World Deadlift Record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane, better known as ‘The Mountain’ in “Game of Thrones” has set a new deadlifting world record.
Bjornsson, 31, broke the previous record held by Eddie Hall in 2016 for lifting 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds). On Saturday, Bjornsson lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kilograms) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland.
The actor and strongman completed the lift as the barbell bent and strained under the weights. He held the lift for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
On Instagram, he said;
“I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible.”
Bjornsson, who is 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 452 pounds had won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018 and has earned third place or higher every year since 2012. He is the first person to have won the Arnold Strongman Classic, Europe’s Strongest Man and World’s Strongest Man in the same calendar year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Game of Thrones’ ‘The Mountain’ breaks deadlift world record; ‘7-figure’ boxing match next</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, better known as Gregor Clegane or “The Mountain” in Game of Thrones, is a very strong individual.
Having already won the Arnold Strongman Classic and the World’s Strongest Man, among many other competitions, the 31-year-old has also now broken another world record.
After initial reps of 420 kg and 465 kg, Björnsson deadlifted 501 kg to go past a record that has held through since 2016. The 6-foot-9 Icelandic strongman beat the previous record set by the UK’s Eddie Hall, who was the first to ever deadlift 500 kg.
Interestingly enough, Björnsson also wants to KO the previous record holder next, saying he’s signed a very lucrative offer for a boxing match with Hall.
“Something new and big,” Thor said when asked what was next for him. “Core Sports just offered me a seven-figure contract, the biggest contract of my life. I’ve signed it already.
“Hall has been running his mouth for some weeks, and I know he got the same deal, same contract. So Eddie, I just knocked out your record, and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring,” Björnsson said. “Time to put your fists where your big mouth is, and sign the Core Sports contract. I’m ready.”
Björnsson, who is also a former professional basketball player, did dabble with some martial arts training in the past. In 2015, the massive athlete was also on camera having a friendly sparring match with Conor McGregor in Ireland.

Bjornsson, best known for his portrayal of Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, broke the record previously held by Briton Eddie Hall who in 2016 became the first man to lift 500 kg.
The event was streamed live on ESPN https://twitter.com/espn/status/1256627646106079234?s=19 and Bjornsson, 31, lifted the barbell that was bending and straining under the weights, holding it for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mountain From ‘GOT’, A Very Strong Lad, Just Smashed The World Deadlift Record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, otherwise known as The Mountain from Game Of Thrones, has officially broken the world deadlift record, by hoisting an incredible 501kg. In terms of animals, that’s heavier than an adult male polar bear, but it’s impressive no matter how you look at it.
He completed the lift at Thor’s Power Gym in his home country of Iceland, after two warm-ups, in which he lifted 420kg and 460kg respectively. The record was previously held by Britain’s Eddie Hall, who managed to lift 500kg back in 2016.
“I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” said the 31-year-old, who won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018. “I’m happy with this. My family and friends, they were happy with this, and I’ve decided to call it.”

Back in 2015, Hafthor Julius Bjornsson broke a 1000-year-old record at the World’s Strongest Viking competition by carrying a 32-foot, 650kg log for five steps. Taking to Instagram to celebrate his latest accomplishment, he said:

“I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible,” he wrote on Instagram.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The sporting world has taken a backseat in recent weeks as the world deals with a significant health crisis.
However, that didn’t stop world-renown stongman Halfthor Bjornsson from setting a world record. Better known as The Mountain, Bjornsson went for the deadlift world record on Saturday afternoon.
Stadning 6-foot-9 and weighing in at 450 pounds, Bjornsson is quite literally a mountain of a man. He proved that with a tremendous lift this afternoon.
He warmed up with a few lifts, hitting 465 kilograms before going for the record. Bjornsson stepped up to the podium one last time to try for the record of 501 kilograms or 1,104 pounds.
Let’s just say he’s a little stronger than the average person.
While the rest of us have been learning how to make sourdough or other interesting hobbies during the health crisis, Bjornsson is out setting world records.
He cooly stepped up to the plate and delivered to the masses watching at home.
This record won’t be east to beat.

And here's the world-record lift:
Bjornsson, speaking on the ESPN telecast, said he was pleased with his lift — and that he could have done more.
"Not only did I pull this incredible weight, I also feel great afterwards," Bjornsson said. "I’m standing here, tall, feeling good. No injuries. So I’m healthy as well. I believe today I could have done more, but what’s the point? I’m happy with this. My family and friends, they’re happy. And I’ve decided to call it."
Bjornsson also called out Hall to a boxing match — not the first time they. have hinted at a fight — after breaking the record.
"I just knocked out your record and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring," Bjornsson said. "Time to put your fist where your big mouth is and sign the CoreSports contract. I’m ready. Are you ready, Eddie?"
Hall, to his credit, wished Bjornsson luck ahead of his world-record attempt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE’s Becky Lynch Reveals The ‘Fun Things’ She & Seth Rollins Do For Date Nights In Isolation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like WWE couple Becky Lynch, 33, and Seth Rollins, 33, have no shortage of entertainment when it comes to quarantining together. The wrestling beauty opened up about some of the many activities she’s been doing with her hunky fiance throughout the coronavirus pandemic and also adorably called him her “best friend” as they navigate the changes of the world together.
“He is my best friend… He is my best friend in the whole wide world so we don’t have to set aside date nights because every night is like that but it is all chill and I love cooking and I would cook every night of the week if I can,” she EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife about how she keeps busy during quarantine. “I haven’t been able to do that in years so just doing that and finding a show. Last night we got some books and were reading. I guess it is whatever you can do together but we have also been doing a jigsaw puzzle, so there are fun things like that we end up doing as well!”Like Becky, Seth also EXCLUSIVELY confirmed to us that he and his lady love are taking advantage of the quarantine time by cooking dinners and watching movies. “Obviously, no one knows how long this process is going to take,” he EXCLUSIVELY said in a Mar. 30 interview. “We’re taking advantage of the downtime and cook some dinners, watch movies, and hang out. We don’t really get a lot of time to do that. So you know, we are going to get full nights of sleep. We are going to hang out with my animals. Just enjoy quality time as opposed to work time, which is where we spend most of our time doing. Luckily she is not one of those fussy types that need a whole lot to be entertained, so I am okay and I will be alright. I think she is down with drinking beers and hanging out.”Becky and Seth seem like they’re doing better than ever in quarantine and it may have to do with the fact that they’re so in love. The lovebirds first started dating in May 2019 and three months later, they were engaged.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Moynihan: Opportunities now abound for Paul in not-so-normal times</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul - congrats, bubbeleh!
The reviews are in and Normal People is a success. I hear that the burghers of your native land are up in arms and complaining about the sex scenes. Believe me, there’s no such thing as bad publicity, my friend. We’re away.
We have to talk, though. I see that everyone is talking about the sports content - how realistic it is, how rare it is to see a realistic depiction on-screen of Gaelic football (is that really what you call it? Marketing department, line one!)
This is fine as far as it goes, Paul, but I see you giving interviews. Talking about Kildare. Talking about being a minor and U21 county player.
Now some of that interview was harmless. Saying that your sport helped “in terms of self-discipline and being ready and being able to capitalize on opportunities” - that’s textbook actorese. Looks real, sounds real, but means nothing. Couldn't have put it better myself.
The other parts, I’m not so sure. “When it came to applying for colleges, I was putting down law and arts and things that would support playing Gaelic football”.
Come on Paul. That won’t fly. Nobody would believe that an amateur sportsman would make a career choice based on that. Believe me.
You may know Gaelic games, but I know the real world.
Better news, though, with the new scripts coming in. There are a couple of projects here - Anchorman: The Mick Lyons Story is one, Get Out (The Goalie Talks) - and as far as I can figure, your only real competition is Chris O’Dowd. You were telling me he was - am I right? - the Roscommon minor ‘keeper in the 1997 Connacht final, if any of those words mean anything in reality, but I think you have the inside track.
For instance, just because you played club football in Kildare - am I even saying that right? - we’ve already been sent a few boxing scripts. I have no doubt you’d star in any of those roles, but what I want to avoid is having to get some poor boxer to say you could have boxed professionally as soon as the movie is released.
Let’s try to hold onto our self-respect in this lousy business, am I right?
The other genre we need to avoid is the old reliable - the movie star as hot-rod car racer.
Now, there was a time when this was good enough for Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Steve McQueen and Tom Cruise: they all made race-car movies, they all enjoyed them and - most important - those movies made money.
But now . . . the new green agenda, carbon footprints, electric cars: it’s just not as sexy any more.
You don’t believe me? Look up one of my other clients, he’ll tell you all about it. Le Mans ’66 is doing okay, and one of the main men in that movie is Matt Damon - he’s sheltering in place somewhere near you at the moment, I believe.
But Paul, I have to ask you to stay away from one topic if you meet up with Matt.
Everyone thinks he’s trapped in Ireland but he’s got another reason to hang out on the Emerald Isle.
He got an early look at Normal People and he’s decided to branch into filmmaking with Gaelic games as a template. Last week he told me he’s moving to some place in east Cork to prepare for his next role: shaving back his hairline, wearing blue contact lenses, using a hurley and ball to build up his skills for a new biopic.
(The name they use for this ball in hurling I can’t even begin to spell. Oy.)
It’s under wraps right now but I can tell you Aaron Sorkin has a second draft ready to go.
They haven’t cast the second lead, if you’re interested. How’s your Cork accent?
A question.
Is anyone else scrolling absently through online sports-gear websites, mindlessly clicking on the availability of random tops and t-shirts for the simple comfort of having one’s attention blunted by plenitude?
Who knew, for instance, that you could get a personalised New York Subliners top for only $99? Or that a Brazil 1970 jersey (kids version) can be had for just £24, though the authentic sweat-stains need to be supplied by the wearer? Or a ROOTED IN OAKLAND t-shirt is available for just $22.49 (though shipping may be extra)?
What amazes me is the sheer variety, the infinite differences. I remember a seminal day in second year in school when one of our classmates produced a replica Barcelona kit for PE; his brother had been working in Spain and came through with this ground-breaking ensemble.
Now every last variation in the Barcelona catalogue is available to you at the click of a mouse. If you had told 14-year-old me that this world would exist I would have confidently predicted my instantaneous insolvency on assimilating that fact.
Now it just serves as an anaesthetic.
Apart from the Fanatics Branded Toronto Maple Leafs Blue/White Mission Full-Zip Hoodie.
That one’s mine.
There isn’t much happening in the way of sports news - see the largest chunk of this week’s column if you doubt me - but a development overseas caught my eye a few days ago.
You’re aware that college sports in America is a hugely lucrative business for the colleges involved - there have been suggestions that the shutdown of college sports in the States may actually endanger some colleges’ future, never mind the sports’ future, so central is that income to those institutions.
Last week, though, we learned the NCAA, the organisation regulating college sports, is to allow student athletes to cash in on their likenesses, images and names, thus bringing an end to what one observer called the greatest economic model ever conceived: one in which those generating vast revenues earn no part of those revenues.
This is an interesting development which has the potential to turn a century’s tradition on its head and create a financial/economic headache for those in charge of sports beloved across an entire country.
Feel free to draw any parallels you want with similar situations here.
Many thanks to the Yale University Press for zipping out a copy of Sons Of The Waves by Philip Taylor. The subtitle should inform you of its appeal to me: The Common Seaman in the Heroic Age of Sail.
Like a lot of you I enjoyed Master and Commander, with Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, but the books behind that movie I have to avoid in case of sudden, ruinous addiction to the works of Patrick O’Brian.
This Taylor book more than compensates. If you think it has no relevance to the current moment, think for a second. Here’s a book that tells you what it’s like for people to spend years on end living cheek by jowl with each other - literally - though hopefully in your situation scurvy is not a real prospect any time soon. A triumph.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Steph & Dom solve your sex, love & life troubles: He's at home all day but still won't help with the kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV's Steph and Dom Parker, 52 and 54, draw on their 21 years of marriage to solve your relationship problems...
Q I'm 44 and a stay-at-home mum. My husband is a lawyer, and earns more than I ever did, so this makes the most sense financially. He's always worked long hours, so I'm used to him being involved only at the weekends. But I thought this would change now he is working from home.
I didn't expect him to help with home-schooling, but I did hope he'd have dinner with us, and show more interest in the children, who are desperate for his attention. But he spends all his time in his study, eats on his own, and refuses to read with the kids before bed or join in with anything we're doing.
I know he's busy, and I don't want to put extra pressure on him, but I resent that he seems to have no interest in getting to know the children. If he has no interest now, when it's easier to spend time with them, when will he? What should I do?
STEPH SAYS: Before we go any further I would like you to take three deep breaths. You need to reduce your anger. You are at the end of your tether. I understand — every mother is, and it is fine to ask for help.
The reality is that you are at home with your family 24/7, when your kids are normally at school, football, ballet or flute, for example. For now that's all over, and your work rate has gone through the roof.
It is completely justified to feel stressed about how much more you are juggling now. However, it isn't reasonable to accuse your husband of not caring about his children. I doubt very much this is the case, and I would advise you to be careful about what you say. It seems to me your allegation is unfair.
It's perfectly reasonable to expect him to take on some of the extra childcare, but to complain about him not eating with you and the children appears unjust. Isn't family suppertime 5pm or 6pm? My guess is he would normally still be at work at that time. Well, he is still at work, he's just working from home.
I have a strong feeling there is an underlying money issue here. You mention his earning capacity being larger than yours. It upsets you that he makes more money than you do, or did, or perhaps could.
If this was just about having the kids under your feet all the time, you wouldn't raise the money aspect, but you do. I think that is what's bothering you.
So, be honest with yourself. Yes, you can be annoyed about the choices you made when you had your family, but be wary about using the kids as a crutch for your irritation. It never ends well when a parent uses their children as a weapon or shield during a disagreement, however close to the truth they may be.
I think you're missing the point here. Remember the strain your husband is under, too. His life — and therefore the entire family's — might be about to change dramatically, and I imagine he's working all the hours he can to try to limit the damage, and not worry you.
Here's my advice. Stop painting him as someone who is uninterested in his children. Instead, choose to be on the same side. Put your hand up for help. Tell him you are exhausted, run ragged and missing time alone.
Get him to suggest ways he can help you — giving you an hour off every day, for example. It can be organised around his work.
Your children should be the source of contentment, not a bone of contention. Count your blessings.
Dom says:
We all know that this is a very difficult time, but I'm not liking what I'm hearing. I understand the issues with family finances and how, with only one salary, your husband will feel he needs to work long hours to earn enough to support you all.
But we all know that lawyers are well-paid and I'd have thought that, if your husband has been working in his field for a good number of years, he should be doing well enough that these long hours are no longer necessary.
I have several friends who are lawyers, and some are busier than others at the moment. In certain sectors things are starting to pick up again, while in others business has been waning. But whichever camp your husband falls into, I see little reason why he shouldn't at least eat with you all. I'm concerned that he's hiding from something.
Maybe it's a work problem —perhaps he's not remotely busy and is frantically worrying about keeping it all going. Or could it be that he's concerned about being seen to be busy by his boss? Or perhaps work isn't the issue, and he's simply hiding from you and the children, or just the children.
You don't say much about his demeanour, so it's hard for me to tell if he might be depressed, but if you think that's a possibility, then don't hesitate to make a phone appointment with his GP.
It is worrying that he is so withdrawn from his children. After all, even if he really is madly busy, he can surely find ten minutes to read with one of them each night. He has 24 hours in his day, and is no longer commuting. At the very least he should be able to give the time he used to spend on the train or in the car to his family.
A serious conversation has to happen. I suggest you sit down in his study with him and ask him 'What is going on?'
I have a strong suspicion he is struggling with being a husband and a father. Just like being a mother, being a father is not always easy. He may not have had a good example from his own — I find we tend to be the kind of father our father was to us.
But even if he was lucky enough to have a wonderful role model in his old man, we all need a little help from time to time. He needs to share what is going on in his head and his heart. Please help him find his way back to the family that he surely loves.

    <h5 class="mb-1">(Video) Oxlade-Chamberlain given diabolical lockdown haircut by Perrie Edwards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix superstar Perrie Edwards has given her partner, Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, a haircut which she’s described as “diabolical”.
I’d bet my house on me not being the only one sat here, looking at the screen, with an overgrown head of hair – but Perrie opted to help Alex out with his.
She gave the Liverpool man a trim, and while it’s not salon-quality, it’s not actually that bad. If it’s all the same to you though, I’ll wait until lockdown is over and visit my barber!
Take a watch of the video below (via the Liverpool Echo):

    <h5 class="mb-1">How King Crimson’s Tony Levin Remains Creative in Quarantine Era: Exclusive Interview</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As with so many, bassist Tony Levin's summer plans have suddenly changed. He was originally set to tour North America with King Crimson, but those dates have since been postponed until 2021 — yet another concert casualty for an industry thrown into coronavirus chaos.
But Levin isn't looking for pity. "I'm fortunate in a way," he says. "Most of what I do is on the road playing live, but I have a backlog of music that I want to record and write at home. And like many touring musicians nowadays who are suddenly at home, I'm finding it's a good time to catch up on all those other things that were a priority but a second priority now that the first priority – touring – has suddenly gone away."
Levin also plays in prog act Stick Men and various other groups, including touring and recording with Peter Gabriel as part of the songwriter's long-running core band. So while most of the world was still adjusting to a new quarantine reality, Levin told UCR he was perfectly comfortable juggling a handful of new projects — including the seeds of a new Stick Men LP and a solo tribute to the many drummers of his life.
You're involved in lots of bands and projects, but it's been 13 years since your last solo album. Is that something you hope to tackle during quarantine? 
The way I am: I always have a list of things. Yes, I'm way overdue on a solo album. But also, the group I'm in, Stick Men, want to write a new album – so I can use the time for that. [He and touch guitarist Markus Reuter are] more focused on trying to get a sense of how to write our new music, which we've already started. Doing it remotely is not our favorite way, but we can do that — trade ideas and stuff like that.
Also, I take a lot of photos. I've put out a few photo books, and I'm overdue for a photo exhibition and another photo book, and all those things take months of work that's hard to squeeze in when you're on the road. So, I'm tackling all of those simultaneously while I'm home. I'd like to say if I'm home long enough that I'll get them all done. The reality is that I probably won't get them all done, but at least I'll make progress and get some of them done.
Listen to the Stick Men Perform 'The Tempest'
Have you and Markus swapped many files yet, or are you still in the initial stage of gathering ideas? 
You put it very well: We're at that first stage of gathering things on our own end. I think he and I are both writing, maybe in my case not feverishly, but we're writing stuff we'll present to the other and also [drummer] Pat [Mastelotto], who has an important say in the music. But pretty much, harmonically, as you can imagine it needs to get set up first by me and Markus. We're in the early stage of trading ideas, and we're also conceptually trying to get a framework for what this will be like.
We've done albums where the three of us have gotten together and improvised live for a few hours and that was the album. We've done albums where Markus and I each wrote material separately and put it together for an album. And we've done some where Markus and I got together and wrote together. This time, one of the things we're looking at is some older material, reexamining it, rewriting some older Stick Men material, and seeing what can happen with that – to bring it to life, and to have something to begin with that all of us participated in already.
And then Pat usually has some ideas. Once we unleash him, he'll send us a bunch of loops and beats that can inspire new ideas. In the end, we'll do much more material together that we need, and then we'll pick the best and refine it. It's usually a long process, but sometimes it's quick. But it's always gratifying with Stick Men. We always feel like we have something to be proud of. And importantly for me, you want to do something that's always uniquely you – that's not like what other bands are doing. So far, I think we've been successful with that, and we want to be sure to keep that up.
Watch Tony Levin's Tribute to Drummers
Let's talk about the a cappella drummer tribute, which is just fantastic. 
It's a musical tribute to all the drummers I've worked with over the years, which is a lot of drummers. I'm just writing a song about that, which is kind of pointless, but it's on the table. And because I have the time to finish it, it's a pleasure to be finishing that. Like you said, this extra time at home is enabling us to tackle projects that maybe wouldn't ever have gotten finished. I think I've had this one in mind for about 10 years, and it's a good feeling to finally be finishing it. It feels a little funny to even be talking about that. It's a piece that had to be done just because I had it in mind. It will not be on an album or anything like that. I think the drummers will enjoy it. I've been very fortunate.
The Pretenders (1980): Chrissie Hynde was a new-school punk with a classic-rock heart. She loved the Kinks as much as she loved the Sex Pistols, and on the Pretenders' stinging debut she comes off like the biggest badass on the planet.
Rush (1980): Compact, radio-ready items like "The Spirit of Radio" and "Freewill" signalled a move away from longer-form compositions for Rush and let to a trip up the Billboard charts. 'Permanent Waves' became their first American Top Five album, eventually going platinum.
Bob Seger (1980): A two-time Grammy winner that knocked Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' off the top of the charts, 'Against the Wind' found its strengths in Bob Seger's balladry, rather than his typical meat-and-potatoes rockers.
Elvis Costello (1980): Costello's first experiment with the genre-hopping that would define his career was 1980's 'Get Happy.' An excursion into soul music, it sounds like Booker T. and the M.G.s crossed with speed and a rhyming dictionary.
Van Halen (1980): Dark elements begin to creep into Van Halen's sound, after a pair of well-received party-rock albums. That creative tension - somber Eddie, versus impish Dave - would spark the band for years, then (perhaps inevitably) tear it apart.
Black Sabbath (1980): When the Ozzy Osbourne-led sessions for 'Heaven and Hell' fell apart, Black Sabbath brought in former Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio to take his place. Suddenly the band was reborn, producing their best album since 'Masters of Reality.'
Judas Priest (1980): Judas Priest began to couple their earlier complexity with more polished, groove-focused songs, hurtling NWOBHM into the mainstream. Fun moments like "Breaking the Law" are perfectly balanced by darker triumphs like "Metal Gods."
Pete Townshend (1980): After 15 years of writing mostly for Roger Daltrey's voice, Pete Townshend discovered his own on his proper solo debut. He also matched the Who's highest charting single when "Let My Love Open the Door" reached No. 9.
AC/DC (1980): AC/DC's powerhouse tribute to their late singer Bon Scott doubles as a declaration of purpose. With new singer Brian Johnson leading the charge, the group delivered their best album (about sex, death and, um, sex), and suddenly found themselves as one of the planet's biggest bands.
David Bowie (1980): After the critically lauded but commercially less successful Berlin Trilogy, Bowie began blending in more obvious pop sensibilities - and quickly returned to the top of the UK charts. 'Scary Monsters' can be seen now as a capstone on his '70s-era experimentalism.
Ozzy Osbourne (1980): There wasn't much momentum behind Osbourne as he emerged from his post-Black Sabbath firing. But the quick maturation of ex-Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoads, coupled with Ozzy's sudden knack for finding neo-metal hooks, quickly turned things around.
Bruce Springsteen (1980): Springsteen's double-album follow-up to 1978's 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' plays like an old Hollywood movie, with characters making some bad choices on their way to redemption. He had way too many ideas and songs to pull it all together without losing some focus. But close enough.
Dire Straits (1980): Mark Knopfler begins to widen Dire Straits' sonic palette, bringing in jazzier textures and some new-wave sensibilities. His narrative command is growing, too. As such, 'Making Movies' opened the door for every success that followed.
Talking Heads (1980): Bringing in horns, funk session players and Brian Eno, Talking Heads crafted their polyrhythmic masterpiece at the dawn of the decade and changed their direction forever. It sounded amazing and ahead of its time in 1980. It still does.
John Lennon/Yoko Ono (1980): After a five-year break from music to focus on being a husband and father, Lennon returned with a bunch of songs ... about being a husband and father. Three weeks after its release, he was killed, instilling the work (a collaboration with wife Ono) with even more poignancy.
The Clash (1980): The Clash followed up their double-album masterpiece 'London Calling' with a three-record set that was even more sprawling. It's messy at times, and isn't as focused as their three previous LPs, but it's brimming with ideas, innovation and brilliance.
Styx (1981): The most successful album in terms of achieving Styx's early goals of mixing of prog-rock ideals and AOR musicality, 'Paradise Theatre' perfectly balances grandiose pieces with short, sharp shocks like "Too Much Time on My Hands," "Snowblind" and "Half-Penny, Two-Penny."
Phil Collins (1980): This not only redefined Genesis’ new-ish frontman as a solo artist, it worked as a fulcrum for everything that came later as Phil Collins' main band began rapidly metamorphosing from prog into an '80s hit machine.
Rush (1981): Still their biggest-selling U.S. album, this plays like an early-'80s greatest hits package (Side one's radio and concert favorites include "Tom Sawyer," "Red Barchetta," "YYZ" and "Limelight"), before Rush settles into long-form thoughts.
The Police (1980): If the Police's first three albums were about building styles, subjects and songcraft, their fourth expands the arsenal outright. It's their most political album, and at times their smartest and most melodic.
Billy Squier (1980): For a moment in time, Billy Squier was everywhere, as songs like "My Kinda Lover" and "The Stroke" ruled the airwaves. 'Don't Say No,' in fact, remained on the Billboard album chart for more than two years.
Van Halen (1981): The slowest-selling album of the Roth era, 'Fair Warning' may showcase Van Halen at their least commercial - but also perhaps at their most compelling. Eddie Van Halen's guitar is a central element in this dark and dirty triumph.
Foreigner (1981): This career peak found Foreigner firing on all commercial cylinders, from the anthemic rock-star love letter of "Jukebox Hero" to tender power ballads like "Waiting on a Girl Like You" to something brand new in "Urgent" - which benefited greatly from a funky cameo on sax by Motown's Junior Parker.
Journey (1981): The addition of Jonathan Cain made a commercial juggernaut out of Journey, which had started as a Bay Area jam band. Cain, in fact, had a songwriting credit for every song on 'Escape,' which reeled off four Top 20 hits - including "Open Arms," the era's definitive power ballad.
Stevie Nicks (1981): Stevie Nicks' long-awaited solo career got off to a fast start with this smash hit, though she still seemed to favor collaborations -- working with Don Henley, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Waddy Wachtel, rather than Lindsey Buckingham.
The Rolling Stones (1981): The Stones stitched together 'Tattoo You' from various leftover songs dating back to the mid-'70s. But the seams barely show on this tight collection - their last classic album - of sexed-up and riff-driven rockers.
Genesis (1981): A bold update of the Genesis sound, 'Abacab' focused more on of-the-moment synths even while creating far more space than a group which once ballooned to five members had ever allowed. At the same time, songs like "No Reply At All" make clear their pop intentions for this decade.
King Crimson (1981): King Crimson returned after a seven-year layoff boasting the snappy new-wave vibe of the day, thanks in no small way to the addition of former David Bowie/Talking Heads sideman Adrian Belew. Tony Levin, fresh off some early solo career-defining work with Peter Gabriel, added new depth, too.
Motley Crue (1981): Motley Crue's punkish, bracingly lo-fi 1981 debut may not be their heaviest, best produced or most popular album - but it comes just a 'Shout' short of being their best.
Ozzy Osbourne (1981): Randy Rhoads' interest in neo-classical guitar stylings didn't just propel the quickly assembled 'Diary of a Madman' to near-classic status, it pointed to a larger career statement that - tragically - was never to be. In retrospect, it was good Ozzy rushed this out at the end of 1981. By March 1982, Rhoads was gone.
Asia (1982): It wasn't the prog-redux moment many might have expected with a new supergroup featuring members of Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer and King Crimson. Instead, it was a huge pop hit. So huge, in fact, that Asia almost immediately started splitting apart.
Iron Maiden (1982): New singer Bruce Dickinson's powerful, operatic voice unlocked the gates to metal immortality for Iron Maiden, inspring Steve Harris to take his songwrting to a new level on jaw-dropping tracks like "Run to the Hills" and "Hallowed Be Thy Name."
Richard and Linda Thompson (1982): Richard and Linda Thompson were ending their 10-year marriage when they recorded 'Shoot Out the Lights,' and the resentment, hopelessness and regret are palpable in the songs. One of rock's all-time greatest breakup albums.
Paul McCartney (1982): McCartney scored his final No. 1 album so far, largely on the strength of the smash Steve Wonder duet "Ebony and Ivory." Dig deeper, however, and you'll find far more interesting gems such as "Wanderlust" and "Take it Away." A great Wings song that wasn’t, the latter should have been the bigger hit.
Toto (1982): To this point, Toto hadn't managed a hit album, something all the more curious considering the studio pedigree of its core members. So, they put their heads together and came up with one. A huge one.
Roxy Music (1982): Roxy Music departed on a high note with this elegant synth-pop gem. 'Avalon' rose to No. 1 in the UK behind the sophisticated, Bryan Ferry-crooned romance of songs like "More Than This" and the title track.
Fleetwood Mac (1982): After indulging in the sprawling, wildly expensive, weirdly effective 'Tusk,' Fleetwood Mac returned with a comfy retro vibe for 'Mirage' - and fans raced back for the lacey mysteries of "Gypsy" and the soaring joys of "Hold Me."
Joe Jackson (1982): Joe Jackson's first album after moving to New York was a love note to his new home. A shimmering collection of songs that touched on rock, Latin, jazz and pop, 'Night and Day' had two Top 20 hits in "Steppin' Out" and "Breaking Us in Two."
Elvis Costello (1982): After setting the bar for dense, layered post-punk with 1979's 'Armed Forces,' Elvis Costello raised it again with 'Imperial Bedroom.' The album was a musically adventurous excursion in genre-hopping that earned comparisons to George Gershwin and Cole Porter.
Judas Priest (1982): And to think, the best-known track on Judas Priest's breakthrough album almost didn't make it. Needing one more song to complete the project, they turned to an unfinished number that became "You've Got Another Thing Comin'."
Bruce Springsteen (1982): Springsteen originally meant for these stark, desolate songs to serve as demos for the E Street Band, but their themes - mostly death and despair, and lots of it - worked better as stripped-down acoustic numbers. We can't imagine them any other way.
Peter Gabriel (1982): Yes, this was to be Peter Gabriel's fourth consecutive self-titled solo album. (A frustrated Geffen Records added a sticker saying 'Security' in the U.S.) Inside, however, much had changed, as Gabriel began to dabble in the African and Latin rhythms that would make 'So' a career-changing smash.
Kiss (1982): With their career in tatters, Kiss finally stopped messing around with disco, pop and concept albums and delivered their heaviest and most sophisticated album ever. Someday we're going to convince them to play "Saint and Sinner" and "Rock and Roll Hell" live.
Def Leppard (1983): With this album, both Def Leppard and producer Mutt Lange came into their own. Focusing less on raw energy and more on pristine melodicism, they created a gleaming tower of pop-metal.
ZZ Top (1983): ZZ Top traded their blues stylings for synth-driven pop on the MTV-conquering 'Eliminator,' and in effect became arena-filling pop stars. But beneath all that new polish was the same ol' boogie that helped define them a decade before.
David Bowie (1983): David Bowie's decision to work with Nile Rodgers, and by extension his suave and funky band Chic, gave this album a sleek approachability in keeping with the times - and Bowie his biggest hit ever. A dash of grit comes courtesy of guest guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, then largely unknown.
Dio (1983): After extremely productive stints as lead singer for Rainbow and Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio stepped out on his own and delivered another masterpiece right out of the gate with 'Holy Diver.' The still-ubiquitous title track and "Rainbow in the Dark" get all the attention, but the entire album is worthy of your time.
Iron Maiden (1983): Iron Maiden's most famous lineup finally locked into place on their fourth album with the arrival of the technically dazzling Nicko McBrain. Meanwhile, on his second studio effort with the group, Bruce Dickinson proves himelf an important songwriting partner as well as one of the genre's best singers on tracks like "Revelations" and "Die With Your Boots On."
Stevie Ray Vaughan (1983): All of the guitar gods were gone, or otherwise occupied. Drum machines had replaced stomping feet. There were synthesizers instead of someone slapping on the 88s. Into this unlikeliest of scenarios stepped Stevie Ray Vaughan.
The Police (1983): The ultimate lesson on leaving at the top of your game, the Police's last album is a dark and complex masterpiece that was light-years from the reggae-infused punk of their first few records. But it was tuneful and accessible enough to sell eight million copies and have four smash hit singles.
Metallica (1983): The future kings of metal went all Nuke LaLoosh and announced their presence with authority on their debut album, mixing breakneck speed with technical precision to help create the thrash genre on "Hit the Lights," "Whiplash" and "Seek & Destroy."
Billy Joel (1983): As he was falling in love with supermodel Christie Brinkley, Billy Joel looked back at the rock and soul music of his youth on 'An Innocent Man.' It spawned three Top 10 hits and remained on the charts for more than 100 weeks.
Motley Crue (1983): Motley Crue's relentless, riff-filled second record immediately catapulted them into hard rock superstardom, and remains their masterpiece. Some of us (definitely not all of us) think they even managed to out-do the Beatles with their scorching take on "Helter Skelter."
Billy Idol (1983): As immediate as this album sounds, it's easy to forget that Billy Idol had to perfect quite a complex formula to create 'Rebel Yell.' Punk attitude, metal guitar, pop smarts, soulful vocals - and yes, the accompanying MTV-ready visuals - all blended together in perfect doses to create this essential '80s sensation.
Yes (1983): Yes’ best-selling U.S. single ever, “Owner of a Lonely Heart” shot to No. 1 on the strength of its new-wave attitude then its weirdly transfixing video - and this legacy group was reborn for a new age.
Van Halen (1984): For his band's sixth album, Eddie Van Halen pulled out a synthesizer, wrote songs rather than riffs and changed the group's fortunes. It eventually tore apart the band (David Lee Roth was gone the next year), but it left us with classics like "Jump," "Panama" and "Hot for Teacher."
The Cars (1984): Trading in the edgy new wave sound of their earlier triumphs, the Cars enlisted now-mega-producer Mutt Lange to help produce something poppier, glossier and arguably even more radio-friendly. Naturally, it sold a bazillion copies. Sadly, it was also pretty much the end of the group.
Twisted Sister (1984): After years of slowly conquering the Long Island and New York metal scene, Twisted Sister grabbed the brass ring with their third album's undeniable twin anthems, "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "I Wanna Rock." In retrospect, the only shame is that those pop-tinged hits drowned out the rest of this impressive album's more diverse and aggresive songs.
Bruce Springsteen (1984): The moment where Springsteen became the biggest rock star on the planet. And he managed it with one of his best set of songs - all rage, sorrow and nostalgia for better days. A landmark record of the '80s and a timeless classic.
Metallica (1984): Metallic fearlessly left the pioneering style of their barely-a-year-old first album far behind with their sophomore effort. Happily, the dramatic advances in production values and songwriting complexity did absolutely nothing to diminish the band's primal fury.
Talking Heads (1984): One of rock's greatest live albums, by one of rock's greatest live bands. Talking Heads were full into their expanded lineup when they recorded their concert movie and this excellent soundtrack, which rework their already formidable catalog into dizzying new heights.
Bryan Adams (1984): 'Reckless' had peaked, it seemed, outside the Top Five in January 1985. But Bryan Adams kept releasing songs, and they kept becoming hits, and pretty soon his album had not only reached No. 1 but had become the first by a Canadian to sell one million copies in his home country.
Don Henley (1984): If this synth-laden, distinctively modern album was your first taste of Don Henley, you might have found it difficult to believe he was once a country-rock pioneer with the Eagles. But beneath that '80s veneer, Henley's familiar songwriting strengths emerge.
Los Lobos (1984): Before they started exploring meticulously crafted soundscapes in the studio, and before they hit No. 1 with their cover of "La Bamba," Los Lobos made one of the '80s' best roots records. Smart, sharp ... and you can dance to it.
John Fogerty (1985): After a 10-year vacation from music, Fogerty returned with his most Creendence-like set of songs since he shut down the band in the early '70s. It's a self-referential work, with lyrical and musical quotes to his CCR days, and a renewed sense of purpose from one of rock's greatest songwriters.
Tom Petty (1985): Petty explores the South and his connection to it, while also enlisting Eurythmics Dave Stewart to produce a handful of mind-warping tracks. It's not Petty's most focused album (and he and his band fought during its completion), but it's an interesting '80s sidetrack.
Dire Straits (1985): Mark Knopfler polished and fine-tuned the tracks on 'Brothers in Arms' to the point where they sounded like perfectly constructed packages of the digital future. All that airlessness would be stifling if the songs ("Money for Nothing," "So Far Away," "Walk of Life") weren't so great.
Sting (1985): After dissolving the Police, Sting hooked up with some of jazz's hottest young guns for his first solo album. 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles' falls somewhere in between the two genres, creating a unique sound and some of the decade's most pointed social commentary.
John Mellencamp (1985): Mellencamp got serious and political on his eighth album, an exploration of deep-rooted Americana that he had first played around with on "Pink Houses" a couple of years earlier. The former John Cougar got even rootsier on the follow-up, 'The Lonesome Jubilee,' but 'Scarecrow' is where it all comes together for him.
Tom Waits (1985): Waits began transforming himself from boozy beatnik to avant-rock weirdo around the turn of the decade. On 'Rain Dogs' he completely gives in to his weirdo side. Trashcan percussion, bullhorn vocals and a Keith Richards cameo - all-around brilliant.
Bob Dylan (1985): This box (originally five LPs) gathers more than 50 songs from Dylan's first three decades - nearly half of them never released or collected on album. It's a riveting portrait of one of music's most influential figures.
Metallica (1986): On their third album, Metallica perfected the thrash assault they were working their way up to since the decade's start. It influenced tons of other likeminded artists, and, more importantly, on songs like the battering title track, it runs circles around the rest of '80s metal.
Van Halen (1986): On this fanbase-polarizing but ultimately undeniable album, Van Halen take full advantage of new frontman Sammy Hagar's considerable vocal abilities, expanding their range on songs like the soaring "Dreams" and the surprisingly sophisticated "Best of Both Worlds."
Peter Gabriel (1986): After four albums of demanding art-rock, Gabriel switched gears a bit on his fifth solo LP (and the first to feature an actual title). Its mainstream success - thanks to hit singles "Sledgehammer" and "In Your Eyes," among others - proved that even intimidating '70s prog-rockers could be world-dominating pop stars.
David Lee Roth (1986): Diamond Dave sure seemed screwed after acrimoniously leaving hard rock's best and most popular act at the height of their fame. But shockingly, while his former battery mate Eddie Van Halen experimented with keyboards and (gasp!) maturity, Roth recruited a three-headed monster of a band and beat his old crew hands down in terms of pure rock thrills.
Bon Jovi (1986): With the possible exception of U2, there isn't a band that was more honest about priortizing world domination than Bon Jovi circa 1986. Purists cried foul over the band's carefully calculated, literally focus-grouped songcraft and mom-friendly sound. But over 12,000,000 people ignored those haters and made Bon Jovi the biggest band of the decade.
Motorhead (1986): We realize we're courting controversy by choosing this over 'Ace of Spades,' but it's not a stunt. There's something just foreign enough about the production on this one to cast Motorhead's awesomely predictable sound in a whole new light. Plus, the first five songs are sequenced together so tightly it's like hearing the 'Abbey Road' medley on amphetamines.
Paul Simon (1986): Nobody's done more for world music than Simon, who enlisted South African musicians to liven his greatest solo LP. 'Graceland' is a joyous, super-catchy collection of songs about growing up, growing old and seizing the moment. Forget the controversy; this is music to get lost in.
Def Leppard (1987): No album defines the sound of the '80s more than this gazillion-selling hit. With Mutt Lange again behind the boards, Def Leppard crafted a set of polished pop-rock gems (like the eternal "Pour Some Sugar on Me") that glisten beneath the weight of their stellar hooks.
U2 (1987): U2's masterpiece sounds epic from the very first notes of the opening "Where the Streets Have No Name." Bono and band made their legend here, on their fifth album, with shimmering guitars, arena-shaking hooks and a soundscape as big as their imaginations would allow.
The Cult (1987): Ever wonder how Jim Morrison would sound fronting early-70's AC/DC? Luckily, with help from Rick Rubin's spartan production methods the Cult tried that look out for this one glorious album. It fit perfectly, so naturally they changed their style again the next time out.
Guns N' Roses (1987): Guns N' Roses busted outta Los Angeles like they had something to prove. Before Nirvana got around to killing hair metal once and for all, GNR got in the first blow on this still-powerful debut assault of riffs, hooks and attitude.
John Mellencamp (1987): Mellencamp dove deeper into the introspective socio-political themes he’d begun exploring with 1985’s 'Scarecrow,' even as rootsier sounds - accordion, melodica, fiddle - moved to the fore.
Warren Zevon (1987): Fresh out of rehab, Warren Zevon rediscovered his muse and savage wit on 'Sentimental Hygeine.' It was recorded with an all-star cast, including Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Don Henley and members of the Heartbreakers and R.E.M.
Bruce Springsteen (1987): After the massive success of 'Born in the U.S.A.,' Springsteen scaled back his music and changed his focus. The result was a stunning song cycle about the pitfalls of falling in love when you're not emotionally ready for it.
Joe Satriani (1987): Steve Vai and Kirk Hammet's former guitar teacher proves that guitar wizardy is about 100 times more impressive when paired up with great songwriting on his commercial breakthrough, 'Surfing With the Alien.' Plus, for crying out loud, the guitar is laughing like a chimpanzee with hiccups at the end of the title track!
Robert Plant (1988): After too long ignoring everything that came before, Plant begins a tentative return to his Led Zeppelin legacy by way of a couple of collaborations here with Jimmy Page. At the same time, a group of younger collaborators goosed him into exciting new sounds.
Eric Clapton (1988): One of rock's first box sets of the CD era, and still one of the best. Collecting material from Clapton's vast career - including the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Cream, Derek and the Dominoes and solo material - 'Crossroads' included enough previously unreleased tracks to entice old fans.
Living Colour (1988): Living Colour obliterated the lines between rock, funk, metal and jazz on their debut. 'Vivid' took on topics like racism, slumlords and celebrity culture while giving some of the decade's most accessibly complex music.
Jane's Addiction (1988): Jane's Addiction were too artsy to fit in with L.A.'s metal scene, too heavy to be part of the alternative club. So they basically became their own entity, combining Zeppelin-sized riffs with tricky art-rock poses on their classic studio debut.
Metallica (1987): Metallica's fourth album (and first to feature Jason Newsted on bass following Cliff Burton's death) expanded the ideas and sprawling set pieces found on the band's earlier LPs. For years, fans have complained about 'Justice''s thin production, but that doesn't take anything away from epic songs like "One."
Keith Richards (1988): Mick Jagger had issued his platinum-selling solo debut in 1985, but to this point Richards had refrained from working outside the framework of the Rolling Stones. 'Talk is Cheap,' a brilliantly nasty little aside that went gold, equalized things - and the Stones were back on track for an improbable reunion that continued into a new millennium.
Traveling Wilburys (1988): When needing a b-side, George Harrison roped in Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne and wound up with a full album, While supergroups often disappoint due to a desire to overwhelm, the Traveling Wilburys succeed because they kept things loose.
Lou Reed (1989): The last best thing that Lou Reed ever did, 'New York' (with its flinty ripped-from-the-headlines references like the "Statue of Bigotry") helped nudge rock toward a better self - even as it put a period on what had become a deeply overindulgent period in American history.
Tom Petty (1989): Although this was Petty's first solo album, all of the Heartbreakers but drummer Stan Lynch played on it. Produced by Jeff Lynne, it contains some of Petty's biggest hits, including "I Won't Back Down," "Running Down a Dream" and the majestic "Free Fallin'."
Don Henley (1989): Henley shifted priorities from decadent rock star to socially aware crusader sometime in the '80s, and on his best album, he chronicles the effects of eight years of Reaganomics on his struggling Everyman. He catalogs matters of the heart too, but the pained title track sums up the decade's dashed dreams.
Aerosmith (1989): After spending the first half of the '80s barely visible, Aerosmith staged a comeback with 1987's 'Permanent Vacation.' But it's 1989's 'Pump' that sealed it. The slickly produced but hook-stuffed album kicked off the band's most commercially successful era, culminating in multiple chart-topping hits.
Bob Dylan (1989): Dylan gave in to worry, seeming to rebuke everything he'd preached on hope-filled albums like 'Saved' - not to mention his goofball turns with the Traveling Wilburys. The result was a late-period classic, governed by producer Daniel Lanois' atmospheric process.
Motley Crue (1989): Already riding an impressive streak of multi-platinum albums, Motley Crue really buckled down for their fifth album. They got sober and brought in producer Bob Rock to tighten up their songs and pump up their sound. Their hard work was rewarded with five hit singles and the biggest-selling album of their career.
Neil Young (1989): The artistic reemergence hinted at on Neil Young's rootsy 1988 return to Reprise, ‘This Note’s for You,’ was realized a year later with ‘Freedom’ - his most varied, most topical, most complete work since the ’70s.

As the video description points out, this performance uses a different backing track for him to sing to than the one found on the record, also making it extra special.
Fame, what you need is in the limoFame, what you get is no tomorrow
If this track, that Carlos Alomar guitar strut, and that rhythm section don't make you at least think about clucking around your hab unit like a funky chicken, you ain't doin' it right.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tonight was all about the crunch. That’s it, serve up whatever you want, as long as it’s crunchy AF.
People ran with the theme. But what seemed straightforward ended up being a hurdle for half of the contestants.
The judges wouldn’t be satisfied until their damn teeth shattered, it seemed.
Straight out the gate Callum got working on chilli crab. But things got awkward when Jock reminded him people won’t actually be eating the shell, meaning the only really crunchy component of the dish was… the onion rings.
The challenge seemed like Hayden’s to win… if it were last Sunday.
Unfortunately for him, he cooked a curry (!) in a crunch challenge (!!) and the only crunchy element on his plate were the papadams (!!!).
At least Kumar was pleased.
Pasta obsessive Laura pretended to step outside her comfort zone with yet another dough dish, but – get this – it was fried. She called it gnocco fritto but we weren’t fooled.
The next challenge was the gooey food challenge, and it was at that moment Jock decided he’d share a certain anecdote with the contestants and us at home.
Jock’s gloating about eggs didn’t help Dani in the gooey challenge, and she was booted, immunity pin and all.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite being an off week for SNL’s slate of increasingly enjoyable at-home episodes, the show posted a few cut-for-time sketches over the past few days to fill the void left by its newest star, Kate McKinnon’s cat. This one, of Beck Bennett giving a realistic (if not somewhat melancholic) quarantine home tour for Architectural Digest, made it clear quite quickly that this ain’t no stinkin’ Brooklyn Heights walk-up. “This is kind of like a pile,” he tells the camera. “This is sort of an organic thing. This is a crack in the wall.” It got us thinking: Which other SNL cast members fled to L.A.when the coronavirus pandemic began? Let’s see. Kyle Mooney? Definitely. Chloe Fineman? For sure. Colin Jost? Ha ha, of course, you forget whom he’s engaged to. To be fair, a bicoastal life sounds terrific, as does “never painting over the smudge.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dylan Slocum is quoting Samuel Beckett and contemplating Armageddon. Neither of these things will come as a huge surprise to diehard fans of his band, Spanish Love Songs. The uninitiated, too, will soon learn that this is just the kind of guy he is.
The LA transplant is currently “home” in Iowa, living in the basement of his bandmate and partner Meredith Van Woert’s parents’ house, hopefully before a permanent move to Pittsburgh. Only ‘hopefully’ for now, depending on the reaction to their latest album Brave Faces Everyone. There’s also, of course, the distinct possibility that someone somewhere gets an itchy trigger finger and presses the big red button, bringing the world to an untimely and abrupt end…
“There’s a line in [tragi-comic Beckett play] Waiting For Godot,” Dylan begins, chuckling as he does, “and it goes: ‘Let us not then speak ill of our generation, it is not any unhappier than its predecessors,’ and I really feel that. I think that basically every time before now has been just as awful as the time we’re living in. Every generation has felt like the world is ending, but at the same time, this feels worse. You can’t escape the feeling that maybe this is it for us.”
If it sounds like the Spanish Love Songs vocalist and guitarist must be a riot at parties, rest assured he also does a fine line in self-deprecation, acutely aware of the absurdity of talking about this high-minded stuff in relation to some über-personal, super earnest, blue-collar punk rock songs. Even if those songs are often rooted in all-too relatable misery and despair, there’s a spirit of defiance and fight in their hearts. The very real and rising threat of climate change may be exacerbating the same old end-of-days concerns that plagued previous generations, but Dylan isn’t so sure he subscribes to an entirely fatalistic, all-hope-is-gone outlook. ‘On any given day, I’m a 6/10’ he sings on the first line of opening track Routine Pain – a nod and tribute to a sentiment expressed by late Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison in his last interview, shortly before he took his own life in the spring of 2018 following a long battle with depression.
“I’ve realised that everybody is basically miserable everywhere. That’s the default standard,” Dylan explains of the tone he wanted to set from the off on these songs. “I joke about being a 6/10, but a lot of people I know are that or worse every day. And so that definitely played into the development of the album. Six to me is pretty great. It’s funny how that little joke is my life now, though – that’s my worldview.”

Increasingly, this worldview is one being shared by many, as the band – completed by guitarist Kyle McAulay, bassist Trevor Dietrich, and drummer Ruben Duarte dovetailing Meredith’s keys and Dylan’s frontman duties – continue to rapidly pick up new converts to their realist cause, having broken through with rafts of similarly-minded sensitive souls on 2018’s Schmaltz, prompting their signing to Pure Noise. Not that the singer had any idea that that’s what he’d be getting himself into.
“We didn’t realise that this would be our appeal,” he insists, “but what we’ve learned is that we’re helping people not feel alone. We have people share the most intensely personal stories with us, because they’ve responded to something in our songs. It’s truly a blessing.”
For years, Dylan tried to run away from this talent for helping people. He refers to pursuing Spanish Love Songs as a “dumb” move and repeatedly calls himself an “idiot” for picking up a guitar and singing songs for a living. Again, anyone familiar with his lyrics will know that beating himself up appears to be his favourite sport, but he’s tried not playing music before and failed. Like it or not, this is who he is and the compulsion doesn’t look likely to leave him any time soon. After finishing his studies at film school, he broke up his old band and instead tried his hand at freelancing as a director’s assistant in Hollywood (he even has his own IMDB page). He also worked for a board game design company. Then he tutored spoiled rich kids through their SATs, most memorably the son of the (American football team) Detroit Pistons’ owner. It was a grubby insight into a world at odds with his core values, however.
“He was like, the one per cent of the one per cent,” he scoffs. “They had a servant’s house on their property. He was an asshole billionaire, but we know where we stand on those people. It’s weird seeing a child grow up in that environment. If the world’s not beating you down constantly, I basically don’t trust you (laughs)!”
Other than Meredith, all of Spanish Love Songs are in their thirties now, so they’ve lived some life, and they know who and what they are. “At our age, if we put out a bad album, we’re done,” Dylan acknowledges of the unforgiving nature of the music industry. It’s an attitude that comes through in their bruised but big-hearted songs, filled with humanity yet also with subject matter hewn from life’s darker edges, encompassing themes of mental health, poverty, medication and ennui. Schmaltz was Dylan’s almost reluctant “last shot at this”, but when that roll of the dice paid off, it made making Brave Faces Everyone an intense experience fraught with a fresh sense of pressure. Suddenly the band had the support of a newly expectant record label behind them, alongside a growing legion of fans. Last September, then, following Dylan’s three-week long summer writing sessions in Iowa, they borrowed serial GRAMMY-nominated producer Howard Benson’s studio, West Valley Recording – a favour to Trevor, who used to work there – where platinum records by Kelly Clarkson and My Chemical Romance’s Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge glowered down at them from the surrounding walls. Dylan only wrote 14 songs, but discarded hundreds of ideas (“sometimes you’ve got to recognise a turd when it comes along, which is most of them!”). The resultant 10 represent his and the band’s best efforts – take ‘em or leave ‘em.
“We started this band with zero expectations, and we’ve kind of stumbled into things,” he stoically accepts. “We are not owed anything cool or anything good. So anything good that happens is truly amazing.
“But we’re all overachieving students,” he adds. “Every single person in our band is like a good student who just wants to please the teacher. And our fans are the teachers now, so we don’t want to let them down.”
Despite that will to please, Dylan isn’t getting his hopes up too high. Like any truly damaged individual, he instead prefers to continue expecting the worst so that he can only be pleasantly surprised.
“If people hate it, then we finally won’t ever have to do this again,” he says, only half-jokingly. “That’s kind of liberating. I truly think we’re a good band, but I also would not be surprised if people didn’t like us. I expect everybody to hate everything. Because as much as I try to fight it, that’s my default mode.”

It’s hard to imagine a world where Brave Faces Everyone does anything but build on the band’s momentum, however. These are, after all, comforting songs perfect for the uncertain times we’re all living through. There’s no judgement in the observations of their protagonists’ weaknesses. There’s compassion and a plea for empathy, to be better, and maybe even some hope by the time that titular closer sends it home.
“I understand this desire to numb out the pain entirely, because the world is scary and it’s getting scarier,” Dylan says. “These songs understand that. So let’s talk about why we do these things. By the end it’s basically saying that nothing is wrong with you. Life is hard, but that’s where I think the positivity comes from. People still laugh when I call this a positive album, but honestly, I am an optimist.”
Hey, maybe it will soon be the end of the world as we know it, but despite how it might seem, Spanish Love Songs feel fine.
Spanish Love Songs’ latest album Brave Faces Everyone is out now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Percival Everett Has a Book or Three Coming Out</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once you’ve finished “Telephone,” the latest book by Percival Everett, you may be talking about it with another reader and finding that you disagree on what happened.
That is intentional.
“There are three different versions of this novel, they’re all published identically, and you can’t know which one you’re getting,” Everett said during a video interview from his home in Los Angeles. With an apologetic chuckle, he added: “It’s going to piss a lot of people off, I’m afraid.”
The author of more than 30 novels and collections of stories and poetry over the past 30 years, Everett, 63, has cultivated a reputation for his vast, genre-defying and sometimes gleefully unhinged body of work. Consider “Erasure,” a race-in-publishing novel with a Blaxploitation parody inside, or the absurdist “I Am Not Sidney Poitier,” narrated by a man named Not Sidney Poitier.
Then there are the even weirder, wilder works like “A History of the African-American People (Proposed) by Strom Thurmond, as Told to Percival Everett and James Kincaid” and “The Book of Training by Colonel Hap Thompson of Roanoke, VA, 1843, Annotated From the Library of John C. Calhoun,” a mock slave-owning manual Everett described as “my version of a horror novel.”
“Telephone,” however, represents something new. Part campus novel, part Western adventure, it follows Zach Wells, an unhappy geologist in the Los Angeles area who explains that “the only thing most of the students would remember would be the joke ‘schist happens.’” One day he finds “Ayúdame” written on a note tucked inside the pocket of an eBay purchase, and he sets out to help the person in need. This puts into motion Everett’s gripping finale — or, rather, finales — involving armed neo-Nazis, a taciturn foreign detective and an uncharacteristically bold poetry workshop.
The differences between the editions, which begin with the colophon, include extended or altered scenes and three distinct endings. The cover designs are nearly identical, but if you look closely, you can spot the differences.
“I think Percival, when he first suggested it, wasn’t sure that we would go for it,” said Fiona McCrae, his longtime editor and publisher at Graywolf Press. “We were worried, ‘Would we try people’s patience with this?’ But all of us were more intrigued than worried as the conversations went on.”
Different versions were sent to different outlets. “For the prizes, they were just given any copy,” McCrae said. “It could be that some judges are discussing the book, but they’re not all reading the same book.” Still, she and others at Graywolf weren’t sure when to let readers in on the surprise, if at all. The coronavirus outbreak changed that discussion.
“It was a secret,” Everett said. “But with the strangeness with the Covid-19 isolation, it was a decision in the house to do the reveal earlier than later. The title” — a reference to the children’s game where relayed messages become hopelessly distorted — “can’t make sense until you understand what has happened.”
He considers the book an experiment that plays with the idea of who’s in charge when reading. “I’m interested not in the authority of the artist, but the authority of the reader,” he said, enunciating in a deep, slightly gravelly voice. “I certainly know that many people will not see what I saw. And many people will see different things from each other. That’s the thrilling thing about making it. If somebody says, ‘Did you mean this something?’ I always say, ‘Yes.’”
Everett, who grew up in Columbia, S.C., has done everything from studying Wittgenstein to performing jazz guitar, casting flies to castrating bulls. Since 1998 he has taught writing and literary theory at the University of Southern California, where he holds the rank of distinguished professor. Three years ago he took up repairing mandolins and guitars in his workshop. Back when he lived on a ranch in the Moreno Valley, he trained horses and mules. Word got out — “unfortunately,” he said — that he might take kindly to other creatures in need of care.
“People would bring me, um, ducks,” he said. “And I would say, ‘I don’t want your duck.’”
But he’d prefer all that — the personal — to not be the focus. Indeed, any prolonged discussion around the work or its creator seems, at best, a reluctant professional concession. Everett, who is married to the writer Danzy Senna, comes across as a warm and generous conversationalist. But he expressed bafflement about “people’s deference to the artist when it comes to the intention and the construction of meaning.”
“I’m just a cowboy,” he said, though right now, because of coronavirus-related cancellations, he is holed up “being a schoolmarm” to their two sons, ages 11 and 13.
“There’s always new sides to him to unwrap,” said his longtime colleague and friend James Kincaid. “One of the things that interested me about his work was his resistance to automatic pigeonholing as African-American fiction.” He recalled going to bookstores with Everett and gradually realizing he wasn’t looking to see “whether they had his work, but where it was.”
It’s this rangy quality, perhaps, that thrills Everett’s readers. While he has been regarded by some as that dreaded type, the “writer’s writer” — “lesser-known,” “underappreciated,” “underrated” are all terms employed to describe his status — this is not the case in France, where his books are featured at bookstore tables alongside best-selling thrillers, his longstanding translator Anne-Laure Tissut said.
“His ability for systematic, pungent self-derision,” she said, “won him the heart of many a French reader.”
“He’s always being discovered,” said his publisher McCrae, who has shepherded 14 of his books since 1996. “I think once you’ve discovered him, you’re like, ‘How come he isn’t better known?’” For a while, she said, people “couldn’t quite define him. But now that’s the very thing that people marvel at.” Everett’s next book — “about lynching,” he said — has already been delivered and is set for release in spring 2021.
Anthony Stewart, a founder of the Percival Everett International Society and author of “Approximate Gestures,” a scholarly monograph on Everett’s work, believes that much of it is based on a basic idea: that black people are at least as complicated as white people.
“A lot of American art seems to overlook that simple fact,” Stewart added. “He writes about the experience of being black, but he does not write about the experience of being black as a problem to be solved or a condition to be endured.”
Speaking for himself, Everett sees his iconoclastic approach to work and life as deeply ingrained. “I can’t say that my breaking the rules was so much a protest as just a natural response to something that seemed arbitrary, and not only unfair, but unseemly,” he said, laughing. “Something stupid people might do.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chrissy Teigen really hates Love Island as she binge-watches series in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While in lockdown it’s safe to say that many of us are binge-watching as many series as we can and Chrissy Teigen is no different.
It seems the 34-year-old is giving the latest season of Love Island a try and we don’t think she likes it very much…
The model took to Twitter to share her thoughts on the winter edition which gave us the queen that is Shaughna Phillips.
And while most of the nation loved all of the villa-filled drama, it appears Chrissy didn’t like it at all.
Like, she really hated it.
Taking to Twitter she didn’t hold back as she said: ‘F***ing HATE this chick on love island. Won’t say what season but this makes me feel better.’
But Chrissy finally gave in as her fans quizzed her on which series she was referring to, she continued: ‘Ok fine it’s the newest season UK.’
She added: ‘Love Island: doyouknowwhatthoughlike doyouknowwhatthoughlike doyouknowwhatthoughlike doyouknowwhatthoughlike doyouknowwhatthoughlike doyouknowwhatthoughlike.’
Lots of her followers responded to her tweet, with many trying to guess who she could be talking about.
Hmmm, we wonder who Chrissy is referring to?
It comes after the mum-of-two admitted that she is loving life in lockdown.
Speaking with Ellen Degeneres during a joint video call chat with John Legend, Chrissy explained: ‘It’s weird how much more energy I have.
‘I feel like a real housewife now, because I spent three hours on my makeup, did nothing to my hair but I’m pretending that it’s just casual.’
She continued: ‘You go through these ups and downs. What we’re going through right now is unprecedented, it’s unreal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NOS4A2 Is Back To Be Weirdly Obsessed With Christmas Again In This New Teaser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If Dracula has taught us anything, it’s that evil vampires have a really hard time staying dead. It just doesn’t stick. So, of course Charlie’s back. Call it a Christmas miracle.
Yesterday, AMC released a teaser for the second season of NOS4A2, the supernatural drama based on the Joe Hill novel that stars Zachary Quinto at his most massively unhinged as Charlie Manx, an evil vampire murderer who really, really loves Christmas. Last season, he died, but he didn’t die so good, so he’s back to his old shenanigans, taking children to Christmas Land, murdering, etc.
Whether you’re naughty or nice, you can agree this new season looks absolutely unhinged, as Minx and Vic (Ashleigh Cummings) continue their duel to the death against a wintry backdrop that seems to include swords, screaming, and a lot of vampires.
It’s not quite Christmas in July, though; the season premiere of NOS4A2 airs on June 21st.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Being with Sarah now the best moments in Matteo's life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All of them were not able to have their usual honeymoon because of the worldwide corona health crisis.  For Matteo G., he says that although they were not able to have the usual honeymoon elsewhere, the days he is now spending with his wife are still “the best moments of my life”. 
In a Facebook Live chat for a product he is endorsing, he was asked how married life is and he quickly replied: “It’s great! It’s amazing! I recommend it to all my friends. I was talking nga to my other batchmates, about married life. At sabi ko, ‘Bro, I think you should get married too, man.’ I don’t know, maybe I’m just in my honeymoon stage or I’m still in the beginning of my marriage, but you know, it’s amazing to wake up, to sleep beside the person you love the most.”
He considers his wife Sarah a real blessing. “Yes she’s a real blessing, kasi kumbaga, I found my partner. You know, there are just so many things we can do together and so many things we can achieve together.”
So he doesn’t mind if the lockdown came so soon after their wedding? “Siempre we’re worried din, but staying home also makes you learn about yourself so much more and you learn also about humility so much. One thing I learned, you are not always right, because the wife is always correct.”
He laughs but quickly adds. “But on a serious note, you know, you really learn how to balance things and when to just give in, or just how to agree. We are given more time by the ECQ to just focus on each other and learn how to be more patient and all these things. It’s a nice phase kumbaga. Being with my wife, it’s also in a way, a blessing in disguise that we have an extended honeymoon. It’s a time na we’re really “locked-in” in our place and we’re getting to know each other more and more every single day. That’s the interesting part. We even take turns sa pagluluto ng meals namin.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Matt Lucas always has same reply when mistaken for Rebel Wilson in Pitch Perfect</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ok, we admit it, lockdown has made us fall a little bit in love with Matt Lucas.
Not only is the comedian the undeniable star of the moment, but within minutes of our call to him at his LA home, he’s got us singing about baked potatoes.
No, isolation hasn’t driven us completely crazy (yet). We’re doing it because that’s what his catchy charity single, Thank You Baked Potato, is all about.
Last month, Matt posted a clip of himself singing the hilarious song about the do’s and don’ts of these strange times (a reworked version from his early days on Shooting Stars).
Since then, it’s gone stratospheric with 3.1 million views (last time we checked – and counting).
Then came duets of the song with music megastars Brian May and Gary Barlow, a No 1 chart spot and a new picture book, with all profits from the story and book going to the FeedNHS fund, which provides hot meals for hospital staff.
But Matt’s not stopping his cheer-up mission there. His new Channel 4 lockdown entertainment programme, Reasons To Be Cheerful, is on the air, featuring chinwags with his famous pals and laugh-out-loud isolation stories from up and down the country.
Then, fresh from a Little Britain reunion with David Walliams, there’s the small matter of taking on another iconic show, as Matt’s replacing Sandi Toksvig on The Great British Bake Off. If the last few weeks are anything to go by, he’s certainly going to rise to the challenge.
Where do we start?!
I know! It’s all very unexpected. I was due to be filming a TV pilot in America, so I was in Chicago for less than 48 hours and then I had to come back home. It meant I actually had some time and I wasn’t sure how to fill it.
I spent the first three or four days in shock, really, and then I sat down at my piano and played a new version of an old song of mine. I put it on Twitter thinking maybe a couple of hundred people would see it…
But then it blew up…
Yes, there’s been such a warm and unexpected response. A couple of days after I released the song one of my friends said, ‘Why don’t you bring it out as a charity single?’
At the same time I got a phone call asking me to get involved in FeedNHS, so the idea made absolute sense. Now, we’ve got a book coming out, which is really beautiful. It’s the song with illustrations and a part with things for kids to do. There’s also a cuddly toy, which plays the song, and T-shirts.
How did you rope in all the stars for the duets?
It all started with Gary Barlow. Once we’d done that and it worked so nicely, I thought I’d be a bit bold and write to some other people.
We’ve had Ronan Keating, Rick Astley and Brian May. We have more coming, who I’m big fans of, but I’m keeping them a secret…
Who’s top of the wish list?
Prince Charles. That’s my dream. Just to get Prince Charles to say, ‘Thank You, Baked Potato’ would be amazing.
How are you finding lockdown life?
The other day I did an interview for Australian TV via Skype. I set my alarm for just a few minutes before then did it straight away.
Afterwards I looked in the mirror and I had pillow crevices all over my face. I don’t know whether you could see them on the TV, but it would have been clear I’d woken up only 90 seconds before!
What else is keeping you busy?
I was meant to start filming Bake Off this week, but because that’s been delayed, C4 asked if I’d like to do a different show while we wait. So that’s how we came up with Reasons… – a lovely mix of C4 faces showing us how they’re staying cheerful in lockdown, mixed in with viewers being resourceful while still having fun and smiling.
I saw a wonderful clip of someone who had set up a skiing course in their garden – just brilliant!
What are you most excited about being on Bake Off?
Eating cake! There’s no downside to that. And not just normal cake – we’re talking the best cakes in the country.
I’ve been warned I’m going to put on a lot of weight when I film the show, so I’m going to have to train very hard during the week with a strict fitness regime so I don’t balloon any further than I have in captivity!
Are you any good at baking?
I’m terrible. Dreadful. I can bake a potato and that’s about it. But it’s a real treat. The phone call to audition came out of the blue.
I wasn’t really looking to be a presenter, but the show’s so wonderful that you say a million yeses. You can’t say no to Bake Off. It’s the show that makes me happy when I’m watching it.
Why was it the right time to bring Little Britain back?
David and I have been hanging out socially again for quite a while now because I’ve been spending a lot more time in the UK. We’d been talking a lot about bringing the show back in some form, whether on radio, TV or stage. But it was about finding the time.
Then we both got a phone call asking us what we could do for BBC One’s The Big Night In and we were able to do Little Britain TV stuff for the first time in 12 years, when the USA series ended.
It was so much fun – and also a great challenge to film it in lockdown.
What’s your favourite memory with David?
When I first knew him. We used to go out for an evening and he’d be wearing a black skirt, hair clips, and black lipstick. He had a girlfriend, but he would go out like that. I remember thinking it was outrageous, but brilliant.
How about the funniest fan encounter?
People would contact us saying, ‘I’m going to get a Little Britain tattoo!’ and I’d reply, ‘Don’t do that! What if you don’t find the show funny any more?’
But they’d still go ahead and do it. It was a mad time. People also send us YouTube videos of them acting out the sketches and now they’re lip syncing to them on TikTok.
Is it what you’re most recognised for?
I once walked into a Shake Shack in Hollywood and someone stopped me and said, ‘I loved you in Bridesmaids!’ Then in the queue someone said, ‘I love Little Britain’.
Then, while I was eating, someone came over to talk about Doctor Who and another person about Les Misérables. It was the weirdest thing – lots of people came to talk to me, but no two people about the same thing. I realised in that moment how lucky I’ve been. I never take it for granted.
Bridesmaids gave you a taste of Hollywood. What was it like?
It was just three days’ work. I flew out on the Saturday and came back on Thursday to film Come Fly With Me.
It was a quick little trip and I feel so lucky to have been a part of it. It’s where I met Rebel Wilson and that’s a friendship that goes to this day. We lived together for three years after Bridesmaids. And people think we’re the same person!
Really?
Sometimes people tell me they loved me in Pitch Perfect. I always say, ‘Yes, the make-up was brilliant on that job, wasn’t it?!’
When did you first know you were good at making people laugh?
When I realised I was bad at absolutely everything else!
What never fails to make you laugh?
People falling over. That’s why I like watching You’ve Been Framed.
Who’s the funniest person in your life?
My late husband Kevin. He was the funniest person I’ve ever met.
How about your comedy icon?
Growing up it was Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Reeves and Mortimer.
Right now, Peter Kay, a Scottish comedian called Limmy and I’d have to put David in there too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ice-T thinks life is pointless without sex</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - Ice-T doesn't see the point in living without sex.
The 62-year-old actor and rapper - who has children LeTesha (44) and Ice (27) from previous relationships and four-year-old Chanel with wife Coco Austin - insisted his advancing age doesn't mean he's slowing down in the bedroom and he credits his active lovemaking sessions for inspiring "everything".
He told Metal Hammer: "I just turned 62 and I'm still knocking it out the park. I can still make a baby through a brick wall.
"Once you stop having sex, I don't know what the reason is to be alive. To me, it's the energy that drives life and inspires everything else."
However, the Cop Killer hitmaker admitted he and Coco need to make "special arrangements" to get intimate because they share their bed with Chanel and their two dogs.
He said: "It's cute and funny because we're all romping around the bed. But at the same time, it's frustrating because we have to make special arrangements to have any kind of sex."
And the bedroom isn't the only place where Chanel has impacted on the couple's sex life because she's also taken over their giant indoor Jacuzzi with her pool toys.
Ice added: "My buddies told me, if you didn't have a baby, that pool would get somebody pregnant.
"But now, with Chanel here, we fill it up and it's like a mini swimming pool, so even though it's too cold to use the outdoor pool, we can still hang out in the family tub."
The family's home used to have two guest bedrooms, but they've now turned into giant closets for Coco - and Ice is delighted because it means they don't have to invite people to stay.
He said: "It's cool 'cos now when we have guests, there's no room for them so they have to stay in a hotel."
The couple don't invite friends over very often because Ice isn't very sociable.
He admitted: "I grew up around so many people at all times, now I like privacy.
"I probably won't have anybody over here for a couple of weeks But I don't do social things.
"I don't drink, I don't smoke weed. So what the f**k are we going to do? Know what I'm saying? I don't have social engagements I play video games."

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Murder Hornets’ Are Now In The U.S., What Does This Really Mean</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OK. The word murder is rarely a happy-go-lucky word, except in perhaps “murder mystery dinner party.” So when news broke over the weekend that “murder hornets” have been spotted in the U.S. for the first time, it caused quite a buzz. Not a good buzz as in what comes with some wine or a new BTS song. But more of a “what-else-can-go-wrong-in-2020-while-the-COVID-19-coronavirus-is-still-spreading-and-who-the-heck-keeps-buying-up-all-the-toilet-paper” buzz. Here’s just a sample of the response on Twitter:
In his tweet, actor Patton Oswalt went from bad to worse. Sure a fecal blizzard would be a (enter your favorite curse word for poop here) storm. But a Cats sequel like Cats: Endgame? That could be disastrous. As you can see, Oswalt referenced an article by Mike Baker in the May 2 edition of the New York Times, which is what generated the social media buzz this weekend and not the actual initial arrival of the hornets. This is actually slightly old news as a few of these hornets had been spotted in the northwest corner of Washington State this past fall. Perhaps the hornets could use some better public relations agents.
Having “murder” in your name certainly isn’t going to help your public face. It’s certainly worse than “nudge hornet” or the “would you like some pumpkin spice with that latte hornet.” It isn’t clear who did the negotiating for the hornets as this tweet asked:
Nevertheless, the hornets have earned their nickname. These hornets, which are the largest hornet species in the world, potentially growing to over two inches long, can be extremely aggressive. Just look at how they decapitate bees in mid-air in this BBC Earth Unplugged video:
Yep, the “Bee Afraid” headline in the video is right. Flying the “headless bee bodies back to their own nests to feed their own young,” is pretty darn gruesome.
These murder hornets are otherwise known as Asian Giant Hornets (no, Asian Americans have nothing to do with them), Vespa mandarinia, or yak-killer hornets.
Before you start equating the murder hornet threat with the COVID-19 coronavirus, don’t. The two are not comparable. The murder hornet is much, much, much less of an immediate threat to human life. The murder hornets are not big enough to decapitate humans, thank goodness. Instead, human deaths could occur via a sting that carries a venom, called mandarotoxin, which is a neurotoxin. It usually takes multiple stings to deliver a lethal dose for humans. However, if you are allergic to the venom, your risk of death can go much higher.
With the exception of those unlucky enough to get stung by them, the murder hornets are probably not an immediate threat to human health in 2020. Currently, there aren’t enough of these hornets around the U.S.. And they don’t seem to seek out humans to sting them like in some horror movie. Each year in Japan, several dozen people die from the hornet stings. That’s not insignificant but it certainly isn’t over 66,000, which is how many in the U.S. the COVID-19 coronavirus has killed already in just a few months. While you should stay as far away from these hornets as you can, you don’t have to clutch your blanket muttering “murder hornets, murder hornets” repeatedly.
The bigger concern is what these murder hornets will eventually do to the bee population in the U.S. As the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website explains, “pollinators, most often honey bees, are responsible for one in every three bites of food we take, and increase our nation’s crop values each year by more than $15 billion. However, honey bees have been in serious decline for more than three decades in the United States.” Having new Jack-the-head-rippers around certainly isn’t going to help this situation. Thus, the invasion of these hornets poses a longer-term threat to human health. If such hornets were to take hold in the U.S., it could eventually dramatically change the available plants and food here.
The key then is to stop the spread of these hornets and get rid of them and their nests before they reproduce and spread enough to the point that they can no longer be eliminated from this country. Therefore, speedy decisive action is required to make sure that this doesn’t become a broader, more difficult to deal with threat. Otherwise, lack of action today could take their toll on human health and many other things in the future. Sound familiar?

    <h5 class="mb-1">T-Pain proves he's the ultimate 'Animal Crossing' husband</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sure, Elijah Wood might be the model Animal Crossing visitor, but T-Pain has proven himself to be your ideal Animal Crossing husband.
The world at large first learned of this monumental fact just a couple of days ago when the rapper and R&B singer tweeted about the generous stimulus package that he left for wife, Amber Najm.
But there's much more to the story, as evidenced by this live stream of the two on Twitch just yesterday. In it, he enlisted fans to come to a house warming on Amber's brand new island. Speaking for everyone, commenter TonyDaddi wrote in the chat, "Just say the WORD WHAT U NEED MRS. PAIN."
T-Pain, the best provider and hype man one could ever ask for, told fans to come bearing gifts or GTFO. And sure enough, Amber was showered with a stockpile so enormous that it puts every other desert island getaway package to shame. 
Fans "made it rain" iron nuggets, a red kimono, various bugs, STAR FRAGMENTS (!!) — all made possible by the man best known for heavily auto-tuned tracks such as "Buy U a Drank." 
On top of everything, T-Pain also ensured that the moose villager on Amber's island would think twice before asking his wife to "take a nap" together, requesting his "alpha team" go out and use bug-catching nets on the harassing villager. That moose will surely think twice before propositioning a married woman ever again.
T-Pain's Twitch channel and Twitter feed are both full of all kinds of other relatable Animal Crossing content, too.
As someone who's pretty new to Animal Crossing himself, T-Pain was frustrated by the game's initially slow pace. Though, unlike the rest of us plebs just starting out, he has an army at the ready to turn him into a billionaire in no time.
We demand the T-Pain x K.K. Slider collab the world deserves now, please!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elton John is reflecting about life in quarantine while speaking with Zane Lowe on “Beats 1”.
“I’ve never lived like anything like this in my lifetime,” Elton said of the COVID-19 pandemic however he is looking at the silver lining that hopefully, it will bring everyone together.
“No matter what political party you are on, you have to listen to what [the experts] tell you,” he added.
The famed musician is isolating with husband David Furnish and sons Zachary, 9, and Elijah, 7, where they play Snakes and Ladders every weekend.
“To be honest with you, it has been great to spend this much time with my boys,” he continued. “It’s 24/7 with them and it’s been fantastic.”
He then joked, “I’m saying that after a week. Check on me in about three weeks.”
Elton did express that he is “saddest” about all the musicians and crew who live “month to month” that are suffering during this time. “I’m very lucky.”
He also had some advice for all the young people who, like him once, think they are “invincible.”
“This is a different situation that has ever happened before. You have to be very careful. Stick with your family…cherish it while you can,” he mused. “It gives us a chance to reflect on what life is all about…coming together as one is what I hope will be the result of all of this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Government funding flows to artists, like Musonga Mbogo, left in coronavirus limbo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Painter Musonga Mbogo is not very precious about his work, which he hangs on the back fence with clothing pegs while he paints on a new canvas, stripped from its frame and spread out on the ground in front of him.
"I like the idea of high art almost being treated like poorly, just as an expression of yourself in every possible way, almost. For me, I like fancy things, which is why I dress up kind of extra, but I try to acknowledge I came from a position where things weren't exactly that perfect. It's my way of holding close to where I came from and acknowledging where I want to go as well," Mr Mbogo said.
Mr Mbogo, 21, is one of 66 recipients of the ACT government's Homefront arts funding package, designed to keep artists, writers and musicians working during the global coronavirus pandemic which has caused major disruptions to the art world.
Arts Minister Gordon Ramsay said the ACT government had taken clear action to support artists with the $500,000 package.
"Support of up to $10,000 per artist will be used for activities including research and development, making of new works or sharing of works via online platforms, and for artists fees and living expenses to undertake arts activities," Mr Ramsay said.
"The government is a great supporter of Canberra's creative sector and I'm glad that this package will provide essential and immediate support to our artists during this difficult and challenging period."
Funding for visual artists, writers, film makers, musicians and sound artists has all been made available under the program, which received more than 370 applications.
Mr Mbogo, who will finish a degree in economics next month, said he would put the $3000 he received towards new materials and online courses to further develop his practice. He has never studied art formally - only taking the classes at school when they were compulsory - and said it was a surreal experience to have people invest in what he was trying to say.
"Art is a voice. For me, that's always what it's been about," he said.
Mr Mbogo is keen to stick at his work in Canberra, eager to be part of a creative expansion in the city as a new generation of artists, musicians and writers decide to stay longer and create work at home, rather than leaving for bigger cities.
"The city is kind of what makes you who you are, I just want to show people who I am, as opposed to kind of almost dimming that side of my life," he said.
"The African diaspora is growing up and I guess the way I see it, now we're coming into our own, being vocal, having our own voices in art, in music, in photography. In that way, you can see a shift in Australia as a whole. I kind of want to, in my own way, be a component - or at least inspire someone to take it further than we could."
Mr Mbogo, whose work was shown at the Melbourne Fashion Festival in 2018 and in an exhibition at the Nishi Gallery in 2019, cited American neo-expressionist Jean-Michel Basquiat as an important influence on his work.
"Just because, for me, I'd never seen a person of colour who had actually pursued art or who was embraced in the art world. And so maybe I was 14 or 15 years old when I was introduced to him. I think I was just going through Instagram, probably saw a photo, probably a friend of mine would have posted," he said.
"That was pretty much enough to have me interested in the art world, just to know that people who look like me can succeed."

The Belconnen Arts Centre has also provided support to five Canberra-based artists through its Going the Distance campaign, which directs all money raised to artists. Alex Asch, Jim Sharrock, Larry Brandy, Rebecca Taylor and Robbie Karmel will use the funding to present online projects.
The centre's artistic director, Monika McInerney, said there had been a high number of ambitious applications for the limited funding pool, but the projects which received support would seek to extend art practices onto the internet.
"I always feel that when you've seen the bushfires, or when you've seen any kind of major trauma that happens across the world, often its the art and the artists that helps the community to heal, help people to reinvent themselves, provide new perspectives," Ms McInerney said.
She said targeted arts funding was key because artists would generally not be able receive JobSeeker or JobKeeper assistance, and many other income streams, including teaching, were also affected by coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man claims he married Priyanka Chopra before Nick Jonas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A man claiming to be the first husband of Priyanka Chopra, the Bollywood beauty who went on to gain international fame, has crawled out of the woodwork….kind of.
You see it all began when model Chrissy Teigen, who also happens to be the wife of Grammy-winner John Legend, began a thread on Twitter, asking: “have you ever been famous but for like 1 minute? a talking head on an infomercial, in the background of a big movie? something u share with people at dinner parties but it's so stupid..I would like to see it (sic).”
Of all the responses that came forth, the one that has garnered the most attention is one by a man called Brandon Schuster, who recalled his meeting with Priyanka back in 2014. He had welcomed her to an event with a garland and somehow the reportage of the incident got mixed up. Soon, he was handing out ‘exclusive interviews’ to media, he said.
In his twitter post, Schuster explained: “I got “married” to Priyanka Chopra in 2014. I put two flower leis on her to welcome her to a “green carpet” event in Tampa. Little did I know that symbolized “marriage” in Indian culture. The Indian press had a field day with it and I was giving exclusive interviews the next day.”
The confusion draws from the fact that exchanging garlands is part of a Hindu wedding ceremony. Of course, without context, it means nothing.
Now that that’s sorted…Priyanka Chopra is actually married to Nick Jonas, of the Jonas Brothers band. The couple married in an elaborate series of ceremonies back in 2018.
These days the happy couple is self-isolating and Priyanka is getting her musician husband to give her piano lessons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Perfume Genius: 'I'm constantly demanding a big feeling'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Until recently, Mike Hadreas was not a particularly emotional person. That may come as a surprise to fans of Perfume Genius, the name under which he releases gorgeous, theatrical, emotionally raw music. “I think for a while my main emotions were either laughing, or just sort of irritated. The two modes, for years really,” he says.
But all of that has changed. He has moved cities, grown older, and learned how to dance. “Even though I feel kind of unhinged and confused, it’s where I need to be right now, and it’s part of me going somewhere else, somewhere better. For however long it is.” His new album, Set My Heart on Fire Immediately, is about this arrival of big feelings, and a hunger for human connection, but for now human connection is on hold.
We were supposed to meet in London at the beginning of March, but, with the global crisis growing, that was scrapped and now we’re talking over FaceTime. “I kind of had a little mini-panic this morning,” he admits. “It’s hard not to just go on your phone and just refresh everything to see what’s happening.”
It is early morning in Los Angeles, where Hadreas now lives. He is 38, but looks younger; on the screen, he cuts a gentle wary figure, softly spoken, though he grows more wry as the conversation unfolds.
Hadreas’s last album, 2017’s No Shape, turned him into one of alternative music’s biggest stars. Its grand, melodramatic songs popped up on blockbuster movie trailers, while his witty, arty tweets have amassed him almost a million followers.
Two years ago, he moved from Tacoma, Washington, a short drive from where he grew up in Seattle, to LA, with his long-term boyfriend and collaborator Alan Wyffels. (Hadreas has been with Wyffels, a classically trained musician, for 11 years; they are in each other’s company “24 hours a day”, and they have played every Perfume Genius show together.) Then, last summer, Hadreas collaborated with the choreographer Kate Wallich and the YC Dance Company on a dance piece called The Sun Still Burns Here, which they performed in New York. It made him realise he was looking for connection, that making music did not have to be so solitary. “Dance blew up so much for me,” he says. “[I started] really craving community, and being able to be present in the real world.”
Hence the title of the record he wrote shortly after it. Set My Heart on Fire Immediately is a demanding, grabby statement. “Because I get greedy,” he laughs. “I get a little of this good feeling and I’m like, well, I want to constantly be in that state.” For someone who has been used to having just two feelings, this is a confusing shift. “It feels really unhinged. If I don’t get it, I’m pissed! I’m constantly waiting and searching for and demanding a big feeling.”
When the new record was sent out to critics, it came with an essay written by the author of On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, Ocean Vuong, in which he notes that in Hadreas’s most recent work, “the body (queer, healing, troubled, wounded, possible and gorgeous) sings itself into its future”. Hadreas has often sung about his body, but says that now, he feels more in control of it, more inside it. “I’m always obsessed with this idea of leaving, and changing and shifting, and just blowing everything up and going. Before, I felt like I couldn’t be in my body and do that, but I’m starting to realise that I can.”
Has he always had a tendency to want to blow things up and leave? “Oh yeah,” he says. “I figured out when I was pretty young that drinking and going out and doing drugs and stuff will just give you a really full, 360-degree feeling. It is ultimately empty, but at least there is enough in the effect that you feel quiet and satiated for a long time. It comes with its own set of really horrible shit, too. It’s kind of a death wish, in a way.”
Hadreas only started writing songs when he got clean in his mid-20s, after he dropped out of art school and eventually moved home, and has been sober ever since. Until recently, he says, he would hide from the world when he wasn’t working, and nest at home with Wyffels, stop feeling so “wild”. “I stopped looking for big ‘feeling’,” he says. “But now I’m starting to realise that maybe there’s another way. I can have more, and keep everything.” Is that liberating? “I feel free, but I also feel that I have no idea what’s going on. Internally, externally. It doesn’t help that the whole world doesn’t, either. It’s in the air, too.”
On the sleeve of the new album, Hadreas is topless and muscular, covered in dirt. On previous albums, he has been androgynous, feminine, in makeup and heels; in the videos released so far, he embraces an ultra-macho look. “I wanted the cover [of Set Fire…] and the video to have that same thing, where it’s warm and nostalgic, but something’s not quite right. It’s hyper-masculine, but there’s something off about it.
“My presentation, and what I wear, there’s definitely a performative element to it and I love that. But also, at the core of it, is that it’s just what I feel like doing, and where I am at the moment.” This matches the music, which dips in and out of 50s ballads, 80s pop and theatrical, lilting Americana.
Hadreas has always sung about sex, and has never been one for coyness. A new song, Jason, recalls an encounter with a man who doesn’t bother taking his clothes off (“That’s one of the only songs that is really just a memory that I mined, and I told the story”). On one of his best-known songs, Queen, he sings about sexuality as a menace to straight society: “No family is safe, when I sashay.”
“[Sex] is an easy place to funnel a lot of things that I can’t explain into something that’s very physical,” he says. “And it’s much easier to put a beat on a song if it’s about sex. Even when I dance, it all comes from a low place,” he laughs, and gestures down. “I think that’s just the funnel.”
When he was a teenager in the 1990s, Hadreas loved female musicians who sang about sex frankly. “Liz Phair was just straight up saying some nasty shit to me, that was so empowering. When I first heard it, I was like...” He puts his hand to his mouth in mock fright. “I didn’t know you could say that.” He loved Alanis Morissette, whom he considers the mainstream version of Phair. “It had a little bit of that underneath. My mom listened to it. And I was like, but mom, she’s nasty! That’s what I liked, this angsty nastiness.”
That angsty nastiness continued to inspire him. “I think it is part of the reason I’m obsessed with sex as an idea,” he says. “When you’re a queer person, [sex] is what everyone says is the disgusting part of how you’re feeling. The wrong part, the dirty part. And I was 12. I hadn’t had sex with anyone, but I was told there’s something wrong with me, because of who I would want to have sex with eventually. It becomes such a loneliness and such a source of shame, and you start developing all these feelings around it before you’re even allowed to find out what it truly is!
“To hear people sing about sex, and women specifically singing about sex in an unapologetic way, where the dynamic was that they were on top, that was really revolutionary to me.”
I wonder how Hadreas feels about queerness becoming more mainstream in the entertainment world, even to the point of it becoming a commodity. “I mean, I try not to be bitter,” he smiles. “But if there is a gay award, I want it. If there’s a gay cheque, then write it to me! That’s how I feel.” He says this lightly. “I feel like queer voices are being heard more, because you can just speak out, and put it up online. I also feel like the gates are still closed, in a lot of ways, unless it’s beneficial to everybody to channel some specific, non-threatening version of queerness. But we need that, too. It’s a weird combination of things. People love queerness when it’s just adjacent to it. When someone’s playing with the idea, and not fully inhabiting it. I think it’s too threatening, when people are...” He reaches for a word, but only one will do. “Queer.”
As Perfume Genius, Hadreas fully inhabits all of it. Is he making the music that he would have liked to have listened to, when he was a teenager? “Yes,” he says, smiling. “I love that. I mean, that’s it, for me.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend? - Issue 322</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Is it a new week already? Insanity! Well, it’s the weekend, so that means your regularly scheduled WAYP has returned, right on time. The weather’s a bit brighter, and KFC is open again, so things are looking up, readers.
After finishing Dishonored 2 last week, I’ve been bouncing around different games. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is cool, but I didn’t have the patience for it. The Outer Worlds has disappointed me so far – it’s a bit bland. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla hype has pushed me into the bosom of Odyssey’s Kassandra, then. So far, so good.
Persona 5 Royal New Game Plus. Words that will no doubt send Sammy into a state of violent head shaking, but it must be done. Going through it again is interesting, you pick up on little details in environments and dialogue that hint at what's coming, and having such powerful personas right from the start is just dumb fun. I only need three more Trophies for the Platinum, so that's my excuse!
For once, I find myself free from the shackles of reviewing something, so I might actually play a game from my personal backlog this weekend. There's plenty to choose from, but one I definitely want to make time for is SUPERHOT VR. I've had it sat there unplayed for far too long. Meanwhile, I want to make sure I finish off Control, which I stopped playing about two thirds in. Hopefully I can stick with it and reach the end.
Since the release schedule has once again dried up, I’m killing time until The Last of Us: Part II releases. Despite loving the original, I’m not really feeling Persona 5 Royal at the moment so I’ve decided to start a Death March playthrough of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Now we’re talking!
This weekend I’ll be doing nothing but playing Persona 5 Royal, and I won’t rest until it’s done. I’m aiming for the Platinum in one run, and I think I’m nearly done. I’ll be sad to see the end of it, I’ve really enjoyed getting back with the Phantom Thieves and seeing all the new content. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.
A spectrum of opinion on Persona 5 Royal this week, then, and clearly the pick of our team. But what are you playing this weekend? You know what to do in the comments section below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mother and daughter team, Sammy and Honey, gave an emotional and golden buzzer worthy performance on “Britain’s Got Talent”.
As the duo took the stage, Honey, 14, revealed why they decided to compete.
“In the past couple of years my mom got diagnosed with cancer,” Honey said. “It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mom is the best thing that has happened to me. I never thought when me and my mom would be singing in the car that it would bring us to this stage.”
Yet, there first go wasn’t a success with judge Simon Cowell stopping them.
“I just don’t like the song but your voices work really well together, how would you feel about coming back later on today?” he asked.
And thank goodness they did because their second attempt where they sang “Lost Without You” by Freya Ridings landed them the golden buzzer from fellow judge Amanda Holden.
Alesha Dixon told the duo, “I just loved the connection, there’s nothing more beautiful than a mother, daughter relationship.”
Holden added, “Every single lyric that you got right and sang just seemed so poignant to your story it was the most wonderful thing to witness.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michelle Mone's mum looks young enough to be her sister at age of 71</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish entrepreneur and life peer Michelle Mone, 48, who has appeared on The Apprentice, Celebrity MasterChef and LooseWomen, defied everybody's expectations when, after dropping out of school, she set up her own lingerie business and built it from the ground up, all while raising three children.
For years she put her all into her job, but now finally feels like she's in a place to enjoy a work-life balance. Here, in her own words, she explain what she's learnt along the way...
Life doesn’t always go to plan
I was supposed to be getting married this weekend, but because of Coronavirus we’ve postponed our wedding until August. We’d spent almost two years planning it and we had a dream honeymoon booked to travel around the Far East.
It’s devastating, but it’s more important that our family and friends are safe. We were lucky we could postpone. I really feel for the couples who saved and saved and have lost money. I just want the world to get back to normal now.
As a child I was a real worrier
My little brother had spina bifida and passed away when I was nine. I always wanted to protect him. Aged 10 I started a paper round because I wanted to look after the family. I am just the same now.
Even though my kids are adults, I still go online and order them things like loo roll to make sure they have enough. I’m not a control freak, I just care about everyone.
Work the hardest you can
By the time I was 11, I’d got 17 teenagers working for me, delivering the newspapers. If I do something, I’ll do it the best and biggest or I won’t do it at all. I am all or nothing. When I was launching my lingerie business I was putting in 12-16 hour days, seven days a week, and bringing up three kids.
Don’t complain
My dad Duncan, 70, taught me that. He’s had the biggest influence on my life. He’s been in a wheelchair since he was 38 because of a disease on his spinal cord. He takes 30 pills daily and is in so much pain, yet he always puts a smile on his face. He’s incredible.
Use criticism to your advantage
I had to prove myself, I left school at 15, I didn’t go to university and I was from the East End of Glasgow. Everyone said, ‘She’ll never do it.’ But I was determined to prove them wrong and wouldn’t have anyone write me off. People used to look down on me, but that gave me more fight.
Have kids before your career gets started, or wait until your 40s when it’s well-established
I didn’t plan to be a young mum, but I had my daughter Rebecca aged 19, she’s now 26. I also have Bethany, 24, and Declan, 22. I had a global brand with three young kids running around my feet and it was bloody hard. But you find a way. It would have been easy to throw in the towel and give up, but I was determined to succeed for their future.
What is for you, won’t go past you
That’s what my granny told me. Don’t be desperate for someone to come into your life, if it’s supposed to happen, it will. I never thought I’d get married again. Then I met Doug.
We’d both invested in the same tech company and met at a dinner in 2016. I wasn’t ready for a relationship and said I wanted to just be friends. I was put off by how powerful and wealthy he was, because I’m independent.
But our kids – he has four – got us together. I fell in love with his kindness and sense of fun. He’s from Glasgow too, he’s seven years older, and has a massive heart.
Play the hardest you can
I love having fun. Before lockdown meant we were isolated at our home in the Isle of Man, I enjoyed nice dinners out. We love having people over for themed nights, maybe a Thai or a Scottish night, it just adds to the fun.
Now we invite lots of people to get together on Zoom instead. For about 20 years work burned me out. But I feel like I’ve got the work/life balance right now.
Mistakes are what shape you
Early on at Ultimo, we gave a contributor in Quebec credit and lots of stock, but didn’t do any due diligence on them. They ran away with £1.4million of our cash and 10 months of stock – it almost ruined the whole business.
After that I grew up fast and learnt about researching people properly. I felt like throttling them at the time, but I thank them for that lesson today, it made me a better businesswoman.
Treat your body like a business
I wouldn’t destroy my business, why would I spoil my body? Bad food makes me feel lethargic and bloated. If only I’d learned that years ago. Now I’m a size 10. But at my biggest I was an 18-20.
Weight loss is all about your mindset. For many years I put pictures of myself that I didn’t like in the kitchen, it put me off snacking. I’ve finally got to know my body and feel amazing in skinny jeans. I just need to be careful I don’t put it all back on now I’m hanging around the house all day.
Give something back
Try and do this every day. I enjoy mentoring people, and Doug and I are very involved with charities, including The Prince’s Trust and the Royal Marsden Hospital.
Here I am with my mum Isabel, who’s a very young 71
We’re on my hen night in Dublin at the end of January, before the Coronavirus crisis changed everything.
I am very close to my mum, she’s recently overcome breast cancer and was treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London.
She’s out of the woods now. I wasn’t sure whether she would be well enough to come, but look how amazing she is!
We had our hair and make-up done, drank pints of Guinness watching the rugby, enjoyed lovely meals with cocktails, then danced all night. Mum kept up with us all weekend.
Mum taught me to treat everyone the same, whether you’ve got a million quid in your pocket or a pound, whether you’re the Queen or the binman. I’ve instilled that in my kids, too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent: Mum and daughter become Amanda Holden's golden buzzer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mother and daughter act has become Britain’s Got Talent’s fourth golden buzzer act of the series.
Honey and Sammy from Essex wowed the entire audience with their heartfelt performance of Lost Without You by Freya Ridings.
And Amanda Holden was so impressed she gave them her one and only golden buzzer.
It was a truly emotional moment.
The first time the pair went on stage, the 14-year-old explained to the judges why they were there.
‘In the past couple of years my mum got diagnosed with cancer,’ Honey began.
‘It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best thing that has happened to me.
‘I never thought when me and my mum would be singing in the car that it would bring us to this stage.’
Although their audition didn’t go too well as Simon Cowell stopped them half-way through the song.
‘I just don’t like the song but your voices work really well together, how would you feel about coming back later on today?’ he asked them.
When Honey and Sammy came on stage later on that day, they came back with a vengeance .
The pair got amazing feedback from the judges, and it left Amanda reaching for the tissues.
‘After everything you have been through, you deserve that moment,’ Simon said.
‘I am going to remember this audition for a long long time.’
Alesha Dixon commented: ‘I just loved the connection, there’s nothing more beautiful than a mother, daughter relationship.’
Amanda added: ‘Every single lyric that you got right and sang just seemed so poignant to your story it was the most wonderful thing to witness.’
Other acts that audition for the judges on tonight’s instalment are 96-year-old Nora and a group of dancing turtles.
Britain’s Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BGT fans in tears as Simon Cowell halts mum and girl's audition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent viewers were in tears after Simon Cowell halted a mum and daughter's performance.
Honey and Sammy, aged 14 and 43 from Essex, pulled at the heartstrings as they opened up about their life.
The teenager revealed she came on the show with her mum, she said: "In the last two years my mum got diagnosed with cancer, and it's been like a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best things that's ever happened to me.
"I'm just so grateful for everything that's happening, I never thought when me and my mum were singing in the car we'd ever come on a stage."
But as they started singing, Simon halted their performance.
He explained that whilst they sounded good together, the song wasn't working for them.
Simon asked them to go backstage, learn another song and then come back.
Luckily, on their second attempt, singing Freya Riding's Lost Without You, they stole the show with their vocals.
They received four 'yes' votes and Amanda Holden gave the pair her golden buzzer.
Viewers were in tears over the whole situation.
Matt tweeted: "Well there I go again the # floodgatesof my tears overtook me again, that was beautiful just beautiful mum and daughter singing on # BGT."
Leanne said: "In tears over @ BGTalready, LOVED the Mother and Daughter melted me."
And Graham said: "Amanda Holden’s golden buzzer act has me in tears. What a beautiful mother and daughter. Beautiful song choice and beautiful voices."

    <h5 class="mb-1">How we stay together: 'I don’t want to just be flatmates. It’s got to be more than that'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Names: Julia and Paul Miller Years together: 29Occupations: Therapist and engineer
Hearing her future husband sing The Sound of Music’s My Favourite Things sealed the deal for Julia Miller.
The couple were finalising their wedding preparations, a stressful time made worse because Julia’s father was in the final stages of cancer. She was steeling herself for the inevitable, when late one night she got a prank call. After telling the random caller exactly what she thought of him, she was upset and couldn’t get back to sleep. And so Paul sang his favourite song, about whiskers on kittens and raindrops on roses, to soothe her. “That’s the moment that I knew he was the one for me,” she says now.
The Sydney couple will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in November. Yet when they first met, the then-21-year-old Julia wasn’t interested in Paul, who was 23.
She’d just come out of a bad relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. A mutual friend decided she needed a fling to cheer her up, so she set the couple up, organising a group date on a yacht. Reluctantly Julia went along.
But Paul was keen: “I thought she was hot when I saw her. I was interested right from the first second.” He was an experienced sailor so he hoped to impress her, even feigning a dangerous moment that he skilfully navigated. Julia remained oblivious. Undeterred, the mutual friend nudged them into a second date. And this time, when just the two of them went to the movies, it was more successful. “That’s when I thought ‘I like what he looked like, but actually I really like him. He’s a nice guy.’”
At the time Paul was living in Newcastle and Julia was in Sydney, but they spent as much time together as they could. They bonded over their similar upbringings and shared values and quickly realised they were right for each other. After six months they moved in together in Sydney. They were keen to get engaged too, but were conscious that others may think they were rushing. “I’ve still got the piece of paper where Paul wrote the plan of when we were going to get engaged, because he’s like that,” says Julia. Paul adds their courtship was “pretty quick” by “2020 standards”… “but I think in the late 80s it wasn’t probably too ridiculous.”
The lead-up to the wedding was stressful. Not only was Julia’s father battling cancer, their priest was unwell with a brain tumour and a close family member died suddenly. Then three days before the wedding, Julia went to pick up her dress only to find her dressmaker was ill and not even close to finishing it, or the bridesmaid dresses. In a mad dash, Julia roped every woman she knew to finish the dresses in time for the wedding day. “I got an ulcer. I definitely got cold sores the day before. But I lost a lot of weight so I was really skinny,” she says with a laugh.
The day itself went smoothly but all the stress taught the couple an important lesson. Julia says they learned “early in the piece how we would go through bad times together.”
Young, happy and in love, the first few years of their marriage was fun. They saved hard and travelled. About four years into their marriage, they had their first daughter. Things got trickier around the arrival of their second child. “When you have just one child it doesn’t affect you so much, but when you have a second one and each of you have to share the load a little bit more, it probably separates you a little bit more than you’re first used to,” remembers Paul.
They made an effort to spend as much time together as possible. It was something Julia had learnt from her own parents. “They’re the sort of people who had to make sure that they had time to themselves so to a certain extent they pushed the kids away,” says Paul. “A lot of that rubbed off on Julia, so she made sure that our kids didn’t get in between us. So I think that’s been a positive in our relationship.”
They were always careful to maintain affection. “My mum and dad were really, really affectionate,” says Julia. “I think when I first met Paul he was affectionate, but he wouldn’t kiss me in public. It took him a little while, and now I find he’s probably worse than me,” she laughs.
Both were determined to make it work. Julia in particular wanted a great marriage, not just a mediocre one. “I thought, ‘I don’t want to just be together because of the kids,’ or, ‘I don’t want to just be flatmates.’ It’s got to be more than that.” She says if it had come to it, she wouldn’t have stuck around. “It’s just too sad. It’s too sad to be living in a loveless marriage.”
One of their biggest challenges came when Paul became very involved with sailing, spending huge amounts of time on it, to the exclusion of everything else. Julia made it clear things had to change. “That was probably our biggest hurdle, that was a couple of years and the girls were young-ish. But I remember one of my daughters saying, ‘All you do is argue’ … I just could not get him to understand how I felt about it.”
It’s something that Paul recognises in himself: “One of my problems is that I focus too much and I have blinkers. I can’t see everything else going on in my life, but that’s where we’re a good couple together because we are very good at adapting ... I don’t think either of us are really stubborn, so we tend to be able to adapt to either bring the other back onto the right path or to, when required, stay calm and live with it.”
What saved them was renovating their house, working shoulder to shoulder each weekend. It was another important lesson for the couple. “You’ve got to have projects together,” says Paul.
Over the years, their approach to conflict has evolved. Where Paul usually avoids conflict, Julia prefers to deal with it straight away. “He now is starting to say, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t realise that I was hurting you. Do you need to discuss it?’” And a lot of the time I go, ‘No, I’m fine. Because you validated it.’”
They were never afraid to disagree in front of their two girls. Both had grown up in homes where their parents didn’t appear to argue, so when there was an argument, it would cause undue anxiety. Instead they wanted their children to see them disagree, resolve and move on.
There was something else. For Julia, as a girl growing up surrounded by brothers, she had to learn to speak up for herself. She wanted her girls to learn that too. “I needed my girls to feel they could have a voice. My daughters will still say, ‘Good on you, Mum’s standing up to Dad.’ Not that Dad’s a pushover, but it’s to say, ‘Don’t let a man dominate you.’ For me that was important for the girls to see, that you can say what you think and not have to be pleasing all the time.”
These days both daughters are adults and have moved out of home. Julia and Paul are enjoying their time together, not least because they still have much in common. “We’ve got friends who go, ‘Oh, I love the way you do things together,’ I think, ‘Yeah, because we’ve kind of kept at it,’” says Julia.
“Not so long ago, [Paul] said, ‘I don’t think I’ll leave you. I’m kind of used to you now,’” says Julia. “I’ve told people that and they’ve gone, ‘Oh,’ and I thought, ‘No, it makes me laugh because that’s how I feel.’” She says they’ve settled into a more comfortable rhythm than ever before. “I never wanted to leave but you’re trying to make this perfect relationship … the kids have to be this and we have to have this perfect family. And now it’s just like, ‘Oh, I’m kind of used to you now’ … It’s not because you couldn’t find anyone else... It’s just that this life is easy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent fans divided over Amanda's Golden Buzzer act</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of Britain's Got Talent have accused the show of being a 'set up' after a mum and daughter duo won Amanda's heart.
14-year-old Honey and her mum arrived on stage and Honey confessed she had signed them up for the talent show.
She then told how her mum had been diagnosed with cancer and after a rough couple of years, things were finally looking up for them.

They began by singing a song from the musical Waitress, but Simon stopped them midway through.
He told them he didn't like the song and he wanted them to go away and learn another then come back later in the day.
The duo exited the stage, and then came back just 15 minutes later to perform again.
Even Simon was shocked they had returned so soon, saying he was expecting them later in the show.
Mum Sammy admitted she had the lyrics on her hands before they belted out Freya Ridings' Lost Without You.
The judges all thought they were amazing, Simon told them he would remember their audition for a really long time.
Amanda was so moved she decided to push her Golden Buzzer.
Simon told her: "They really deserved that."
But viewers at home were far from convinced.
They accused the whole thing of being a set up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People Finale Recap: Will They or Won’t They?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Connell and Marianne are in a groove. Marianne is “content,” happy to do movie nights with Joanna and not even all that rattled by the fact that her mom has decided to stop supporting her (financially, that is — she was never really supporting Marianne emotionally). Marianne has to move out of that glamorous Dublin flat. She’s all but estranged from her family now, but she’s building this life for herself on her own terms. And I don’t think that’s not a factor in why she and Connell are able to be in such a good place. This, after all, is their comfort zone: He’s the dominant one, the one with all the power, and she is the one who needs him. It’s telling that even though she had all the resources in the world back when Connell lost his restaurant gig and couldn’t make rent, he could not bring himself to ask her if he could stay with her, but now that the roles are reversed — even though they both won that scholarship so doesn’t Marianne also have free housing? — it’s a given that she will stay with him, so he can take care of her.
The cool girl from first year who cornered Connell about his Joyce essay successfully got him involved in the literary magazine, which he edits. He’s written a story so great Marianne is “completely jealous” of it. He’s buying Marianne a book of Frank O’Hara poetry for her appropriately low-key and lovely birthday, for which she curled her hair and put on lipstick, like someone who is excited about life again. 
From what we can see of their sex life now, it’s all very intimate and heavy-breathy and not at all violent, even in a playful way, which would suggest Marianne just put that whole part of herself in a little box to never open again, which I’m sure will be fine! She takes all that energy to the pool to swim laps multiple times a day.
All is well and calm and good and then: Connell gets an email. A university in New York (!) is offering him a place in their creative writing MFA program. Marianne is stunned; she didn’t even know he applied. She expresses her shock before she says “congratulations” which is not ideal but is understandable, considering. Connell is super-embarrassed about the whole thing, which was a long shot. Why didn’t he tell Marianne he was applying? “To be honest, I still look up to you a lot and I wouldn’t want you to see me as deluded.” Aww! Of course it wasn’t even Connell’s idea to apply because Connell, like Marianne, is constitutionally incapable of really taking his life into his own hands and pretty much every major decision to date — applying to Trinity, studying English, going to therapy, joining the literary magazine — was made for him by someone else who had to talk him into it. 
The show does a much better job than the book did of letting us see Connell really addressing his mental health issues. (For one thing, the therapy in the book was a bust and didn’t really take.) Connell is concerned about uprooting his barely stable life, one that is only recently free of panic attacks. “Now is not the time for me to go halfway across the world and live in a city where I don’t know anyone,” he says. He swears he’s not going. Marianne advises him to think on it. 
That night, there’s a party for the literary society, where the lovely curly-haired girl kindly calls Connell “the most naturally fucking gifted editor of all times.” There’s punch and joy and I am so relieved Connell and Marianne found these people and aren’t still running around with the Peggys and Jamies of Trinity. 
Connell invites Marianne to his place for Christmas. Well, really it was Lorraine’s idea (see above re: Connell initiating literally anything ever). They drive home with a car piled high with presents and Lorraine greets them as a “Christmas miracle.” I love Lorraine. Their family Christmas is lowkey and sweet and just seeing that such a thing is possible — a happy family, playing silly games, sitting close together and making warm conversation — moves Marianne to tears. She has to retreat just to get some air from the overwhelming niceness of it all. Walking down the street, they pass Marianne’s mom. Lorraine is gracious to her former employer but Marianne’s mom walks away without speaking to them. 
It’s New Year’s Eve, and Marianne agrees to go to the party that all the kids are going to. She wears this semi-sheer pink sparkly top that is halfway to something Helen would wear and a leather skirt that’s very Marianne. Hot, mean Rachel hugs her like they’ve always been friends. I appreciate this bit of realism because I do think for the most part, everyone gets amnesia about who they were dicks to in high school because it’s too mortifying to recall the details, and everybody just does the whole “oh my God, how are you?!” whenever they see someone from home.
In the morning, Connell is helping Marianne move out of her mom’s house for real. Site of their first kiss but otherwise not really a place Marianne is too keen on remembering. They’ve both been thinking about New York. Connell would love for one year of his life to not be so hard, but Marianne points out that there is more than one way for your life to be difficult, and what if New York is “difficult and amazing”? (I love how she says “It’s New York! It’s writing!” Shh … protect their Irish innocence, no one tell them what it’s really like.) 
After Connell comes around to/admits that he would like to go, Marianne confesses that she is going to stay put. “I want to live the life I’m living,” she says. It’s only for a year. Well, in theory it’s only for a year. Maybe Connell will love New York and never want to come back to this place. They have this very tender back and forth about how they wouldn’t be the people they are now without each other. “We have done so much good for one another,” she tells him. He says “I’ll go” and she says “And I’ll stay, and we’ll be okay.” 
Ah, the first young couple in the history of coupledom to attempt a long distance relationship. Can they really handle being apart? Or will they be so good at being apart they never get back together? Share your most romantic and/or cruel theories in the comments!

    <h5 class="mb-1">I'm Self-Isolating Over 3,000 Miles From My Family — Here's How I'm Dealing With It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When I first packed my bags and bought my one-way ticket to California from Boston, there was a slew of things I thought about. I knew moving across the country to pursue my dream job was the right thing to do, but I couldn't help but think: what if something bad happens? Just about every possibility crossed my mind — death, sickness, a natural disaster — but never, not once, did a global pandemic.
COVID-19 came out of left field, and I, like many others, was unsure of the right play. Cases were quickly popping up all over the US, and suddenly, the whole country was on lockdown. My parents, who had been calm, cool, and collected about the whole thing up until that point, now had fear in their voices. The question was asked: "Why don't you come home?"
"Why don't I go home?" I thought to myself. I can be around my family, see my dog, eat free food, and get homemade dinners. Flights were also cheap, so it all sounded good to me. But as with all pros come cons, and there was one very large con that outweighed the pros of snuggling Henry (my dog) and eating homemade meals: I could have the virus. What would happen if I went home to see my family and infected them all in the process? The bad thoughts just spiraled from there. I decided for them and myself that it was best I stayed here, 3,000 miles away, in San Francisco.
It was weird at first. Reading the news and hearing the bleak predictions, you want to be with your family (or at least within a 50-mile radius). My parents' texts weren't helping, either: "I'm glad you're out there following your dreams, but I really wish you were closer to home." Ugh, break my heart, why don't you? It was even harder knowing it was my decision to stay in California, not theirs. Although they said they understood, I could tell they wished I were home. I did, too.
I comforted myself with tomato soup and grilled cheese, a staple in my house growing up, and talked it out with my roommate. She made me feel better. I also began limiting my exposure to news so I'd stop thinking of all the bad headlines. After a few weeks, I adjusted to the norm of being across the country during a pandemic, and for the first time, it felt right. I realized going home wasn't all that I built it up to be. It wasn't a vacation. Sure, flights were cheap, but they were cheap for a reason — no one was flying. If I took the risk, I'd be wearing a mask and gloves on my six-hour flight home, and I wouldn't be able to eat at my favorite restaurant or visit my grandmother or any of my friends once I got there. I'd essentially be under one roof with my parents for the foreseeable future, and while I love them, that's no walk in the park.
The truth is we're all struggling with this virus in our own way. If everyone hopped on flights to see their families, these stay-at-home orders would have no purpose. By doing our part to help flatten the curve, we're doing the best we can. I now rest easy knowing (and feeling) that in some small way, I made the right decision. My parents have even come around to the fact that I won't be home for a while. A few more texts are now exchanged each day, and our phone calls consist of ways to solve COVID-19 (like we're experts), but that's OK. What's important is that everyone's healthy and safe, and Zoom is always there if we need a little face time. I'm happy with my decision to not go home, and in hindsight, I know staying put is worth it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Create your new normal - The Happiness Connection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A few years ago, I gave a presentation about emotions. I used the word normal to describe what was typical for most people. When the session was over, I was stunned to discover I had triggered a member of the audience into a near meltdown.
That was the first time I stopped to consider what an emotion-packed word, normal can be. 
When I was first diagnosed with clinical depression, my husband and in-laws cautioned me not to tell anybody. They were afraid I would be labelled as crazy or abnormal. 
This is what happened to the lady in my audience. She had struggled with mental illness and only had to hear the word normal to be transported back into a time when she believed she wasn’t.
Although I wasn’t talking about people not being normal, she was unable to hear anything I was saying because of her emotions.
It is only in recent times that we are considering the possibility that being different might be a strength and a blessing. 
In evolutionary times, it benefited people to fit in and be like everyone else. You needed to be part of a group if you were going to survive.
I don’t want anyone else to have the same experience as the woman in my audience, so let me assure you, I don’t want to spend my time discussing whether any of us are normal. Instead I want to refer to normal as a noun.
What is your normal?
Dictionary.com defines normal as the usual, average, or typical state or condition. 
What do you do every day? Do you have daily or weekly routines? What is important to you? How do you spend your free time? What makes you feel energized?
This is a conversation that is becoming more relevant with every passing day. The pandemic has ensured that what was normal in your life at the beginning of the year, is unlikely to be your normal, today.
Every time you or your life changes, you will consciously or unconsciously adjust your usual routines. If you start a new job, move to a new city, or change your marital status, modifications need to be made. 
Some people resist change and cling as much as possible to their old way of doing things. That isn’t always best, but it’s comfortable.
Many people who have extended stays in institutions like hospitals, are afraid to go home. They have been there long enough for its routines to be their new normal. 
Although the sudden unchartered territory of the pandemic felt scary when it started, I’m willing to bet you are finding you’ve got used to physical distancing. 
An elderly friend decided to go to Rona to get something for her garden. It was the first time she has left her home in weeks. She told me how shaky and unsettled she felt doing something that was perfectly normal only a couple of months ago.
Until a vaccine for COVID-19 is found, many of your old ways of life will be put on hold. 
Even when restaurants are open, they will probably have vastly reduced seating, or plexiglass between tables or booths. Lines of people waiting to enter a store is likely to remain commonplace for the months ahead. 
I suspect even when we can gather in large groups again, some parts of the old normal will have disappeared forever.
Small changes require small shifts. Big transformations need you to pivot in bigger ways. The pandemic has caused major alterations. The opportunity it is providing is just as immense.
You have the chance to consciously influence what your new normal will look like.
What are you enjoying about your current lifestyle? What are the biggest challenges? What can’t you wait to do again?
Gather as much information as possible and then decide what you want to keep and what feels good to release when a vaccine is found.
If you love having more time as a family, consider not enrolling your kids in so many extracurricular activities. If you are enjoying a slower pace of life, practice being more discerning about what you choose to do with your time.
Your world will always be influenced by things beyond your control. This conversation is about crafting the life you want for yourself within those unmovable boundaries. 
What do you want your new normal to look like? If you can imagine it, you can create it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">My unborn baby's father ghosted me the day after I told him I was pregnant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mascara tears rolling down my cheeks, hands shaking, and my heart beating a thousand beats a minute, I tapped the little camera icon to video call my boyfriend.
‘Yep. I’m pregnant.’
His eyes widened. He didn’t say much. Just that he’d be there with me through it all and he’d support me in whatever decision I made. That he would take responsibility. That we’d stick to our plan. Get a place together in Sheffield or Manchester, find better jobs, be a team through it all. This was on 11 January. 
The next day, he disappeared.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve pictured a future where I had it all. A successful, high-flying job, a trendy townhouse in a vibrant city, a mutually fulfilling and healthy relationship, and enough money to jet away on a couple of holidays every year.
I was working towards having that future someday and I was doing well for myself. My life was headed in a positive direction. 
Read the latest updates: Coronavirus news live
In a bout of impulsivity – combined with a deep fear of settling in a job I wasn’t passionate about and a whirlwind romance with a Hungarian man – I took a job in Budapest as a travel journalist.
The first couple of months were fantastic. I’d get my pieces written up, and then we’d explore the city. It was all very hedonistic, wild and carefree. We were glued at the hip.
Writing about it now makes it sound like a summer romance that was never meant to last. Maybe that’s exactly what it was. But despite the dysfunctionality of it all, it was a real relationship. We met each other’s families and planned to move to the UK together. We even adopted a kitten.
One night, walking home across the Chain Bridge from a party in the early hours, he even got down on one knee and promised me that we’d be engaged within the year. I sort of laughed it off and acted a bit freaked out, but deep down it felt right.
Looking back, that was just one on a very long list of broken promises. I never thought such a beautiful summer would turn into the reality I’m living now.
When I found out I was pregnant, I’d been visiting family in England for Christmas and New Year, and he was back in Hungary. Because of this, the disappearing act was probably easier for him.
After he vanished, he’d message me once in a blue moon when it suited him. He ignored all my calls, but would contact me on Facebook occasionally to respond to my messages. One minute he’d tell me he just needed more time to process the news, the next he’d say he wanted nothing to do with the baby or me. He’d tell me I shouldn’t get an abortion, then I should.
It was clear that he wasn’t taking me or my needs – and the baby’s – into account at all. It was all about him and his feelings. Nobody else’s. I felt so alone.
About a week or two after I found out I was pregnant, I started bleeding. Thinking I was miscarrying, I told him what had happened. He seemed panicky and gutted. When midwives did an emergency scan and saw that the baby was okay, I forwarded him the picture of the tiny embryo growing inside me.
I hoped that actually seeing the picture would give the jolt he needed to take it all seriously. Despite his behaviour, I still loved him. I was desperate for him to wake up to the situation and prioritise me and our unborn child.
He stopped replying again.
When he dumped all my belongings into a suitcase and shipped it over, even going as far as to include a bag of food I’d been eating at one of Budapest’s Christmas markets weeks earlier, I realised how little I suddenly meant to him. I couldn’t believe it. I felt so worthless and unimportant, like he hated me.
Even his family began to ignore me completely. I reached out to his mum and sister several times via text and social media. I said I wanted them to be a part of the baby’s life, but they never responded.
Knowing that the guy, who had often commented on how beautiful our children would be and who had promised to stick by me, now wanted nothing to do with me or the baby we had created, caused me to sink into a deep depression. I stayed in bed all day, only really leaving the house to go to counselling appointments.
His reaction when I told him I was depressed? ‘Get a hobby or something’.
Unsurprisingly, taking up judo wasn’t exactly the first thing on my to-do list. During those first couple of months, my thoughts were plagued with the utter fear and constant anxiety of the prospect of being a single mum. 
I suppose a huge part of me thought he’d eventually come to his senses and realise that I needed his support. That he was just scared, like many other guys his age would be. That he’d eventually realise what’s important.
That never happened. As coronavirus spread across the globe and fatalities increased day after day, so did his indifference and disinterest towards me and our unborn child.
When we went into lockdown, it felt like the icing on top of the cake. My pregnancy had already been zapped of happiness because of him abandoning me, but at least I had my family and friends by my side to get me through it and bring some positivity to the situation. Of course, that’s all changed – I can’t see anyone, so it’s been quite difficult. 
I’m nearly five months pregnant now, and the prospect of bringing a baby into the world during the Covid-19 pandemic is scary to say the least.
I haven’t healed from the experience, but I’m beginning to accept it. I’d be lying if I said it hasn’t been tough. Being left to be a single mum was never what I wanted, or what I imagined would happen to me.
For about a month and a half after I found out, I was plagued with doubts day and night about whether or not I could do it. Because my ex refused to talk to me and essentially shut me out of his life, I booked in twice to have a termination as my mental health got so bad.
I didn’t want the baby to grow up without a father figure or male role model, and I doubted my capabilities. But both times, when it came to it, I couldn’t go through with the abortion. 
I knew then that I had to accept I would be raising this baby on my own without his help or support, and that I had to stick with my decision. 
Despite the stress and mental health problems I’ve experienced, my little baby is healthy and growing inside me, clinging on to life in such fleeting and uncertain times.
Just before the lockdown measures were implemented, I moved into a two-bedroomed house in my hometown with my cat (the one we adopted together, as it happens). It’s opposite a park and has a pretty garden with enough space for little one to run about. It’s a great place to raise a child in. 
Up until recently, I was still emailing my ex every couple of weeks to let him know how the pregnancy was progressing. He rarely replied, and if he did, his response was always cold and clinical. I suggested we talk on the phone to really discuss everything and what the future holds, but he refuses to.
He even had the audacity to say to me in an email: ‘I hope you’re not drinking, but you probably won’t listen to me’. I was baffled.
I’ve stopped making an effort now.
If my ex decides that he wants to be a father to his child, that’s up to him. I’m not stopping him. He had the opportunity to be present at the birth but he said no, and hasn’t shown an interest in what the baby’s name will be, or anything of the sort. It’s all very sad, but I hope one day he realises the implications of his actions and behaviour. I know that I’ll never forgive him or his family for tossing me to one side without even a ’how are you?’. 
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t still have feelings for him, but they fade every day. I think the person I fell in love with – the man who would have done anything for me – has disappeared. I don’t even know who he is anymore. I know I deserve better.
As cliché as it sounds, I’m a believer that everything happens for a reason. I think you have to go through bad experiences in life to appreciate the good times more. When lockdown is over and the world has (somewhat) gone back to normal, and I’m cradling my sleeping baby in my arms, I’ll know I’ve come out the other side – no matter how many sleepless nights and dirty nappies await me.
I think this child will inherit their mum’s strength and resilience, that’s for sure.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will COVID-19 kill the human in us?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You know that something is wrong when your doorbell starts ringing at 2am. You know it is very bad when the person outside starts pounding at it with his/her hand.
A light sleeper, I am always half-awake, so when this happened, I rushed to the door, barefoot and shirtless, only to open it to a lady who in desperation muttered: "Please, help my son." I followed her.
A man around my age was lying on a sofa, close to their main door, struggling to breathe, irresponsive. I panicked a bit; I told myself: "He is infected, he has it."
I admit I was afraid and seconds later ashamed that I left my neighbour in her home, waiting for a few seconds while her son struggled for his life. It had gotten to me, "coronaphobia".
I rushed back home, grabbed gloves, a face mask, sandals, and a T-shirt, then woke up my adult son and told him to help me.
It may have taken less than 30 seconds to do that, yet I felt guilty; I believe I did the right thing, but I left a person who needed me in fear, in uncertainty.
I sent my son to the security guard, to call an ambulance, which he did as I remained there, helping move the suffering man. His mum was unable to tell me what was wrong with him, I am sure fear was increasing the language barrier. I thought of everything - heart attack? intoxication? stroke? nothing seemed to fit the symptoms.
He was just there, fighting to breathe, and I could not do anything and afraid I would bring the virus, COVID-19, home. Then I felt guilty for being irresponsible, I was doing everything against what guidenlines on social media had been advising.
"I am not a medic, I have no equipment or means to handle the COVID, I should leave it to the qualified people, I should avoid contact, Am I really thinking on mouth-to-mouth respiration?, I should not be here, I should not be risking my family." The thoughts came fast, tumbling over each other.
But, how can one leave another human to their luck at a time like this? I don't know how, because I could not; at the same time, my mind was wandering. "Who else is here to help right now? At least they won't be alone, we are with them - I know CPR, he will be fine, I will be fine, I can do this, I will isolate myself after."
My neighbour had recovered by the time the paramedics arrived - he was suffering something totally unrelated to any respiratory disease, he was not even taken to the hospital, but to his private doctor.
It was a relief - I know the mother will see her son in the morning, eat a happy favorite breakfast and perhaps make some jokes about the night before. It was a relief too to know I didn't put myself or my family at risk.
I've been in a quite a few emergencies through my life, as a Mexican journalist in the north of Mexico, I've been through accidents, narcos pointing a gun centimeters away from my face, attacks on our newspaper office, and I managed to remain calm.
I was the one that first jumps to help back in the day, so what changed? is it that the pandemic has made social distancing such that we fear to help, fear touching others even in an emergency?
Certainly, fear is there now, but that seems not to be enough to deter us from being kind to each other.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why it’s good to be bored</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I remember my first experience of boredom as vividly as my first kiss. The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum’s friend’s house, into which she had disappeared. “Won’t be long,” she’d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.
Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag – minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.
I was in trouble, of course – but I was not convinced that I’d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice – and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future.
I did not understand then – two decades before my first conference call or doctor’s waiting room – that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one’s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present – evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women.
It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a “boom time for boredom”. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us.
But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. “I think that’s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don’t think you do.”
Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that – in trying to outrun it my entire life – I had been refusing to heed.
What if I stopped and listened?
Danckert is an Australian cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of “physician, heal thyself,” he says. “As a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.”
This isn’t a new phenomenon. To quote from Boredom: A Lively History, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: “How long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?” In the Middle Ages monks complained of “the noonday demon”: the personification of acedia – torpor, alongside agitation – provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be “a bore”, it was Dickens who was the first to term it “boredom” – in Bleak House in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being “bored to death” of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (“I’m just about starving tonight”) evokes Tolstoy’s definition in Anna Karenina of the feeling as “the desire for desires”.
“Boredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,” says Eastwood, who is head of the Boredom Lab at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives – from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention – with a view to applying their findings in the real world. “But as a scientist, I wasn’t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.”
Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming “crisis of agency” among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a “failure to launch into life”, which these men told him they experienced as “being chronically bored”. But what was being bored, exactly? “I thought: what is this?”
In Out of My Skull, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of “wanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything”. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.
It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. “Only boring people get bored,” goes the aphorism. “I’m highly motivated to prove it’s not true,” jokes Danckert.
It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner Anne Enright wrote recently: “Boredom is a productive state, so long as you don’t let it go sour on you.” It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren’t. Complaints of “I’m bored” are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. “There is this impulse in us to say, ‘There’s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.’ But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there’s things to do – but they can’t bring their desires in the moment in line with what’s there.”
Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In Out of My Skull, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia’s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not “even want to look out of a porthole”. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs. The psychologists suggest it was Hadfield’s intrinsic motivation to find meaning in what he was doing, and to occupy and challenge himself within the confines of his environment, that set the two astronauts apart. Hadfield claims to never be bored – but, Danckert says, it’s more that “he just deals with it really very well”.
In the years after I tore apart Mum’s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions. My parents are enthusiastic sailors and most of my school holidays were spent in the close confines of their yacht, without television or internet, during sometimes long passages at sea.
On those trips I read every book on board, regardless of interest (a dictionary; a medical encyclopaedia) or age appropriateness (pulpy Dick Francis thrillers, replete with rumpy-pumpy); and when I ran out of other people’s stories, I wrote my own. I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me.
I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth – while simultaneously a source of distress for many.
The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.
In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic. In young people, boredom is associated with higher than average risk-taking; in the elderly, it can speed up the degenerative process of ageing. Both groups are at particular risk of depression, for which boredom is a precursor.
Boredom-prone people also experience higher levels of anger, aggression and hostility and may be driven to look for meaning in extreme political views, or tribalism. To Danckert, that means boredom may be one part of our ever more polarised politics and public discourse. “When you’re in the midst of an overload of information, one response is to shout louder,” he says. Sociologist Orrin Klapp, writing in 1986, called it “ego-screaming” and that “perfectly captures Twitter trolling,” says Danckert.
The fact that our response to boredom is often destructive, adversarial or otherwise problematic speaks to just how deeply uncomfortable we find the sensation. A 2014 study found that many people chose to administer painful electric shocks to themselves rather than being left alone with their thoughts. One man shocked himself 190 times in 15 minutes.
“All too often when we’re bored, we see ourselves as passive, empty vessels to fill – we look for stimuli that will get rid of the bad feeling in the short term,” says Eastwood. “But it doesn’t foster and grow our capacity for agency – and that’s exactly what we need to be free from boredom and its negative consequences.”
Danckert and Eastwood are reluctant to blame the present problem on our preoccupation with technology alone. But it is true that tech presents us with a powerful distraction. If the goal is to simply avoid being bored, it may be easier now than ever, what with the infinite scroll of social media, endless hours of entertainment on Netflix and Spotify, and all our friends always available.
But this over-abundance of things to do itself can exacerbate boredom. Eastwood evokes the “paradox of choice”, saying “options are not necessarily freeing and do not necessarily make us happy”. Seeking relief on the internet “can feel like trying to drink from a fire hose” Danckert and Eastwood write. Not only that, in hijacking our attention, technology may, over time, compound the issue it seems to alleviate. “It takes time and attention to scroll through Instagram or play Candy Crush, but at the end of it, you’re not satisfied, because you didn’t do the harder work of figuring out: ‘What do I really want to do?’ It’s a vicious cycle: you got some engagement, but it wasn’t the thing you needed,” says Danckert. That is the challenge that boredom lays down, he says: “to figure out what is going to be meaningful and useful to you in your life”.
Becoming better attuned to our own inner states can allay the discomfort and illuminate a satisfying course of action. Mindfulness, which fosters a non-judgmental response to one’s thoughts (as I now know I practised on my parents’ boat), has been linked to lower levels of boredom. Danckert lets his mind wander on his three-mile walk to work , thinking of “the dumbest things – but it is engaging to just follow those threads and see where they lead you”.
Eastwood’s own ritual is making time to sit and think, with a cup of tea – a period of “constructive internal reflection”, during which he connects with his internal compass. Uncomfortable feelings steer us for the better, he says. “Just as it’s good that we have the capacity for pain, to keep us safe, it’s good that we have the capacity for boredom, because it saves us from the ruin of stagnation. It keeps us moving forward and searching for a better way of applying ourselves, for engaging in the world.”
Received in that spirit, boredom can be a call to action – but many of us choose not to hear it. Wincing, I admit to Danckert that I have opened Twitter, scrolled for a while, become bored with scrolling, closed Twitter, then immediately opened Twitter again, almost instinctively. I do this embarrassingly often, I tell him – it’s just easier to push through boredom on the internet, rather than taking it as a cue to log off.
Danckert reiterates, not without sympathy, I think, that at moments like that it is better to “just do something”. It does not necessarily have to align with some higher purpose in life – simply putting down my phone will break the cycle of unsatisfying engagement, and reinforce my own sense of my autonomy.
Within weeks of our interview, a global pandemic takes hold, and I count myself lucky to just be bored. Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over. I spend less time on my phone. I read my flatmate’s books that have rested on our communal shelf for years without ever piquing my curiosity. I bake, for the first time since childhood. Constraints that might have been boring are in fact oddly motivational.
As Danckert and Eastwood write in Out of My Skull, when we are “constantly carried along by a fast-moving stream, we can forget how to swim for ourselves”. It is this that boredom seeks to remind us of, they suggest – that we are the authors of our lives, even now they’ve been derailed.
1. Don’t fight the feeling. Boredom is uncomfortable, but you make it worse by layering suffering on top. Think of when you twist your ankle – you feel pain without berating yourself for being clumsy, or fretting about a chronic injury. Feeling bored is unavoidable, but it is not a judgment on your character or ability.
2. Create a new routine. Boredom flourishes within constraints. In the absence of ordinary routines and busyness, it may feel like you are stagnating. Try to find another gear – one that may not be as high-energy, or productive, but is full at the same time.
3. Find purpose. Boredom is not an absence of things to do, it is the struggle to find value in any of the options available to you. Being able to connect with a reason “why” for doing something (including quarantine) can make it less boring. Instead of agitating for anything to do, try to determine what’s really important – whether right now, or for the future.
4. Avoid passive consumption. It is all too easy to binge Netflix or scroll social media. If you’re enjoying yourself, there’s no problem, but treating yourself as a passive consumer may mean you are more likely to feel bored. You need to feel engaged.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love loves a lie: comedian Joanne McNally on whether men and women can ever 'really' be friends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Something has happened to me since I tripped into my mid-30s. I say tripped, because the last time I checked I was 29, drinking alcopops at a festival, as I watched a man sell narcotics out of a baguette. So I'm really not sure how the situation escalated to this, now 36, eating collagen alone in my bedroom. My only assumption is that I skidded on something that catapulted me forward seven years. Maybe it was one of my own unfertilised eggs?
I'm maturing. There are the physical effects, of course, the new lines and folds in my face that look like an arts-and-crafts enthusiast broke into my home overnight and tinkered away at me for hours, trying to mould my head into an accordion.
Maturing means I'm losing things I'd rather keep, like facial elasticity, child-bearing years and the mental pluck to wear a scrunchie. But I'm also gaining things like sanity and perspective. Physically, I'm curdling, but mentally, I'm ripening.
Take, for example, my attitude towards male friendships. Excuse the exclusively hetero-woman angle, but it's all I know (though, let's face it, no orientation is safe from the economics of attraction; we're all in this warzone together).
As a teenage girl, boys were only good for the following: attention, a swell in my own self-esteem and social kudos. My teenage years were spent needing to be fancied. At that stage I knew nothing about myself, only that I loved coleslaw, puffer jackets and was mortified by my body, so if a boy considered me important enough to fancy, then that meant something.
To be fancied was to be seen; it made you feel important. I couldn't see anything in myself other than unwanted bulk, hidden under layers of Umbro, so male attention was like an emotional ring light - validation, the modern-day equivalent of a blue tick - that gave me something to work with. Nothing was more thrilling than being approached by a chain-smoking 16-year-old called Deco who told you that his mate Damo requested your puffed-up, overly lip-lined presence in the bike shed, where he was waiting to put his tongue in your mouth for as long as you both could bear it. Magic.
I'm sure there were other girls more sophisticated than me who got their teenage thrills from highbrow pursuits like writing novellas in their bedroom or gorging on the historical achievements of Emmeline Pankhurst, but my main concern was tongue: seeking it, winning it, binging it.
My 20s brought with them a slightly more mature attitude to men. I had guy friends who I got on with but we kept each other on the outer circle, never on the inner. We'd go out in gangs but I would never in my wildest dreams have rung them in broad daylight and suggested we nip down the town for coffee and a quiche. They were too 'other'; I felt sure they couldn't give me the all-consuming affinity I felt from my female friendships.
I adore women. Not all women, of course - I'm not going to pretend there aren't some I wouldn't like to put in a barrel and drop off the side of a boat, and I know there are women who would happily barrel me into the ocean also, that's an unfortunate fact of life, but even those women, I still think about them. They affect me. Those situations gnaw away at me, because our perceived betrayals of each other are more painful than if done by a man.
Women begin from a position of unspoken, understood solidarity; a shared experience that is so strong that when crossed, it feels like more than just rude disregard - it feels like treason.
I used to go to house parties and come home with the phone numbers of women. I've made life-long female friends in the toilets of nightclubs. Nothing thrills me more than a stranger asking an entire bathroom for a tampon and me proudly passing one over like a baton of female fortitude. That connection is so gratifying, knowing that this woman can carry on her evening in comfort, without a cinderblock of toilet paper stuffed into her knickers. We are one.
I blame the movies The few male friendships I had that progressed from outer circle to inner were always riddled with holes: disguised desire, secret obsessions, drunken declarations, disastrous hook-ups and eventual implosion. By the time we eventually crossed the line, the blur was so bad I couldn't tell if we were sexually compatible or riddled with cataracts. All friendships need a chemistry to exist and survive, a mutual magnetic draw that pulls you together - so when that chemistry is between two people who traditionally like to sex that sex, the lines can wobble and blur. That has always been my experience, anyway. Some of my female friends grew up with great male mates and no lines were ever crossed and I just looked on with a tilted head, impressed but confused.
Movies have a lot to answer for. The idea that men and women can't be best mates without someone wanting to secretly wiggle their way into the other's knickers is a favourite story (note: the wiggler always wins). Take the movie Just Friends, for example, a personal favourite of mine because Anna Faris's character, pop star Samantha James, basically steals the show for being bonkers.
Anyway, Ryan Reynolds has a lifelong obsession with his childhood bestie, Amy Smart, whom he eventually wins over by morphing from obese, badly-braced nerd to incredibly hot, successful music producer. Oh and I'm 70pc confident that almost every Sandra Bullock movie circles around this idea also, but in reverse - Sandra starts out ugly (which in movie terms means she wears glasses), Sandra gets hot (which in movie terms means she takes off her glasses and exposes a kneecap), and she ends up in bed with Hugh Grant or some other character who never wore glasses. We're fed this type of stuff all the time, and I gobbled it all up like a hungry, emotionally-stunted pig.
One of my own secret-obsession-man-friend situations took up most of my 20s. It was exhausting, heartbreaking but also intoxicating. Let's face it, the human condition loves a bit of 'will they, won't they'. It gives us life; it's up there with blood transfusions and antibiotics and that scene in Real Housewives where someone accused Aviva of faking her asthma diagnosis, so she ripped off her prosthetic leg and threw it across the dinner table.
Being secretly in love with your fake best friend is akin to getting waterboarded by an adorable puppy. At times, it's complete torture, but you need to be around the puppy so you can absorb its very being, which you've decided is celestial, so you carry on, in the hope that the puppy has an epiphany and realises it should not be drowning you in a trough of Pedigree Chum, but instead should be drowning you in a trough of Pedigree soulmate.
I would hang around my man-friend-obsession at all times, negging him with OTT reminders that he was definitely not my type, trying to throw him off my scent, like I hadn't tried to swipe a lock of his baby hair from his mother's side cabinet. And then I'd bid him an overly casual good-night in a way that suggested he physically repulsed me, and spend the evening listening to My Heart Will Go On, smelling the bobble hat he'd once left in my house and trying to wear the face off his Facebook page. Sleep, eat, obsess, repeat.
Befriending your unrequited love should be considered a mental-health issue; it's like an exercise in psychological self-harm.
Sometimes it's just a physical thing - a chemical thing, unrequited lust; whatever hormone they're leaking, you're buying. Their very presence makes your entire body fizz up with adrenaline and excitement and longing. You crave them; it's like they're heroin and your genitals are the syringe.
But then there are the other friend-obsessions where you think you're actually in love with them and the 'love' is unrequited. That's a one-way street and there's nothing coming your way but tumbleweed and torment, because that's when the voice starts, that debilitating hum in your head, the little bastard lounging in the back of your mind on a beanbag, smoking a cigar, and whispering: 'If they don't want you, it's because you're not good enough for them. You're not quite sure about yourself yet, are you Joanne? No, so you should see yourself how they see you. That's exactly what you should do - allow them to determine your worth. Yes, him, that man who lives in his mother's basement, is a suspected gambling addict and thinks walnuts can cure cancer. Yes him, he is perfection. How he sees you is how you must see yourself. The only way to fix this internal rejection-fuelled turmoil is to win him over. Win his attention. Win this gift to womankind. Change his mind. Only then can you achieve inner peace.'
I didn't have the emotional skill-set to validate myself, so I would try to outsource that side of things to men. When it didn't work, all hell broke loose. It's all classic human behavior - I want them, so they increase in value, but they don't want me, so I decrease in value. Love is basically the FTSE 100 for humans. I don't wish to be challenged on this analogy.
Obsession is never subtle Sometimes you pine for so long, you lose focus; you pursue an imagined relationship that you've invented. Who can ever live up to that? I've been the secret fancier and the secretly fancied. In my 20s, a particular man pursued me for years, years! I finally succumbed to his charming flirtations and three months in, he dumped me. Basically, he achieved his mission, so I lost value, and then he got to know me, so my FTSE plummeted through the floor, down through the Earth's crust and into the bowels of hell. What can I say? I'm an acquired taste.
Obsession is obvious. It always is. You think you've got a hold on things, you think your 'friend' doesn't know, but they always know. Your body will betray you: small signs like a flushed cheek, a diluted pupil, an ill-timed erection. I'll never forget seeing a photo of Brad Pitt staring at Angelina Jolie at some press junket for that movie they basically agreed to make so they could rub up against each other for 12 months and eventually leg it off together. He was entranced; his eyes were twirling in his head and pulsing like a heartbeat. It was incredible to watch. Like I said, obsession is never subtle.
Previous relationships have done nothing to change my mind. Like the boyfriend who has a particular female friend whom you've never met, but he assures you they're 'just good friends'. Your gut is squealing at you because you know it's more; you just know. But you want to believe him because love loves a lie; it means you can stay.
The whole situation stirs up your waters of intuition so violently that you're practically vomiting silt on a daily basis, and when you eventually find her sexy selfies in his phone, and his love-eye replies, it echoes what you've always believed - agenda. There is always an agenda. It also confirms that you want your next boyfriend to be a eunuch with no Wi-Fi and a Nokia 500.
My mid-30s have come with changes; I'm evolving. Yes, I still occasionally come in pissed and eat my housemate's hummus, but now I'll admit to it rather than blame the wind. Growth. And during this spurt of personal development, I've acquired these wonderfully sound man friends. Real ones, no agenda, no sexual motivation, no stolen glances, no dilated pupils, no smelling bobble hats. We are legitimately 'just friends', and it's brilliant. They bring new angles to old problems, and I'm always surprised by how similar we actually are. As the weirdly accurate Thai saying goes: 'same, same, but different'.
Obviously, everyone's experiences are different and everyone gets different things from different friendships, but just out of interest, I asked one of my new man friends why he likes having female friends. "Because you actually listen. Men don't want to hear my problems; men are just waiting to talk again."
I asked a female friend is there anything she gets from her male mates that she doesn't get from her female mates, and she took a long, superior, woke breath and said: "Joanne, I collect personalities. Not genders." And then I regretted asking her because I remembered that she matured way faster than me (but she also thought Indiana Jones was based on a true story, so no-one's perfect).
Men have always felt different to me, because, well basically, I'm not one. I had the whole thing worked out: gay man equals friend; straight man equals agenda (mine or theirs). Outside of that incredibly reductive equation, I distrusted everyone's motivations, including my own, but now that's changed, and I think I know why.
Part of my mental ripening is I now know my sole purpose in life is not to try and be considered 'attractive'. I've moved on. Now I don't care if lads fancy me or not - it's nice and all that, but growing up, I thought it was all I was good for: try to be pretty, if they don't think you're pretty, you've got nothing; none of your other accomplishments mean anything unless you're fanciable.
I've finally shed all that. I now know I've more to offer the world. Listen, I'm not suggesting I live my life in a muumuu dress and a moustache, far from it. I lash money into my face and I've had so much laser I could be used as an Olympic beam, and I enjoy all that - actually, I love it - but now I've stopped waiting for men to tell me who I am, which is handy, because they really didn't. It's a lot to ask of someone, especially when they're just trying figure out their own shit.
Shaking off all that male validation stuff has freed me up to have male mates. I don't need or want anything from them except normal friend stuff like chats and drinks, and potentially their sperm if the fear of dying alone means I decide to grow my own baby for company. Like I say, normal stuff! I'm late to the male-mate game, but I'm here now. Yes, maturing can turn a breast into a forward-falling flesh-slinky, and it will widen a gut, but it will also widen an outlook, and for that, I am glad.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Does Working from Home Make You Blue? Research Explains Why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joanie* is a working mother with three teenaged children. Shortly after the birth of her second child, Joanie began working from home (wfh) one day a week. “I thought it would be the solution to my feelings of guilt about being away from my kids,” she told me. “But it ended up making my life harder. I felt torn all the time – I could nurse while I was on a conference call, as long as I remembered to mute myself; but I couldn’t be with my older daughter while I was working, and she couldn’t understand why I wasn’t spending time with her. And of course, if I was spending time with them, I wasn’t really devoting my full energy to my job.”
However, during the COVID-19 lockdown, Joanie discovered that working from home with three teenagers was a completely different thing. “I’ve loved it in a lot of ways,” Joanie said. “I’m even thinking about asking if I can continue once businesses open back up. But there are a couple of things I’d do differently now. Because I still saw glimmers of the problems I had when the kids were little – there were times during the day when I'd just start to feel stressed and unhappy. And it wasn't just because of COVID."
If you are one of the lucky ones who has enjoyed some parts of the lockdown, you might just be one of many who are thinking about turning this temporary wfh solution to COVID-19 into a permanent way of life. But before you make that decision, it can be useful to recognize that being at home for your job has both benefits and drawbacks. In a fascinating study, Stanford professor Nicholas Bloom found that telecommuting raised worker productivity and decreased employee attrition, sick days, and time off and saved the company money by reducing the need for office space, at the same time that employees saved commute time, gas money, and the wear and tear of having to get to work on time. At first glance, it looked like a win for everyone.
But there was one problem. At the end of the study, more than half of the volunteers chose not to work at home 100% of the time. The reason? They felt lonely.
David*, who, like Joanie had been working from home at least part of every week before the coronavirus pandemic, described a similar feeling. He told me that he had enjoyed the combination of being on his own part of the time and being with colleagues and business contacts the other part. “I didn’t realize how important those connections were until the COVID shutdown,” he said. “Now I really crave those in-person contacts. I’m socializing with friends and business connections all the time on the screen, but it’s not the same. I don’t really understand it, but I’m missing even just being able to shake hands with someone.”
Feelings of isolation and loneliness can make it hard to get your work done. But even if you’re still productive, those feelings can lead to emotional difficulties, including depression and anxiety; and they can also contribute to a wide range of physical issues.
Researchers have long recognized the importance of social contact in maintaining physical and mental health. There are even studies explaining the physiological impact of David’s missing handshakes. According to research, social contact can calm and soothe some of the chemical reactions to stress that make our bodies and psyches more vulnerable. Which is simply to say that there are physiological reasons that even if you like working from home, it can make you feel a little down simply because you are not having social contact with your work buddies.
Add to this package feelings of stress about not getting enough work done, and you have a recipe for feeling down, anxious, and generally overwhelmed even as the world begins to open up after the COVID-19 lockdown.
“But I really want to stay home after the lockdown,” you say? That’s totally fine. There are pros and cons to both sides of this question. In a thoughtful article about life after leaving his corporate job, Scott Mautz says that even though he was lonely, the positives of working from home far outweighed the negatives for him. One ambitious study concludes that the findings about the superiority or inferiority of either choice are “highly ambiguous” and depend on a number of factors, including the personality of the employee, the type of business, and the responses of co-workers, team members, and family members.
What’s important is to remember that when working from home, you can get surprisingly lonely, and to make adjustments accordingly, so that your loneliness doesn’t morph into depression, anxiety, or just a general sense of the blahs.
Mautz writes that being with family or loved ones and seeing colleagues on video chats or even in occasional face-to-face meetings isn’t enough to counteract the loneliness. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself missing the casual chats, even the irritating moments with co-workers you don’t even like. And, he tells us, be proactive about seeing colleagues, setting up business meetings, and seeking out business-related in-person activities. It’s not that you have to go back to work if you don’t want to, he says; but it’s important to be prepared to do things to offset the sometimes surprising sense of isolation and disconnectedness.
One last thing. Looking for any kind of perfect solution can itself lead to the blues, because nothing is truly perfect. So remember – whatever you choose will have good and bad components, and try to enjoy whatever you’ve chosen without expecting it to meet all of your needs.
Both Joanie and David are looking forward to getting back to their offices. “I want to see people again,” Joanie said. “I’m even looking forward to a couple of time-wasting meetings,” David said. “And it’ll be great to be away from the house when my husband decides it’s time to run the vacuum,” he added. But they are also both very happy that they are able to work from home part of the time. As Joanie put it, "I understand now that part of the difficulty with working from home is that you can end up feeling kind of lonely and unsupported. You’re doing it all on your own, and you don’t get those off-handed 'good job' comments that you get when you’re at work. So you put extra pressure on yourself. And then you end up stressed and worried. So I'll make an extra effort to arrange some 'in person' work time. But I do like being able to set my own schedule. And responding to work emails while I’m having coffee and still in my pj’s is really the best.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bengaluru writer Dinesh Devarajan shortlisted for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The summary of Dinesh Devarajan’s story, The Teeth on the Bus Go Round and Round, isn’t the only one that offers intrigue among the 20 shortlisted for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize. But it is probably the most bizarre of all. “A grieving widow and her adolescent son go in search of a pair of lost dentures while being teased by her dead husband,” it reads.
The writer reveals the story is semi-autobiographical. Before one almost exclaims, “What?!”, he explains, “The original idea came to me years ago, when I was growing up in a middle-class household in Chennai. My mother and I went in search of my grandfather’s dentures.” It is darkly funny.
Devarajan had written a few lines, then, like “a rough sketch of a story”. Like one of perhaps a million middle-class boys in Chennai, he grew up to be an IT professional. Devarajan, 37, lives in Bengaluru now. But his profession hasn’t killed his passion. He continued to write stories. His little daughter deserves some credit, too. For, she demands new bedtime stories almost every night. A kids-friendly, rudimentary version of The Teeth on the Bus Go Round and Round, too, was narrated to her.
“Since I already had a few lines written, when I narrated the story to my daughter, I kind of got the structure of it.”
Devarajan started writing the story last September. “It was challenging to write on working days. So, on weekdays, I would just write during breaks, for five or ten minutes. I would get most of my writing done on weekends.” He submitted the story a few hours before the deadline: October 31, 2019.
Devarajan is one of the five writers shortlisted for the prize from the Asia region. There are 15 other writers from four other regions. The judges will choose a winner for each of the five regions. These regional winners will be announced on June 2, before being published online by the literary magazine Granta. The overall winner will be announced on July 7. The shortlisted stories will be published online, in the online magazine of Commonwealth Writers, adda, which features writing from around the globe.
Devarajan’s short stories have been published in Write India Stories, Season 1. He has also published his short story collections, Two is Company and City of Gods (both UNISUN Publishers).
He credits Anita Nair’s writing workshop, Anita’s Attic, for his refinement in writing. “I participated in the programme in 2017. I learnt that writing isn’t just about having an idea and putting it on paper. It is about organising yourself, having a strategy, finding a platform to publish your work… It was really helpful.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two Nigeria reality TV shows catch CNN’s attention</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> 
IN the latest episode of African Voices Changemakers, CNN explores the reality TV industry in Nigeria, going behind the scenes of The Fasttest Shedder and Try My Job.
The Fasttest Shedder is a 90-day weight loss reality show created by Seyi Olusore, popularly known as Shedams. Shedams speaks about his motivation behind the programme, “I’ve realised that a lot of women they face body shaming. They are quick to, you know, look down on themselves in terms of self-esteem.
We have so many reality TV shows in Nigeria, and I just wanted the fun aspects, you’re losing weight and at the same time, you’re documenting your progress. We’re trying to show people that this is real.”
Past contestants attest that Shedams’ passion is not just an act for the camera. Season 2 runner-up Vera Agu, says that his support has continued after her season ended, “I love the way he pushes me even after the show.”
Regardless of who wins the show, Shedams sees all the contestants as champions, “It’s a passion over profit. When I see persons, who couldn’t fit into some clothes, then fit into it and we are happy to pray for me.
So, I’m supposed to be happy. I’m supposed to be impressed, saving people’s lives.”
 
CNN also looks at Try My Job, a show which takes celebrities and influential people and tasks them with being a blue-collar worker for the day.
Creator and host Olawunmi Oyadeji says that she made the show to promote skills acquisition and entrepreneurs, “I just noticed that a lot of these guys that are doing blue-collar jobs are not really appreciated. We take them for granted. We don’t pay so much attention to what they do.”
Now in its tenth season, the show has proved to be a hit. Oyadeji talks about the concept, “The show gives celebrities, not just celebrities, influential people the opportunity to wear other people’s shoes for a day, most especially their fans.”
Oyadeji advises anyone wanting to follow in her footsteps to be prepared to work hard, “It’s a lot of patience, is a lot of money. It’s a lot of dedication.
So, you need to have a passion for what you’re doing. There are many times I wanted to give up and I woke up the next day I was like, ‘No, I can’t’.”
These two changemaking programmes show that reality TV is not always about the drama, but also about the life-changing results

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Defines A Cult Hero? Here Are Five Of Gaelic Football's Best</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The term cult hero gets banded about a lot but what does it really mean?
A quick google search describes the noun as “a writer, musician, artist, or another public figure who is greatly admired by a relatively small audience or is influential despite limited commercial success.”
It reads like an insult, however, the term is very broad in its nature and has been used to describe all types of characters in various different realms and is, more often than not, viewed as a compliment.
When the question came last week to pick a top five of Gaelic football’s cult-heroes, small audiences and limited success weren’t traits that were taken into consideration.
Instead of that were feelings of trying to mimic them in the back garden, cheering their name the loudest when watching and admiration for how they were a bit different from the rest. When their name is mentioned, memories of childhood come flooding back, fill you with joy and put a smile on your face.
With that in mind, for me, the term cult-hero describes somebody who is admired by all, possesses great skill, gets the crowd off their feet and is generally worth the entrance fee alone.
Here are five of the best.
_____
Vinnie Murphy
Dublin forward Vinnie Murphy had far from limited success. The first act of his ten-year Dublin career saw him collect four Leinster medals, an All-Star award and play in three All-Ireland finals, winning one in 1995. In the 1992 All-Ireland final, the full-forward was triple-marked by Donegal and famously, still won 19 possessions in the game.
Unfortunately, Murphy fell out of favour following a change of management in 1996 and fell off the inter-county scene. The following years saw Murphy spend time in Tralee where he played club football with Kerins O’Rahillys. The former All-Star spoke to Pundit Arena last year where he recounted how his time in Kerry renewed his passion for Gaelic football. A passion that was ultimately enough to earn him a return to the Dublin setup at 30.
Murphy returned to the setup with cult-status and although he wasn’t the player of old, he was used as a highly effective impact sub who brought the crowd to its feet when he entered the fray charging like a bull into the opposition full-back. Murphy readily admits he was once embarrassed by the crowd chanting ‘Vinnie’s gonna get ya’ in those latter years but the man himself knows it came from a place of admiration that Dublin fans, and the rest of us, had for him.
“It embarrassed me at the time but I still thought I was an elite footballer and still thought I was better. In reality, I knew exactly where I was but I’m going to have a go. I’m not going to let a team just run over me, I’m going to have a go back and I think the Dublin fans seen that. They saw a lot of themselves in me which is great.”
_____
Shane Curran
There’s a lot expected of goalkeepers in the modern game. They’re expected to kick it long, kick it short and in some cases, kick it over the bar. They modern-day goalkeeper is seen as a fly-keeper with the tactic being hailed as revolutionary to Gaelic football. The only problem with that argument is that Shane Curran was doing it for Roscommon as far back as the late nineties.
Known to many as ‘Cake’, the Roscommon man made his senior debut playing in the forwards, however, after a stint playing between the goals for Athlone Town in the League of Ireland, he returned to the Roscommon side a goalkeeper towards the turn of the century. Cake became famous throughout Ireland for his marauding runs up the field, his sensational shot-stopping and ability to kick long-range frees.
In Curran’s day, however, he was seen as a maverick rather than a revolutionary.
“Well, it’s funny, in my day I was seen as a maverick and a mad man for coming out of goal and taking frees,” Curran told Pundit Arena.
Forever the maverick, speaking to this writer earlier, Cake described the return of the fly-keeper as making goalkeeping “sexy” again. “I think it’s great to see that, I really do, in terms of making the position sexy for clubs. Clubs have been struggling for a long, long time to get goalkeepers and it’s a big problem in ladies GAA as well. It’s now becoming really sexy to play in goal and I think that’s a good thing.”

Ciaran McDonald
One of the best footballers ever, that much can’t be denied. Ciaran McDonald defined the previously used term, ‘worth the entrance fee alone’ throughout a glittering career with Mayo and his native Crossmolina.
McDonald actually made his Mayo senior debut in trying circumstances as he came on as a sub in their ill-fated 1994 Connacht final defeat to Leitrim. He would then miss Mayo’s return to the big time as he opted to spend the summer abroad in 1996 when Mayo lost an All-Ireland final replay to Meath which is mostly remembered for its infamous brawl.
The bleach-blonde McDonald returned in 1997 when Mayo again reached the final, however, despite scoring a second-half penalty, he couldn’t help his side over the line against Kerry. McDonald would lead Crossmolina to an All-Ireland club title in 2001 before guiding Mayo back to deciders in 2004 and 2006. Unfortunately, Kerry would defeat them on both occasions but McDonald could hold his head high having achieved almost ‘god-like’ status throughout the country for his iconic performances during the early part of the century.
With the hair long and blonde, socks pulled up to the knees coupled with ability and flair that made him the most recognisable player on the pitch, what made McDonald a cult hero was the complete contrast in personality off it. He wowed spectators on the field but shunned the limelight that inevitably followed. It wasn’t until a rare appearance on Second Captains back in 2015 that most of us heard him speak for the first time.
_____
Francie Bellew
Without a doubt, one of the most underrated defenders to play Gaelic football. If you hail from Down or Tyrone, you probably disagree with that statement, as you probably disliked Francie Bellew. If you were from Armagh, it was simple, you loved him. Like McDonald, a person who shunned the limelight, however, unlike McDonald, Bellew’s game wasn’t based on flair but rather his physical presence.
The Crossmaglen man was an old-school full-back in a modern era, the likes of which was rarely seen since the days of Mick Lyons in the eighties or Kieran McKeever in the nineties. It wasn’t just the spotlight that Bellew ignored as the story goes that he refused to play for Armagh until club mate Joe Kernan came on board in 2002 when Bellew was 26.
Up until then, he was happy out playing a pivotal role in Crossmaglen’s club football dominance, however, the teak-tough defender would go on to win an All-Ireland, five Ulster titles, a National League medal and an All-Star with Armagh. It comes as no surprise that his debut year coincided with Armagh’s only All-Ireland win.
He received unfair criticism in certain quarters, but on reflection, many recognise the man for what he was, a fine footballer and a winner.
_____
Geoffrey McGonagle
Loved by all in Ulster, especially his native Derry, Geoffrey McGonagle was a larger than life character known for his bustling full-forward style and ability to turn on sixpence despite possessing a body-type that didn’t necessarily lend itself to speed. What was particularly special about the Dungiven man is that he was a dual-sport cult-hero winning Ulster championships with Derry in both football and hurling.
Deceptively quick with top-level ability, McGonagle was aptly described by club and county teammate Joe Brolly as “a spectator sport in himself, delighting us and the crowds with his touch and audacity. For such a big chap, he has incredible coordination and hand speed.” Brolly also said that many times over their 14 years playing together, he could only marvel at McGonagle’s “wizardry”.
The full-forward just missed out on Derry’s golden season in 1993, making his debut with the senior team a year later winning back-to-back National League’s in 1996 and 1997 before setting up Brolly for a famous goal in the 1998 Ulster championship final, Derry’s last provincial title win.
In hurling, Derry may not be considered near the top-level, however, it’s important to note, the side was much stronger during McGonagle’s career. In the early 2000s, he picked up two Ulster championship medals with the Oak Leaf county, scoring 1-8 in the 2001 final win over Antrim.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hey Disney, The Live-Action Hercules' Muses Need To Be Black Women</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Honestly, that this gospel truth even needs to be explained is disappointing.
Because Disney is nothing if not Disney, the fact that the studio is moving forward with a plan to produce a live-action adaptation of its 1997 Hercules movie doesn’t come as a surprise in the least. Though people might not often talk about it with the same reverence that they have for Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, Hercules is a bona fide classic—partially because of its imaginative aesthetic spin on Greek mythology, but mainly because of the five goddesses who led you through the story with a series of songs that were as outstanding as they were decidedly surprising to hear in a story about Zeus’ son facing his trials.
While so much of Hercules cleaved to the demigod’s narrative roots, the Muses stood out because of how well their framing as an all-knowing girl group fit into their traditional characterization as the embodiments of the arts. More than that, though, each of the Muses—Calliope (Lillias White), Clio (Vaneese Y. Thomas), Melpomene (Cheryl Freeman), Terpsichore (LaChanze), and Thalia (Roz Ryan)—were depicted as and voiced by Black women whose collective talents turned gospel bangers into the soundtrack of fictional antiquity.
The Muses’ larger significance was something that might have been lost on non-Black theatergoers who don’t quite understand what it meant to see and hear elements of Black culture and Black people put front and centre in a way that was intentionally reverential and not at all disparaging.
To put it quite simply: Characters like the Muses simply didn’t exist in Disney’s movies before Hercules. Though the studio had produced a number of other productions revolving around characters of colour, they were almost always the focal points of stories that, on some level, felt like Disney attempting to make up for the fact that it spent decades pouring the vast majority of its energies into stories about white characters.
The Muses were some of Disney’s first characters who all read as an explicit celebration of Blackness without being sandboxed into Disney’s Black Movie Mould™, which makes them an important part of the larger animation landscape. It’s also precisely why the Muses in the live-action Hercules should also be portrayed by Black women.
Disney’s changed a number of details in the live-action remakes that it’s put out recently (Will Smith’s beatboxing Genie and Emma Watson’s engineering-minded Belle come to mind), and they’ve mostly worked because those characters were essentially presented as blank-ish slates in their original incarnations. But the Muses are so ensconsed in a specific kind of Blackness that to change that would feel like a unavoidable deviation from the canon.
The right thing to do here is easy to see, Disney. So do it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The angst over Joe Biden's assault allegation has an easy resolution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden finally confronted the rape accusation against himself on Friday. He went on MSNBC's Morning Joe, where he categorically denied the events described by his accuser, Tara Reade, had happened and insisted that he would not release his Senate papers early so reporters could look at them. On the other hand, he also said "Women have a right to be heard and the press should rigorously investigate claims they make."
All this is no doubt intensely frustrating for loyal Democratic voters. President Trump has been accused of worse than what Biden is alleged to have done, and on more than one occasion, yet largely skated from serious scrutiny. That is probably why when Chris Hayes did a segment on the story on his own MSNBC show, furious Democratic partisans made #FireChrisHayes trend nationally on Twitter.
But getting mad is not going to get Democrats out of their Biden fix. Only one thing can do that — pressuring Biden out of the race, and replacing him with someone else.
As I have previously written, Reade's story about Biden is credible. It would never meet the courtroom standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt," but given that Reade is now known to have privately told at least five people what happened at the time or in the years following, it can't be dismissed out of hand. Biden has a track record of behaving creepily around women, and has a long history of ridiculous exaggeration and telling bald-faced lies. At bottom, it is quite similar to many other #MeToo stories.
The plain fact is that this accusation is going to dog Biden for the rest of the campaign. Trump has already started talking about it. The right-wing media will cover the story for purely political reasons. Fox News does not care about #MeToo, but the story damages Biden, demoralizes Democrats, and makes liberals look like egregious hypocrites. The sight of nearly every Democratic-aligned women's rights group queasily keeping silent about the story is simply delicious for the likes of Sean Hannity (though a few have started speaking out).
It's also hard to see how Biden could conclusively "address" the story, as some liberals have advocated. At bottom it is a case of he-said-she-said, and Biden does not have a record of scrupulous honesty.
Many mainstream and lefty journalists will continue to cover it. The Reade accusation is unquestionably news, and outside of the right-wing press, there is still a broad ethic of covering stories even if they are politically inconvenient. It is not always honored, but it's still there. As The Intercept's Ryan Grim writes, "I decided early in my career that I would never suppress a story if the only reason I were doing so was concern about its political implications. If you do that, you're no longer a journalist."
However, Biden still has not been officially nominated. The Democratic National Convention is not until August 17, and before then he could be pressured into dropping out. If Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, a critical mass of the rest of other Democratic elected officials, and all the various Democratic-aligned activists groups all said in unison that Biden was unfit to be president, and should drop out for the good of the party, he probably would withdraw. The primary rules regarding candidates who drop out are somewhat vague, saying that delegates cannot be "mandated" to vote for someone else, and "shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them." But this would seem to allow Biden to instruct his delegates to support another candidate, and in 11 states there are specific rules for doing so. Realistically, no unclear legal technicalities are going to prevent someone else from getting the nomination if Biden refuses to take it.
Bernie Sanders would certainly be ruled out, despite the fact that he would have the second-most number of delegates. The entire point of the panicked scramble to endorse a clearly lousy candidate before Super Tuesday was to keep Sanders from winning. But it still could be somebody else — perhaps Washington Governor Jay Inslee, or California Governor Gavin Newsom, both of whom have handled the coronavirus pandemic relatively well (unlike New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose incompetent bungling created the worst outbreak in the world). Inslee or Newsom would not be my first choice, but at least they have no rape allegations against them and are in full possession of their faculties.
Or simpler still, as Alex Pareene suggests, Democrats could simply re-start the primary and see who wins. There would surely be some controversy, but most Democratic voters would wind up happier in the end.
Frankly, I cannot possibly believe this will happen. Democratic elites had no problem bending the rules to help Michael Bloomberg, or indeed sending their loyal voters out into the teeth of a viral pandemic to vote in person to put away Sanders. It is clearly within their power to send Biden packing. But they have neither the wisdom nor the foresight of the cynical party bosses of old, who would have thrown him out on his ear long ago.
Biden could also still win. Given the appalling economic conditions likely to prevail in November, a random person picked off the street would have a good chance of beating Trump. But still, if you are already exhausted at the prospect of months of arguments about whose sexual assault allegations are worse, the escape hatch is still open.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Believe women? Sure, say Democrats, but vet their claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — “Believe women” was never a call to believe all women automatically.
That’s what leading Democrats, including the prominent figures of the #MeToo movement, are suggesting as they stand behind former Vice-President Joe Biden and his bid to unseat President Donald Trump. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the female senators who ran for president and prominent Hollywood activists, they’re not backing down after Biden on Friday publicly denied a former aide’s accusation that he assaulted her in 1993.
“It never happened,” Biden said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “Believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward, and then vet it, look into it. That’s true in this case as well. … But in the end, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is the claims are false.”
It was largely the denial Democrats were hoping for.
Even so, there was a clear discomfort and perhaps resentment with being on defence on the issue while campaigning against a president accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct. (Trump has denied the allegations.) Especially galling to some is the charge by Republicans that Democrats are giving Biden a pass they didn’t afford Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault when they were teenagers.
Pelosi, the nation’s highest-ranking Democrat, recognized the maw and curtly stepped around it.
“I don’t need a lecture or a speech,” she said at her weekly news conference as she cut into a reporter’s question about a double standard. “With all the respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, I have the highest regard for Joe Biden. And that’s what I have to say about that.”
Others have been less succinct. Actress and leading #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano sat behind Kavanaugh during his televised confirmation hearings, a position she sought as a way to stand in “solidarity” with Blasey Ford.
But as the Reade allegations swirled around Biden and a party finally uniting around him, Milano penned an essay for Deadline.com in which she acknowledged “shades of gray” and reiterated her support for the former vice-president.
“Believing women was never about ‘Believe all women no matter what they say,’ it was about changing the culture of NOT believing women by default,” Milano wrote.
Karen Finney, a prominent Democratic strategist and message-maker who worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, rejected the Kavanaugh comparison outright.
In the context of sexual assault allegations, Finney said “believe women” doesn’t mean accepting as fact any assertion, but instead means affording women the default credibility to take claims seriously.
“If you start from the premise that this person is telling the truth, then you do the investigation and look at the facts,” she said, “and if the facts tell a different story, then that’s an important conversation to have.”
Biden’s supporters in the Senate, too, have stood by him, including some who challenged him for the nomination and are now said to be on his short list for a running mate.
But a few hours after his appearance on MSNBC, Trump’s campaign posted a video featuring many of them — Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii — saying in the past that female accusers should be believed.
The reel begins and ends with Biden and Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee whose husband, Bill Clinton, was impeached in connection with his extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Senate acquitted him, but the episode remains one of the party’s fraught chapters in its advocacy for women.
Biden appeared Friday to recognize the need to reinforce his commitment.
During an evening virtual fundraiser with hundreds of veterans from the Obama administration, he addressed the matter again, repeating his assertions that Reade’s account “didn’t happen,” but explaining that his reaction doesn’t amount to hypocrisy because of how Democrats have approached the #MeToo movement.
“My knowledge that it isn’t true does nothing to shake my belief that women have to be able to be heard and that all the claims be taken seriously,” Biden said. “It isn’t enough just to simply take my word for it and dismiss it out of hand. Frankly, that shouldn’t be enough for anyone because we know that sort of approach is how the culture of abuse has been allowed to fester for so long.”
Unreleased document troves — Biden’s at the the University of Delaware and other Senate files at the National Archives — have raised questions about what might be found in them. Reade says she filed a complaint about Biden with the Senate. Biden says such a document, if it exists, would be stored in the archives.
A dozen times on MSNBC, Biden said he knew of no complaint Reade had filed against him and got somewhat mired in the details of where such a document might be stored.
Biden was asked if he is “absolutely certain” and “absolutely positive, that there is no record of any complaint by Tara Reade” against him.
His answer was highly qualified: “I’m absolutely positive that no one that I’m aware of, ever, was —been made aware of any complaint, a formal complaint, made by or a complaint by Tara Reade against me at the time this allegedly happened, 27 years ago,” until he announced his campaign for president.
Then Biden tried again:
“I know of no one who’s aware that any complaint was made.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Between the former Chicago resident cameo and Dennis Rodman nostalgia, you might be enjoying ESPN’s ten-part The Last Dance, but if you ask documentarian Ken Burns, the whole endeavor is one massive air ball. “I find it the opposite direction of where we need to be going,” the Academy Award–nominated filmmaker behind The Civil War and Baseballtold the Wall Street Journal this week.
So why, exactly, does Ken Burns, who says he hasn’t seen the series, dislike The Last Dance — which explores Michael Jordan’s basketball legacy, focusing on his time spent with the Chicago Bulls — so much? According to Burns, the involvement of Jordan’s production company, Jump 23, on the project calls into question the legitimacy of Last Dance as a documentary.
“If you are there influencing the very fact of it getting made, it means that certain aspects that you don’t necessarily want in aren’t going to be in, period,” says Burns, saying he himself would “never, never, never, never” allow such a partnership on one of his films. Added the documentarian, “And that’s not the way you do good journalism … and it’s certainly not the way you do good history, my business.” ESPN’s The Last Dance is currently airing every Sunday until May 17.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Micro review: 'Untamed' by Glennon Doyle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">'Untamed' is the new memoir by Glennon Doyle, the author of the bestselling memoir 'Love Warrior'.
While 'Love Warrior' was about how she hit a terrible low and got out of it, this book is about what she's learnt and how she's grown since. She divorced her husband and married again, this time she married a woman and she seems to be stronger and steadier. Most of the book is filled with her beliefs along with the anecdotes of what cemented them. It's called 'Úntamed' because she looks into how society has raised women to be and feels it's in a way that curbs their wild beauty and she explores that wonderfully. She also speaks on how being sensitive is not a weakness but a power and explores that in an empowering way. There is also a lot of honest self-reflection in the book.
If one has read a lot of self help books, feminist books, and self discovery memoirs, this book might not offer much new, just a different perspective. However the book is still worth a read for it's well written, insightful and thought-provoking. However if one wants to read an inspiring memoir, this is a brilliant book to pick up.
How critics view the book:
“Filled with hopeful messages . . . encourag[ing] women to reject the status quo and follow their intuition . . . This testament to female empowerment and self-love, with an endearing coming-out story at the center, will delight readers.”— Publishers Weekly
“She is a terrific storyteller. . . . Whether discussing her children or the world outside, challenging conformity, confronting misogyny, or standing up to religious bigotry, her goal as a memoirist (and as a person) is to defy expectations and to help others break out of their cultural cages so that everyone can find their own version of humanity. A bracing jolt of honesty from someone who knows what she wants to say and isn’t afraid to say it.”— Booklist

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Biden and the Presumption of Innocence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Regarding Tara Reade’s allegation that she was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden in 1993, and what the allegation could mean for Democrats this fall, some stock phrases come to mind. Hoisted on their own petard. What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Be careful what you wish for.
Above all: The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Let’s not start with the Brett Kavanaugh precedent. Or with the vindictive excesses of the #MeToo movement, typified by the Aziz Ansari story, the “Shitty Media Men List” and Al Franken’s resignation from the Senate. Go back further than Juanita Broaddrick’s appearance, like Banquo’s ghost, at the second debate in 2016, which did so much to blunt the Clinton campaign’s case about Donald Trump’s moral unfitness for office.
Rewind instead to 2011, when then-Vice President Biden and Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced a new policy of “comprehensive guidance” on matters of sexual violence and harassment for any school, college or university receiving federal aid. The guidance, issued in the form of a “Dear Colleague” letter, demanded that campus administrators use a “preponderance of evidence” standard — also known as “50 percent plus a feather” — to adjudicate accusations of sexual assault.
As with so many such policies, the intentions were irreproachable. To take a zero-tolerance attitude toward every form of sexual abuse. To transform the way that women thought of their experiences of abuse and of their rights. To teach men to think much harder about their behavior and their responsibilities. As Biden put it in a 2015 speech, “We need a fundamental change in our culture. And the quickest way to change culture is to change it on campuses of America.”
But if the goal was laudable, the means frequently were not. It’s one thing to use a “preponderance of evidence” standard in a civil case. It’s another when there’s a 50 percent minus a feather chance that an innocent person might have his (and occasionally her) reputation destroyed and life wrecked by a dubious accusation.
Within a few years there were at least hundreds of such cases. Accused students, sometimes facing charges based on ambiguous sexual encounters, were left to fend for themselves in campus tribunals with little regard for due process. Guilty verdicts in these kangaroo courts tended to run high, but so did stories of financial settlements between schools and the families of the accused.
There’s no reason why one can’t be in favor of tough penalties for sexual misconduct and fairness toward the accused. But if Biden ever spoke up against the miscarriages of justice carried out in the name of his policy, I’m unaware of it.
Nor, with honorable exceptions like The Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus, do I recall liberal politicians and pundits worrying about the unintended consequences of the #BelieveWomen approach to allegations of sexual misconduct. So long as it was politically advantageous — as it was with Kavanaugh-accuser Christine Blasey Ford — then women were seen as courageous truth tellers.
By contrast, when it was not advantageous — as it was with Clinton accusers like Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey, or with Tara Reade today — then they were unreliable people whose accounts had to be scrupulously weighed against the available evidence.
This is the “heads, I win; tails you lose” school of political argument. It fits in well with the “sentence first — verdict afterward” school of legal judgment from which it emerges, along with the “all women are truthful, but some are more truthful than others” school of forensic analysis.
In his Friday morning interview on MSNBC, Biden was asked by Mika Brzezinski how he could square his past support for Blasey Ford — “you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts,” as he said at the time — with his insistence that Reade’s allegation is unequivocally false. Biden’s answer, “Women have a right to be heard and the press should rigorously investigate claims they make,” was what a lawyer would call non-responsive. Being “heard” is not, and should never be, the same thing as being believed. The entire difference between hearsay and proof, rumor and reason, mob rule and justice, lies in the distinction.
For my part, I don’t believe Biden. I don’t believe Reade, either, barring dispositive factual disclosures. Belief in the absence of convincing evidence is a form of religion. It should not be a part of our legal system, confirmation hearings, campus codes, or political campaigns.
What I do believe in is the presumption of innocence, whether in courts of law or public opinion, and in high standards of proof for high sorts of crime. That’s a presumption I will continue to extend to Biden. The least he can do now is extend it to everyone else, including those who suffered when he didn’t.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Part 2: ‘I’m Always Paying Attention To Where My Power Is, Especially During The Coronavirus’: Rhonda Ross Shares Wisdom On Coping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 10th is Mother’s Day. This two-part series about mom-daughter duo, Rhonda and Diana Ross, is dedicated to Moms everywhere. Before social distancing mandates, I attended a Diana Ross concert with no idea who the opening act would be. It turned out to be daughter, Rhonda Ross. A singer/songwriter in her own right, Rhonda’s own unique style and incredible voice brought the house down. It was obvious to me that, following in her mom’s footsteps, Rhonda has the chops to make it big. But something else about this singer/songwriter captivated me. Her latest album, “In Case You Didn’t Know,” reflects her life philosophy of resilience, knowing where you hold your personal power and how they sustain you through the kind of hard knocks we’re all experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rhonda shared her personal approach to dealing with the Coronavirus anxiety in the second part of my interview.
Bryan Robinson: Rhonda, how do you spend your time on the road?
Rhonda Ross: I take my physical, mental and spiritual health extremely seriously. And I do that in all parts of my life wherever I am. One of the things I do on tour is spend a lot of time paying attention to my thoughts. I’m a thought person. When I’m public speaking, I tell a joke that I’m a power monger. I’m always paying attention to where I have power, where I’m holding on to it and where I’m giving it away. One of the places where my power resides is in my thoughts, “What am I thinking about whatever is happening in my life right now?” I’ve worked on that in my quote “time off.” I listen to spiritual teachers. I’m not a TV watcher, except for conscious watching. I can be in a hotel for two weeks and not turn on a TV. I don’t even realize it’s there. I watch very little news. I have a digital subscription to The New York Times and go there to read an article here and there. But I don’t leave the TV on loop.
Robinson: I wanted to circle back to what you said about where you hold your power because this has significance for readers struggling with COVID-19 fears and job loss in the era of social distancing, along with the mindset they take to work. Could you talk a little more about how you do that.
Ross: I’m very aware that the way I feel about something has less to do with what that something is and more to do with how I’m looking at it. We get stuck in thinking that the feeling we’re having is coming from what the thing is; therefore, we have to change what the thing is so we can feel better and not be stressed out or depressed. But that way of thinking gives me no power because I have to change that thing which is very likely unchangeable. And even if it is changeable, it will take crazy amounts of energy on my part to change it. That goes from everything from the government to my husband who doesn’t do the dishes when I want him to. I can’t change him, and I can’t change my son.
Robinson: You’re talking about your perspective.
Ross: It’s all about my perspective, so what is it about my perspective that I have control over? I have control of how I see it, how much I focus on it, how much energy and time I give to it, how much mental space I give to it. Let’s take the coronavirus, for example. I can’t stop a global virus. So I can be stressed or scared or tense about it, which will only hurt me in terms of high blood pressure or depression and other mental and physical problems. Or I can look at the parts of it that are not as scary like how many people have recovered from it. And I can do the things in my life that help me feel in control or give me back my power. I can wipe down the phone, keep my hands clean, I can keep my immunity up. I can get sleep and drink water and make sure I’m not running myself ragged. One of the things that gives me power and control is to not think about what’s going to happen two weeks or six months from now because no one knows. I can focus in the now, be present and know that for right now I’m healthy and safe. I’m not with my son right now and there’s a feeling of wanting to micromanage his hand washing from thousands of miles away. I’m going to trust that they’re doing it. I’m going to breathe and take time to not freak out and panic. This is all to say what things can I control and what things do I have power in. When you focus on where your power is and activate things you have power over, you feel like you’re not being batted around by life. You’re not being thrown up against the wall. You get to walk in your own control, and that is huge for me whether it be the coronavirus or anything else. I’m always thinking about where my power is in this moment and where am I giving it away whether it’s to something else or to somebody else’s opinion.
Robinson: That’s so wise. Our power comes from what we do with what life brings us, because we can’t change life. I love the way you put that.
Ross: I like to think about it like a sailboat. The wind comes, but you don’t get angry at the wind and say, “Why are you coming from the north? You’re not supposed to be coming from the north!” You adjust your sails and keep going by adjusting your sails. That’s where your power is: the adjustment of how you handle what’s coming at you. I think we get into the habit of complaining about everything from the weather to our circumstances. Just the alleviation of that one habit can change how you think. Then going one step further beyond complaining is appreciating how beautiful that tree is blowing in the wind or what great color on that woman or that bird as it’s flying. You talk about something that will reduce stress, it’s walking through life with appreciation.
Robinson: It absolutely will. And it will draw others to you. People want to be around that kind of energy.
Ross: It’s true. I was laughing with my husband some years ago. We were on a flight and he was in a mood, complaining about everything. As soon as we were airborne, the seat in front of him came back but his seat wouldn’t go back, then something else didn’t work (laughs). And he was feeling everything was going wrong, but everything was going right for me. I said to him, “You came on the plane already in a complaining space, and you had a terrible flight, and I had a great flight. And I was sitting right beside you.” It has nothing to do with the objectivity of it. It’s the subjectivity of how one person can be walking through life seeing all the great and beautiful things and attract the nice people. And somebody else can be having a totally different experience. My personal belief is that the difference in your experience is tied to your thoughts, your perceptions and how much you’re complaining or appreciating.
Robinson: That’s so true.
Ross: There are times when things don’t go well for me. My first thought, instead of blaming the world for it, is to ask where my head is and how I found myself here. And I don’t even have to go back and figure it out. I can switch it right now in the moment. That’s my practice and my work all day whether I’m on tour or not. With the kind of pace and routine we have, thinking like that has allowed for everything to go smoothly. Everything I talk about is in my music. To me it’s all the same whether I’m speaking, singing or living—it’s all the same stuff.
Happy Mother’s Day!

    <h5 class="mb-1">TV for Wednesday, May 6</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boomers and Gen-Xers probably won’t like some of the home truths spouted from the mouths of babes in this enlightening and ultimately endearing episode of the Q&A series. Upfront, anyone pretty much over the age of 18 is warned about their “use by” date and that soon enough, “you’re all gonna be dead”. Such cockiness aside, there is much to absorb here about the state of the planet from those about to inherit it.
Concerning the worst crime a woman can commit towards another, this Blue Mountains psycho-thriller based on Michael Robotham’s book follows a popular narrative of twisted female jealousy. This kind of story does the sisterhood no good, of course, but is well executed here by a cast headed by Downtown Abbey’s Laura Carmichael and Australian actress Jessica De Gouw (Arrow). Tonight’s events are the stuff of new mothers’ nightmares.
The writers’ room in-jokes (laugh tracks, closed captioning, random script notes) are not out of place in this acerbically self-referential animation series that tonight takes one of its bleakly funny trips into the future. Predictably, it’s is a dystopian capitalist dream for the aged Stewie, who decides to revisit the crumbling family home and its decrepit inhabitants. The gags tumble over each other, but among the best is the imagined pop music trajectory. American Dad follows at 9.30pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' Actor Sam Lloyd Dies at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known for his role as New Sacred Heart lawyer Ted Buckland on the long-running NBC-ABC medical comedy Scrubs, died Thursday night in Los Angeles, his rep, Kevin Turner, told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 56.
The Vermont native had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year, which was revealed in a GoFundMe campaign launched by Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife, Jill. The fundraiser had raised nearly $160,000.
In a family statement provided by his wife, Vanessa Lloyd, she wrote, "Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30th, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer. Our family is devastated. It doesn't feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.
"The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong," she continued. "Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston."
Scrubs star Zach Braff paid tribute to Lloyd on Twitter, writing: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence also paid his respects on social media, tweeting: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Aside from appearing on 95 episodes of Scrubs as Buckland, Lloyd reprised the role for another Lawrence series, Cougar Town. His other TV credits included Lawrence's Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. On the film side, he appeared in Galaxy Quest and Flubber.
Survivors include his wife and Weston, who was born in 2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd -- best known for portraying lawyer Ted Buckland on the sitcom "Scrubs" -- has died, his agent confirmed to Fox News on Friday. He was 56.
Lloyd died on Thursday as a result of complications from lung cancer, according to a statement obtained by Fox News from the late actor's wife, Vanessa.

"Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston," the statement concluded.
In January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with a brain tumor shortly after Vanessa gave birth to their first child together -- a son named Weston, according to a GoFundMe page for the late actor. Doctors also found that the cancer had metastasized from his lungs and spread to his spine, jaw and liver, per the page, which was created by "Scrubs" executive producer Tim Hobert.
In addition to starring as Ted on the long-running series "Scrubs," Lloyd appeared in a handful of shows over the span of his career, including "Cougar Town,” “Desperate Housewives,” “Seinfeld,” “Modern Family,” “The West Wing” and “Shameless,” as well as movies such as “Flubber” and “Galaxy Quest.”

According to Variety, Lloyd also sang in an a cappella group The Blanks, which performed on "Scrubs" as The Worthless Peons. He also played bass guitar in the Beatles tribute band The Butties.
Following news of his passing, tributes poured in from the "Scrubs" family.
Bill Lawrence, creator of “Scrubs,” shared a behind-the-scenes snapshot of Lloyd, captioning it: “Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Zach Braff tweeted: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd: 5 Things To Know About The ‘Scrubs’ Actor Who Died At 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, famous for playing the eccentric lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, has sadly passed away at 56 years old. The television star’s agent confirmed the tragic news to our sister website, Variety, on May 1. This is the same day that the public learned of the tragedy, and tributes soon flooded Twitter on Friday — among them, Scrubs’ lead star Zach Braff and the show’s creator, Bill Lawrence, contributed their own solemn words (which you can see below).
Sam had only experienced fatherhood for a few weeks when he received the life-changing diagnosis of his brain tumor in Jan. 2019. At the time, surgeons couldn’t remove the tumor and the cancer went on to spread to his lungs, jaw, liver and spine, according to a GoFundMe page that Scrubs producer Tim Hobert and his wife Jill Tracy set up. However, targeted cell therapy made major improvements within a few months, and Sam revealed that the tumor and hematoma in his brain were “virtually gone” by May of 2019. By March of 2020, Tim had sad news to share. The cell therapy began to “lose its effectiveness” and Sam underwent three brain surgeries, before he eventually passed away weeks later. Now, learn more about the beloved actor whom family, friends and fans are mourning.
1. Sam was most famous for his roles on Scrubs and Desperate Housewives. Sam cracked up viewers with his portrayal of lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, a role that he played for 95 episodes between 2001-2009. His other biggest role was Dr. Albert Goldfine on Desperate Housewives, which he played between 2004-2005. He has made appearances in a number of other notable TV shows: Seinfeld, Modern Family, Cougar Town, Shameless and more. He also made cameos on West Wing and Malcom in the Middle, both shows that his famous uncle — Back to the Future Star Christopher Lloyd — also guest-starred on!
2. He has graced the big screen. Although TV was Sam’s forte, he also had roles in big name films like Flubber, Galaxy Quest and Rising Sun.
3. Sam was musically gifted. He sang in an a cappella group called The Blanks (you might’ve heard the ensemble’s tunes on Scrubs, under the name of “The Worthless Peons”). Sam had also worked on a musical for a decade, which was even accepted into a “prestigious theatre accelerator program” right before his cancer diagnosis, according to the actor’s GoFundMe page.
4. The actor is survived by his wife, Vanessa, and their young child.  Sam and Vanessa welcomed their first child together, a baby boy named Weston, right before Sam learned he had cancer. Sam spent his last year of life bonding and FaceTiming with his precious son, as seen on precious photos on his GoFundMe page.
5. Sam’s life was honored with touching tributes from his TV family. Zach (Braff) took to Twitter shortly after the tragedy broke, writing, “Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.”
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence shared a throwback photo from the set of the medical comedy, writing, “Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' star Sam Lloyd has died aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BELOVED US TV star Sam Lloyd has sadly passed away. 
Lloyd, who was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the hit medical comedy series Scrubs, died on Thursday evening in Los Angeles, aged 56. 
His representative, Kevin Turner, confirmed the tragic news to The Hollywood Reporter. 
Lloyd, who was originally from Vermont, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour last year. 
News of his illness was revealed after Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife Jill launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his treatment. 
The campaign raised close to $160,000. 
However, an update on the GoFundMe campaign page revealed back in February that Sam had been rushed to hospital after suffering swelling on his brain. 
Though doctors were able to remove a tumour, there were further complications resulting in two further emergency brain surgeries. 
Sam was later transferred to ICU at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA, where he was put on a “breathing tube and feeding tube”.  
News of his sad passing prompted an outpouring of tributes from his Scrubs co-star. 
They were led by Zach Braff, who wrote on Twitter: 
Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy." 
Fellow co-star and character actor Robert Maschio also posted a warm tribute to his late colleague, posting a picture of them together alongside the message: “Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met.  ‘Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace. #RIPSamLloyd.” 
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, meanwhile wrote: "Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it - he had the biggest heart of all of us. But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones." 
A regular and much loved character on Scrubs, Sam enjoyed a raft of appearances across some of America’s best loved comedies of the past few decades with credits on Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. 
He also racked up an impressive film resume that includes parts in Galaxy Quest and Flubber. 
A warm, funny and talented man, he is survived by his wife Vanessa and son Weston, who was born in 2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd, best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the comedy-drama "Scrubs" has died at the age of 56, TMZ reported on Friday. 
"Scrubs" creator Bill Lawrence took to Twitter the same day to express his condolences on hearing the sad news.
In the popular TV series "Scrubs", Lloyd portrayed a depressed lawyer who had suicidal thoughts due to self-esteem issues and was plainly inept at his profession.
Apart from "Scrubs", Lloyd also appeared on "Desperate Housewives," "Happy Together," "Shameless," and "Modern Family".
Doctors said earlier that his brain tumour was inoperable.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King’s Carole Baskin tricked into giving first interview by pranksters posing as Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TIGER King's Carole Baskin's first interview since the popular show came out on Netflix in March premiered Sunday.
The big cat activist thought she was exclusively talking to Jimmy Fallon when she was really talking to two YouTube pranksters.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners wanted to see if they could trick celebrities into giving them interviews.
They do this by telling victims that they would be talking to a late-night show host, like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon.
From this they were able to score an exclusive chat with Baskin by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon.
In the fake interview, Carole revealed she “had to let go about half of our staff” because her sanctuary’s been closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Though she said she and handful of volunteers are working “double-time” to care for the haven’s 55 exotic cats, she confessed she doesn’t know if they’ll “ever going to be able to do tours again.”
Carole, who told Us Weekly she “isn’t angry” about the “fun prank,” was also persuaded to wear her flower crown while showing pictures of herself and her third husband, Howard Baskin.
She told the outlet: “I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped, but had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank.
“It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited.”
She used the interview with the YouTubers as an opportunity to talk about a proposed law aimed at stopping the exploitation and abuse of big cats in zoos.
Josh talked to INSIDER about why he chose Carole and how he was able to get her to agree to a fake interview.
He explained: "Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show.
"And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?"
He then explained that they used a fake email address to reach Carole and tell her they were producing live segments for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
Ultimately, she agreed to the interview.
They then went through thousands of Jimmy Fallon clips where he uses the word "cat" and pieced them all together to make Carole believe she was actually talking to the late-night show host.
Josh explained: "As you'll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he's interviewed the cast of 'Cats,' and he's actually interviewed a real cat.
"So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that."
Of course, the way the two YouTubers landed the interview may seem a little shady and may have people wondering whether it's illegal or not.
The 26-year-old had previously explained their methodology in another interview: "I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong," Pieters said in a previous interview.
"We always try to give people a bit of a chance."
The interviewer admitted that they weren't really expecting it to work.
He said: "Like all of our ideas, we really didn't expect it to work, and then it did work," he said. "I guess it's that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working," he said. "And then when it does work, it's always quite fun to watch."
Baskin is a "very interesting lady," Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
"We really did not expect it to work," he said. "We still can't really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin."
As most people know, Carole is one of the main characters in the docuseries Tiger King.
She was Joe Exotic's enemy and spent years trying to shut down his zoo and cub petting operation.
It was the Tiger King himself who first alleged that Carole murdered her first husband, Don Lewis.
Carole, never officially a suspect, has vehemently protested her innocence over “lies and innuendos” in the Netflix series.
The animal activist simply claimed that he had disappeared and made for dead, but new evidence shows he was actually murdered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carole Baskin Tricked Into Giving First Major TV Interview Since ‘Tiger King,’ Says ‘I Was Suspicious’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Kristine Lofgren
Carole Baskin gave her first major interview since the Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” hit televisions across the country. While the big cat advocate thought she was speaking with Jimmy Fallon, it turned out that she was actually chatting with two YouTubers who tricked her into spilling details about her experience filming the show.
As Business Insider reports, Josh Pieters and Archie Manners reached out to Baskin to see if they could trick her into appearing in their video. Pieters conducted the interview, while Manners acted as a producer. They played clips of old television episodes of Jimmy Fallon’s show, The Tonight Show.
With so many interviews taking place remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two saw an opportunity to trick celebrities into conducting interviews.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters said. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
To their surprise, Baskins agreed. They compiled a bunch of clips of Fallon talking about cats in order to prepare for their interview.
Baskin opened up about the challenges they’ve been facing at her big cat rescue in Citrus Park, Florida. She told them that she has been forced to lay off half her staff since they can no longer allow people to visit the park. She also talked about her choice of headwear – a type of lei – and urged people not to pay to see tiger cubs.
Since the news of the fake interview hit the media outlets, Baskins opened up about being tricked into giving an interview.
“I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited,” she told Us Weekly magazine.
In the past, Baskins has said that she was upset with the way she was portrayed on the show, which spent an entire episode focused on the disappearance of her husband. She says that people who are focused on finding out what happened to her late husband missed the point.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers Trick Carole Baskin Into Thinking She Was Being Interviewed For ‘The Tonight Show’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Netflix’s Tiger King blew up in March, the show’s stars scrambled to give interviews with anyone who’d listen. All except Carole Baskin.
Now she’s given her first public interview since the docuseries aired, and it was all because two YouTubers pranked her into thinking they were producers for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners came up with a plan to download clips from actual Jimmy Fallon interviews and put them into a soundboard on their iPad. They then reached out for a chat.
“She said no, because the Tiger Queen hates Tiger King for making suggestions she was involved in her husband’s disappearance,” Pieters said.
“So we emailed her again saying we wouldn’t talk about Tiger King, which was fine for us because we couldn’t make Jimmy Fallon talk about Tiger King.
“We said we’d just talk about cats.”
It turns out Fallon has interviewed Kat Dennings, the stars of the movie Cats, and Bob Irwin holding a cat, all of which were very useful as soundbite fodder.
While there was nothing groundbreaking in the interview, we did learn a few tidbits about how Big Cat Rescue is coping during the pandemic.
“We have so many cats depending on us, we don’t have a choice in the situation,” Baskin said.
She said they’ve stockpiled around 9,000 kilos of frozen meat and still have volunteers on hand to look after the animals every day.
“After COVID-19 I just don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to do tours again,” she added.
The fact this stunt was pulled off so smoothly shouldn’t come as a surprise – these are the same guys who literally flew professional racist Katie Hopkins to Prague as part of an elaborate prank to get her to pose in front of a sign reading C. U. N. T.
The boys have form.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Carole Baskin breaks silence and says sanctuary may be forced to close</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King star Carole Baskin has revealed her business may be forced to close after the coronavirus pandemic as she broke her silence.
The cat sanctuary owner had refused to give interviews following the global success of the Netflix series after her rival Joe Exotic accused her of murdering her husband in the show, something she obviously denies.
But Carole was tricked into giving her first interview by YouTube star Archie Manners and his prankster pal Josh Pieters.
Archie convinced Carole that Jimmy Fallon wanted to interview her and used audio clips from old shows to construct questions so she'd believe she really was talking to the TV presenter.
She spoke about how the sanctuary is coping in the coronavirus lockdown, revealing she's had to sack half her staff and is having to work seven days a week.
Carole explained: "My daughter and I still come into the sanctuary every day because we have to take care of all the big cats here.
"Unfortunately due to the loss of tourism revenue we've had to let go of about half of our staff and thankfully all of our animal care is done by volunteers.
"The animals are still getting their daily care but it means all of us are having to work double time to make sure that happens."
She admitted that the coronavirus pandemic may mean they never open again.
Carole continue: "I work seven days a week but I'm a workaholic so I really love doing this work.
"After Covid-19 I just don't know if we're ever going to be able to do tours again."
Carole has avoided talking to the media since Tiger King debuted on Netflix as she slammed the show for delving into the theory that she murdered her husband.
To get her to agree to his interview, Archie posed as an employee from a production company and insisted that they would only ask her about cats.
They sent her a Zoom link and told her that Jimmy would be asking the questions over the phone so it wouldn't break their cover.
Carole hasn't responded to the prank yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers trick Carole Baskin into first interview since Tiger King</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTubers Josh Pieters and Archie Manners tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first interview since Tiger King after they convinced her that she was talking to Jimmy Fallon.
The pair reassured her that they would not talk about Netflix or Tiger King and she joked that she didn't want to be referred to as 'that b**** Carole Baskin'.
They tell her that she won't see the host as she speaks into the webcam while she even breaks out her signature "hey all you cool cats and kittens" phrase.
They used a soundboard with generic questions and quotes from Fallon.
Viewers were amazed that the pair managed to pull it off, as Baskin has shunned all media and interviews since the hit docuseries dropped on Netflix.
She was unhappy with how she was portrayed and the episode which focused on the disappearance of her ex-husband Don Lewis.
Baskin realised what had happened afterwards.
Commenting on the video, she wrote: "This is the email I sent to my husband and daughter after the interview: 'Well that was weird. I couldn't see Fallon during the interview, and when they had his voice on the questions they didn't sound like it was specific to the topic.
"'He'd just say things they could have recorded from any other interview; like - what are you doing during Quarantine?
"'At the end he said: 'Miss you buddy,' so that really didn't sound like it was live from him to me.
"'They did stick to the questions they gave us, so I just can't tell. This whole thing may have been a spoof and they said they won't broadcast till next week, and will let us know before they do, but I'm not holding my breath.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Tiger King’s Carole Baskin Is Hilariously Tricked Into Finally Doing 1st Interview After Doc — Watch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix’s Tiger King became a viral quarantine sensation in mid-March, making star Carole Baskin a household name! Since the seven-part documentary series premiered, however, the Big Cat Rescue founder has repeatedly denied interview requests — until now. The 58-year-old received a number of emails inviting her to appear on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last month, however, it turns out the requests weren’t from producers, but YouTube pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners!
The hilarious duo came up with quite the scheme, emailing Big Cat Rescue and posing as a third party production company which books celebrity guests on the popular late-night show. In various emails showed in Josh and Archie’s video — which they dubbed a “worldwide exclusive” — Carole, and her husband Howard Baskin, repeatedly denied the invitation due to how she was portrayed in the series. “They devoted an entire segment to 23-year-old lies and innuendos suggesting I was involved in my husband Don [Lewis‘] 1997 appearance,” an email, allegedly written by Carole, read(of note, Carole has never been convicted of any crime). Eventually, the Florida resident changed her tune and agreed one one condition: they only talk about cats.
After an initial phone call where they discussed the interview, and an email from her husband Howard — also her lawyer — confirming a date, the duo were ready to rock ‘n’ roll! From there, Josh and Archie scoured the internet for clips of Jimmy talking about cats to cut together video clips as “questions.” Carole called into the scheduled Zoom call as planned, and Archie worked his magic. “You’ll only be able to hear [Jimmy], but he will be able to see you because of the cameras in his house — you can’t talk too much,” Archie explained, as Carole hilariously responded, “Something every husband wants!”
“I’m doing great, my daughter Jamie [Murdock] suggested I do this interview with you, she says hi. And we are working every day with the in the sanctuary,” Carole explained to “Jimmy”, noting that the cats have been keeping her busy in quarantine. “My husband and I live about five miles from the sanctuary and my daughter lives next door to us. My daughter and I still come in to the sanctuary every day as we have to take care of all the big cats here…we have so many cats depending on us, we don’t have a choice in the situation,” the Big Cat Rescue founder and CEO said.
Like many businesses, Big Cat Rescue was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced much of America to social distance. “Unfortunately, due to the loss of tourism revenue, we had to let go of half of our staff,” Carole revealed. “And thankfully, a lot of our animal care is being done by our volunteers. Our animals are still getting their daily care, but it means all of us are having to work double time,” she also said, noting that she wasn’t “sure” if they would ever be able to have tourists again. Carole also sent Josh and Archie a number of never-before-seen photos, which they cut into a hilarious montage titled “Baskin’ In The Glory.” At time of publishing, Big Cat Rescue has yet to acknowledge the prank on both their website and social media platforms.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Tiger King’ Star Carole Baskin Duped Into Interview By YouTubers Playing Clips Of Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin is the latest celeb to be hoaxed by YouTube tricksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.
The British duo recently tested a theory: would celebrities agree to an interview when played recorded soundbites of James Corden taken from “The Late Late Show”?
It worked like a charm, with the pair easily tricking U.K. pop star Craig David, TikTok performer Holly H, “Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein into believing they were having conversations with the actual James Corden, when in reality they were playing clips from his talk show.
For their next stunt, the duo tried the same thing with Carole Baskin of “Tiger King” fame, using clips of Jimmy Fallon from “The Tonight Show”.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high-level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They decided to reach out to Baskin, never expecting she’d actually take them up on it — until she did. The result is Baskin’s first major interview since the debut of “Tiger King”.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
According to Pieters, celebrities are given a false sense of security when they hear the familiar voices such as Fallon and Corden.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters explained. “You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
According to Pieters, Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” although he admitted he never expected she’d actually go through with it.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video of the interview is scheduled to go live on their YouTube channel at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers claim they tricked 'Tiger King' star Carole Baskin into first public interview since show's release</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two YouTubers have claimed they've tricked Carole Baskin, a star of Netflix's "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness," into her first public interview since the show's release.
The pair of Internet personalities -- Archie Manners and Josh Pieters -- shared a video online, detailing how they managed to score interviews with Baskin and several other celebrities by posing as staffers from various popular late-night talk shows, such as "The Tonight Show."
'TIGER KING': CAROLE, HOWARD BASKIN SAY THEY FEEL 'BETRAYAL' FROM FILMMAKERS, ARE GETTING DEATH THREATS
The duo's video explained that they'd use audio clips from popular hosts such as Jimmy Fallon to trick stars into believing they were speaking with the famous comedians via audio.
In their video, Manners and Pieters revealed that they posed as producers of Fallon's show when they asked to interview the big-cat enthusiast.
[WARNING: The video below contains graphic language.]
Baskin initially turned down the request, Manners and Pieters said, but eventually accepted after they promised not to speak about "Tiger King," which they explained "was fine with us because we couldn't make Jimmy Fallon talk about 'Tiger King.'"
Manners and Pieters explained that they used clips of Fallon's interviews mentioning the word "cat," including interviews with Kat Dennings and cast members of the musical movie "Cats."
Baskin spoke with the duo over Zoom, and they explained to her that while she cannot see Fallon, he could hear her, she would hear him and he would be asking her questions.

The interview then began as the duo played an audio clip of Fallon greeting a guest.
"I'm doing great," Baskin said. "My daughter, Jamie, suggested that I do this interview with you, so she says 'Hi,' and we are working every day with the cats at the sanctuary."
The YouTubers played more clips of Fallon's voice, asking her who was quarantining with her, and what she's been doing.
"Unfortunately, due to the loss of tourism revenue, we had to let go about half of our staff, and thankfully, all of our animal care is done by volunteers," Baskin said. "So, the animals are still getting their daily care, but it means all of us are having to work double-time to make sure that all that happens."
Baskin further discussed life in quarantine while running the sanctuary.
"Thankfully, we were able to fill up our freezers, we can store about 20,000 pounds of food at a time," she said.
Baskin later added: "After COVID-19, I just don't know if we're ever going to be able to do tours again."

The YouTubers then convinced Baskin to don a flower crown and introduce several video clips while saying her catchphrase: "Hey all you cool cats and kittens, it's Carole at Big Cat Rescue."
The video contained a montage of pictures that Manners and Pieters claimed the public hadn't seen.
Fallon recently has been asking each of his guests if they'd like to spotlight a charity or cause during their remote appearances on his show, so the Internet personalities replayed a clip of the late-night host asking Baskin to do the same.
"There is something you can do to end the abuse of big cats and to save them in the wild," the activist said. "That's to make the 'call of the wild,' and you can do that by testing the words 'cats,' C-A-T-S, to the number 5-2-8-8-6."
Baskin continued, explaining that such a text message would alert a member of Congress and serve as support for the Big Cat Public Safety Act, a bill she's supported.
They then concluded the interview with a clip of Fallon thanking a guest for joining him.
"Tiger King" followed the rivalry between Baskin and fellow big cat enthusiast Joseph Maldonado-Passage -- better known as Joe Exotic -- and also examined rumors that Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her ex-husband.

Baskin and her husband, Howard, did previously speak to the Tampa Bay Times following the release of the series.
Reps for Baskin did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Tiger King's' Carole Baskin Tricked Into Fake 'Tonight Show' Interview by YouTubers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin, who was featured in Netflix's popular Tiger King docu-series, has given few interviews since the show became a hit, citing her displeasure with the way the show portrayed her.  But she recently fell victim to a prank by YouTubers pretending to be Jimmy Fallon interviewing her for The Tonight Show.
Pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners posted a video Sunday on their YouTube channel showing how they pranked Baskin. The duo pulled clips of Fallon asking various questions about cats that would not cause suspicion on Baskin's part.
"Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show. And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?" Pieters told Insider, adding it took multiple attempts to finally get Baskin on board.
Baskin has previously said she doesn't like how Tiger King implied that she had a hand in her late husband's death. However, Pieters and Manners convinced her that "Jimmy Fallon" would ask only about her big cats.
They told her she wouldn't be able to see Fallon during the interview, being conducted via Zoom, and explained how they handled moments where they were stuck without an appropriate audio clip of Fallon's voice.
"There is often a moment where there isn't a clip that's suitable," Pieters told Insider. "But that's luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, 'Oh we've got a quick change there, Jimmy's just doing this,' or 'Jimmy's just doing his makeup,' and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong."
During the interview, Baskin talked about how she's been taking care of her animals amid the coronavirus pandemic, noting she'd had to lay off half her staff "due to the loss of tourism revenue" and that volunteers are still helping take care of the cats, and also asked viewers to support the Big Cat Public Safety Act, one of her most passionate causes, which she also spoke about  in the Netflix show. She also sent them several never-before-seen images.
On Sunday, Baskin toldUs Weekly that she wasn't upset by the prank and thought something was amiss during the interview.
"I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited," she said.
Pieters and Manners previously pranked British pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H, Love Island couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury and magician Julius Dein by using voice clips from James Corden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first major interview since 'Tiger King' by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has given her first official interview since the binge-watching phenomenon “Tiger King” dropped on Netflix in March, and got everyone wondering whether she really did murder her husband and feed him to the big cats at her sanctuary.
But while she thought she was going to be chatting with late night host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show,” she was actually being asked questions by Josh Pieters from his home in London, in his underwear, while his YouTube partner Archie Manners chaperoned the interview.
Pieters has been posting a three-part series since Friday on his YouTube channel, which has just changed its name to “Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.”
They wanted to know whether they could trick celebrities into thinking they were being interviewed on real late night TV shows by just using a Zoom call, some sound bites from old clips, and Manners pretending to be a producer.
Spoiler alert: they could.
When watching shows like “Good Morning Britain,” Pieters and Manners wondered whether the guests could always see who was interviewing them, Pieters told Insider in an exclusive interview.
“From there came the idea of just playing the talent recordings of their interviewers and seeing if they would notice,” Pieters said.
In the first two episodes, they spoke to UK pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H,“Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein with voice clips from James Corden. But they stepped things up a gear with the third video, which will air on Sunday night.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They sent Carole Baskin an email from their trusty fake-but-also-real production company Invisible Objects, saying they were producing the live segments for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
They’d almost forgotten about it when she finally replied and agreed to the call.
Pieters and Manners are a duo who have become well known and respected on YouTube for their social experiments. So far they have fooled the world with an Ed Sheeran lookalike, presented right-wing provocateur Katie Hopkins with a fake award, and sold microwave meals on Deliveroo, which earned them a reputation of having one of the “most underrated channels” on YouTube.
Even by their standards, faking the presence of James Corden and Jimmy Fallon sounds nearly impossible. The strange times we are living through certainly helped.
“I wouldn’t say it’s thanks to lockdown,” Pieters said. “It was just really interesting seeing people like Prince William and all these people you’d never imagined to see on Zoom, and Zoom becoming such a big thing.”
Video calls are being used by talk shows all over the world right now, and there’s no real set way to do them. So as long as Manners put on a confident enough performance, there’s no reason to doubt Fallon or Corden were listening in too.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters told Insider.
“You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
The interviews all went more smoothly than expected. Pieters said he’d been having nightmares of being really stuck and having nothing to say with the few clips in front of him, because it’s so hard imagining the direction the interview will go beforehand.
“There is often a moment where there isn’t a clip that’s suitable,” he said. “But that’s luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, ‘Oh we’ve got a quick change there, Jimmy’s just doing this,’ or ‘Jimmy’s just doing his makeup,’ and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong.”
The way they prepared for Baskin’s interview was by scouring Fallon’s older videos for relevant sound bites.
“As you’ll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he’s interviewed the cast of ‘Cats,’ and he’s actually interviewed a real cat,” Pieters said.
“So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that.”
The end result was the first major interview Baskin has given since “Tiger King” aired.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
Pieters and Manners try to answer the “questions you didn’t know you had.”
They never try to completely trick anyone, because ultimately, lying and deceiving is a lot less interesting than what they actually pull off.
“I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong,” Pieters said in a previous interview.
“We always try to give people a bit of a chance.”
Pieters said their latest series was simply seeing whether playing recordings to someone could convincingly pose as a real interview.
“Like all of our ideas, we really didn’t expect it to work, and then it did work,” he said. “I guess it’s that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working,” he said. “And then when it does work, it’s always quite fun to watch.”
Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video will go live at around 3 p.m. ET.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has given her first official interview since the binge-watching phenomenon “Tiger King” dropped on Netflix in March, and got everyone wondering whether she really did murder her husband and feed him to the big cats at her sanctuary.
But while she thought she was going to be chatting with late night host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show,” she was actually being asked questions by Josh Pieters from his home in London, in his underwear, while his YouTube partner Archie Manners chaperoned the interview.
Pieters has been posting a three-part series since Friday on his YouTube channel, which has just changed its name to “Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.”
They wanted to know whether they could trick celebrities into thinking they were being interviewed on real late night TV shows by just using a Zoom call, some sound bites from old clips, and Manners pretending to be a producer.
Spoiler alert: they could.
When watching shows like “Good Morning Britain,” Pieters and Manners wondered whether the guests could always see who was interviewing them, Pieters told Insider in an exclusive interview.
“From there came the idea of just playing the talent recordings of their interviewers and seeing if they would notice,” Pieters said.
In the first two episodes, they spoke to UK pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H, “Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein with voice clips from James Corden. But they stepped things up a gear with the third video, which will air on Sunday night.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They sent Carole Baskin an email from their trusty fake-but-also-real production company Invisible Objects, saying they were producing the live segments for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
They’d almost forgotten about it when she finally replied and agreed to the call.
Pieters and Manners are a duo who have become well known and respected on YouTube for their social experiments. So far they have fooled the world with an Ed Sheeran lookalike, presented right-wing provocateur Katie Hopkins with a fake award, and sold microwave meals on Deliveroo, which earned them a reputation of having one of the “most underrated channels” on YouTube.
Even by their standards, faking the presence of James Corden and Jimmy Fallon sounds nearly impossible. The strange times we are living through certainly helped.
“I wouldn’t say it’s thanks to lockdown,” Pieters said. “It was just really interesting seeing people like Prince William and all these people you’d never imagined to see on Zoom, and Zoom becoming such a big thing.”
Video calls are being used by talk shows all over the world right now, and there’s no real set way to do them. So as long as Manners put on a confident enough performance, there’s no reason to doubt Fallon or Corden were listening in too.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters told Insider.
“You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
The interviews all went more smoothly than expected. Pieters said he’d been having nightmares of being really stuck and having nothing to say with the few clips in front of him, because it’s so hard imagining the direction the interview will go beforehand.
“There is often a moment where there isn’t a clip that’s suitable,” he said. “But that’s luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, ‘Oh we’ve got a quick change there, Jimmy’s just doing this,’ or ‘Jimmy’s just doing his makeup,’ and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong.”
The way they prepared for Baskin’s interview was by scouring Fallon’s older videos for relevant sound bites.
“As you’ll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he’s interviewed the cast of ‘Cats,’ and he’s actually interviewed a real cat,” Pieters said.
“So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that.”
The end result was the first major interview Baskin has given since “Tiger King” aired.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
Pieters and Manners try to answer the “questions you didn’t know you had.”
They never try to completely trick anyone, because ultimately, lying and deceiving is a lot less interesting than what they actually pull off.
“I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong,” Pieters said in a previous interview.
“We always try to give people a bit of a chance.”
Pieters said their latest series was simply seeing whether playing recordings to someone could convincingly pose as a real interview.
“Like all of our ideas, we really didn’t expect it to work, and then it did work,” he said. “I guess it’s that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working … And then when it does work, it’s always quite fun to watch.”
Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
Watch the full video, that went live on Pieters and Manners’ channel at around 2 p.m. ET on Sunday, below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carole Baskin thought she was talking to Jimmy Fallon on Zoom. She was pranked.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has been mostly quiet since the world became obsessed with Netflix's documentary series Tiger King. Now, the documentary subject has given the world a rare peek into her life in coronavirus quarantine, but she was tricked into doing so.
The Big Cat Rescue founder joined a Zoom call believing she was being interviewed by Jimmy Fallon to promote her animal sanctuary. Instead, she was talking to two YouTubers who had tricked her into thinking she was speaking with Fallon by posing as a casting company and playing sound bites of Fallon's voice. The YouTubers had clipped Fallon's soundbites from other videos. Fallon's continued to do The Tonight Show from home during quarantine, interviewing celebrities over video chat.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners are the self-styled pranksters behind the fake Tonight Show interview. They've tricked other minor celebrities before by posing as talkshow bookers. But the Baskin interview is notable since she has been so private since Tiger King debuted. 
Baskin, whose shown as the nemesis of Tiger King's main subject, Joe Exotic, has criticized the show for her portrayal. The former zoo owner and tiger breeder is currently serving a prison term for hiring a hitman to kill Baskin. Baskin may run an animal sanctuary, but the documentary doesn't paint her as a saint. It airs concerns about her animal habitats and chronicles her ex-husband's disappearance in 1997. Local police never accused Baskin of wrongdoing, but her ex's family and friends suggest foul play (and that she fed him to her tigers). She denies it all.
Baskin tells the fake "casting company" she's doing the interview "for the cats," and uses it to promote the Big Cat Public Safety Act, potential legislation intended to stop the breeding of big cats in captivity. She only agreed to the interview if Tiger King and the ensuing controversy wouldn't be mentioned. She said her daughter her convinced her to talk to Fallon.
No one was physically hurt by this prank, but it's likely a blow to Baskin's ego. It's tempting to look at pranking for clicks as harmless, if groan-worthy. However, a hunger for YouTube views has put people in harm's way as YouTubers have undertaken more and more risky and morally questionable "pranks" to make videos all in the name of virality. 
Check out the video to see what Baskin and her cool cats and kittens have been up to in quarantine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' actor Hafthór Björnsson breaks deadlifting world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an electric display of power, Icelandic strongman and Game of Thrones actor Hafþór (Hafthor) Björnsson broke the deadlift world record Saturday, picking up 501 kilograms (nearly 1,105 pounds) of weight.
Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka The Mountain on Game of Thrones, made his deadlift world record attempt on Saturday, which was broadcast live on ESPN and streamed on YouTube. The previous record was set at 500 kilograms (about 1,102 pounds) by Eddie Hall in 2016.
The record-breaking lift is incredible to watch. His form from the start to the end is spectacular and his lockout at the top is uncharacteristically stable. Many lifters would wobble when attempting a personal record, but the 31-year-old looks like a rock.
The lifting event took place in Iceland, which with its small population of just 364,000, has been operating on lighter social distancing measures than other European countries. (Gatherings of more than 20 are banned through Monday; it's unclear exactly how many attended this event, but in footage, the gym looks sparsely populated.) The country has recorded only 10 COVID-19 deaths; Iceland implemented mass testing and contact tracing early on. Before Björnsson took the stage, event commentators described the attempt as something to look forward to amid the coronavirus crisis.
Before hitting the record, Björnsson warmed up by lifting 420 kilograms (roughly 926 pounds) and 465 kilograms (approximately 1,025 pounds), which means he pulled up a grand total of 1,386 kilograms (nearly 3,056 pounds) over three rounds that day.
After breaking the world record and taking a few minutes to kiss his wife, catch his breath, and cool down, Björnsson said in an interview that he was thankful he had the opportunity to attempt this record despite everything that's going on in the world. 
"Not only did I pull this incredible weight, but I also just feel great afterwards," he said, noting that he didn't get any injuries. "I believe today I could have done more but what's the point? I'm happy with this."
Björnsson also holds the world record for the elephant bar deadlift, which is the same lift but with a longer barbell, and won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While live sports are at a standstill as present as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, that didn't stop 'Game of Thrones' star Hafthor Björnsson from writing his name into the record books on Saturday.
According to the ESPN website, Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka "The Mountain" on the hit show, deadlifted a record 1 104 pounds (501kg) at his Iceland home.
Björnsson, 31, beat the previous record of 1 102 pounds (500kg), set by England's Eddie Hall in 2016.
The 6-foot-9, 441-pound (200kg) Björnsson won the World's Strongest Man title in 2018 and has finished in the top three on seven other occasions.
He has also been Iceland's Strongest Man for nine straight years and won Europe's Strongest Man each of the past three years.
The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' actor sets world record for weightlifting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Icelandic actor and strongman Hafthor Bjornsson set a world record for the deadlift on Saturday when he lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kg) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland, reported Reuters. 
Bjornsson, best known for his portrayal of Ser Gregor ‘The Mountain’ Clegane on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, broke the record previously held by Briton Eddie Hall who in 2016 became the first man to lift 500 kg.
The event was streamed live on ESPN here and Bjornsson, 31, lifted the barbell that was bending and straining under the weights, holding it for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, is also the winner of the World’s Strongest Man competition from back in 2018.
Speaking in a “behind-the-scenes” video posted on YouTube, Bjornsson said: “I’m extremely proud, you know. I’m extremely happy. It’s great – there’s nothing better than proving people wrong. So many people didn’t believe in me, so many people that said, ‘501 kg is never going to go up’… But I also had a lot of support.”
“I feel healthy, I feel good. I’m just absolutely speechless, even though I’m talking a lot now. But I’m excited, super excited – this is huge for me,” he added ecstatically.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Game of Thrones” actor best known to fans as favorite Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane, Hafthor Björnsson, crushed the world record on Saturday by deadlifting 1,104 lbs. (501kg).
Björnsson, who stands 6 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 450 pounds, set the new record for deadlifting (a lift made from a standing position in which a loaded barbell or bar is raised off the ground to the level of the hips) at his home gym in Reykjavík, Iceland.
Watch the incredible lift below:
Björnsson warmed up by deadlifting 926 pounds (420kg), then on his next set deadlifted 1,025 pounds (465kg) for his second attempt before the record attempt at 1,104 pound (501kg). He took 15 minutes between each lift.
Former deadlift champion and 2017 World’s Strongest Man winner Eddie Hall — who set the record previously in 2016 — had earlier disputed the event “in [Björnsson’s] home gym with a bunch of [his] pals.”
“I genuinely look forward to having my record broken & seeing what is possible,” Hall wrote in an Instagram post. “I think you are probably the man to do it, there’s no denying that & I’ll still shake your hand afterwards and say well done… if you do it under the appropriate conditions.”
After besting Hall’s record, Björnsson had a message for him: “Eddie, I know I just knocked out your record. Now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring. Time to put your fists where your big mouth is and sign the Core Sports contract.”
To conclude his run as “The Mountain,” whom Björnsson had portrayed since Season 4, on the fifth episode of the show’s eighth and final season, fans finally got the fight they had been waiting for.
Known as “CleganeBowl,” the episode saw The Mountain go mano-a-mano with his brother Sandor, aka “The Hound,” in a brutal action-packed brawl that saw the brothers fighting to the death high atop the Red Keep in Kings Landing. The Hound threw himself onto The Mountain through a cracked stone wall, and they both fell to their deaths in the fiery wreckage below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">He really is The Mountain! 6ft 9ins Game of Thrones star Hafþór Björnsson breaks the world deadlifting record by lifting 1,104lbs - and thinks he could have shifted MORE if he'd had a crowd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson has broken the world deadlift record at an event held in Iceland.
Incredible footage shows the 31-year-old actor lifting a whopping 1,104 pounds (501 kg) off the ground inside Thor's Power Gym in Reykjavík on Saturday.
Björnsson  - who is best known for playing Ser Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane on the hit HBO series - has now smashed a record previously set by Briton Eddie Hall. 
Back in 2016,  Hall made international headlines after he lifted 1,102 pounds (500 kg). 
Björnsson's deadlift was streamed live on ESPN Saturday, with footage showing him lifting a barbell that was bending and straining under the massive amount of weights. 
The star held the barbell for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
The event took place without a crowd, due to current restrictions on large gatherings that have been put in place due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
In Iceland, no more than 20 people can currently gather in one place. 
Björnsson only completed the deadlift in the company of his doctor, referee and film crew.  
Afterward he told ESPN: 'I'm obviously speechless..'I'm over the moon.'
Björnsson even bragged that he could possibly lift even more weight if he had a crowd. 
He previously told the New York Post that he performs 'maybe 10 percent better in a competition — the crowd gives you that adrenaline rush that you need'.
But the strongman was simply happy to take the world record.  
He stated on Saturday: 'I'm standing here, tall, feeling good, no injuries. I'm healthy as well. I believe today I could have done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this.'
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.
 He played 'The Mountain' - a famous knight loyal to the Lannisters - on Game of Thrones between seasons four and eight. His character was killed in the penultimate episode of the series.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Game of Thrones star Hafthor Julius Bjornsson smashes deadlift world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafthor Julius Bjornsson has set a new world record by deadlifting 501kg (1,105lbs) at his gym in Iceland.
The Icelandic strongman, who played the Mountain in the smash-hit HBO series, broke the previous record held by Brit Eddie Hall.
It has taken four years for someone to beat Hall’s effort, with Bjornsson lifting just 1kg more than his rival.
The coronavirus pandemic meant Bjornsson had to attempt the world record at his gym and seek official recognition for the lift as it was out of competition.
Magnus Ver Magnusson officiated the deadlift after two successful warm-ups at 420kg and 460kg.
Bjornsson, who has one World’s Strongest Man title, was elated after he managed to break the record.
He said: ‘I’m absolutely speechless, so happy and thankful. Blessed. Everything went according to plans, I’m over the moon.
‘I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point? I’m happy with this.’
The world record attempt attracted controversy and Bjornsson is now eager to settle his rivalry with Hall in a boxing match.
‘Wow… something new and big,’ Bjornsson said when asked what was next.
‘Core Sports just offered me a seven figure contract, which is the biggest contract of my life. I’ve signed it already.
‘Eddie Hall has been running his mouth for two weeks now and I now that he got the same deal.
‘So Eddie, I just knocked out your record, and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring.
‘Time to put your fists where your big mouth is and sign the Core Sports contract.
‘I’m ready. Are you ready, Eddie?’

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mountain from Game of Thrones breaks world record for heaviest deadlift</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson is officially the first man in history to deadlift 501kg after his world-record attempt this afternoon.
The Icelandic strongman, who played Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane in the HBO series Game of Thrones, set out to break the previous record set by British strongman Eddie Hall.
And the 6ft 9in actor succeeded, smashing the record surrounded by a small crowd due to Covid-19 distancing rules.
Thor - as he is popularly known - streamed the attempt to the world via different media platforms and was overjoyed as he smashed Hall's record, with over 330,000 tuning in via RogueSport's Youtube channel.
His first two lifts of the afternoon were 420kg and 465kg, which he breezed through with little fuss.
After another 15-minute break, Bjornsson stepped up for the moment we'd all been waiting for and didn't disappoint.
The man mountain struggled more so than he had on previous attempts but made history, sending his camp wild in the gym as the referee gave his lift the all clear.
Bjornsson had put blood, sweat and tears into his preparation for the event, following a strict training routine and a complex diet.
“Usually I like to get around eight hours before I’m up around 8am in the morning,” the ambassador for REIGN Total Body Fuel, a new energy drink for fitness in the UK, told the Daily Star.
“Then I’ll make myself a breakfast. I’ll have six packs of 200g of rice. I’ll put some chicken in it.
“I’ll have my second meal of the day, again with rice with mince, rib eye steak or some kind of other steak. I have one more meal before I train.
"Then I’ll have a can of REIGN for my workout so I can get the caffeine I need for my session. After my session, I have a mother meal similar. Basically, I eat the same throughout the day.
“I’ll add spinach and carrots for my diet and eat that around six times a day. It’s very simple. But very effective.
“You basically have to be obsessed and consistent with everything you do from your sleep routine to your diet routine. People always wonder what the secret is to become the world’s strongest man.
“There is no real secret: it’s just about how you work and being consistent. "
British strongman Eddie Hall set the record back in 2016, lifting 500 kg under strongman rules.
The 32-year-old starred in a 2019 TV show entitled: " The Strongest Man in History."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nostalgia for the beautiful world outside has made a collector of me</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Trapped indoors, we’re all overcome with nostalgia, the past being one way to escape the present. Butterscotch Angel Delight is now strangely hard to come by. Meanwhile, Stanley Gibbons reports a “gratifying” increase in customers as people remember how they once loved stamp collecting.
This may explain why last month I spent more money than I should have on a large collection of old cigarette cards. These are not, however, any old cigarette cards: they are the silk flower cards given away with Kensitas in the 1930s – and so lovely you can hardly believe they were once just a free gift (“Why do we give you these inserts? Because tobacco is a plant, and we want you to realise that only the finest Virginia tobacco is used in Kensitas”). Each one is a tiny envelope. Inside is a piece of ribbon on to which has been woven a flower: violets and stocks, roses and lupins, pansies and nasturtiums. Having laid them all out on the kitchen table (I’m like a teenager with his Panini stickers, weeding out duplicates), I can gaze at them for minutes at a time. The past is another country or, in this case perhaps, another market garden.
In all the lists I’ve seen of books about epidemics, one seems to have gone missing: Somerset Maugham’s novel of 1925, The Painted Veil, in which a shallow woman is brought to her senses by an outbreak of cholera in a remote part of China. I can’t account for its disappearance thus far. Maugham has such an instinct for psychology; he writes women so well; he looks at the expat and understands that his grating superiority is more than likely just a cover for the fact that he has basically run away from home. And then there’s its uncommonly gripping and queasy-making plot. This was inspired, he tells us in a preface, by Book V of Dante’s Purgatorio, in which appears the story of a gentlewoman from Siena, whose husband, suspecting her of adultery, takes her to his castle in Maremma, hoping that the noxious vapours from the marshes will kill her…
Thanks in large part to a rallying cry issued by the food writer Jenny Linford, some of us have been buying quite a lot of cheese, the better to support the nation’s artisan makers during this crisis. Luckily, I’m all for cheese; given a choice, I’ll always take a slice of Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire over a bag of Maltesers. But even so, what might a person do should they happen to end up with – whisper it – too much cheese?
Pondering this, I remembered the potted cheese of which my father was fond and out of which I used to take the piss as a child, on the grounds that it sounded (and looked) like something Fungus the Bogeyman would regard as a treat.
If this has not put you off – my nod to Fungus and his horrible habits, I mean – you can find several recipes for the using up of ancient fromage in Elisabeth Luard’s timely new book Preserving, Potting and Pickling, including one with marc (though any white spirit – vodka? – would do just as well). It’s so easy. Simply grate your leftover hard cheese, pound it together with your soft, work in the booze and then stick the whole pungent ensemble in a ramekin. Seal with a layer of clarified butter. But be warned: this is not for the faint-hearted. It gets whiffier every day. After a fortnight, you’ll need to bury it under concrete.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to scientists, our brain can memorize up to about 2.5 petabytes of data. For comparison, this is the same as if you saw and memorized about 25 billion photos on Facebook. But even though our brains have such an amazing capacity, we can still forget why we’ve just walked into a room or try to figure out where our phone is while talking on it.
We at Bright Side have also been in funny situations where we forgot about something, but our stories can’t compare to the ones that online users shared.
“My girlfriend bought this very attractive Easter egg for me, which I then left in the Sun.”
“It was 60 and sunny yesterday. Forgot to put the top back up.”
“Someone forgot their bag full of groceries.”
What interesting situations have happened to you when you forgot something?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Despite New Evidence, ‘Destiny 2’ Isn’t Really Going To Destroy The Tower Again, Right?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A couple days ago a few players started loading into “glitched” Tower instances that showed at least one small section of the Tower heavily damaged. Since then, I’ve seen more and more people manage to get into these instances, though the process of how to get there is still unclear, and just requires a lot of repeated fast travel and a bit of luck. I’ve tried to find the glitched instance myself, but can’t. But enough people have found it where no, this definitely is not photshop trolling.
What’s been discovered is a small section of the front part of the Tower near Zavala and Eververse that appears to be heavily damaged. This is a season all about the Cabal super-ship, the Almighty, headed toward the Last City on a Kamikaze mission. It’s easy to forget because it’s literally never mentioned at all week to week, nor do we have any sort of reminder like the ship appearing in the earth Skybox or anything, but this glitch has made it seem like there could be actual consequences here.
So what’s going on?
I suppose there could be some technical explanations for this, that it’s just a bug, or that something like Zero Hour textures (in the other, old destroyed Tower), have somehow moved their way over here.
However, this seems recent. We haven’t seen this glitch before this past week, and given that we are in a season where there is a direct threat to the Tower, that seems like a bit of a coincidence that’s hard to overlook. Second, these are really, really detailed textures, not something you would imagine would appear as a simple bug. These look like purposeful recreations of the old architecture in destroyed form. So no, this does not seem like an accident.
So, what’s actually going to happen? The most common theory is that we do manage to use the Rasputin superweapon we build to blowup the Almighty before it gets here, and yet it gets close enough where debris does manage to hit the Tower and Last City in some capacity.
If we fully failed and the Almighty, intact, hit the Last City, we wouldn’t just see some cursory wall damage, we’d see a crater as big as the one that killed the dinosaurs, given the Almighty’s size. So this might be a “split the difference” outcome.
In terms of how bad this could get, that’s what I find myself wondering about this most. This glitch is only showing one part of the Tower, so how damaged is the rest of it? Also, a very, very small part of me wonders if this could be a cheeky way to destroy Eververse, given how close the damage is to Tess Everis, but that’s probably too much to hope for.
Even through datamining, we do not have answers to these questions about what’s going on here. We have seen a leaked cutscene, but it has nothing to do with the Almighty or this potential Tower damage. We have heard about a leaked mission, which again, seems wholly separate from this.
I am hoping this is a significant development to end the season and lead into the next one, and not just some random texture glitch. I don’t believe we’re actually going to see the Tower outright destroyed again, like we did during the Red War, but damaged? I can buy that, and it would at least give the Almighty plotline some weight. Now, we just need to be reminded it’s actually going on again through the game itself. Lemme see that ship in the skybox, please.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Robots and cameras help enforce China's sci-fi quarantine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING: Robots delivering meals, ghostly figures in hazmat suits and cameras pointed at front doors: China’s methods to enforce coronavirus quarantines have looked like a sci-fi dystopia for legions of people.
Authorities have taken drastic steps to ensure that people do not break isolation rules after China largely tamed the virus that had paralysed the country for months.
With cases imported from abroad threatening to unravel China’s progress, travellers arriving from overseas have been required to stay home or in designated hotels for 14 days.
Beijing loosened the rule in the capital this week – except for those arriving from abroad and Hubei, the province where the virus first surfaced late last year.
At one quarantine hotel in central Beijing, a guard sits at a desk on each floor to monitor all movements.
The solitude is broken by one of the few visitors allowed near the rooms: A three-foot-tall cylindrical robot that delivers water bottles, meals and packages to hotel guests.
The robot rides the elevator and navigates hallways on its own to minimise contact between guests and human staff.
When the robot arrives at its destination, it dials the landline phone in the room and informs the occupant in an eerie, childlike voice: “Hello, this is your service robot. Your order has arrived outside your room.”
Its belly opens and the guest takes the delivery items before the robot turns and rolls away.
Doctors in hazmat suits go from room to room daily reminding occupants, including an AFP journalist who had been in Hubei, to take their temperatures with the mercury thermometer provided at check-in, and to ask if any are experiencing symptoms.
People under home quarantine elsewhere in the city have had silent electronic alarms installed on their doors.
Officials put up a notice on each quarantined household’s door asking neighbours to keep an eye on the confined inhabitants.
In one Beijing residential compound, officials told AFP that people under home quarantine must inform community volunteers whenever they open their doors.
Friederike Boege, a German journalist, began her second quarantine in Beijing this year on Sunday after returning from Hubei’s capital Wuhan.
Her building’s management installed a camera in front of her door to monitor her movements.
“It’s quite scary how you get used to such things,” she told AFP.
“Apart from the camera I do believe that the guards and the cleaner on the compound would denunciate me if I were to go out,” Boege said.
During her previous quarantine experience in March after returning from a trip to Thailand, she was reported to building management by a cleaner for going downstairs to take out the trash.
No human contact
Total isolation has become a temporary norm for those under strict quarantine, without even a single trip to the grocery store or walk to break up the monotony.
Joy Zhong, a 25-year-old media professional returning to Beijing from a work trip in the virus epicentre of Wuhan, spent three weeks without leaving a cramped room at another hotel in the Chinese capital.
There, guests were not allowed to order their own food and were instead given standardised meals.
Friends were allowed to bring packages to the front desk, which were then left outside hotel rooms by staff who avoided direct contact with guests.
“Spending 21 days in a row without seeing a single person, it felt like time was passing extremely slowly,” Zhong told AFP.
Not all people under quarantine are as closely watched as those in Beijing, however.
Charlotte Poirot, a French teacher who arrived in China in late March – just before a ban on foreigners entering the country was introduced – spent two weeks under quarantine at a hostel in the southeastern city Guangzhou.
She was confined alone in a 10-bunk room, with meals delivered to her door and medical personnel coming to check her temperature multiple times a day.
“They never locked the door and the (whole) process was based on reliance,” Poirot told AFP. “We all played the game without contesting.”

“They never locked the door and the (whole) process was based on reliance,” Poirot said. “We all played the game without contesting.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Robots and cameras: China's sci-fi quarantine enforcement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Authorities have taken drastic steps to ensure that people do not break isolation rules after China largely tamed the virus that had paralysed the country for months.
With cases imported from abroad threatening to unravel China's progress, travellers arriving from overseas have been required to stay home or in designated hotels for 14 days.
Beijing loosened the rule in the capital this week -- except for those arriving from abroad and Hubei, the province where the virus first surfaced late last year.
 At one quarantine hotel in central Beijing, a guard sits at a desk on each floor to monitor all movements.
The solitude is broken by one of the few visitors allowed near the rooms: A three-foot-tall cylindrical robot that delivers water bottles, meals and packages to hotel guests.
The robot rides the elevator and navigates hallways on its own to minimise contact between guests and human staff.
When the robot arrives at its destination, it dials the landline phone in the room and informs the occupant in an eerie, childlike voice: "Hello, this is your service robot. Your order has arrived outside your room."
Its belly opens and the guest takes the delivery items before the robot turns and rolls away.
Doctors in hazmat suits go from room to room daily reminding occupants, including an AFP journalist who had been in Hubei, to take their temperatures with the mercury thermometer provided at check-in, and to ask if any are experiencing symptoms.
People under home quarantine elsewhere in the city have had silent electronic alarms installed on their doors.
Officials put up a notice on each quarantined household's door asking neighbours to keep an eye on the confined inhabitants.
In one Beijing residential compound, officials told AFP that people under home quarantine must inform community volunteers whenever they open their doors.
Friederike Boege, a German journalist, began her second quarantine in Beijing this year on Sunday after returning from Hubei's capital Wuhan.
Her building's management installed a camera in front of her door to monitor her movements.
"It's quite scary how you get used to such things," she told AFP.
"Apart from the camera I do believe that the guards and the cleaner on the compound would denunciate me if I were to go out," Boege said.
During her previous quarantine experience in March after returning from a trip to Thailand, she was reported to building management by a cleaner for going downstairs to take out the trash.
No human contact
Total isolation has become a temporary norm for those under strict quarantine, without even a single trip to the grocery store or walk to break up the monotony.
Joy Zhong, a 25-year-old media professional returning to Beijing from a work trip in the virus epicentre of Wuhan, spent three weeks without leaving a cramped room at another hotel in the Chinese capital.
There, guests were not allowed to order their own food and were instead given standardised meals. 
Friends were allowed to bring packages to the front desk, which were then left outside hotel rooms by staff who avoided direct contact with guests.
"Spending 21 days in a row without seeing a single person, it felt like time was passing extremely slowly," Zhong told AFP.
Not all people under quarantine are as closely watched as those in Beijing, however.

Europe prepares for more lockdown easing as virus hopes rise
Europe on Sunday prepared for a further cautious easing of coronavirus restrictions following signs the pandemic may be slowing, after Spaniards flocked to the streets to jog, cycle and roller-skate for the first time after 48 days of confinement.
More than 242 000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
With signs that the spread of the contagion has been brought under control, parts of Europe and the United States have begun to lift restrictions to try to inject life into economies crippled by weeks of closures and ease the pressure from populations wearying of captivity.

Iran to reopen many mosques as lockdown eases: Rouhani
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said mosques would reopen across large parts of the country on Monday after being shuttered since early March over the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Rouhani said 132 counties, or about one third of the administrative divisions, would "reopen their mosques as of tomorrow", speaking at a televised virus taskforce meeting.
Maintaining "social distancing is more important than collective prayer", he added, arguing that Islam considers safety obligatory while praying in mosques is only recommended.

Saudi stocks dive after finance minister vows 'painful' measures
Saudi shares slumped 6.8% as trading opened on Sunday, a day after the finance minister announced "painful" measures to tackle the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.
Almost all the listed stocks on the Arab world's largest bourse were in the red just minutes after the start of trading.
Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said late on Saturday that the kingdom would take "drastic measures" to face the double shock of the novel coronavirus and low oil prices.
"Some of these measures could be painful," he said in an interview with Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya.
He said the world's leading crude exporter would borrow close to $60 billion this year to plug a huge budget deficit.
Saudi Jadwa Investment, an independent think-tank, forecast Thursday that the kingdom would post a record $112 billion budget deficit this year.
The International Monetary Fund in April projected that the Saudi economy would contract by 2.3% this year.
Capital Economics, a London-based think-tank, said the contraction would be at least 5%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Glass Hotel by Emily St John Mandel review – haunted visions of a global crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Few readers will come to Emily St John Mandel’s fifth novel, The Glass Hotel, unaware of her fourth, 2014’s Station Eleven, which imagined a world ravaged by a hyper-lethal form of swine flu. That book was always going to cast a shadow over its successor – such is the curse of a career-defining blockbuster. But as we face Covid-19, the strange, masochistic allure of havoc-lit has catapulted Mandel’s post-pandemic tale of itinerant Shakespearean actors back into bestseller territory. How better to while away a stint in lockdown than by bending our waking terrors into the most comforting and redemptive of shapes – the narrative arc.
A handful of quietly placed clues suggest that The Glass Hotel exists in the same universe as Station Eleven, in a time before the outbreak. The “Georgia Flu” is lurking, but we will never learn if it is days, months, or a year away. Mandel has not penned a ticking-clock prequel; rather, her new novel is a portrait of everyday obliviousness, the machinery of late neoliberalism juddering along with characteristic inequity. This is a tale of Ponzi schemes, not pestilence.
New York financier Jonathan Alkaitis carries himself with “the tedious confidence of all people with money ... the breezy assumption that no serious harm could come to him”. He’s the owner of the book’s titular hotel, a surreal monolith planted on the northernmost tip of Canada’s Vancouver Island, accessible only by boat. It’s a pocket of “wilderness-adjacent” extravagance for aspiring plutocrats; an “improbable palace” in that borderless nation, the “Kingdom of Money”.
Mixing cocktails in the hotel bar is directionless Vincent, a young woman marking time in her remote hometown, a stifling place with one road and “two dead ends”. Her best friend drives the hotel boat; her brother, Paul – aspiring composer, recovering addict – sweeps the floors. Vincent has a “very particular gift”: she’s a lithe social chameleon. When newly widowed Alkaitis orders a drink, Vincent is who he needs her to be. Alkaitis then requests her companionship in exchange for “the freedom to stop thinking about money”. The keys to the kingdom are hers, but not for long. The time of plummeting stock prices and collapsing banks is near.
The future is restless in The Glass Hotel, impatient and insistent: it interrupts the present to tether consequences to actions, ends to beginnings. Alkaitis, we learn, will die in prison; Vincent will drown. What are we to make of these future echoes? They are not warnings it seems, but hauntings. “There are so many ways to haunt a person,” Mandel writes, “or a life.” The Glass Hotel is crowded with phantoms: lost mothers; wronged victims; a “ghost fleet” of empty container ships; a beyond-the-grave curse scrawled in acid. In his medium-security cell, unrepentant Alkaitis conjures a spectral “counterlife” so intoxicating the real world loses form, a luxurious dreamscape with no extradition treaty.
It’s a beguiling conceit: the global financial crisis as a ghost story. As one of Alkaitis’s employees reflects of a swindled investor: “It wasn’t that she was about to lose everything, it was that she had already lost everything and just didn’t know it yet.” But Mandel’s abiding literary fascination is even more elemental: isn’t every moment – coiled with possibilities – its own ghost story? Isn’t every life a counterlife?
Like Joshua Ferris’s And Then We Came to the End, a central section of The Glass Hotel is voiced by a collective workplace “we” – a mea culpa chorus of Alkaitis’s underlings. “We had crossed a line, that much was obvious,” they tell us, “but it was difficult to say later exactly where that line had been.” Mandel is not interested in righteous outrage, she’s interested in that illusory line, how it is possible “to both know and not know something”. But there’s a hallucinatory, fairy-dust sheen to The Glass Hotel thatmakes the real world cruelties of 2008 feel as remote and otherworldly as the transparently symbolic (and symbolically transparent) hotel. Here is a realm of kingdoms, palaces, and “the shadowlands”, which is how Mandel characterises American poverty: “a country located at the edge of an abyss ... a territory without comfort or room for error”. The language of allegory can illuminate, but it can also be a form of camouflage. It does both in this novel.
With its shattered narrative, the joys of The Glass Hotel are participatory: piecing together the connections and intersections of Mandel’s human cartography, a treasure map ripped to pieces. But it is as a spectral sequel to Station Eleven that The Glass Hotel stumbles into poignance, as pre-pandemic fiction. All contemporary novels are now pre-pandemic novels – Covid-19 has scored a line across our culture – but what Mandel captures is the last blissful gasp of complacency, a knowing portrait of the end of unknowing. It’s the world we inhabited mere weeks ago, and it still feels so tantalisingly close; our ache for it still too raw to be described as nostalgia. “Do you find yourself sort of secretly hoping that civilisation collapses ... Just so that something will happen?” a friend asks Vincent. Oh, for the freedom of that kind of reckless yearning.
• The Glass Hotel is published by Picador in ebook and audio on 30 April and hardback on 6 August.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The future is now: Review of Lavanya Lakshminarayan’s ‘Analog/Virtual: And Other Simulations of Your Future’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A sense of foreboding overhangs Lavanya Lakshminarayan’s debut book. The interconnected stories march steadily towards you like an advancing army — with every word you read, the comfortable distance created by speculative fiction is slowly eroded and you feel exposed to possibilities that look all too real.
The book is in a Bengaluru of the future when it is called ‘Apex City’ — a world where the Bell Corporation has established ‘meritocratic technarcy’ to define the boundaries of life, literally and figuratively. You have the ‘Analogs’ of Apex City living outside the Carnatic Meridian, bearing the full brunt of a world that has succumbed to climate change, with barely any fresh food and water, and deprived of technology, while the ‘Virtuals’ live on the other side. There you have ClimaTech for simulated weather, OmniPorts and HoloTech for communication and interaction, bots as teachers, humble video games that assume larger-than-life proportions and the ‘vegetable farm’ where you can be ‘harvested’ should you slip down the ladder of merit — Lakshminarayan’s world-building is impeccable. Within this, characters come and go, some etched deeply, some lightly, but each one adding another layer of meaning.
The two stories that especially worked for me are ‘Études’, which sensitively portrays an adopted Analog’s journey in becoming a pianist without technology, and ‘The Be-Moji Project’, which envisions a future where words will become immaterial and holographic ‘emojis’ will take their place. Her stories, effortlessly criss-crossing between the poignant and the absurd, pulsate with solid life, like the deep thrum of a bass guitar that once caught in a song, cannot be released from memory again.
Despite the initial discomfort of not having a central character to invest in emotionally, the book works because of the assuredness with which it subverts ideas of class, power, dissent by showing what the world looks like when boundaries are closed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 50 best Irish films ever made, in order</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">IN VERY PARTICULAR ORDER, HERE’S OUR (CURRENTLY DEFINITIVE) PICK OF THE GREATEST IRISH MOVIES EVER MADE
No sane person will sincerely claim that the ranking of cultural entities is anything other than a sophisticated parlour game.
When it comes to Irish film, however, the debate will invariably focus less on relative placings – whether Garage is better than The Quiet Man – than on how we are defining our terms. Is The Quiet Man Irish at all? It was financed by an American studio and set in a fanciful version of the real nation.
When testing a novel for Irishness, we need focus our attention on the writer alone. Colm Tóibín’s The Master may be set in England and published by a British house, but nobody would claim it was anything other than an Irish book. John Crowley’s adaptation of Tóibín’s Brooklyn is Irish as well. But it’s also British and a little bit Canadian. A co-production of the BBC and the Irish Film Board (among others), it quite reasonably competed for awards at both the British and Irish Academies. Few of the films on this list pass the purity test for absolute uncorrupted Irishness.
Our rules are looser than some may prefer. Significant numbers of Irish personnel is a factor. Notable levels of Irish funding scores you a few more points on our jerry-rigged scale. Shooting a film in Ireland gets you a long way down the road, but, as should be obvious, external productions that use the country as a stand-in for somewhere else aren’t getting anywhere with the jury. Neither Saving Private Ryan (Normandy in Wexford) nor The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (the Berlin Wall in Smithfield) was up for consideration.
Setting a film in Ireland is not in itself a qualification. We would never have been much tempted by Waking Ned, a British production filmed in the Isle of Man, but Yann Demange’s 1971, a British film shot in Liverpool and Sheffield, would have walked in if Northern Ireland Screen had lured the filmmakers to the real Belfast.
Decisions also had to be made as to what we mean by a feature film. We settled on a production made for theatrical exhibition that exceeds 70 minutes. Pat O’Connor’s fine The Ballroom of Romance fails on two counts. It is a television production that comes in at 65 minutes. (At the 1983 Bafta awards, it won in the TV section, not the film race). Playing hardball on length, we had to regretfully exclude the early work of Vivienne Dick, Bob Quinn’s legendary Poitín and more recent films such as Graham Seely and Kevin Brannigan’s The Man With the Hat.
The final ranking is – as all such rankings must be – the creation of a fleeting mood. The order may have been different an hour or so later. It is not, however, a ranking of Irishness. Once a film has qualified it competes equally with all others. Some may reasonably think our top film among the least Irish of the bunch. So be it. Having made the grade, we asked only whether it is better than the rest. The answer today was “yes”. Tomorrow, who knows?
50. KoreaCathal Black, 1995Black was among those who made Irish films happen at a time when such things were as rare as Irish space probes. He reached maturity with a rural saga, adapted from a John McGahern story, that covered a great many domestic neuroses – emigration, the Civil War, generational discord – in an impressively small space.
49. Cardboard GangstersMark O’Connor, 2017Weed-peddler Jayson (writer and star John Connors) and his crew get an opportunity to offload some heroin, a career move that pits them against local kingpin Derra (Jimmy Smallhorne). Unabashedly masculine and in thrall to the Goodfellas template, this is the most polished collaboration between the director and the multitalented Connors.
48. IntermissionJohn Crowley, 2003A decade after Pulp Fiction, any collection of interweaving urban stories was likely to attract the adjective “Tarantinoesque”, but Mark O’Rowe’s abrasive script sang to his own unsentimental melodies. Colin Farrell, Cillian Murphy and Colm Meaney buzzed about a heightened Dublin. The shot of kissing buses still hangs in the brain.
47. Snap (Carmel Winters, 2010)Fifteen-year-old Stephen (Stephen Moran) snatches a toddler from a park and holds him captive for five days. Three years on, his mother (Aisling O’Sullivan) investigates in this cleverly constructed and unsettling mystery from the director of Float Like a Butterfly.
46. KissesLance Daly, 2008Daly recently had a domestic hit with the Famine drama Black 47, but we’ve gone for his quieter film about a couple of young Dublin neighbours who light out for the territory at Christmas time. The director draws beautiful, unhurried performances from Kelly O’Neill and Shane Curry. A minor-key gem.
45. Good FavourRebecca Daly, 2017An ailing stranger stumbles from the woodland into a small, isolated religious community. He recovers and befriends the children of the colony but his “otherness” remains, especially when things start to go wrong. Is he there as a saviour or something more sinister? As ever, Daly keeps you guessing.
44. SavioursLiam Nolan, Ross Whitaker, 2007Fiercely felt documentary concerning three boxers from Saint Saviours Academy in Dublin’s north inner city. Made over two years with sparse funding, the film is as much an appreciation of a culture as a sports movie. Whitaker returned to the fight game with his great doc on Katie Taylor.
43. KingsTom Collins, 2011In the 1970s, a group of young men leave Connemara. Decades later, they reunite at the funeral of a friend. Colm Meaney heads the cast of this award-winning bilingual drama, adapted from Jimmy Murphy’s play The Kings of the Kilburn High Road.
42. Hush-a-Bye BabyMargo Harkin, 1989Set in Derry, Harkin’s highly original drama follows a young woman as she navigates an unexpected pregnancy with no apparent support from an imprisoned father. Unavoidable comparisons with the notorious Kerry babies case. Strong lead performance from Emer McCourt. Sterling support from rising national treasure Sinéad O’Connor.
41. The Secret of Roan InishJohn Sayles, 1994In the 1940s, a young girl is sent to the Donegal island of the title, where her extended family tell her about selkies and her missing younger brother. A magical piece of storytelling about storytelling with a great teller in the late Mick Lally.
40. Shadow DancerJames Marsh, 2012No accent issues for the untouchable Andrea Riseborough as a conflicted informant during the later years of the Troubles in Belfast. Accused of being pro-IRA by the Daily Mail and “unashamedly pro-British” by other critics. It remains a singularly strong thriller from a fine director.
39. MaudieAisling Walsh, 2016Folk artist Maud Lewis (Sally Hawkins) lives a troubled life in Nova Scotia as she struggles with various ailments, a lost daughter, and an abusive husband (Ethan Hawke). Slowly, however, her paintings bring visitors and admiration.
38. Silent GraceMaeve Murphy, 2001Murphy’s study of protests by female Republicans in Armagh Prison during the early 1980s felt like an overdue correction. It was a shoestring production, but Murphy’s poetic script and strong performances from Orla Brady and Cathleen Bradley helped it to soar. The film’s reputation has steadily increased over the intervening decades.
37. In AmericaJim Sheridan, 2002Semi-autobiographical, Oscar-nominated drama co-written by the director and his daughters Naomi and Kirsten, in which a Dublin family relocate to New York’s Hell’s Kitchen in the 1980s. There, the parents (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton) struggle while their young daughters befriend a reclusive Nigerian photographer (Djimon Hounsou).
36. The CommitmentsAlan Parker, 1991The Snapper and The Van may be more coherent Roddy Doyle adaptations, but one can’t ignore the impact Alan Parker’s vibrant Dublin musical had on a city on the brink of unprecedented cultural upheavals. Generated a touring act, a stage production and a handful of durable careers.
35. Flight of the DovesRalph Nelson, 1971Once maligned as high blarney, this adaptation of Walter Macken’s 1967 novel has gained a cult following in recent years. Two Liverpool children escape their cruel uncle (Ron Moody) and run away to Galway. Features a great St Patrick’s Day chase and the forward-thinking, inclusive anthem, You Don’t Have to Be Irish to be Irish.
34. The GeneralJohn Boorman, 1998Or Excalibur? Or Zardoz? Boorman has had an inestimable effect on the Irish film industry. His most durable commentary on the nation is this troubling, ambiguous engagement with hoodlum Martin Cahill. Gave Brendan Gleeson his first lead role in a feature. Lovely monochrome photography from Seamus Deasy.
33. WaveridersJoel Conroy, 2008Cillian Murphy narrates this award-winning doc that chronicles Irish-Hawaiian George Freeth’s early 20th-century contributions to surfing alongside modern practitioners Richie Fitzgerald, Kelly Slater and Easkey Britton, as they take on a monstrous 60-foot wave off the Cliffs of Moher.
32. The Revolution Will Not Be TelevisedKim Bartley, Donnacha Ó Briain, 2003Fascinating – and controversial – documentary concerning the 2002 coup d’etat attempt on the Chávez regime in Venezuela. Works, among other things, as an eloquent treatise on media manipulation.
31. GazaGarry Keane and Andrew McConnell, 2019This beautifully shot documentary portrait of life in the strip of the title, home to nearly two million Palestinians, was filmed over four years. For all the trials and turmoil on screen, it’s a representation of, as one taxi-driver puts it, people who “just want to live their lives”.
30. The Secret of KellsTomm Moore, 2009Cartoon Saloon, based in Kilkenny, has been one of the great success stories in Irish cinema history. The first of its three(!) Oscar nominations in the feature animation section came with this gorgeously rich fantasy structured around the creation of the Book of Kells. A phenomenon.
29. December BrideThaddeus O’Sullivan, 1991Two brothers (Donal McCann and Ciarán Hinds) and a servant, Sarah (Saskia Reeves) form a scandalous love triangle in rural Ulster at the turn of the century. Sarah’s continued distaste for convention brings her into conflict with locals, a minister, and finally, her own children.
28. Bloody SundayPaul Greengrass, 2002Though made for Granada TV, Greengrass’s kinetic take on a seismic tragedy debuted at Sundance and received a theatrical release. So it counts. James Nesbitt is excellent as the heroic Ivan Cooper. Ballymun does good work as Derry. But it is the dynamism of the filmmaking that sticks in the memory.
27. GarageLenny Abrahamson, 2007A lonely petrol station attendant with learning difficulties (Pat Shortt) befriends his 15-year-old co-worker in an award-winning drama that delicately segues from comedy to tragedy.
26. The Image You MissedDonal Foreman, 2018Foreman is among the most interesting and original of younger Irish filmmakers. This eccentric documentary combines a study of his father, the late filmmaker Arthur MacCaig, with a consideration of political instabilities in Northern Ireland. A singular piece from an original mind.
25. The Killing of a Sacred DeerYorgos Lanthimos, 2017The Greek director’s characteristically curveball adaptation of Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides sees Colin Farrell’s cardiothoracic surgeon stalked by a vengeful Barry Keoghan.
24. His & HersKen Wardop, 2010Wardrop has carved out his own niche in documentary, making elegantly composed collages of ordinary lives. His 2010 masterpiece – a real hit on domestic release – moves among 70 women, their contributions arranged in order of age from infants to wise elders. Charming. Heart-breaking.
23. The Butcher BoyNeil Jordan, 1997When his mother commits suicide, 12-year-old Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens), retreats into violent fantasy fuelled by comic books, cowboys and Indians and atomic age anxieties in a black comedy adapted from Patrick McCabe’s 1992 novel.
22. Odd Man OutCarol Reed, 1947Beware. Whatever the Belfast locals may tell you, the scene in the pub was not actually shot in the Crown Bar. Many of the exteriors were, however, filmed in the city. So we can count Reed’s masterly thriller as among the great Belfast films. James Mason is the IRA man on the run.
21. The Rocky Road to DublinPeter Lennon, 1967Dublin has never looked more unlovely and backward than in journalist Peter Lennon’s contemporaneous depiction of Ireland, as the filmmaker begs the question: “What do you do with your revolution once you’ve got it?”
20. The FarthestEmer Reynolds, 2017Stunning documentary from a versatile talent – also one of our best editors – on the Voyager space probe. A sense of awe permeates the boffins’ descriptions of great achievements completed with relatively rudimentary computing power.
19. Good VibrationsLisa Barros D’Sa and Glenn Leyburn, 2013In the 1970s, as sectarian conflict in Belfast rages, DJ Terri Hooley (Richard Dormer) opens a record shop “on the most bombed half-mile in Europe, ” and the Ulster punk scene is born. An energetic delight from the directors of Ordinary Love and Cherrybomb.
18. SilencePat Collins, 2012Sui generis oddity concerning a sound recordist travelling Ireland in search of landscapes free from the noises of men. Along the way, he ponders human life its relationship with nature. It might be a documentary. It might be an experimental drama.
17. The Magdalene SistersPeter Mullan, 2002In the early 1960s, four young women – rape and incest survivor Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff), too-pretty Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone), unmarried mother Rose (Dorothy Duffy) and intellectually disabled Crispina (Eileen Walsh) – are forced into a Magdalene asylum. Hugely affecting historical drama.
16. OnceJohn Carney, 2007Conceived as a low-budget distraction between larger projects, Carney’s ambulatory musical - featuring Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová – became a phenomenon for the ages. Won an Oscar for best song. Generated a hit stage show. Carney moved on to further success with Begin Again and the lovely Sing Street.
15. The Fading LightIvan Kavanagh, 2009If you are a carer – or just a human – your heart will break watching this criminally overlooked drama. Two sisters ponder the fate of their disabled brother (a tour de force performance from Patrick O’Donnell) as they tend to their dying mother.
14. Song of GranitePat Collins, 2017Collins confirmed his status among the most vital Irish artists of his generation with the docu-drama on the Irish folk singer Joe Heaney. The picture has the silvery resonance of myth, but it has much to say about the Irish experience abroad in the 20th century.
13. Mise ÉireGeorge Morrison, 1959Beginning with a pre-photographic representation of Dermot McMurrough and Richard II before moving into newsreels, this wildly ambitious documentary powers through such historical milestones as Roger Casement’s execution. Featuring Countess Markievicz, Éamon de Valera, Michael Collins, Liam Cosgrove and, in the trenches of the first World War, the Connaught Rangers.
12. BrooklynJohn Crowley, 2015Irish film’s annus mirabilis came in 2016 when – thanks to Crowley’s take on a beloved Colm Tóibín novel, Lenny Abrahamson’s Room and Ben Cleary’s short Stutterer – domestic films bossed the Oscar nominations. Saoirse Ronan confirmed her rising status as the Wexford girl torn between Domhnall Gleeson and Emory Cohen.
11. The LobsterYorgos Lanthimos, 2015In this winningly absurd romantic comedy, a newly single Colin Farrell is transported to a hotel where he has 45 days to find a romantic partner or he’ll be transformed into an animal of his choosing – specifically the crustacean of the title.
10. My Left FootJim Sheridan, 1989It still seems so unlikely. Producer Noel Pearson and director Jim Sheridan imagined their study of disabled writer Christy Brown would play to a modest audience in Dublin. Boosted by a stirring performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker, it ended up winning two Oscars and relaunching the domestic industry.
9. The Wind That Shakes the BarleyKen Loach, 2006After seeing his friend executed by the Black and Tans, a young doctor (Cillian Murphy) joins his brother in the IRA until the Anglo-Irish Treaty comes between them. Deserving winner of the Palme d’Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.
8. Adam & PaulLenny Abrahamson, 2004After a long career in advertising, Lenny Abrahamson, collaborating with writer and actor Mark O’Halloran, made his feature debut with a study of two Dublin drug users that skirted Beckett and Buster Keaton while remaining utterly its own thing. The lead performances from O’Halloran and the late Tom Murphy are remarkable.
7. The Quiet ManJohn Ford, 1952John Wayne, playing an Irish-American boxer from Pittsburgh, returns to his ancestral home and falls for firebrand Maureen O’Hara. Unaccustomed to local etiquette, he fails to understand the importance of her dowry. He’d want to catch on.
6. The Crying GameNeil Jordan, 1992Jordan had already been up and down the sine wave – a hit with Mona Lisa, a bomb with High Spirits – when his peculiar psychological thriller broke through in 1992. Stephen Rea, the director’s muse, was typically muted as an IRA volunteer drifting towards one of cinema’s great twists.
5. HungerSteve McQueen, 2008It is hard to think of a more electrifying scene than the (McQueen and Enda Walsh scripted) encounter between Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender, never better) and Liam Cunningham’s visiting priest as they discuss the morality of the former’s hunger strike.
4. Man of AranRobert J Flaherty, 1934Controversy has long raged about Flaherty’s “fictional documentary” on life in the Aran Islands during the inter-war years. Scenes were fabricated. Family relationships are tweaked. But the film’s influence remains enormous. Despite its flexible attitude to the facts, Man of Aran translated truth to the emerging Irish nation (and the world).
3. Anne DevlinPat Murphy, 1984A sensible young woman (Brid Brennan, extraordinary) is caught up in Robert Emmet’s 1803 revolt. Made decades before the current conversation on the female gaze, Murphy’s painterly film is a landmark.
2. The DeadJohn Huston, 1987Huston always had a romantic view of the old country. James Joyce doesn’t much invite cinematic adaptation. The director was so ill he could barely stand. Much of the film was shot in California. Yet everything came together like holy kismet for Huston’s take on the final story in Dubliners. Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann have never been stronger. Somehow the sense of place survived.
1. Barry LyndonStanley Kubrick, 1975An 18th-century Irish scoundrel (Ryan O’Neal) makes his way across Europe and wins the heart of a noblewoman (Marisa Berenson), only to succumb to “Misfortunes and Disasters” as the intertitle puts it. Cinematography that required Nasa tech. Stately composition. Bach, Vivaldi, and The Chieftains. Forget The Shining and 2001. This is Kubrick’s masterpiece.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Upload: What if heaven is as hellish as the near-future?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is no secret that many humans are spooked by the idea that our lives amount to just a short period in the history of the world. Accordingly, some humans believe in an afterlife.
In recent years the popular culture has been a tad obsessed with the afterlife. The engine of interest and speculation about the topic is technology. The internet, Artificial Intelligence and a plethora of scientific advances fuel the idea of our consciousness existing long, long after our bodies wilt and die.
We’ve had the lovely smart comedy of The Good Place, with characters becoming better people in heaven, not in order to get there. The unsettling dark comedy Forever, with Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, presented the afterlife as a place of listlessness and dissatisfaction. The HBO/BBC mini-series Years and Years featured a character uploading herself to the Web before death and escaping the soulless present day.
Upload (new on Amazon Prime Video) is more satire than sage rumination on life in the hereafter. As such, it’s a fun and convivial distraction, at times immensely clever, but never quite as savagely indignant as it needs to be. It’s the work of Greg Daniels, whose stellar résumé includes The Simpsons episodes, King of the Hill, the NBC version of The Office, and Parks and Rec. He’s smart and influential and you should know that going into Upload.
The series is set in 2033, which is the really fun part. The technology is what is promised to us in 2020 but just out of reach. There are self-driving cars, food deliveries by drone and a running joke is that most major companies have merged. Thus, we get Google-Samsung and Nokia-Taco Bell. Here’s the real crux of it – the afterlife is merely an app you purchase. Depending on your income, you can have a super-nice heaven or a fairly banal heaven.
Our central figure is Nathan (Robbie Amell), a computer programmer busy cooking up a dazzling new creation. He is almost killed in a car accident (don’t trust self-driving vehicles is the message) and his wealthy girlfriend Ingrid (Allegra Edwards) gives him the chance to be uploaded to Lakeview, an afterlife place that looks like a grand hotel. (Think the Banff Springs Hotel, because there’s a distinct touch of Canada in this pleasant afterlife, which features “maple bacon donuts.” Wouldn’t be surprised if Greg Daniels visited Banff and it inspired the setting.) It is very pleasant and petrifyingly boring.
As the series progresses it becomes both a romance and a mystery. The satiric tone still holds, mind you. Nathan encounters an elderly man he recognizes as one of “the Choak brothers” (the guy is nicely played with sinister calm by William B. Davis), who scoffs at the idea that Nathan died in an accident. Also, Nathan gets very tight with his "angel,” named Nora (Andy Allo), whose job is to ensure the afterlife app offers customers what they’ve paid for.
This is all very rueful, charming and might make you chuckle. But it isn’t the scathing satire it could be. Recommended for those who want a gentle comedy with smarts. For those viewers it will be heaven itself.
Finally, this column continues with a “stay-at-home-period daily-streaming pick.” Today’s pick is Deutschland 83 (Crave). It’s a first-rate espionage thriller that treads lightly on the territory of larger, philosophical and political matters. It first aired to acclaim on Sundance TV in 2015 and was also a huge hit in Britain and Germany. The year is 1983 and Ronald Reagan is making speeches about the Soviet Bloc “evil empire” and he includes East Germany in that. As far as Lenora (Maria Schrader), a Stasi official, is concerned, that is declaring war. The East must be prepared. She convinces her colleagues that a spy must be sent to infiltrate the West German military.
She has in mind her nephew, Martin (Jonas Nay), a border agent who is smart, knows English and is loyal. He’s approached directly. He doesn’t want to do the job. He’s got a girlfriend who adores him and his mom is a single mother who is ill and who worries about him. Still, he goes and does the work. It’s a wild ride, this darkly entertaining and occasionally genuinely creepy drama series. It will entertain and make you think rather than bring tears of nostalgia for the early 1980s. It was followed by Deutschland 86 (also on Crave), which continues the hair-raising and sometimes harebrained adventures of Martin the spy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TV for Saturday, May 9</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even those who find the supernatural stuff a bit of a stretch will have to admit those aspects of this post-prison adventure thriller based on Neil Gaiman’s novel enrich the drama. The opening credits alone are a sensory feast, the gothic imagery invoking the underworld into which ex-con Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle, The 100) is shoved by the audacious Mr Wednesday (Ian McShane, Deadwood). This promises to be a battle both of the flesh and conscience.
The main problem with the Mayan doomsday prophecies on which this flimsy pseudo-history documentary hangs itself is that it is eight years out of date. Perhaps we should take some comfort in the fact that the world didn’t end in 2012, as these gaily dressed experts in 2009 proposed it might, according to ancient calendars possibly influenced by alien visitors. By that logic, the psychics who predicted said the plague of 2020 would end us all could be wrong, too.
Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts are a magnificent pairing in Chris Columbus’ heartfelt 1988 examination of the tenuous relationship between mother and stepmother in a blended family situation. This one is made yet more brittle by the terminal cancer diagnosis of the first wife (Sarandon). Ed Harris, as the dad caught in the middle, also gives a moving performance. It goes without saying that you’ll need the tissues handy by the story’s inevitably tear-jerking end.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: Pop superstars Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande are teaming up for the first time on a duet that will fund scholarships for the children of health and emergency workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.
The duet, called "Stuck With U," will be released on May 8, the two singers announced on Friday on Instagram, where they jointly have some 316 million followers.
All net proceeds from streaming and sales of the duet will be donated to the First Responders Children's Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for the children of those working during the pandemic.
Bieber, 26, and Grande, 26, two of the biggest young singers in the United States with hits like "Love Yourself" and "Thank U, Next," have never recorded a song together.
"We hope we make a big difference with this and we hope it uplifts you and makes you feel happy," Grande said in a statement.
The single is the first in series from Scooter Braun, who manages both singers, that will benefit charities during the year, Braun said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber announce new song 'Stuck With U', all proceeds go to COVID-19 relief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: American singer Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have teamed up to help others in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Grande and Bieber announced on Friday(local time) that they are working on a song, 'Stuck With U,' which will drop next week with all proceeds slated to go to coronavirus relief.
The 26-year-old songstress Ariana tweeted on Friday, "Stuck with u by me and @justinbieber out May 8th. head to my Instagram for more info. thank u to @1strcf and @sb_projects for making this possible."
Grande also announced the news on Instagram, and wrote, "Grateful to announce that my friend and i have partnered with @1strcf and @sb_projects on this release. proceeds from the streams and sales of #stuckwithu will be donated to first responders children's foundation to fund grants and scholarships for children of healthcare workers, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics, police officers and firefighters serving at the front lines during the global pandemic."
The 26-year-old pop-star Bieber, also added in a statement, "More than ever we are seeing the selfless, tireless and amazing work that doctors, nurses and healthcare providers give to the world every day. It is our hope we can lend our voices to raise awareness and give much-needed support for them and their families. It's my honour to come together with my friend Ariana and our SB Projects family to try and do some good."
The two music superstars have also independently been helping people in need. According to sources to Page Six, Grande, who has been communicating her longing to make music during the quarantine, has sent fans between 500 and 1,000 USD using the Venmo app.
One of the Ariana fans told Page Six that the 'Senorita' singer "took care of my salary for the month." She has helped more than 20 fans, said the outlet.
The '7 rings' singer also joined the Disney family singalong in April and sang 'I Won't Say I'm In Love' the animated film 'Hercules.'
Back in February, Bieber cantered his efforts on China, saying at the time that he "couldn't imagine how scary it would be if a new disease was effecting my wife and my family and friends."
The 'Yummy' singer said he made a donation to the country and urged his followers to join in on the conversation.
Bieber also accepted the #AllInChallenge to raise money for COVID relief. The singer said he will fly to your house for a private concert and sing 'One Less Lonely Girl.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What were you hoping for?Romance and an injection of excitement to jolt me out of my lockdown routine.
First impressions?She’s a babe, with a backdrop worthy of a cabinet minister.
What did you talk about?Our top pubs, her time in New York, mine in Indonesia, murder mysteries (both classic and involving tigers), tactics for making friends with neighbours.
Any awkward moments?I don’t think I made much sense while falling asleep on the sofa at the end. It runs in the family is my only excuse.
Good table manners?Impeccable. Either she is a quick eater or I was too focused on my saag paneer because I never actually saw her Chinese food.
How long did you stay on the call?Until just past 11. We moved on to sofas for Pictionary and quizzing.
Best thing about Olivia?She is a really genuine person, which made it easy for me to relax into the date.
Did you introduce her to your housemates?Yes, my housemate played waiter in exchange for a cut of the food and an attempt to score a date with her housemate.
Describe Olivia in three wordsAnimated. Alluring. Astute.
What do you think she made of you?I took it as a compliment that I reminded her of a cop from LineOf Duty. I just hope my lockdown haircut didn’t count against me.
Any connection issues?None. Plus we have the most unlikely mutual connection to Saskatoon University hospital in Canada.
And… did you swap numbers?Yes.
How did the call end?Rushing back to our tables to stage the selfie we forgot earlier on!
If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Established social norms for how to end a video call gracefully.
Marks out of 10?9.
Would you meet again in person?I would like to.
What were you hoping for?To speak to a person other than my housemate, and for my rubbish wifi to stay connected.
First impressions?All I remember was it suddenly hit me I was on a Guardian Blind date in the middle of a global pandemic.
What did you talk about?Corrupt police tigers, our kimchi-making housemates, the fact that Angus is named after a blue Mini from Aberdeen, and Quidditch.
Any awkward moments?When I disappeared for ages to try to figure out how to use Uber Eats.
Good table manners?He was a saint for waiting an hour for my food to arrive, while his curry sat in the oven.
How long did you stay on the call?A respectable four hours.
Best thing about Angus?He was really fun to chat to, and he laughed at my jokes (even the Line Of Duty ones, and he hasn’t seen Line Of Duty).
Did you introduce him to your housemates?He briefly met Emily, when she came to help with my food ordering crisis.
Describe Angus in three wordsPatient, fun and thoughtful.
What do you think he made of you?Probably that I’m a bit too enthusiastic about Poirot and should tone down the sarcasm.
Any connection issues?At the beginning, the connection was so bad, I couldn’t understand anything Angus was saying.
And… did you swap numbers?Yes, so he could get my approval on a screenshot selfie.
How did the call end?With a discussion on whether we’d see each other again.
If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?That I’d figured out how to order the food beforehand.
Marks out of 10?8.
Would you meet again in person?Yep, Angus has never been to a taproom; that needs to be resolved.
​• Self-isolation doesn’t mean you have to stop looking for love, and Blind Date will continue with online video dates. If you’re single and would like to be set up (with a takeaway on us), email blind.date@theguardian.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">Maya Jama is sick of d*** pics in her DMs but recommends phone sex in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maya Jama is getting really sick of all the d*** pics in her DMs.
Yes, the 25-year-old – who split from Stormzy last year – is a single lady in lockdown and no, she does not want to see your meat and two veg.
‘It always goes through my mind, like, “You’ve sent me a picture of your willy,”‘ she said in an Instagram Live.
‘Even if I loved the sight of you, I can’t respond to you now because I’ve just seen your willy.’
She’s got a fair point.
There’s still hope for all you lusty lot though, because the radio presenter does reply to her DMs sometimes – you just have to be funny.
She explained: ‘I never used to reply to DMs because I’d be like, “I don’t ever want to meet somebody through DMs.”
‘But obviously, recently I’ve replied to DMs. If somebody’s done a funny meme or a gif, or something like that makes me chuckle, that’s good.’
And while she’s not a fan of genitalia close-ups, Maya is a strong advocate of phone sex.
She said: ‘If you are confident enough to do it, phone sex is the movement. That’s what people have been doing for years in long distance.’
Hinting that she might try it out herself, the DJ added: ‘I need to practice my sexy voice on the phone and see where it goes.’
Reading, cleaning, practicing your phone sex voice… all your standard lockdown activities.
Maya – who jetted off on a break to the Maldives before lockdown struck – got stuck in the middle of some serious beef recently.
Wiley kicked off feud number 625 with Stormzy when he thirsted all over one of Maya’s Instagram snaps on Friday.
He commented under a photo of the presenter posing in the mirror: ‘I say this with respect “Looking like a bloodclart Snack”.’
Maya and Stormzy split up in August 2019 after four years together and the rapper is still heartbroken about it.
Stormzy admitted back in January that he’d still love to marry his ‘amazing’ ex and have her children.
Ever considered sending her a GIF on Insta, Stormzy? Just a thought.

    <h5 class="mb-1">17 Animal Photos That Have Amazing Stories Behind Them</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We feel like the world just has to know about how orangutans became friends with otters, why a dog works in a post office, and why a person that takes care of zebras that lost their parents wears a striped coat. There’s just no such thing as too many kind stories.
We at Bright Side believe that there are more good things in this world than bad ones — and we have proof. Be sure to keep reading until the end of the article where you’ll find a bonus story about the most cunning cat in the world.
Mary Lore Barra from Mexico accidentally found out that her cat Pixi lives a double life. Mary got him when he was a kitten and 2 years later, Pixi grew into an adult cat with an independent personality. When he disappeared for several days, she wasn’t really worried, thinking he was doing regular cat stuff like running around and hunting birds.
But one day, this cat came home wearing a new collar. The woman suspected that she wasn’t the only owner of the pet, so she attached a piece of paper to the collar saying, “His name is Pixi and it looks like he lives in 2 houses.” Soon, the cat returned with an answer, “We call him Huarache, he has 2 homes. Congratulations! Other parents of the cat.”
It turned out that the other owners of Pixi lived not far from Mary’s house and before they got her note, they were sure they were the only owners of the cat. Now they’re sharing the details of Pixi’s life with each other and Mary says, “I think that Pixi is very lucky. Some cats don’t have even one home, let alone 2. I know that his other owners are decent people because they take good care of him.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having a baby is always a huge moment in time - but having one when the country is in the midst of a pandemic is unchartered territory.
Those adorable little ones won't know what's happening around them right now.
They'll just carry on making cute (and sometimes deafening) noises whilst padding about on living room floors without a care in the world.
But those gorgeous faces will no doubt feel the warmth, love and comfort of their mummys and daddys - who rightfully deserve a medal.
Whether it's your first, second, third or sixth - hats off to you all.
It's those amazing little moments with your little baby that is going to make all the difference as the storm rages outside.
In honour of everyone finding their feet as parents right now, we asked over Facebook if they'd like to tell us a little about their bundle of joy.
101 reasons to smile as Plymouth pulls together in spite of hard times 
And the feedback was overwhelming - there really are some super cute new Janners among us.
Plus your praise for the NHS and the midwives at Derriford really was amazing to say the least.
So we thought it would be lovely to share with you all the many photos and messages we've had from parents who were so keen to share with us the ray of sunshine (or two!) that's come into their lives.

    <h5 class="mb-1">So It Turns Out The Word ‘Cocktail’ Comes From Sticking Spicy Surprises Up A Horse’s Anoos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Monday or Tuesday of this week, during a spot of cheeky isolation-induced day drinking, a question occurred to me: what is a cocktail? I mean, I know what cocktails are – they’re those things we used to drink on a Friday afternoon back when we were allowed to go out and socialise – but what does the word actually mean? Where does it come from?
With nothing but time on my hands and an insatiable curiosity, I poured myself another stiff drink and turned to my old mate Google for answers. After hitting a few dead ends, I managed to find a pretty convincing explanation that, while fascinating, also may have tainted the very concept of cocktails for me forever. Long story short, it involves a horse’s arse.
According to spirits historian David Wondrich, the word ‘cocktail’ has its origins in the old-fashioned concept of “feaguing”, which means:
“Fundament”, it turns out, is a polite way of saying “arsehole”. What this therefore means is that in olden times, people would stick spicy things (or live eels?) in horses’ butts to make them cock their tails and seem more lively.
Ingredients like ginger and pepper were also commonly used in alcoholic beverages circa the 18th century, and these drinks were said to perk people’s spirits up in much the same way as a horse that had just copped a spicy surprise in the derriere. Thus, the phrase cocktail was born.
I was reeling from this information, so I decided to do some real hard-hitting journalism to find out if this deranged explanation was true, or just a load of horse shit.
Chad Parkhill, author of the book Around The World In 80 Cocktails and owner of the Melbourne bar Trouble In Dreams, is a man who knows a thing or two about drinks. When I asked him about the horse’s arse theory of cocktails, I fully expected him to laugh in my face, but instead, he told me that this version of things is most likely legit.
He reckons there are a few myths about origins of the word ‘cocktail’, and some theories that have been debunked over the years:
He went on to say that our “current best guess” for the origin of cocktails involves a horse’s rear end. The word ‘cocktail’ is either “a metonym from ‘cock-tail’ horses being impure breeds (so a cock-tail drink is an impure drink),” or “it comes from the practice of sticking raw ginger root up a horse’s ass to make it perk up.” Either way, it involves butts.
Perhaps ironically, Parkhill reckons the fact that we’re actually asking questions like this is a sign of maturity. He says there was a point not long ago when bartenders would just make up origin stories for drinks willy nilly, but now there’s “a lot more rigour, and more debate between people about the significance of evidence and what conclusions we can draw from it.”
“So even though we might never be able to say definitively where the word ‘cocktail’ comes from, the fact that we can have this debate shows that the field is growing up.” Yes, growing up. Now if you’ll excuse me I’m off to day drink and giggle about butts for the remainder of the afternoon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Never Have I Ever Season 2: Everything We KNow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netflix's Never Have I Ever first premiered on Netflix in late April, and the teen comedy already has people talking. The new series joins Sex Education, Atypical, and The End of the F*ing World as another teen series gripping the attention of audiences looking to relive (or not) their long-ago days of angst, puberty, and general anger and confusion about the world. Speaking as a full adult woman living in the middle of a pandemic, a lot of my feelings right now mirror those I dealt with as a 13-year-old in a land-locked state. When will I ever see the ocean? When can I leave this isolation?
Anyway. Never Have I Ever, a coming-of-age comedy from co-creators Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher, follows the story of a first-generation Indian American girl growing up in Southern California named Devi Vishwakumar. Its 18-year-old star, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, told Varietythat one of the best things about the show is reactions from fans who say they can empathize with its characters.
"It's awesome because I’m seeing so many people saying, 'Oh my God, I can relate to this so much.’ Whether it's something as simple as one of the arm hair joke—because let's be real, even though I’m 100 percent confident with my arm hair, there are days where I go up to my father and I say, 'Why did you do this to me? Why can’t you give me anything else?'"
This show is clearly a success. So, will it get a second season? And what will that look like?
With powerful forces such as Kaling, behind this show, it looks like there's a good chance this show will be renewed for another season.
"I felt lucky to be able to do a show about an Indian nerd who's also badly behaved, to show that because I'm deeply familiar with it. Bela [Bajaria, Netflix vice president of local language originals] was also interested in seeing Indian characters who are not all like Princess Jasmine," Kaling told Newsweek.
Kaling has been repping her show hard on Instagram, and something says she'll be delighted to see it get renewed.
Chances are good, but no one has said anything yet. The first season seems to be a hit among fans so far, because the show has proven itself to be complex comedy. It's funny, but it's also melancholy, just like high school.
"Never Have I Ever begins with a tragedy when protagonist Devi Vishwakumar’s (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) father Mohan (Sendhil Ramamurthy) suddenly dies, and shortly after, Devi inexplicably loses the use of her legs," The Verge writes. "(This is all in the first few minutes). As Devi is starting to get used to life without her father and with her disability, her mobility returns, just as curiously as it left."
The plotlines for the second show might not be written yet, but its star already has ideas for what her character can explore next season.
“Three main things—understanding that she needs to be more appreciative of her family and her friends because her friends do a lot for her," she told The Verge. "Her friends really are her day ones. And also understanding where her mother’s coming from. That is something that we'll be able to have a lot of audiences relate to, understanding where our parents are coming from even though they might not go about doing certain things the best way possible."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Palesa Madisakwane – What You Need To Know About Somizi’s Ex-Wife
If you are a fan of South African soapies, you must definitely know the gorgeous Palesa Madisakwane. The  44-year-old actress who doesn’t seem to age at all is popularly known for her role as ‘Thandeka’ in e.tv telenovela Ashes to Ashes. She also played the role of Palesa in SABC 1’s drama series Generations. Hopefully, that rings a bell. If not, you might know her for her involvement with quite a handful of influential men in the country. One of which,  is Mzansi’s most loved entertainer, Somizi Mhlongo and the two have a child together. A girl, Bahumi Madisakwane, read all about her in this article.
Some of you might be wondering that is it not that Somizi is gay? Oh, yes he is. Palesa and Somizi had an affair before the latter came out of the closet. Palesa has also been involved with controversial flamboyant businessman Nico Matlala and Jakes Mocuminyane. So who is this vivacious woman?
Palesa was born on September 6, 1975. She is a well-renowned actor. She has three children, Bahumi Madisakwane with Somizi Mhlongo, Thato, and Khumo Mocuminyane from her relationship with now estranged husband Jakes Mocuminyane. Arguably, the highlight of her career was when she featured on Generations. She has also acted on
Palesa has also been involved in a few controversies. Speculation has it that when she met Somizi she was deeply involved and committed to another man. Palesa’s dalliance with Somizi ended up in a love child, Bahumi.
last year, Palesa, escaped death by a whisker after she was involved in a horrific car crash that left her nursing wounds all over her body. The accident happened on Witkoppen road in Johannesburg North. According to the actress, it was all the fault of a drunk driver.
After sustaining massive face injuries which would only be disastrous for her television career, she was fortunate enough to undergo facial reconstruction. This was after her former boyfriend, Somizi Mhlongo, stepped in and took her to an aesthetic doctor.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is proving a very important point in her latest interview with Variety.
The 18-year-old actress chatted with the site about her Netflix show, Never Have I Ever, and applauded the series for promoting cultural sensitivity, and that includes pronouncing her name and other South Asian names correctly.
“That active effort for Devi’s name ‘Vishwakumar,’ to get that right, it’s important because that’s her name. You deserve to be called the way you want to be called, no matter what,” she shared.
Maitreyi adds that she knows “obviously, Tamil names are super long. My entire full name — Maitreyi Ramakrishnan — I have 20 letters, but I do have my friends at school that just call me Ramakrishnan and they pronounce it correctly. I think names are so important.”
“I think one of the greatest disrespects you can do to a person is not put the effort into somebody’s name. Personally for me, I used to anglicize my name…in high school, and then when I landed in L.A., they were like, ‘How do you say your name? Sorry, I don’t want to mix it up.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this is my chance to reclaim my name’ because I love my name. Why would I change it?”
Never Have I Ever is streaming on Netflix now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leah Lewis on How Family, Friends, and Twin Fire Souls Make The Half of It a "Coming-of-Life" Story</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most movies that center around that awkward-yet-wonderful time of life that is our adolescence are seen as coming-of-age flicks, but according to Leah Lewis, The Half of It is something different, something more. "I would say it is a very realistic story about an immigrant who is coming of age, coming into her sexuality," she explained to POPSUGAR. "It deals with finding friendships and finding your way back to your family. I feel like it's a coming-of-life story."
That's a lot to put on one film, but luckily, Alice Wu's production lives up to the hype. Lewis stars as the film's protagonist, a high school senior named Ellie Chu, who is too smart for her own good and the small town of Squahamish. All she cares about is her grieving father and making sure that they keep their cozy home above the train station, which she ensures by helping to pay the bills with a side business writing English papers for her classmates. Enter Paul Munsky, earnestly played by Daniel Diemer, and Aster Flores, the high school unicorn that is a popular girl who happens to be genuinely kind and played by Alexxis Lemire. The three become caught up in a complicated love triangle loosely based on the famous play, Cyrano de Bergerac.
The story of Cyrano de Bergerac isn't a new one, and most adaptations of the 19th-century play follow the premise to the letter: Person A pretends to be Person B to help the latter woo Person C, whom they're usually both in love with. The Half of It not only flips the story's usual gender roles, but gives it new life by upping the stakes for the young characters. Ellie only feels brave enough to send letters to Aster under Paul's name because she fears how the other young woman would handle knowing that the person she's connecting with is another girl. And Paul, well Paul gets all kinds of twisted up in his feelings throughout the film.
"I remember when I first read the logline, I was immediately excited. I mean, it's a typical Cyrano de Bergerac story, but with this added factor of there possibly being a coming of sexuality," Lewis recalled. "I was very thrown by that in all of the most positive ways. I went in to audition for Ellie, who I immediately fell in love with. I just remember thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, if I'm not part of this, what am I going to do with myself?' So very early on, I was just jazzed to even be able to have the opportunity to audition for the role to begin with."
Even speaking over the phone, it was obvious that the actress — who currently stars on The CW's Nancy Drew as a modern take on Georgia "George" Fan — was completely enamored with the young Ellie. And it's hard not to be: you either find her loner-nerd aloofness relatable or can't resist falling for the soft marshmallow that's slowly revealed as her defenses fall away. Not that she doesn't have a good reason for those defenses — as possibly the only Chinese family in Sqahamish, Ellie and her father are noticeably isolated from the rest of the town and have no one but each other as anchors in their daily lives.
It's an existence that Lewis acknowledges is trying for her character. "Ellie at the beginning of the film lives a very modest, routined life. You can immediately see that she is very responsible, as she has a list of things that she has to take care of before she even leaves the house," she pointed out. "She goes about her life as this shy wallflower, like this fade-to-the back character, even though her life is so colorful at home."
Despite not seeming wallflower-ish in any way, Lewis admitted that there were many ways that she related to Ellie. The 17-year-old high schooler was modeled from real-life experiences that Wu herself had, but Lewis revealed that the director highlighted ways the actress could relate to the character to create a more authentic story. "The way that Ellie writes is very similar to the way that I express myself in my everyday life. I take pen to paper, almost every single day, and that is very important to me," she said.
Of course, there's the most obvious similarity between the two, which is that they're both Asian American. Lewis, who was adopted from China when she was 8 months old, acknowledged that though her family life is different from Ellie's, their experiences growing up were similar. "There wasn't that large of an Asian community [in my hometown] for me to explore that part of myself and feel accepted in that aspect. Similarly with Ellie, as far as we know, her family is kind of the only Chinese family in Squahamish," she said.
For Ellie, her social isolation is compounded by the fact that her father is still grieving over the death of her mother and rarely socializes for fear that people won't understand him because of his accent. He heavily relies on Ellie to act as the family's voice and, in some ways, allows Ellie to act as the parent. It's a heavy burden for a high schooler, but it doesn't prevent the two from being close. It's a familiar dynamic for children of immigrants, which I explained to Lewis is the reason the father-daughter relationship strongly resonated with me. The actress felt the same, noting that their dynamic hit close to home with her because it's obvious that they love one another.
"Being a teenager and discovering your place in the family can be a very interesting experience. At that age, I don't think I was as close to my parents until I needed to draw closer to them. Similarly, Ellie and her father don't have this dialogue until a huge event pops up in their life and brings them closer together as well. And because he's not as fluent in English, we don't see them communicating so much with words, but more with their actions and the way that they move with each other at home. It's in the secret moments where he's there for Ellie when she is sad," she said.
"I feel like Paul is the first instance of Ellie and her father truly being seen by somebody in this town. Her father stays at home and doesn't really have any friends, and then Paul enters the picture and starts bringing in meat for him and hanging out with him. It's cool seeing Paul kind of open up both of these characters, it's really beautiful. That was one of my favorite things!"
Paul, the second half of The Half of It's doomed love triangle, is the catalyst for more than just Ellie and Aster's world properly colliding. The earnest jock becomes Ellie's first friend through the sheer desire to know her outside of their farce: defending her from bullies, asking questions about her family and life, encouraging her to do what she loves and play her music. He doesn't just become Ellie's friend: he becomes her partner, her confidante, and shows her another face of love that isn't her father. He shows her that, despite not understanding her completely, people can still care about her and love her. It's a beautiful relationship, and one that doesn't fail to get Lewis emotional when she talks about it.
When I asked her what she would say was the most significant moment in the duo's friendship, Lewis warned me no less than three times that she would probably start crying while talking about it. (Her voice definitely wobbled a few times.) "The most significant moment in their relationship was something that Ellie didn't even see when after everything was said and done: Paul goes to her father and still brings him the meat," she said. "That little action just shows his love for her, his acceptance for her. He literally says to her father, 'You don't see her.' Oh my God, I could cry just thinking about the fact that that is the moment where we realize someone finally sees her, and how beautiful is that?"
On the other hand, Lewis's favorite scene with Diemer is the final scene, where Paul and Ellie say goodbye to each other at the train station, which Wu made special for both actors. "Daniel and I became close friends offscreen and Alice totally embraced that. She would always pull us aside and tell us different things about each other. Right before the train scene, she pulled me aside and asked me what I wished for Daniel in life. I just thought we were having a conversation and I was like, 'Oh, I hope he has a good life,'" Lewis recounted. "Then right before we shot the goodbye scene, she whispered in my ear what Daniel wished for me in my life. I completely just broke down. We were like our characters, where we just wanted the best for each other and we just loved each other so much. So, I'm just reduced to tears every time I think about it."
Not only is that a ridiculously sweet behind-the-scenes tidbit, but it also lends even more sentimentality to an already beautiful scene. For Lewis, the scene allows viewers to "finally see the growth in these characters." By the end of the film, Ellie has allowed herself to accept love from someone else, namely Paul, who has pushed past what he's been taught to fight for his relationship with her. "Seeing Ellie cry at the end, you finally see her accept and feel that love and friendship," Lewis explained. "For Ellie, that is really hard, because it's a whole 180 from that moment back to when they were in the car and Paul starts to ask Ellie about her personal life. Ellie's not used to loving or talking to other people in that kind of intimate way. So you see both of the characters just open up and bloom by that moment."
The emotional ending of the film is a very welcome conclusion after seeing the two friends fall apart when Ellie's feelings for Aster (and Paul's for Ellie) are revealed in a crushing scene. Lewis admitted that the scene was especially difficult because of the sensitivity of the moment. "These are real-life situations that people go through. For Ellie to be discovered rather than her getting to express these feelings naturally, it was a very intimate moment," she said.
By that point in the film, Aster and Ellie's relationship is relatively fragile, on the cusp of possibly becoming a friendship but too new and delicate to be anything solid. But there's something more between them that is unspoken, thanks in part to Ellie's feelings and to the intimacy they built during what is my favorite scene of the film. The two find themselves at a local lake after Aster seeks Ellie's company, and they bond during a tranquil dip in the water. They discuss music, their families, and relationships, but the hushed intimacy of the scene speaks more than words ever could. It's a meeting of two souls that have finally found the one other person who truly gets them out of the hundreds of others who never could. It's not just romantic: it's affirming in a way that speaks to a deep connection that I desperately wanted to see more of.
"The scene between Aster and Ellie is particularly special because it's the first time that they're face-to-face with each other and having these real conversations. Paul is not there to be the middleman anymore; there is no veil that Ellie gets to hide behind, and it's kind of same with Aster. It's the first time that these twin fire souls finally come together and realize that they see each other for who they are," Lewis said about the scene. "It was so special because, once again going back to just being seen, I think this is the first time these characters had uttered those words to another person. That's huge for them, and the fact that they feel so comfortable around each other speaks on the natural chemistry that's there."
She added, "Just shooting it with Alexxis was magical. It was our last day on set and we were in this gorgeous hot tub spring that our set department built for us. It was rewarding because not only was it the last day, but getting to shoot it with someone who was my best friend was like, 'Are you kidding me? Really? Are you sure that we get to do this?' Alice was amazing beyond words throughout the whole thing."
Lewis and Lemire's bond definitely lends to the closeness that grows between Ellie and Aster, and it makes any viewer watch their final scene in the movie with an unavoidable air of hopefulness. If anyone says that their heart didn't pound out of their chest during that ending conversation and kiss, y'all are lying! And though Lewis admitted that it's strange when "your best friend falls in love with the girl that you fell in love with and you kind of also fell in love with your best friend," she still hopes that the trio stays in close contact.
Yes, it sounds a little ridiculous when it's said out loud, but The Half of It manages to capture the messiness of being a teenager, falling in love (and realizing you don't quite know what love even is yet), finding your soul's other half, and figuring out who you are when you didn't think anyone would ever care to learn who that is. There's a lot of love and discoveries that need to be navigated, but Lewis has faith they'll figure it out. And maybe there's space for Aster and Ellie to make beautiful art together in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lionel Shriver: 'Some people think I'm evil incarnate'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionel Shriver is a US-born writer whose novels include Big Brother, The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047 and the bestsellingWe Need to Talk About Kevin, which won the 2005 Orange prize and was turned into a film by Lynne Ramsay starring Tilda Swinton. In 2014, she won the BBC national short story award. Her new novel, The Motion of the Body Through Space, is about a long-married couple whose relationship is almost destroyed when one of them becomes obsessed with exercise.
What kind of lockdown are you having?One of the most horrifying things about this experience is that it’s having so little effect on my life. I live in lockdown all the time! I don’t think this reflects well on me, but either I don’t have a very keen social appetite or I’m under-aware of when I’m starting to get lonely.
How do you feel about your new novel being published during this time?Oh, that’s a catastrophe. I’m ashamed of myself because I’m not supposed to care about what’s happening to my book; it’s nothing compared to losing a business you’ve spent your whole life building. But it’s two years’ work, and I’m publishing into a big, black hole; all the bookshops closed.
What are these weeks of seclusion and anxiety going to do for art?Cataclysm is always good for the arts. The possibility of catastrophe is stimulating to the imagination, though I worry this is potentially catastrophic on a scale that’s bigger than anything I could make up – and I don’t mean the disease itself, but everything that follows economically. It’s the same for all of us, though. We feel like we’re in a disaster movie, only we’re on the wrong side of the screen and there’ll be no happy endings for our favourite characters.
Your novel Big Brother was about obesity. The new book is about exercise. Are they companion pieces?There is a correspondence there, yes. Big Brother was about food and people’s relationship to it. In this one I’ve kept food out of it. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with the relationship between mind and body, and the weirdness of living in an organism that’s in the process of corruption and, ultimately, death. That’s a big subject and I don’t mind visiting it more than once.
Was there a specific trigger for this novel? Something that set you off?I’ve always been an exercise nut, so in some ways this is putting that under the microscope. But like Serenata [the wife in The Motion of the Body Through Space] I have drastically arthritic knees. That’s sobering. There’s the feeling of being punished for having been good; the first intimations of limitation.
Serenata’s husband, Remington, takes up extreme exercise late in life, and enters a “Mettleman” triathlon. It’s almost as if he’s joined a cult. How did you research this?I went with my husband to the Lake Placid Ironman [in the Adirondack Mountains, New York]. What was interesting was that I had to really force myself to go, and when I got there I only did one interview. It was fascinating how repelled I was by my own subject matter.
Serenata has a harder time ageing than Remington. Is the unfairness of the way women age – and are seen to age – at the heart of your story?I wasn’t motivated by that. But I do think it’s especially hard to get older as a female. I found the menopause horrific: all these stupid hormones pinging around your body arbitrarily. They’re not organised to a purpose, yet they won’t go away; they just go haywire. There’s a strong feeling of being discarded that one can’t really blame entirely on men. Nature doesn’t want you around any more.
At the 2016 Brisbane writers festival, there was outrage when you said that you hoped the notion of cultural appropriation in fiction was a fad. Does the row that recently blew up around Jeanine Cummins’s novel, American Dirt, about a Mexican bookseller, suggest your optimism was misplaced?Yes. I was talking to an executive at HarperCollins, which publishes the No 1. Ladies’ Detective Agency series. He said they’d be turned down today: a middle-aged, white Scot [Alexander McCall Smith] writing about a black woman in Botswana – that’s not on. But let’s not waste time listing all the books that would break the rules now. What made the American Dirt row horrifying was the author’s response. She didn’t stand up and defend herself. Instead, she pushed to the fore her Puerto Rican grandmother. It was completely wrong-headed. The whole idea of cultural appropriation limits fiction’s ability to be fiction.
What did you make of the decision of Hachette, Woody Allen’s original publisher, to cancel the publication of his memoir following protests from Ronan Farrow and several company employees?I took it a little personally. It sets a terrible precedent. I’ve stuck my neck out in the past. I’ve made a lot of enemies. Some people think I’m evil incarnate. What if enough of them were working at HarperCollins and didn’t want my book published, and staged a walkout? Would HarperCollins stand behind me? Should I feel confident it would honour my contract? That a writer can be the victim of the mob like this should be terrifying for any author.
What are you reading?Oh dear. In all honesty, I’m reading newspapers and magazines exclusively. I can’t read fiction right now, which makes me a hypocrite because I expect everyone to read mine.
What will you write next? Something about the apocalypse?One way in which the lockdown has been great for me is that I’m going to finish the draft of my new novel in four months. It’s about a couple who make a pact that they’re going to kill themselves when they’re 80. It sounds like a downer but it’s actually a huge amount of fun because it’s a parallel-universe book. Honestly, it has turned out to be hilarious.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season's finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race," is in her house. 
For a drag queen, that's unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world — and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
"We've really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days," Aquaria told Business Insider, "where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home."
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going — and attempt to recoup some lost income.
"I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress — in theory — when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized," Aquaria said.
But she noted that that's not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience — and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans — is a difficult task. 
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow "Drag Race" stars, has been competing in "Werq The World Battle Royale." It's a livestream of the self-described "largest drag show on the planet" — and, according to its website, all funds raised go to "displaced local drag entertainers around the globe." The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of "Human Touch."
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of "Drag Race" — fan-favorite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12's queens will experience life post-"Drag Race."
As a season of "Drag Race" airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
"Drag Race" also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience — one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
"Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me," Aquaria said. "Getting to share my experiences on 'Drag Race' with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space."
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won't get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won't get the post-season visibility — and monetary opportunities — that other competitors have benefited from.
"I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I'd won," Aquaria said. "So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it's really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try."
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
"I don't know if it's just 'cause I'm online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls," Aquaria said. "Because if they can't build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being."
And this season — which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations —  now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn't made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes "some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable." She said that potentially delaying the finale — and keeping everyone "on the edge of our seats" — would be a preferable alternative.
"I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there," Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there's been one constant.
"It's wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they're at a drag show. It's certainly an extremely surreal time," Aquaria said. "I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who's been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it's been, how interesting it's been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support."

But she noted that that’s not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience – and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans – is a difficult task.
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow “Drag Race” stars, has been competing in “Werq The World Battle Royale.” It’s a livestream of the self-described “largest drag show on the planet” – and, according to its website, all funds raised go to “displaced local drag entertainers around the globe.” The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of “Human Touch.”
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of “Drag Race” – fan-favorite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12’s queens will experience life post-“Drag Race.”
As a season of “Drag Race” airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
“Drag Race” also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience – one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
“Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me,” Aquaria said. “Getting to share my experiences on ‘Drag Race’ with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space.”
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won’t get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won’t get the post-season visibility – and monetary opportunities – that other competitors have benefited from.
“I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I’d won,” Aquaria said. “So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it’s really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try.”
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
“I don’t know if it’s just ’cause I’m online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls,” Aquaria said. “Because if they can’t build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being.”
And this season – which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations – now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn’t made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes “some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable.” She said that potentially delaying the finale – and keeping everyone “on the edge of our seats” – would be a preferable alternative.
“I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there,” Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there’s been one constant.
“It’s wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they’re at a drag show. It’s certainly an extremely surreal time,” Aquaria said. “I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who’s been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it’s been, how interesting it’s been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season’s finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” is in her house.
For a drag queen, that’s unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world – and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’ve really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days,” Aquaria told Business Insider, “where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home.”
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going – and attempt to recoup some lost income.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Comedy is dominating among movie and TV viewers as people look for laughs while social distancing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At-home audiences are looking for a good laugh as people practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The talent agency UTA's data group UTA IQ, along with the research firm SightX, conducted a representative survey of nearly 1,100 people across the US, ages 18 to 54, who had been social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak from April 4 to April 11.
The survey found that 51% of respondents were watching comedy TV shows during the outbreak, the leading genre.
Drama (39%), action/adventure (33%), and news (33%) followed among TV viewers. Family came in at 27%.
"A third of people still rely on TV to get their news, and family-friendly content is important with so many children home 24/7," the survey said. 
The popularity of family television is good for Disney Plus, which was the streaming service with the highest level of "intent to add" among survey respondents, at 37%, followed by the Disney-operated Hulu at 33% and the upcoming HBO Max at 31%.
HBO Max was the leading service among those that recently launched or are launching this year, such as the mobile-only Quibi and NBCUniversal's Peacock. 
The chart below breaks down each TV genre:
The comedy genre also dominated among movie viewers, with 59% of respondents saying they were consuming comedy movies while home. This it notable considering comedies have struggled in theaters in recent years while blockbuster superhero movies dominate the box office.
But only 24% of respondents said they were watching superhero/comic-book movies while social distancing, suggesting audiences prefer a spectacle on the big screen while comedies provide comfort at home.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JK Rowling, the creator of the Harry Potter adventures, is donating £1m to charities supporting vulnerable people during the lockdown.
Half of the money will go to Crisis which helps homeless people, and half to Refuge to support victims of domestic abuse.
Rowling's donations come amid #HarryPotterDay on Twitter.
Saturday also marks the anniversary of one the author's major events in her stories.
On Twitter, Rowling said: "Today's the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I am going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths.
"Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world."
Rowling, who wrote many of her Harry Potter stories while living in Edinburgh, said many vulnerable people who were homeless or in an abusive relationship were suffering at this time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">JK Rowling donates £1 million to charity to help vulnerable during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JK Rowling is donating £1 million to charity to help the most vulnerable in society during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Harry Potter author usually marks the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts – the showdown between Harry and the Hogwarts students and Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the final book, The Deathly Hallows – on 2 May each year.
However, she decided it would be ‘inappropriate’ to discuss the fictional deaths that occurred in the Harry Potter books while the country is in crisis.
The 54-year-old tweeted: ‘Today’s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I’m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world.

‘So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I’m thinking of the people who’re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I’m torn between pride and anxiety.’
The author – believed to be worth £700 million – went on to confirm she would be making a donation to Crisis and Refuge, to help the homeless and victims of domestic abuse. 
Rowling wrote: ‘As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I’ll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to https://crisis.org.uk, who’re helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to https://refuge.org.uk, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.’
Chief executive of Refuge Sandra Horley CBE stated that domestic abuse could potentially increase during lockdown, with people spending more time at home with their abusers.
A statement read: ‘1.6 million women experienced domestic abuse last year, and self-isolation has the potential to aggravate pre-existing abusive behaviours by perpetrators.
‘While in lockdown or self-isolation, women and children are likely to be spending concentrated periods of time with perpetrators, potentially escalating the threat of domestic abuse and further restricting their freedom.
‘Domestic abuse isn’t always physical – it’s a pattern of controlling, threatening and coercive behaviour, which can also be emotional, economic, psychological or sexual. Abuse is a choice a perpetrator makes, and isolation is already used by many perpetrators as a tool of control.
‘In the current climate, it is certainly more challenging for women suffering abuse. Lines of communication could be severely limited if women are unable to leave the home.’
Rowling had been ‘reminded’ by a fan on 1 May that the Battle of Hogwarts was coming up, to which she responded with a shout-out to the birthday of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour’s daughter – who was called Victoire, French for victory, because of the day her birth fell on.
The writer – who lost her billionaire status due to her charity donations – tweeted: ‘Also Victoire Weasley-née- Delacour’s birthday, but that gets overshadowed. I feel bad for her. The wizarding equivalent of being born on Christmas Day and christened Holly.’
The creator of the wizarding world of Harry Potter has been active on social media during lockdown, responding to fan art and also launching Harry Potter At Home to keep kids entertained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Harry Potter author JK Rowling gives one million pounds to help poorest and most vulnerable during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JK Rowling has promised to donate £1m to charity to help "the poorest and most vulnerable" during the coronavirus crisis.
The Harry Potter author posted on Twitter that she would be donating half the cash to domestic abuse charity Refuge and half to homeless charity Crisis. In a statement on Twitter she said: "Today's the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I'm going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world.
"So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I'm thinking of the people who're out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have three key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I'm torn between pride and anxiety.
"As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I'll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to Crisis, who're helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to Refuge because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown."
Domestic violence charities in Wales have been hard pressed to combat the surge in domestic abuse cases because of the virus. Not only has there been increased demand but they are unable to fund raise as usual.
The Battle of Hogwarts is a reference to the end of the Harry Potter series in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In it the forces of good combated Volde... sorry, You-Know-Who, and he was finally defeated.

Last month, Gareth Bale donated a million pounds to help Welsh and Spanish health workers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">JK Rowling to donate £1m to charities battling pandemic as she pays tribute to brave frontline workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Harry Potter author JK Rowling is donating £1m to charity to help tackle domestic abuse and homelessness during the pandemic.
The Scots writer has pledged to give £500,000 each to Crisis and Refuge, who are both facing increased demand due to the nationwide lockdown.
The 54-year-old Edinburgh resident also paid tribute to key frontline workers who are working hard to save lives, including three of her own family members.
She has pledged the funds in honour of the fictional Battle of Hogwarts, which took place in her magical books 22 years ago today.
Rowling tweeted: “Today’s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I’m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today.
“Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world.
“So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I’m thinking of the people who’re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life.
“I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I’m torn between pride and anxiety.

"And half of which will go to Refuge, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.”
The generous author previously revealed that she had suffered from all the symptoms of the coronavirus but had not been tested for the infection.
She has since fully recovered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">J.K. Rowling Honors ‘Battle Of Hogwarts’ Anniversary With $1.2 Million Charity Donation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">J.K. Rowling is donating $1.2 million to charity, to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, the final showdown that takes place in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
The Harry Potter author decided to forego her tradition of apologizing for killing off Harry Potter characters on May 2, and instead penned a heartfelt message on the current global COVID-19 crisis, and announced that she would be donating £1 million ($1.2 million), splitting this donation between homeless support charity Crisis, and domestic violence charity, Refuge:
“Today's the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I'm going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world. 1/4
“So on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I'm thinking of the people who're out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have 3 key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I'm torn between pride and anxiety. 2/4
“As ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I'll be making a donation of £1m, half of which will go to crisis.org.uk, who're helping the homeless during the pandemic 3/4
“and half of which will go to refuge.org.uk, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown. 4/4”
May 2 is the day on which Harry Potter defeated Lord Voldemort and his followers in the Harry Potter books. The final battle at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry resulted in the deaths of many fan favorite characters, and in previous years, Rowling took to Twitter every May 2 to apologize for one of these deaths:
Even last year, many thought Rowling had forgotten to post an apology, but eagle-eyed fans spotted a change in her cover photo, presumed to symbolize an apology for the death of Sirius Black in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix:
Fans have reacted to Rowling’s break from tradition with gratitude, with many saying that they also plan to donate after seeing her announcement.
In December 2019, Rowling was awarded a Ripple of Hope R.F. Kennedy Human Rights award. To help fans, families and teachers through the COVID-19 crisis, Rowling announced the launch of her Harry Potter at Home hub, dedicated to providing free resources to those reading the Harry Potter series, including offering the first Harry Potter eBook and audiobook for free.

My husband and I have lost a portion of our income during the stay-at-home orders, but luckily we kept enough of it to cover our monthly expenses. We are some of the lucky few who can decide what to do with our stimulus checks. 
We know many people have to use it to dig their way out of the total loss of their income. Many others will need to use it to try and catch up on rent or car payments, or to put groceries on the table. 
Our stimulus checks haven't even hit our bank account yet, and already I've signed up for counseling with an online service. Getting therapy is the best use of that money that I could imagine. 
LoadingSomething is loading.
I have never gone so long worrying about my husband every time he touches his face, takes out the trash, goes to the garage in our condo to sort the recycling. Every time he leaves the safe bubble of our little condo, I  prepare myself with Clorox wipes to wipe down the doorknobs, his keys, and anything he touches before washing his hands. 
I am like a drill sergeant barking orders, "Don't touch that! Wash your hands for 20 seconds! Leave your mask on until your hands are clean! Take off your shoes!" He knows I am highly anxious, and he responds to all of my commands, but he looks exhausted. 
I need someone to walk me through the changes we are experiencing. I need someone to help me replace some of the fear and anxiety I feel with calm and acceptance. This situation is new. I can't Google the best way to handle a pandemic. And although the market is wide open for it, I haven't seen any self-help books on how to adjust or thrive during the biggest disruption of our lifetimes. 
And it isn't only what we are going through now. It is also about all that is coming. How do I adjust my fear when my husband goes back to his office? How do I accept brunch or dinner invitations at restaurants with friends? How do I resume my afternoon coffee break with my neighbor? Will I ever love and trust grocery shopping again? Will getting the mail ever be something that I look forward to instead of avoiding? 
The virus has brought with it so many questions. How do I carry the grief? I have lost people I know. People I love have lost their parents. Family members have loved ones who are sick. There is no way to visit the sick or dying. My childhood friend's mother died alone without the touch or comfort of her children. It is so much to process and work through, and we aren't alone. We need to comfort those in our inner circle who are also struggling with their own grief, stress, loss of income, etc. 
From the beginning of this pandemic, we have had to rely on people. We have taken our cues from scientists, cheered their research efforts toward a cure or vaccination. We have honored and tried to take care of our doctors, nurses, paramedics, grocery clerks, drivers, trash collectors, and all those people who are making a significant contribution to all of our lives. We have even had to count on our neighbors to stay home, to wear masks, to protect each other. 
It is no surprise that with my stimulus money, I am once again turning to a human being to help me get through the most challenging and swiftly changing time of my life. I'm hoping to learn coping mechanisms for now and into the future. The money will be well spent.

From the beginning of this pandemic, we have had to rely on people. We have taken our cues from scientists, cheered their research efforts toward a cure or vaccination. We have honored and tried to take care of our doctors, nurses, paramedics, grocery clerks, drivers, trash collectors, and all those people who are making a significant contribution to all of our lives. We have even had to count on our neighbors to stay home, to wear masks, to protect each other.
It is no surprise that with my stimulus money, I am once again turning to a human being to help me get through the most challenging and swiftly changing time of my life. I’m hoping to learn coping mechanisms for now and into the future. The money will be well spent.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Carell will return to TV comedy with "Space Force," which debuts this month on Netflix. It's among the most anticipated new shows of the month.  
Every month, Business Insider runs down the five most anticipated new shows using data from television-tracking app TV Time, derived from its millions of users around the world who use the app to track and react to what they're watching.
May also sees the premiere of DC's "Stargirl," which will stream on DC Universe and air on the CW network the next day, and TNT's "Snowpiercer," which is based on "Parasite" director Bong Joon-ho's 2013 sci-fi thriller of the same name.
Below are the five most anticipated new shows of May: 
Description: "From Greg Daniels (The Office, Parks and Recreation) comes Upload, a new sci-fi comedy. In the near future, people who are near death can be 'uploaded' into virtual reality environments. Cash-strapped Nora works customer service for the luxurious 'Lakeview' digital afterlife. When party-boy/coder Nathan's car crashes, his girlfriend uploads him into Nora's VR world."
Description: "A four-star general begrudgingly teams up with an eccentric scientist to get the U.S. military's newest agency — Space Force — ready for lift-off."
Description: "In post-World War II Hollywood, an ambitious group of aspiring actors and filmmakers will do almost anything to make their showbiz dreams come true."
Description: "Set more than seven years after the world has become a frozen wasteland, Snowpiercer centers on the remnants of humanity who inhabit a perpetually moving train, with 1001 cars, that circles the globe. Class warfare, social injustice and the politics of survival play out in this riveting television adaptation based on the critically acclaimed graphic novel series and film of the same name."
Description: "DC's Stargirl follows high school sophomore Courtney Whitmore as she inspires an unlikely group of young heroes to stop the villains of the past. This new drama reimagines DC's Stargirl and the very first superhero team, the Justice Society of America, in an unpredictable series. "
Disclosure: Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, is a Netflix board member.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Beckham has shared a heartwarming video montage to celebrate her husband David's 45th birthday today.
The fashion designer, 46, shared the clip this morning showing nostalgic unseen videos and pictures, and had The Doobie Brothers hit Long Train Runnin' playing in the background.
A clip also shows son Brooklyn, 21, surprising his dad for his 43rd birthday.
She also shared a snap in a separate post of the pair walking Rottweilers Snoop and Puffy in Manchester 23 years ago.
The former Spice Girl Victoria captioned her post: "Happy birthday @DavidBeckhamx Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago."
David was also seen in a video with his family walking through Disneyland Florida wearing Mickey Mouse ears on over his black baseball cap.
Cruz and Romeo were also shown playing guitars when they were children.
Another snap shows the Beckham family sat on the front row at one of her fashion shows.
The family were also seen in a throwback pic when they were at the Grand Canyon in the US.
She captioned her sweet montage: "Happy bday to the best daddy. Celebrating in lockdown and missing @brooklynbeckham and all our friends and family today. We all love you so much xxx', she captioned the post."
Many fans rushed to the comments section to send David well wishes.
One wrote: "Many happy returns to the most wonderful David!"
Victoria also shared a picture of a bacon and egg sandwich on her Instagram stories with "love" written in tomato ketchup, which was captioned "happy birthday David Beckham".
This week Victoria reversed her decision to furlough 30 employees at her fashion company after coming under immense criticism.
The entrepreneur, who has a combined fortune of £335 million with husband David, opted to use the government bail out scheme and use tax-payers' money to pay 80% of her staff's wages while they are at home.
However, Posh has now undergone a change of heart after being 'devastated' by the public reaction.
Her fashion brand had earlier sent letters to staff warning them that they were going to be furloughed under the Government's scheme for two months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Victoria Beckham pays sweet birthday tribute to husband David with adorable family video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VICTORIA Beckham paid a sweet birthday tribute to husband David today as he celebrates turning 45.
The designer put together an adorable family video montage on Instagram featuring loads of cute Beckham moments.
Giving a detailed glimpse into their life over the years, David could be seen being affectionate with his wife as well as being a doting dad to their four kids.
Victoria's first snap was a throwback of the pair walking their dogs Snoop and Puffy in Manchester in 1997.
She wrote: "Happy birthday @davidbeckham x Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago. Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much x
The video collection followed with a bittersweet caption about how they were missing eldest son Brooklyn, family and friends in lockdown.
On her Instagram stories, Victoria shared a picture of David's birthday breakfast: a bacon and egg sarnie with ketchup.
His presents were covered in wrapping paper with his face on for an extra personal touch.
David's kids also wished him well, with Romeo writing: ""Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day ♥️sorry for being officially taller than you now 😂♥️."
While Cruz posted: "Dad, I love you so much happy birthday have a great day ❤️❤️❤️."
The tribute comes a day after Victoria made a U-turn - and pledged to reverse her decision to furlough staff.
The star has decided against a government bail-out following a furious backlash from the public.
News of her change of heart comes after the Sun on Sunday revealed the 46-year-old designer’s company was using Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s scheme to furlough 25 members of staff - despite being boasting a family worth of £335million.
A source added: “Victoria is devastated about the backlash she’s faced.
“The original decision to furlough wasn’t actually hers - it was more a board thing, and she was persuaded that it was the right thing to do. Obviously she now realises this is wrong.
“Victoria realises she still has some way to go when it comes to endearing herself again with the great British public, but she is going to use her position and influence to start giving more back.”
The former Spice Girl, married to ex-England captain David, has had a relatively rough few months.
Her business empire has taken numerous hits, and in November it emerged the company had recorded losses of over £12million.
She has also made dramatic cuts to the business empire, slashing her own salary and even losing the use of her chauffeur.
Since its formation in 2008, it has made losses of around £35million - despite boasting celebrity fans including Michelle Obama, Cara Delevingne, Jennifer Lopez and Meghan Markle.
And after news of her decision to furlough staff emerged - albeit on an ‘enhanced package’ - social media was flooded with scathing comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Diana 'tried to kill herself four times', new documentary claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new documentary will claim Princess Diana attempted to kill herself four times and it could be aired on Netflix.
The four-parter - titled 'Being Me: Diana' - will air the struggles of the beloved royal and lay bare her mental health battles and eating disorders.
It will tell all about Diana’s troubled childhood right the way through to her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles.
It is at that point in her life where she tried to to take her own life, the show is set to claim.
The series will also reveal never-before-seen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92. It will make difficult viewing for Prince William and Harry, 23 years on from their mother's death in Paris.
DSP, the TV company behind ITV’s Torvill and Dean, are behind the controversial project, according to The Sun.
It has not yet been officially commissioned by Netflix but filming is already said to have started, sources suggest.
Mirror Online have approached Netflix for comment.
And it will especially be a blow to Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, who are said to be in talks with the streaming giant over future projects.
Harry also worked with Netflix on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special shown only this week.
A TV source told The Sun: “The royals have all refused to take part as have the Spencer family (Diana’s family).
“William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.”
Harry and Meghan are currently looking into new commercial projects as they settle down in Los Angeles, California after quitting as senior royals.
Meghan has already bagged herself a role narrating a Disney documentary, with the couple reportedly hiring an agent to bag them more big roles.
The couple and their baby son Archie are now living a financially independent life after their decisions to step down from the Royal Family means no more taxpayer funds or HRH titles.
Mirror Online has contacted Netflix for a comment.

Netflix has not yet commissioned the programme but TV company DSP has apparently started preparing the project.
Being Me: Diana will also feature claims that the late princess tried to take her own life four times, according to The Sun.
It will also reportedly include unseen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92 and interviews with people close to her.
According to a TV source, quoted in the tabloid, none of her family will take part.
They said: "The royals will refuse to take part as will the Spencer family.
"William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good."
A spokeswoman for Endemol Shine, the parent company for DSP, said: "This is a not a commissioned show and everything within the treatment is already in the public domain."
Harry collaborated with the TV streaming service on a Thomas the Tank Engine 75th anniversary special.

Harry recorded a special message for the show recalling his fond memories of watching the iconic series.
He said: "Thomas the Tank Engine has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years - entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters.
"I certainly have fond memories of growing up with Thomas & Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.
"Very proud to have been asked to take part in this special episode. I wish Thomas & Friends a very happy anniversary."
Prince Harry even carried a Thomas the Tank Engine bag on his first day at nursery school!
He and Meghan are reportedly in talks with Netflix over future projects.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princes William and Harry will be 'very upset and angry' over controversial new documentary series which is set to claim Princess Diana tried to kill herself four times</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princes William and Harry are set to be 'very upset and angry' over a controversial new documentary which will claim that Princess Diana tried to kill herself four times.
According to The Sun, a four-part series provisionally called 'Being Me: Diana' will delve into the mental torment the late royal suffered - from battling eating disorders to her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles and painful childhood.
It will use unseen footage from Diana's speeches filmed before the Princess of Wales' death in 1997, as well as interviews with people who were close to her to shed light on her inner turmoil shortly before her split from Charles in 1992.  
The series is being made by TV company DSP, which was behind 127 Hours and ITV's Torvill And Dean. The project is planned for Netflix but has not yet been commissioned. 
It's set to be particularly upsetting for Harry, who worked with the streaming service on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special after he and Meghan Markle stepped down as senior royals earlier this year. 
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are also believed to be in talks with Netflix about other future projects. 
A TV source told the publication that The Firm will refuse to take part in the documentary series, as will the Spencer family. 
'William and Harry will be very upset and angry', they added. 'It's particularly distressing for Harry because he's been working with Netflix.
'At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.'  
A spokeswoman for Endemol Shine, the parent company for DSP, told The Sun: 'This is a not a commissioned show and everything within the treatment is already in the public domain.'
Charles and Diana tied the knot at St Paul's Cathedral in front of 2,000 people on July 29, 1981.
In 1992, Prime Minster John Major announced the couple were to separate, but continue living together at Kensington Palace.
They divorced in 1996 and a year later Diana died in a car crash in Paris. In 2005 Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles at Windsor Guildhall.
In video footage released late last month, the Duke of Sussex introduced a new program for Netflix called 'Thomas and Friends: The Royal Engine', which features his father and grandmother, Prince Charles and the Queen, as animated characters.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman confirmed the project had been in the pipeline for a 'long time' and added that 'everybody was aware' of it before it aired, including the Queen.  
The episode was recorded before Harry and wife Meghan quit as senior royals and moved to America. 
Proceeds from the anniversary edition, which aired in the US one day before the UK, are being donated to environment and sustainability projects under Harry's Travalyst project. 
In his introduction, Prince Harry is seen sitting in an armchair, reading from a book about the train's adventures. 
The 35-year-old, who is now living in Los Angeles, said: 'Thomas the Tank Engine has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years - entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters.
'I certainly have fond memories of growing up with Thomas & Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.
'I am very proud to have been asked to take part in this special episode. I wish Thomas and Friends a very happy anniversary.' 
Meghan has carried out similar work in the wake of seeking financial independence and moving to the US, narrating the Disney+ documentary Elephant which started streaming on April 3, three days after she and Harry officially quit royal life. She too donated proceeds from the project to charity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Globe wins eight National Newspaper Awards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Globe and Mail won eight of the 21 categories at the 71st National Newspaper Awards, garnering recognition for journalism that uncovered the SNC-Lavalin affair and broke news on the manhunt for two teen murder suspects who fled British Columbia to the wilds of Manitoba. Its coverage of Canada’s huge data gaps and a meditation on art and climate change were also lauded.
Geoffrey York, The Globe’s Africa bureau chief based in Johannesburg, was one of just two journalists to take home a pair of awards at Friday’s digital-only event, which was streamed from Toronto.
Mr. York won the Norman Webster Award for International Reporting with his stories detailing the realities of life in the heavily militarized dictatorship of Sudan. He, Matthew McClearn and Stephanie Nolen won the Business category for their in-depth investigation into the lending practices and other activities of Export Development Canada in South Africa and Colombia.
Other Globe winners included Kelly Grant, who received the E. Cora Hind Award for Beat Reporting with her extensive coverage of pharmacare and medically assisted dying. Robert Fife, Steven Chase, Sean Fine and Daniel Leblanc were honoured with the John Wesley Dafoe Award for Politics, a recognition of The Globe’s role in breaking the story of the attempt of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office to put pressure on then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.
The Globe also won Project of the Year for its year-long examination of key gaps in the way data are gathered and analyzed across the country and how this system is so fragmented.
Globe editor-in-chief David Walmsley said: “Brave, independent journalism has never been more important than now. And winning these awards helps us to showcase the standards of excellence that we hold ourselves to."
The Globe received 19 nominations and won eight of those categories at this year’s awards, the most of any outlet. La Presse and the Ottawa Citizen each won three, with Le Devoir and the Toronto Star each winning two.
Renata D’Aliesio, Melissa Tait, Ian Bailey and Andrea Woo won the Breaking News category for their coverage of the Western Canadian manhunt for two Port Alberni, B.C., teenagers accused of killing three people on the highways of northern British Columbia.
The Globe’s Marsha Lederman, who is based in the B.C. bureau, won the Arts and Entertainment Winner award for her in-depth examination of art and climate change as well as a feature about Margaret Atwood’s feverish activity after the death of her life partner.
Caroline Alphonso won the Bob Levin Award for Short Feature – named for The Globe editor who died last year – for her story about a special school where children battling debilitating illnesses can keep up with their studies.
Randy Richmond of the London Free Press was named Journalist of the Year and also won the Local Reporting category for his series exposing how a local police officer assaulted a woman and then had his force mislead the public about the incident. He was also nominated for the George Brown Award for Investigations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amy Childs confirms new romance with boyfriend Tim and says 'he's the right one'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reality TV favourite Amy Childs has gushed about her new romance with boyfriend Tim.
The former The Only Way Is Essex star, 29, has confirmed her new romantic relationship with businessman Tim.
Amy has taken to social media to praise her new partner and it seems she has finally found the right guy, despite her previous attempts for romance on Celebs Go Dating.
Sharing an adorable selfie of the glamorous pair on her Instagram, Amy had happy news for her followers.
She captioned the image: "When you finally meet the right one for you, it suddenly becomes clear why everyone else was so wrong...️"
Amy concluded with the simple message to Tim: "I love you."
The pair are currently in lockdown together at their home in Essex as the UK deals with social distancing measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The pair have been rather quiet on their romance until now, but have been seen in images on Tim's Instagram page since last year.
Sharing an image of the couple in December, Tim captioned a glamorous picture of the pair: "With this little sort last night."
Back in February before the lockdown procedures kicked in, they enjoyed a weekend away together.
Showing an image from a romantic dinner table date, Tim wrote: "Perfect weekend away with the mrs."
To this Amy commented: "Perfect xxx".
Since the lockdown began in March, the couple has been at home with Amy's two children, three-year-old daughter Polly and 19-month-old son Rich.
Amy had Polly with her ex Bradley Wright, while Rich is the son of her ex, businessman Ritchie.
Despite having the children to look after, Amy and Tim are making the most of their time together.
Sharing an image of himself with a drink in a hot tub on Tim's Instagram account, he wrote: "Isolation isn't that bad after all! Quality time with my girl."
We're just glad to see things are looking so good for Amy in the romance stakes at last!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amy Childs shares emotional love letter to new man Tim as she posts shot of him for the first time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REALITY TV star Amy Childs has confirmed she’s officially loved-up with new man Tim after she posted an emotional love letter to the hunk.
It’s the first time she has shared a photo of them together, and indeed him, after months of keeping quiet on her love life.
However it seems like Amy, 29, is very happy with her new man and couldn’t resist sharing a sweet tribute to him.
Posting a gorgeous snap of them on Instagram, the Essex star wrote: “When you finally meet the right one for you, it suddenly becomes clear why everyone else was so wrong .... ❤️ I love you”
Underneath the heartfelt declaration, boyfriend Tim replied: “Love you”.
Amy’s friends and followers were quick to heap praise on the couple, with Demi Sims writing: “So cute” and her cousin Harry Derbidge posting a series of love hearts in the comments.
Meanwhile one fan wrote: “You deserve so much happiness!!”
And a second added: “So happy for you hun xxxx”
While a third referenced her dating disaster on Celebs Go Dating, writing: “Jamie who…happy for you x”
Fans of the celebrity dating show were thrilled when it looked like Amy had met a keeper in hunky roofer Jamie, even going so far as meeting her family and children.
However, his true feelings came clear when he went on to snog another girl while on the freebie trip to the Dominican Republic.
Since the shambolic TV dating experience, she's been getting cosy with new man, Tim – and it’s clear she’s smitten.
Friends of the mum-of-two have said she’s "very excited" by her new flame.
An insider told New! magazine: "It's early days but Amy is very excited about Tim.
"We heard she went on a few dates with him last year but it wasn't the right time and it fizzled out.
"But they are back in touch and things are going really well."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent: Fans have fallen in love with 96-year-old legend Nora</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent fans have all fallen in love with 96-year-old Nora, who stormed her way to four yeses with a beautiful song accompanied by her daughter.
To be honest, what a legend.
Nora was joined on stage by her daughter Pam, who played along on the piano.
And to be say she was a revelation would be a bit of an understatement, with Nora gaining a new legion of fans up and down the nation.
To put it bluntly, we’re all now in love with her.
‘Go on Nora!’ One fan wrote. ’96-years-old and singing like that! What a woman.’
Another enamoured viewer added: ‘This is what it’s all about…go Nora!’
‘Can I adopt Nora?’ Another fan asked. And no, no you can’t, because she is a 96-year-old woman, sorry!
But the good news is is that Nora (and Pam!) stormed through to the next round, so we only have to wait to see what bop she’ll sing next time.
Maybe a bit of Ariana Grande if we’re lucky?
Tonight’s BGT also introduced us to mother and daughter duo Honey and Sammy, who only went and became Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer act.
Needless to say, everyone was in buckets of tears, as were we.
The only question remaining is…when will Nora drop her mixtape?
Britain’s Got Talent airs Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Did Jill Scott, 48, date Drake, 33, back in the day? That’s the question that was on many fans’ minds after the singer admitted the rapper used to be “a wiggle in my giggle” in her latest congratulatory post to him, which she wrote in the caption for two pics she posted, including one of that showed the cover of one of his new releases and a throwback that showed them smiling and posing together. “Back when Drake was the wiggle in my giggle-white Lamborghini, Maserati @champagnepapi ❤️Respect and congratulations Doc,” the caption read.
It didn’t take long for fans to start speculating about what exactly Jill meant with her cheeky message and many of them seemed to think it mean the two had previously been more than friends. “Jill put that mic work on him😩,” one follower wrote while another wrote “😍 SUGA MAMA VIBES 🙌🏽.” “I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in that statement 🤔,” another replied. “Yo wiggle to yo giggle what?” asked a fourth and another said “Drake definitely wanted her mic skills.”
Although Jill didn’t elaborate further on what exactly she meant with her caption, it’s clear to see that she’s super thrilled for the “Hotline Bling” crooner latest music release. The mixed tape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, came out on May 1 and features some of his unreleased songs, songs from SoundCloud, and some new tracks. His next studio album, which he has yet to name, will be released later in the summer of 2020.
We’ll be on the lookout to see if Jill or Drake post anything else that may confirm what exactly she meant. In the meantime, we’ll just enjoy Drake’s new tunes!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We made it through to May (not that anyone is checking their calendars these days), and it’s usually about now that the E3 hype train starts to build up a head of steam. Obviously that won’t be happening this year, but with Ubisoft announcing Assassin’s Creed Valhalla this week and Microsoft showing off some new games next Thursday, at least we can start getting excited for the next-gen consoles.
And there’s your monthly dose of free games for subscribing to online services:
There was quite some variation in the scores this week as you can see below:
And Steve had a look at a cheap and cheerful gaming headset:
PDP LVL50 Wired Gaming Headset– 7/10
It was a quiet week for the previews – I guess it’s trickier without devs being able to host preview events – so we just had Dom taking at look at Octopath Traveller on Stadia. For a game that was previously a Switch and then PC exclusive, opening up now on Stadia “might even be the best place to play it”.
Other than that, What We Played featured Gears Tactics, Final Fantasy VII Remake & Streets of Rage 4.

    <h5 class="mb-1">One Of The Best Games This Generation Is Free On PS4, But Not Forever</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Generally speaking, if someone gets a PS4 or an Xbox One, I tell them to get Hitman. Sometimes I tell them to get Hitman 2, but the basic gist is the same: these are some of the best games out this generation full-stop, fascinating board games of intrigue, death and perfectly-tailored pants. Hitman is free on PS4 right now, and you should really go play it.
You don’t have forever to play, however. The game is only free this weekend, until May 3. Afterwards, however, it’s not exactly expensive: Hitman: Game of the Year Edition is only $9, and Hitman 2 is only $18. Both are eminently worth it.
The idea is this: you are Agent 47, a genetically-engineered assassin tasked with infiltrating the enclaves of the ultra-rich, from a high-end resort in Bangkok to a fashion show in a Parisian mansion. You’re welcome in parts of each level, but not the whole thing: to get to where you need to be you’ll need a wealth of tricks, disguises and stealth. The goal is sort of what you make it, but ultimately you want to eliminate a series of targets with as little attention but as much fanfare as possible. Each level comes with a range of scenarios ranging from the straightforward to the outlandish, giving 47 a chance to expose his targets and kill them in poetic ways.
For example: a fashion icon uses models as agents to steal international secrets that she then sells. Find the model on his cell phone, knock him out, take his clothes and get your makeup done to look like his. Use your new look to lure the target into a one-on-one meeting. Poison her drink for the celebratory toast, or just garrote her as soon as she closes the door.
Or, if you want: set off some fireworks to lure both her and her partner out to admire. Push her off the balcony onto your first target, eliminating both. Things are wacky that way.
Each level of Hitman is an intricate machine of interlocking characters and systems just waiting to be thrown into chaos. It’s one the most engrossing series I’ve played in years, and now you can give it a shot for free.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How have you been getting on with Animal Crossing: New Horizon's recent nerfs and new events?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still very young, but it's already been through a series of ups and downs.
After folks started to hit the "endgame," some of the creamy faults started to rise to the top. That said, Nintendo has made it very clear that this is a live service game, and advancements will come over time: most notably, the recent addition of Leif and Redd.
On the flipside, those changes can be contentious. Nintendo recently nerfed monthly interest gains in a bid to defeat time-traveling players. Tarantulas, which I've seen a whopping two of total in all of my time with the game, also got a nerfed spawn rate.
As I noted earlier this week, I've "completed the game" and unlocked terraforming, and like most things New Horizons related, it's gotten a mixed reception in my household. I was under the misguided assumption that it would function a lot like the in-game house editor tool, which conveniently allows players to arrange items in a top-down fashion, with a grid to show exactly where items are placed, to boot.
Terraforming has none of those things, so my dreams of being able to remodel my island with any sort of realistic timeline have been dashed. To make matters worse, I don't get the opportunity to play very much at night, when a lot of the New Horizons magic happens, so I haven't experienced a few of the stingiest events like meteor showers. It's frustrating.
That said, I still enjoy New Horizons. I might not be playing it nearly as often as I'd like to (I hope some of the aforementioned issues are going to be fixed eventually, and let us craft multiple items and craft from storage, Nintendo!), but I am still playing. The little May Day puzzle was a brief bit of fun! I hope we get more of that sort of stuff. I also really love the new art wing in the museum: Blathers is probably my favorite Animal Crossing character in this iteraiton.
My time with New Horizons has been confusing, but what about you?

    <h5 class="mb-1">This ‘Star Wars’ Day, here’s a look at all the spin-offs, movies, and TV series coming up in the franchise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many things are on May 4 with the lockdown across India being lifted gradually — but most important of all is that Disney+ Hotstar is being kind enough to stream JJ Abrams’ The Rise of Skywalker two months ahead of schedule! What better way of celebrating Star Wars Day (May the Fourth Be With You) than by watching the polarising, concluding episode of the epic saga?
In December 2019 when The Rise of Skywalker came out, expectations were sort of high thanks to the super success of the Abrams-helmed The Force Awakens (2015). Nine films to tell the story of one family seems a bit of an overkill, but The Rise of Skywalker is nowhere near the end of the story of the galaxy far, far away.
Quick recap — Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) that began it all was episode IV in the saga. It introduced farm boy-turned-Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), donut hair and all, and the piratical captain of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (Harrison Ford). The trio were fighting the evil empire led by Darth Vader. A New Hope was followed by The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Return of the Jedi (1983).
Then came the execrable prequel trilogy of The Phantom Menace (1999), The Attack of the Clones (2002) and The Revenge of the Sith (2005), which told the story of how Anakin Skywalker turned into the breathing-compromised (uh oh) Darth Vader.
In 2012, The Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm and took charge of the sequel trilogy, which kicked off with The Force Awakens. Taking place 30 years after the battle of Endor, the movie was loved by critics and fans alike. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi (2017) went off in new directions and angered everyone. Abrams was bought back for Rise of Skywalker but unfortunately all that fans loved in The Force Awakens just got terribly annoying — bringing Palpatine back was the final straw.
There were two spin offs — Gareth Edwards’ well-received Rogue One (2016), which focuses on how the rebels got the Death Star plans and the not-so well-received Han Solo origin story, Solo (2018), directed by Ron Howard. While The Rise of Skywalker signals the end of the sequel trilogy, there is plenty more for Star Wars fans in the offing.
There are two trilogies being planned — one based on the game, Knights of the Old Republic, with Laeta Kalogridis (Alita: Battle Angel) doing the writing honours and the other based on the book series, The High Republic, set 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss were attached to a new Star Wars trilogy but they walked away from Disney for a nine-figure deal with Netflix.
Marvel mandarin Kevin Feige is developing a Star Wars movie, as is Rian Johnson—he probably would be able to squeeze it in between the further adventures of the oddly-accented Benoit Blanc. There are also rumours of spin-offs for Kylo Ren and Rey.
While the movies set to release in alternate years from December 2022 are all very well, we find the proposed series way more exciting. First up is Jon Favreau’s excellent The Mandalorian. Season 2 is coming out in October 2020 and Favreau is already working on Season 3.
There is also an Obi-Wan Kenobi series with Ewan McGregor reprising his role as the Jedi master, directed by Deborah Chow. Set eight years after The Revenge of the Sith and 11 years before A New Hope, the series with six one-hour episodes will feature a young Luke Skywalker.
A Rogue One spin off-series is scheduled for a 2021 release. Said to be a spy thriller, the show will tell the story of Cassian Andor (Diego Luna reprises his role). There is also news of Russian Doll’s Leslye Headland being showrunner for a female-centric series — Rey or Cara Dune? Neither, because it is supposed to “take place in a different part of the Star Wars timeline”. That is the good thing about having a galaxy as your sandbox.

In celebration of Star Wars Day (and because we're all stuck inside), Disney is releasingThe Rise of Skywalker on Disney+ two months early. Instead of hitting the streaming platform in the middle of summer, the finale of the Skywalker Saga arrives on May the 4th.
Whether you loved it, hated it, or never got to see it, the release of The Rise of Skywalker is sure to put many in the mood to watch more Star Wars films. Now that (nearly) all the movies and shows are in one place, it's never been easier to sit down and marathon the whole series. (As of this writing, Solo is only available to stream on Netflix. It will move to Disney+ on July 9 and join all other Star Wars content.)
Before you press play on the first movie, it's important to decide your preferred viewing order. Do you start with the original trilogy or the prequel movies? What about the standalone films and the television shows? Here is how to watch Star Wars in order, whichever order you choose.
If you're looking for even more Star Wars goodness to celebrate May the 4th, consider some of the best video games from a galaxy far, far away.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mandalorian’s Beskar Steel Has An Earthly Counterpart In Wootz Steel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the biggest Disney fan, I have long awaited the arrival of Disney+. Along with classic musicals and historic animated shorts, the platform also contains some of the biggest franchises around, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and of course the entire Star Wars back catalog. Launched on 24th March 2020, coinciding nicely with the start of the UK’s COVID-19 ‘lockdown’, the first thing I devoured was The Mandalorian, and with it, every Baby Yoda meme I could get my hands on.
The Mandalorian is a new series set in the Star Wars universe, five years after the end of the original (and let’s just say it, best) trilogy, and two and a half decades before the latest and final trilogy of the Skywalker saga started with The Force Awakens. Din Djarin is a bounty hunter from the planet Mandalore, sporting a uniform we have seen on Boba Fett. Although they shared a job description, Fett Junior was not technically a Mandalorian. Instead, he is a clone of Jango Fett, and did not grow up on Mandalore, confirming that the way of the Mandalorian is a culture, a way of living, and not a species, race or religion. The series explores this culture in greater detail, with the famous armor playing a major role.
In The Mandalorian, Djarin is paid for missions in bars of Beskar steel. This sacred material is used to make a Mandalorian’s armor, which is crafted by expert armorers that know how to work this material. Are there any parallels to materials that we know of in a galaxy closer to home? Let’s take a closer look at the material properties of Beskar steel.
Beskar steel is handled as cast ingots. The dull, slate gray bars of Beskar steel have wavey ridges and patterns on the surface, and are stamped with the Imperial shield of Palpatine’s empire. Armor made of Beskar is highly sought after as it is an extremely robust material, able to withstand blaster shots and lightsaber strikes. It must therefore also be light enough to be worn for prolonged periods of time. We know that the material can be melted in a hot furnace and cast into shapes. It can be worked with heat and hammering. It is malleable enough in a thin, heated form to be shaped into panels, which make it a perfect choice for armor.
Plate armor made of panels has been used for thousands of years, though the full suit of armor dates back to the Late Middle Ages. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, was commonly used as it can be easily forged, hammered, shaped and cut. It is also stronger than iron, owing to the fact that the carbon ‘impurities’ in the steel prevent the iron atoms from sliding past one another, giving rise to a tougher, less brittle material. Beskar certainly seems to have similar properties, and so we can presume that it is a metal, and indeed a form of steel as its name suggests.
Armor needs to be light, but also strong. Sadly not enough research has been conducted on lightsabers here on Earth, so it is hard to vouch for the resistance regular steel would have against such a space sword, however it is possible to engineer steel to be reasonably blaster-proof. For example, stainless steel, an alloy of iron, carbon and some chromium, cannot catch fire easily - handy for us here on Earth, given that we cook food inside stainless steel vessels. It can therefore be presumed that Beskar steel would also be able to withstand blaster fire, especially as they tend to emit cooler yellow flames.
The biggest clue as to whether there is a material analogous to Beskar steel here on Earth is the patterning on each ingot. These waves and ridges of alternating light and dark colours are a trademark of a real material that is known for its strong, light properties, just like Beskar steel. Wootz steel is a high-carbon content steel originating from south India and Sri Lanka. It is formed by heating iron ore to a high temperature in the presence of carbon-containing plants such as bamboo. The resultant smoky fire ensures a high content of iron carbide in the steel formed this way. Though iron carbide is a brittle substance, when incorporated into the bulk of the steel, it ensures that blades made of Wootz steel remain sharp. The burnt bamboo and other plant matter also imparts a little nanotechnology into the mix, ensuring that this steel is stronger and lighter than any other.
Tiny nanoscopic carbon structures, such as straw-like carbon nanotubes and football-shaped fullerenes, are created in sooty fires. These nanostructures are very strong, but also incredibly light. When embedded within the steel, they make the steel even stronger, reducing the brittle nature of the steel even further, without adding any bulk.
Wootz steel ingots were also used to make Damascus steel blades, which were said to be so strong, they would never shatter. Crucially however, Damascus steel and Wootz steel both display very similar wavy patterns to Beskar steel. In Wootz and Damascus steel, these patterns are formed by folding and working the steel, so that iron carbide layers line up, creating intricate patterns. These patterns were historically somewhat of a trademark, though modern techniques now allow metallurgists to create a range of bespoke and intricate designs.
Although the events of the Star Wars universe took place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the science does seem to confirm that a form of Beskar steel exists in our time too. Now, if someone could hurry up with those lightsabers, it really would make my lockdown gardening so much easier...

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keith Lemon has confirmed that Holly Willoughby's final episode of Celebrity Juice has already been filmed.
Holly announced she had quit the ITV2 series after 12 years on Sunday, leaving viewers gutted.
She follows former co-stars Fearne Cotton and Rufus Hound who have also left in recent years, while Keith is the only original cast member remaining.
Keith took to social media to say goodbye to his close friend after her decision was made public.
He wrote: "I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day. Goodbye @hollywills x."
Now, he appears to have confirmed that Holly's final Celebrity Juice has been filmed.
The show has been recorded differently this series due to the coronavirus lockdown, and studio filmed episodes halting in March.
The team including new panellist Mel B all returned and filmed the show from their homes to meet social distancing rules, and the last episodes of the series are filmed in the same way.
As fans took to Twitter to share their sadness, many asked Keith about whether there would be a goodbye show for Holly.
One viewer told him directly: "Keith we need a goodbye show..best bits...cakie..ect ect ect..x."
Keith replied, confirming it was already filmed - while later tweeting to another fan that there weren't many episodes left in the current series.
He said: "Filmed it already. Shame it was whilst lockdown was happening. No hugs."
Keith later tweeted: "One more juice next week then a comp show then that’s it."
While many viewers fear this is the end of the show, Keith appeared to suggest otherwise as he continued to tweet as though the show will go on without Holly - amid speculation Michelle Keegan may replace her.
Keith was also forced to remind people Holly was quitting the show and not TV in general, while Holly herself revealed she would return for appearances on the series.
He said: "Don’t worry you’ll get more Holly. She isn’t stopping telly Just not on celeb juice anymore. Sad times."
Meanwhile, Holly revealed: "I'll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check... if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart."
Celebrity Juice continues on Thursday at 10pm on ITV2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's heartfelt message as she quits Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby's paid an emotional tribute to her co-stars and fans as she quit Celebrity Juice.
The This Morning star has been a team captain on the ITV2 show - which is fronted by Keith Lemon - since it started more than 12 years ago.
Holly, 39, said in her announcement on Instagram that "all good things must come to an end" and that "nothing lasts for ever."
Alongside a collage of photos from her time on the panel show, she wrote to her 6.6m followers: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos...
"I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences."
The mum-of-three goes on to say: "It's never felt like work and always been to me like a night out... Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever...
"It's time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person... whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest... @keithlemon ..."
Paying tribute to the show's host she continued: "Where to begin... I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’... my goodness me it did... three friends, you me and @fearnecotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship... I love the bones of you Lemon!
"Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years... I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check...
"If I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart...," she ended the post in a nod to Keith's show phrase.
Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series back in 2018.
Keith responded to the post: "I’m in tears x"
And fans are gutted she's leaving the chaotic show too.
"Won't be the same without you Holly," one said.
Another commented: "Always loved the show! Not been the same without Fearne and will be even worse without you Holly."
"Noooooooooooooooo this can’t be won’t be the same," echoed a third.
Keith had already paid tribute to Holly before her announcement with a rather sweary video clip that he shared on Instagram.
In the short clip, Keith is seen reacting in shock as Holly screamed “F***!” at the camera.
He captioned the video: "Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.
"A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at. Don't look into her eyes though, cos she can make you do anything. What a lady!"
He added: "The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of... well me I guess."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby confirms she's leaving Celebrity Juice in moving tribute</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has confirmed the news we have been dreading, that she’s leaving Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The 39-year-old currently appears as a team captain on the show, alongside host Keith Lemon and fellow captain Mel B.
And despite rumours circulating that she had quit, the ITV host has now confirmed the sad news on Instagram with a lengthy post.
Sharing a series of photos of her time on the show fronted by funnyman Keith, Holly began: ‘Thank you Celebrity Juice for 12 years of fantastic chaos… I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone. Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
‘Also a huge thank you to ITV2 for believing in the show in the first place and for all of your support…Over the years the production team has changed, however to anyone lucky enough to have worked on the show, they will know that we really do have the best time, it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out..’
Holly went on to tease who her replacement could be as she continued: ‘Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work… all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever… It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person… whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest…Keith Lemon.
‘Where to begin… I remember starting this journey with you and saying “I think this might work”… my goodness me it did… three friends, you me and Fearne Cotton and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship… I love the bones of you Lemon!
‘Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check… if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after… know you are always in my heart..’
Shortly after Holly’s announcement, Keith shared a hilarious video on social media with the sweetest caption.
‘I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best!
‘I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.
‘Goodbye Holly Willoughby x’
Holly’s departure comes after close pal Fearne Cotton left Celeb Juice in 2018.
Celebrity Juice continues on Thursday, at 10pm, on ITV2.

Last night The Sun exclusively revealed quit the comedy game show after 12 years.
The TV presenter, 39, who has three children with her producer husband Dan Baldwin, 45, wants to spend more time with her family.
Holly told the ITV2 show’s producers about her decision last week after filming several lockdown editions with host Leigh Francis, 47.
Since launching the panel series in 2008 Holly — mum to Harry, ten, Belle, eight, and Chester, five — has become one of the UK’s most successful female TV presenters.
She fronts ITV daytime show This Morning, alongside Phillip Schofield, 58, and filled in for Ant McPartlin, 44, two years ago on I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here.
Holly’s decision to quit Celebrity Juice comes after pal and fellow panellist Fearne Cotton, 38, left the series in 2018 to focus on new projects.
A TV source said: “Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show — it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.
“She’s still the best of pals with Leigh Francis and will continue to support the series.”
Yesterday comic Leigh posted a touching tribute to the star on his alias Keith Lemon’s Instagram page.
He wrote: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in.
“One of the boys but all woman. A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at.
“Don’t look into her eyes though, ’cos she can make you do anything. What a lady! King of the ladies!
“The queen of the milk beasts! The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of . . . well me I guess.
"Super rad! Super nice! My mate!
“I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Holly replied: “Aww . . .  what a lovely thing to say . . .  love you Lemon.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">In pictures: Princess Charlotte celebrates fifth birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Princess Charlotte, daughter of Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton, celebrates her fifth birthday on Saturday – an occasion marked by the release of four new photographs of the young royal.
The pictures shared by the Royal account were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge. The post also shared an adorable caption.
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow.” it read. ” The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area.”
The photographs were taken last month by her mother at the Sandringham Estate in eastern England where the family helped to pack and deliver food parcels for isolated pensioners in the local area.
Last month, Charlotte’s great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth, the world’s oldest and longest-serving monarch, turned 94. However, there was little fanfare to mark that occasion as Britain endures a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak – its worst national crisis since World War Two.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte's birthday: Queen marks it with adorable family snaps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Queen has shared a heartfelt message to Princess Charlotte on her 5th birthday.
The 94-year-old took to Twitter to share a string of snaps of the youngster today. These include one which shows the Monarch cuddling her great-granddaughter.

In another, taken by mum Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, Charlotte poses for a portrait snap which was released by Kensington Palace yesterday.
Alongside the post, it reads: "A very Happy Birthday to Princess Charlotte who is celebrating her 5th birthday today.
"Princess Charlotte is The Queen’s fifth great-grandchild.
"To mark the day @KensingtonRoyal have released new photos of Princess Charlotte taken by The Duchess of Cambridge."
Fans were quick to gush over the photos, with one writing: "One of the most beautiful pictures."
A second said: "What a beautiful photo of Grandmother and the great grandchildren."
A third commented on the similarities between the young Cambridge and the Queen. They said: "She looks just like Queen Elizabeth...!!"
Another agreed: "Wow, she certainly takes after her great-grandmother!"
The post comes hours after Kensington Royal shared some beautiful pictures of Charlotte to mark the occasion.
In the photos, Charlotte is hard at work doing her bit to help people in need during lockdown.
The caption reads: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday.
"The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area."
Charlotte and her brother, Prince George, are understood to be spending the lockdown with their little brother, Louis.
Mum and dad William and Kate, have been homeschooling them.
According to royal expert Angela Mollard, Kate's mum and dad Carole and Michael Middleton, will be sending a "very special delivery" to the Cambridges' home at Anmer Hall in Norfolk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 'very Happy fifth Birthday' Lottie! The Queen shares a throwback snap with Princess Charlotte as she and Prince Charles share their 'best wishes' with the little royal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Queen and Prince Charles were among the first members of the royal family to share their best wishes with Princess Charlotte as the youngster celebrates her fifth birthday today.
Taking to Instagram today, the Queen's, 93, official account shared several snaps of Her Majesty alongside the little royal, including one alongside Prince Philip taken at Trooping the Colour in 2017 
Meanwhile Prince Charles, 72, also shared his 'best wishes for a very happy birthday' with the five-year-old today, posting a portrait taken by Kate Middleton, 38, to mark the day.
To mark her birthday, Kensington Palace has released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped her parents deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week.
Posting on Instagram today, the Royal Family account shared a series of images to mark the big day, including a photograph of the little royal acting as a flower girl at Princess Eugenie's wedding.
Other images in the series included one of Princess Charlotte with her mother Kate, the Queen and Prince Philip, 98, during Trooping the Colour in 2017.
Another sees the Queen surrounded by her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, with Princess Charlotte taking centre stage on Her Majesty's lap.
The image is just one of a series of photographs that was shot by contributing photographer Leibovitz to mark the Queen's 90th birthday in April 2016. 
Meanwhile Prince Charles' account Clarence House posted just one image of the little royal, the commemorative image taken by the Duchess last week.
They wrote: 'Wishing Princess Charlotte a very Happy Birthday - five today!'
The daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who is currently isolating in Norfolk with her family, is likely to chat over the phone with her great-grandmother The Queen and other loved ones on her special day.
In spite of the extraordinary circumstances around her birthday this year, Kate Middleton and Prince William have reportedly planned a fun day for their daughter's birthday on their Anmer Hall home. 
A source told the Sun: 'The family has arranged a Zoom party for her, so she can speak to family and friends. Then, they have put together a full plan that will give her all the fun of a birthday – including cake and games – despite the extraordinary circumstances we are faced with.' 
'Her great-grandmother will be joining the family call on the big day. As far as Charlotte is concerned, the important part is that her whole family are by her side to say: "Happy Birthday".' 
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate. 
The entire family helped out with a local initiative started by the monarch's staff, who have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and the vulnerable in the area during the lockdown.
After sharing four images of the little royal yesterday, the couple went on to thank fans for their well wishes and released a fifth picture today.
In the new snap, which was taken by Kate as part of the series, the little royal can be seen thoughtfully holding one of the parcels of pasta.
Around 1,000 meals were dispensed in the first week alone, and the scheme has been running for five weeks so far.
This time the Cambridges, all keen cooks, rustled up some home-made pasta which they separated into 12 large bags and tied up with raffia to add to the food parcels. Sources said all the children – even little Louis, two – were involved.
The following day, the family – Charlotte smartly dressed in a black and white checked dress with grey tights and black Mary Jane shoes – then helped to load bags of fresh produce into a van from the Sandringham Visitors' Centre ready for delivery.
Sources say William, Kate, Charlotte and George spent two and a half hours driving around the area delivering food to those in need.
The princess can even be seen in one picture proudly knocking on an elderly resident's door with her goodies, standing on a mat which reads 'Welcome Home, Wipe Your Feet'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte joins parents in charity food deliveries as she turns 5</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New photographs of Princess Charlotte have been released to mark her fifth birthday.
The young royal is seen helping to load a van with food and delivering meals for those in need amid the coronavirus crisis.
Charlotte was volunteering with her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis, ahead of her birthday which she celebrates on Saturday.
The princess is shown in two photographs holding white bags of fresh food for pensioners shielding themselves due to the coronavirus outbreak or other vulnerable people in lockdown in Norfolk.
In another image she knocks on the door of an elderly resident as she holds a bag of fresh pasta which William, Kate and their children spent several hours making the day before the delivery.
Four pictures, taken in April by Kate, have been released and the final photograph is a portrait of her daughter smiling as she looks straight at the camera.
The Cambridges got soaked as they made their rounds, likely to be in the area around their home of Anmer Hall which is on the Queen’s Norfolk estate of Sandringham.
Over the past five weeks, the Queen’s Sandringham staff have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and vulnerable people living in the local area, Buckingham Palace has said.
Around 1,000 meals were made and delivered in the first week alone.
It is not known if William was behind the wheel of the delivery van which was from the Sandringham Visitor Centre.
The birthday girl’s full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
She was born at the private maternity Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London, at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lb 3oz.
Kate is a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society which has regularly released pictures she has taken of George, six, and Louis, two, to mark their birthdays.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have shared adorable new photos of Princess Charlotte to celebrate her fifth birthday.
Kensington Palace uploaded the stunning snaps to their Twitter account on the eve of the toddler Princess’ birthday.
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow,” the Royals wrote.
The never-before-seen images, which were impressively taken by the Duchess herself, were snapped at Sandringham Estate.
Donning a gorgeous black and white gingham dress, the young royal can be seen helping her family pack and deliver food packages to isolated pensioners in Norfolk, England.
Happy Birthday, Charlotte!

    <h5 class="mb-1">In Pictures: Princess Charlotte turns five</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young royal was born on May 2 2015 and is fourth in line to the throne.
Princess Charlotte, known for being one of the feistiest of the Queen’s great-grandchildren, is celebrating turning five.
Charlotte has been seen in recent weeks enthusiastically clapping for carers as the Cambridge family stay at their Anmer Hall mansion in Norfolk during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the past year, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed that her daughter, whom she has been heard referring to by the nickname “Lottie”,  was “pretty good” with spicy food, and also liked olives.
One of Charlotte’s favourite books as a toddler was Julia Donaldson’s classic The Gruffalo, and the princess loves horses, just like her great-grandmother the Queen.
William and Kate’s middle child was born at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lbs 3oz.
Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge made her debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, the same day.
Since her last birthday, Charlotte has joined her family to explore Kate’s Back To Nature garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Prince George and Charlotte took off their shoes and paddled barefoot in the stream during their May excursion, with the princess shouting “Ooh la la” as she waded through the water.
When William asked Charlotte “Will you help George?”, the princess retorted “no” before skipping off.
In June, the Cambridge children gathered with their parents on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour, with Charlotte waving her arms around to greet the crowds.
The fourth in line to the throne also had fun at the King’s Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in July.
She was spotted poking her tongue out during the presentation ceremony after her mother had encouraged her to wave.
The princess’s big day came in September when she started school.
She arrived for her first day with her parents and George, looking a little nervous at first as she fiddled with her pony tail, but excited as she met her headteacher.
The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.
She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.
But the duchess confessed it was “challenging” and admitted she kept her children in class during the Easter holidays to give their days “structure”.
She said it was not all “hardcore” as she found fun activities online and the children had been baking, cooking and pitching tents in the garden.

Since her last birthday, Charlotte has joined her family to explore Kate’s Back To Nature garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Prince George and Charlotte took off their shoes and paddled barefoot in the stream during their May excursion, with the princess shouting “Ooh la la” as she waded through the water.
When William asked Charlotte “Will you help George?”, the princess retorted “no” before skipping off.
In June, the Cambridge children gathered with their parents on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour, with Charlotte waving her arms around to greet the crowds.
The fourth in line to the throne also had fun at the King’s Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in July.
She was spotted poking her tongue out during the presentation ceremony after her mother had encouraged her to wave.
The princess’s big day came in September when she started school.
She arrived for her first day with her parents and George, looking a little nervous at first as she fiddled with her pony tail, but excited as she met her headteacher.
The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.
She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.
But the duchess confessed it was “challenging” and admitted she kept her children in class during the Easter holidays to give their days “structure”.
She said it was not all “hardcore” as she found fun activities online and the children had been baking, cooking and pitching tents in the garden.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.
The video service, owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.
“Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke’s page from their site on Friday.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who claim Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30 million times.
“We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke’s channel,” said CCDH’s chief executive Imran Ahmed.
“However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke’s content (and) need to be removed.”
They asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.
“Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate surprises new parents during video-call to London hospital</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new mum and dad received an unexpected surprise when the Duchess of Cambridge paid them a virtual bedside visit.
Kate said hello during a video call to midwives she had worked with at Kingston Hospital last year.
She chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: ‘My goodness, you must be exhausted.’
She added Max was ‘so sweet’ before congratulating the new mum and dad.
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should ‘reach out and ask for help’ if they need it.
The call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.
During her video chat from her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents have changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
To maintain social distancing, three pairs of midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while another was filmed putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) before taking the laptop in to introduce the duchess to baby Max and his parents.
Ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week which begins on Monday, Kate spoke to a group of experts last week, including Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, and Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
The duchess, who has spent much of her public work highlighting the importance of the early years development of children and parental wellbeing, said to the group: ‘Parents do need to go out and reach out to those who can support them, particularly those who can provide knowledgeable resource as well.
‘It’s important to access and reach out for help when you do need it.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate Middleton Did Another Secret Zoom Call—With a New Mom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bringing a new child into the world can already be an anxiety-ridden experience, but add in a pandemic, and you've reached a whole new level of difficulty. For the U.K.’s Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week, which beings tomorrow, Kate Middleton hopped on Zoom with midwives, health visitors, parents, and leading experts to talk about the impact that the coronavirus crisis has had on families and healthcare workers, per Entertainment Tonight.
During her Zoom call rounds, the Duchess of Cambridge also talked to a new mom and dad in the U.K. after they welcomed their son. The mom, who was still in her hospital bed, spoke with the duchess, who expressed her best wishes to the couple. "Very nice to meet you," Kate said, laughing, as she spoke to the new parents, who sat in their hospital room. "This is definitely a first, I think. Well, firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?"
The camera panned over to the newborn, and Kate said, "He's so sweet. Aww, congratulations."
During the video, Kate also spoke to healthcare experts and providers what their main concerns are during this pandemic.
"Social isolation" was among the biggest worries from healthcare professionals, who said that many new parents aren't able to see their family members leading up to or after the birth.
"It creates anxiety because we all know how important those key relationships are in those early days," one woman said.
Kate has long been an advocate for the importance of postpartum mental health At a 2017 event for Best Beginnings, a charity partner of the royal mental health charity, Heads Together, she spoke about how quickly things shift in a new parent's life after giving birth.
"Nothing can really prepare you for you the sheer overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother. It is full of complex emotions of joy, exhaustion, love, and worry, all mixed together," she said then. "Your fundamental identity changes overnight. You go from thinking of yourself as primarily an individual, to suddenly being a mother, first and foremost."
Like the rest of us, Kate and Prince William have become well acquainted with Zoom in recent weeks. They have also talked with teachers and students who are adjusting to remote learning right now.
"Self-isolation and social distancing can pose huge challenges to our mental health—in recent weeks The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been in regular contact with organizations and patronages to understand the issues they are facing during this difficult time," they wrote on the Kensington Palace Instagram account in March.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate Middleton Surprised These New Parents Over Video Call to Deliver Her Personal Congrats</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kate Middleton is continuing her efforts to raise awareness about early childhood development and the realities of motherhood, even while social distancing. The Duchess of Cambridge recently shared a video, via the royal family's YouTube account, which shows her discussions with parents, midwives, and experts about the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on families. These conversations are especially timely as the United Kingdom prepares to celebrate Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week starting May 4.
The Kensington Palace Twitter account posted an extended video of the adorable interaction with the brand-new mom and dad. "He's so sweet!" Kate says in the clip, admiring the newborn. After the mom reveals she gave birth the night before, Kate responds, "Oh my goodness, you must be exhausted!" As a mother of three, Kate can sympathize with the demands of childbirth (she used hypnobirthing during her delivery!) and the sleepless nights with infants. Watch the video above to see part of their sweet chat, as well as Kate's full conversation with healthcare professionals from around the UK.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate calls midwives and parents to highlight mental health issues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - British royal Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, has video-called a number of new parents, midwives and other maternity service professionals to promote her message of mental health awareness during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a video posted on Twitter by Kensington Palace, the residence and office of Kate and her husband Prince William, the mother-of-three could be seen chatting via video-link with a woman who had given birth the night before, a midwife, and various others.
“As organisations you’re playing such a vital role, giving key information, you’re hugely trusted by the public in general, and therefore the information that you provide is a lifeline to many people at this time,” Kate told professionals from not-for-profit mental health organisations on a group call.
The video was issued to mark Britain’s Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week.
In a separate snippet, Kate could be seen chatting with a new mother on her hospital bed, congratulating her on the birth of her son and acknowledging the strangeness of having the conversation via video-link due to social distancing measures.
“This is definitely a first,” she said, laughing along with the new mother.
A midwife also appeared from a hospital ward on the video-montage, asking whether Kate could tell that she was smiling underneath her protective face mask. “With your eyes, yes I can,” the duchess replied.
Kate and William have long campaigned to raise awareness of mental health issues. Last week, the couple launched a new service called OurFrontline, which provides round-the-clock mental health support to key workers involved in the response to the coronavirus crisis.
William’s grandmother, 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth, has issued a number of rallying messages to the nation since it went into lockdown in March, including a televised address that was only the fifth of her 68-year reign.
More than 28,000 people have died of COVID-19 across the United Kingdom.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Joe Allen
The new mother was operating on two hours of sleep when she spoke with the Duchess of Cambridge.
Even as she’s quarantined with her family, Kate Middleton is still finding ways to bring some love to families across the United Kingdom. The Duchess of Cambridge recently surprised a pair of new parents with a video chat in which she congratulated them on their new child, People reports. Middleton was introduced to the couple, Rebecca and John, at Kingston Hospital, where Middleton did some work shadowing last November.
“Very nice to meet you. This is definitely a first. Well, firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?” Middleton said on the call.
After the couple told the duchess that it was a boy, Middleton offered even more congratulations.
“He’s so sweet. Congratulations!,” the royal mother said.
In speaking with People, Rebecca said that her conversation with a member of the royal family had come as a shock to her.
“Having a baby is an extraordinary experience at any time, but having one during lockdown and then having a surprise conversation with the Duchess of Cambridge after two hours sleep was particularly surreal!,” she said.
Rebecca continued by saying that Middleton had asked what it was like to give birth during the coronavirus pandemic. She said that the midwives in the maternity ward had tried to make the process as normal as possible. The new mother said that apart from the masks, this birth was almost identical to when she had her first son in 2015.
On her call, Middleton also checked in with the hospital’s staff to see how they’d been coping in light of the virus.
“Are you very aware of a difference, or a shift in a mother’s emotional and mental wellbeing in comparison to before the pandemic?” Middleton asked.
The staff told the duchess that the situation had led to an increase in anxiety, and then praised the staff for their ability to work through the challenge. The midwives on the call discussed the impact the coronavirus had had on them, and the importance of continued support for frontline workers.
Last week, Middleton and Prince William launched Our Frontline, an initiative designed to provide 24-hour mental health support for frontline staff and key workers dealing with the virus.
Throughout her time as a royal, Middleton has prioritized childhood development and the mental health of parents as two of her key issues. On the call, she told the staff that babies come regardless of the circumstances in the world, and said she was grateful to them for continuing to do the work they do in these new circumstances.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate coos over newborn baby during virtual chat with parents</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duchess of Cambridge has made a virtual bedside visit to new parents during a video call to midwives she worked alongside last year.
Kate chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted.”
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should “reach out and ask for help” if they need it.
The video call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.

When the duchess, who is mother to six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, who celebrated her fifth birthday on Saturday, and two-year-old Prince Louis, began chatting with the parents of baby Max, she said: “Well firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?”
“It’s a little boy,” Ms Attwood told her, as she sat up in her hospital bed with her newborn son alongside her in a cot.
Given a closer look at little Max, the duchess cooed: “He’s so sweet. Ah, congratulations. When did you have him?”
Told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, Kate said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted,” and his mother replied “Yes. I’m pretty tired now.”
During her video chat, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents has changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
To maintain social distancing, three pairs of midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while another was filmed putting on personal protective equipment before taking the laptop in to introduce the duchess to baby Max and his parents.
From her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, the duchess watched as the hospital birth centre’s lead midwife Sam Frewin, whom she had met during her work placement last November, appeared on camera in a mask and disposable apron.
“I’m smiling, can you tell?” joked Sam.
“I know,” gasped Kate, surprised by her appearance.
Looking closer, she laughed, adding: “With your eyes, I can.”
Later Jennifer Tshibamba, an antenatal midwife who is part of a team offering ultrasound scans and blood tests for genetic conditions, said wearing masks was an added challenge when giving parents difficult news.
She said: “It’s the aspect of having that face-to-face contact and being at a distance and having your mask on and not seeing someone’s facial expressions and knowing that she might be hesitating to say something.”
During the video call, the duchess asked about the concerns of mothers and was told by Jo Doumouchtsi, a perinatal mental health midwife, there had been an increase in referrals for anxiety.
She said: “The main issues that women are having at the moment really are around coming into hospital and worries about catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.
“They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.”

Ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week which begins on Monday, Kate spoke to a group of experts last week, including Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, and Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
The duchess, who has spent much of her public work highlighting the importance of the early years development of children and parental wellbeing, said to the group: “Parents do need to go out and reach out to those who can support them, particularly those who can provide knowledgeable resource as well.
“It’s important to access and reach out for help when you do need it.”
She added: “You speak to six mums and all of you realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one who’s going through it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate Middleton coos over newborn during surprise virtual maternity ward visit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A newborn received a royal welcome when the Duchess of Cambridge paid a virtual ­visit over the internet.
Kate, who has a keen ­interest in early years development, spoke to parents Rebecca Atwood and John Gill about what it was like to have a baby during the lockdown.
The Duchess, 38, cooed at baby Max, who was just 16 hours old, and said: “Hello! Very nice to meet you! This is ­definitely a first, I think!”
After sending “huge congratulations” to his parents, Kate added: “He is so sweet. When did you have him?”
When told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, she replied: “My goodness, you must be exhausted!"
Kate’s surprise ‘bedside visit’ came during a call to staff at Kingston Hospital’s Maternity Unit on April 22.
She did a two-day work placement at the south west London hospital last November, and this time heard from staff about their experiences during the pandemic.
Six midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while one pulled on personal protective equipment and took a ­laptop to introduce mum-of-three Kate to baby Max and his parents.
The Duchess dialled in from Anmer Hall in Norfolk – where the Cambridges have been staying during the lockdown – and heard that the hospital had dealt with a rise in referrals for anxiety.
Jo Doumouchtsi, perinatal mental health midwife, said: “The main issues women are having are around coming into hospital and catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.
“They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.”
And midwife Jennifer Tshibamba added: “We want women to know we’re here, we’re still open.
“Even with what’s ­going on, we’re here to listen to you, we’re still here to make sure we provide you with the best care for your pregnancy, for your baby and support your family.”
The hospital’s perinatal mental health team – which includes psychiatrists and mental health nurses – sends out a weekly newsletter that gives mums advice for coping during the pandemic and lists what ­services are available.
Kate said: “That’s probably such a valuable tool for them now. To you all there, you do an amazing job, ­honestly, as you say, ­babies come all the time.
“The fact you’re having to work in these difficult times… well done.”
Kate told the midwives how she and husband William had spoken to NHS staff about the importance of reaching out if they were feeling low.
She said: “They don’t feel they can reach out because they feel guilty for doing it, which is extraordinary.
“With new mums and parents and families, they don’t want to feel like they’re overburdening but it is so ­important to reach out and ask for help when you do need it.”
As part of their work to support people during the pandemic, the Duke and Duchess have created a new text service dedicated to key workers.
Leading mental health charities will work together to provide 24-hour ­support to those under pressure while millions of us stay at home to save lives.
Mind, Samaritans, Shout, Hospice UK and the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation will provide support and online resources to the key workers keeping Britain ­moving through the crisis.
William, 37, said the text service would be their “top priority” in the coming months. And ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week – which starts tomorrow – Kate said new mums should also speak up if they need help.
Typically, around one in 10 women experience a mental illness during ­pregnancy or in the first year after giving birth.
Kate said that in her experience, talking to other mums helped.
She said: “You realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually, what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one going through it.
“To be able to share it in whatever way, whether it’s on the phone, through social media – in any form – ­it does ­normalise some of these anxieties.”
Using a video call to ­connect with others was exactly what Princess Charlotte did on her fifth birthday on Saturday.
Kate and William threw a party for their daughter at home, with lots of fun and games for her and brothers, George, six and Louis, two.
A source said Charlotte also made Zoom calls to members of her family, ­including the Queen.
Kensington Palace ­yesterday released five photos of the ­princess to mark her birthday – all of which were taken by mum Kate.
The sweet images showed a smiling Charlotte helping to deliver care packages to vulnerable Norfolk residents during the lockdown.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duchess of Cambridge has made a virtual bedside visit to new parents during a video call to midwives she worked alongside last year.
Kate chatted to Rebecca Attwood and John Gill with their baby Max nearby, and when she was told the infant had been born the night before, the royal said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted.”
Midwives told the duchess the coronavirus outbreak had left some mothers suffering from anxiety, concerned about catching Covid-19.
During another video call with experts from the sector, the duchess raised concerns about new parents, saying they should “reach out and ask for help” if they need it.
The video call was made on April 22 to staff at the maternity unit of Kingston Hospital in south-west London, where she spent two days on a work placement last November.
When the duchess, who is mother to six-year-old Prince George, Princess Charlotte, who celebrated her fifth birthday on Saturday, and two-year-old Prince Louis, began chatting with the parents of baby Max, she said: “Well firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?”
“It’s a little boy,” Ms Attwood told her, as she sat up in her hospital bed with her newborn son alongside her in a cot.
Given a closer look at little Max, the duchess cooed: “He’s so sweet. Ah, congratulations. When did you have him?”
Told he had arrived at 10pm the previous night, Kate said: “My goodness, you must be exhausted,” and his mother replied “Yes. I’m pretty tired now.”
During her video chat, Kate spoke to midwives she had met before, and their colleagues, about how the experiences of expectant mothers and new parents has changed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
To maintain social distancing, three pairs of midwives took it in turns to join the chat, while another was filmed putting on personal protective equipment before taking the laptop in to introduce the duchess to baby Max and his parents.
From her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk, the duchess watched as the hospital birth centre’s lead midwife Sam Frewin, whom she had met during her work placement last November, appeared on camera in a mask and disposable apron.
“I’m smiling, can you tell?” joked Sam.
“I know,” gasped Kate, surprised by her appearance.
Looking closer, she laughed, adding: “With your eyes, I can.”
Later Jennifer Tshibamba, an antenatal midwife who is part of a team offering ultrasound scans and blood tests for genetic conditions, said wearing masks was an added challenge when giving parents difficult news.
She said: “It’s the aspect of having that face-to-face contact and being at a distance and having your mask on and not seeing someone’s facial expressions and knowing that she might be hesitating to say something.”
During the video call, the duchess asked about the concerns of mothers and was told by Jo Doumouchtsi, a perinatal mental health midwife, there had been an increase in referrals for anxiety.
She said: “The main issues that women are having at the moment really are around coming into hospital and worries about catching Covid, but also about the isolation after the baby is born.
“They have to self-isolate, so they are having limited support from their other family members.”
Ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week which begins on Monday, Kate spoke to a group of experts last week, including Dr Alain Gregoire, chairman of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, and Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
The duchess, who has spent much of her public work highlighting the importance of the early years development of children and parental wellbeing, said to the group: “Parents do need to go out and reach out to those who can support them, particularly those who can provide knowledgeable resource as well.
“It’s important to access and reach out for help when you do need it.”
She added: “You speak to six mums and all of you realise you are going through the same thing. Before that, you’re worried that actually what you’re experiencing, you’re the only one who’s going through it.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry stripped naked for her latest social media offering as she posed in a nude selfie.
The actress, 53, told her 6.1 million followers that she was indulging in some self-care.
She added that she's been using Taraji P Henson's products, paying tribute to her pal and urging fans to give her stuff a go.
"I've known this woman since she started in the industry," Halle wrote, "And it's been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed.
"Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favourites!"
The Hollywood icon recently reminisced about her time in the industry, including her work on Die Another Day, Pierce Brosnan's last Bond film before he hung up the mantle.
Halle recalled that the Irish actor, now 66, had to give her the Heimlich Manoeuvre as she choked on a fig during a steamy sex scene.
Chatting with American talk show host Jimmy Fallon from her home, she dished: "I was supposed to be all sexy, trying to seduce him with a fig, and then I ended up choking on it and he had to get up and do the Heimlich.
"James Bond knows how to Heimlich!
"He was there for me, he will always be one of my favourite people in the world."
She was playing love interest and fellow spy Jinx, revealing that the studio had even flirted with the idea of giving her character her own spinoff flick.
She's also been battling online trolls since going into lockdown, clapping back at those who passed judgement on her for letting six year old Maceo-Robert wear high heels.
"Is this your daughter or your son?" one wrote.
She came back: "Well it's a he and he is having a ball. Tryna cope the best he can! Laughter helps a lot right now."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American actress Halle Berry, 53, has recently shared a steamy selfie on Instagram - it shows her just out of the shower, her hair wet and her makeup-free face covered with water droplets.
Berry wrote that she was enjoying some time for self-care during the coronavirus lockdown.
The picture has received more than 200,000 likes, and the actress's fans expressed their admiration with her natural beauty.
"Halle stopped aging around 25 years ago. I figure she must have stumbled onto the fountain of youth back then. Maybe she will tell the rest of us where it is," one follower wrote.
"Looking gorgeous!", "You are so beautiful, Halle", others said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'It's just scary': Kylie Jenner says the coronavirus hits 'close to home' in the latest KUWTK trailer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” won’t be back until September, but a recently released trailer revealed some of the topics the show will be taking on next season, including the coronavirus pandemic.
The trailer, which gives a sneak peek of the show’s 19th season, broaches the topic with a voiceover of Kim who says, “The White House said that the coronavirus is serious,” over ominous music. The trailer also mentions the Los Angeles stay-at-home order, which went into effect on March 19.
It also includes a clip of Kylie Jenner telling the camera that the coronavirus pandemic hits “close to home,” though the clip doesn’t offer any more details into what the Kylie Cosmetics founder meant.
“It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive,” she said.
In recent weeks, many celebrities tested positive for COVID-19, including Tom Hanks, Pink, and Idris Elba.
It appears season 19 will touch on the ways the Kardashian family has been affected by the pandemic. One clip shows Scott Disick saying he’s going a bit stir crazy, and another shows a tearful Kris Jenner telling Khloe over the phone she wishes she could hug her.
The trailer also features non-coronavirus-related clips, including Kris and Disick pulling a prank and the family speculating about whether Khloe has hooked up with ex Tristan Thompson.
“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” will return to E! in September. You can watch the trailer for season 19 here:

His hair, too, is longer thanks to lockdown, while his hands are covered by an unflattering pair of latex gloves.
Up close there's no mistaking who the mystery man is....but quite why Liam Payne finds himself stacking shelves in a London foodbank is another matter.
In an exclusive interview with the Mirror, the down-to-earth 26-year old singer has spoken for the first time about how he felt compelled to act in the wake of the global pandemic.
Like many, he was left deeply upset by reports of families struggling to eat under the crippling financial pressure caused by the nation going into lockdown.
And in an extraordinary act of generosity, the star has donated cash worth 360,000 food parcels to the Trussell Trust, who support a nationwide network of food banks.
But he wanted to get his hands dirty too....so headed down to a foodbank in London's Euston to volunteer and also find out first hand about the scale of the problem.
“I was told that in terms of people turning up to that specific foodbank, it was almost double, if not more. It's terrible people need food banks anyway but now, it's getting worse and worse,” he says.
Liam spent the day packaging up food parcels for the homeless with a team of four other charity volunteers
“My job for the day also entailed packaging up specific items for homeless people that were stuck on the street,” he says. “They need very specific types of food because a lot of them can't cook things, they can't prepare stuff, they can't get boiling water.”
Last week The Trussell Trust said it was enduring its busiest ever period, with 81% more emergency food parcels being given out across the UK compared to the same period in 2019. This included 122% more parcels going to children.
“The numbers are crazy,” he admits. “And it's just disturbing to know how many people are without food in these circumstances. I hope enough people out there know about these food banks and can get down to them.”
He paid special tribute to the “inspiring” foodbank volunteers he met including Carla, Dorothea and Helena.
“These people are putting themselves on the line every single day going out and doing this, putting themselves at risk,” he says
“I want to urge anyone reading this to donate to The Trussell Trust if you’re able to. I know lots of people are in a really difficult financial position right now so can’t … but if you can please do donate.”
Growing up in Wolverhampton, money was tight in the Payne household, with dad Geoff a fitter and mum Karen a nursery nurse.
But while he admits that “money definitely put stress on the family in certain circumstances”, he says that it was a world away from the current predicament many families are now finding themselves in.
“This is a really unprecedented situation that we find ourselves in right now,” he says. “It's very distressing seeing the number of people out there losing their jobs.
“ I'm hoping that the Government does what it can and makes those right decisions so that we can all improve this and get back on our feet as quickly as possible.”
For Liam the lockdown has presented its own personal challenges too.
The star has been separated from his three-year-old son Bear, who is living with popstar mum Cheryl, with whom he is separated.
“I've been FaceTiming as much as I can, and it's just great knowing he's so well looked by Cheryl at home. But missing my son has been one of the hardest things that I've had to do so far. I'm dying to get back to see him, but obviously, I just think it's so important that we follow the government guidelines at the moment and me and Cheryl are talking all the time.”
Like many parents, Liam says he was also left worried about new reports of a potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections.
“To think of kids struggling, it really, really pulls on the heart strings, and I just can't imagine how people feel in that position.”
Liam reserves special praise for the army of NHS workers up and down the country and says how he has been joining in the Clap for our Heroes every Thursday.
And like so many other people he has been left horrified by the rising death toll among their ranks – not least as he recognises the important role the NHS played in his own life.
The star has previously said how he was born “effectively dead” with doctors having to bring him round. He was then in and out of hospital with kidney problems as a toddler.
Asked if he owed a personal debt to the NHS, he said: “I think so, definitely. Living in the country and having the NHS service, I think we have taken it for granted. It's unfortunate that it's only in times like these that we all suddenly realize that. I mean these guys literally put themselves at risk every day.
“It's wonderful to hear the clapping throughout the streets, and people really, really going for it.”
Work-wise, the lockdown has meant that Liam has had to put on hold a series of international dates over the summer including a gig in Russia.
“I hadn't been there before, even with One Direction, so I was quite miffed about,” he says. “But you have to do what you have to do in this circumstance. And I was actually meant to go to America at the time of this, and luckily I'd stayed put for the moment, I didn't want to be stuck away from all my family and everything, which would have been even harder.”
Instead he has taken on the rather unique challenge of putting on gigs from the confines of his London flat. As well as performing the One World Together at Home gig put on by Lady Gaga, he performed his new single Midnight with Alesso on James Corden's chatshow from both his frontroom and rooftop.
“I mean it's challenging to make things look interesting from home.... we were flying a drone around in here, what we’ll do next I don’t know..!” he laughs.
For someone who has been so open before about his mental health while in One Direction, I wonder how he is doing holed up away from his friends and family?
Liam has previously spoken about suffering chronic loneliness in the band and having to seek therapy because he was in such a “bad place”.
He says: “The thing that I'm trying to remember in my head is there are going to be bad days. There are going to be some days where you feel a bit down. But as long as you know that, you can kind of battle your way through it a little bit.
“But I think the main thing for me is just making sure I have a routine and setting mini goals and little victories like writing a song or making sure that I've been in touch with a family member that day.
“But I think one of the things we can all do to help each other is just by staying in touch. If you know somebody who's a little bit lonely or is struggling, reach out to them.”
Liam is supporting the Trussell Trust, an anti-poverty charity that supports a network of food banks and campaigns for a future where everyone can afford their own food. You can support their work by donating here – www.trusselltrust.org/make-a-donation/

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner Says Someone “Close To Home” Has Coronavirus And Lord, I’m So Tired</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was inevitable that Kylie Jenner and the rest of the Kardashian clan would seize upon the coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity for self-promotion. The only question was how shameless they’d be, and based on the new Keeping Up With The Kardashians trailer, the answer to that is “quite shameless indeed.”
The show, currently in its 18th season, will return in September, and will follow the family into quarantine in Los Angeles. The new footage, which seems to have been shot on their personal devices, shows them wearing masks and dealing with the challenges of lockdown, like weeping in closets and joining endless Zoom calls.
The kicker comes when Kylie Jenner, seemingly at the point of tears, appears in a confessional to say: “It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive.” 
Now, the trailer clearly wants us to think that Kris or Kanye or whoever has been struck down with KOVID-19 (patent pending), but this is almost definitely not the case.
Given the deliberately vague wording, the mystery person will almost certainly turn out to be some rando who lives in the next street over (and therefore “close to home”), or somebody with an even more tenuous connection to the family than that.
Still, you kind of have to admire this family’s hustle for finding a way to make this pandemic all about them. Check out the trailer below:

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Minute With: Tim Gunn on pajamas and post-quarantine fashion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Even Tim Gunn, the immaculately dressed fashion mentor from “Project Runway” and Amazon’s new competition show “Making the Cut,” is finding it hard to get out of his pajamas these days. As much of the world shelters at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gunn said he too has given in to comfort over style when he’s at home in his New York apartment. Reuters spoke to Gunn by telephone about how the ongoing quarantine has changed fashion and what might come next on “Making the Cut.” Q: What do you think will happen to fashion now that people have gotten used to working in sweatpants or even their pajamas? A: I have to confess to you I’m one of those people. And it’s really unusual for me. For years I’ve been saying, “if you want to dress to feel as though you never got out of bed, don’t!” But there’s a silver lining to this, at least for me. I now have a great deal of empathy for people who do dress for comfort. I’ve not been wearing sweats, but I have been wearing my pajamas, thinking “well I have no place to go.” When I actually got into regular clothes, and I did because of video conferencing, I felt as though I was wearing a wet suit. I felt so constrained and confined and tethered. I think the psychological and even physical effect of going back to normal clothes makes you just squirm. I have a good deal of empathy for people who really subscribe to the comfort trap. It’s easy to get trapped. But I do have a pact with myself. When I’m wearing pajamas and a robe, I won’t even go down the hall of my apartment building to the trash chute. If I’m leaving the apartment, I get dressed. I’m not in a suit, but I’m wearing proper clothes. Q: So what is proper clothing for you right now when you do go out in the hallway? A: I’d wear a turtleneck and a pair of jeans. Q: Do you think that once we are all allowed out into some kind of new world that there might be a huge embrace of fashion, that maybe people are tired of their sweatpants? A: I fully believe that. I know people who are dressing up every day. They’re not leaving their apartment, but they’re dressing up because they feel that they have infused their lifestyle with some normalcy. Q: Do you know if you’ll have a season two of “Making the Cut” and what it might look like? A: We’re certainly talking about a season two. The plan for doing it this summer is, of course, off. And we are carefully, thoughtfully, recalibrating all of our thinking about the show in regard to social distancing and interactions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Kardashians Have Already Turned the Coronavirus Into Content</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keeping Up With the Kardashians has released yet another extremely dramatic trailer for its upcoming season, this time showing the family as they react to the first wave of coronavirus news. “The White House said that the coronavirus is serious,” Kim says as dramatic music pans in the background. The camera cuts to Kris staring out the window over her sprawling Calabasas property as a stay-at-home order is issued. There’s a shot of an empty L.A. highway and we see Scott Disick, lounging in his living room, exclaim that he’s going “stir crazy.” A wide green lawn and swimming pool peek out from the French doors behind him.
Meanwhile, a glazed-looking Kylie says, “It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive.” It’s unclear who she’s referring to; perhaps one of the many asymptomatic celebrities who have accessed tests via private labs (including Kris Jenner). There are a few more pans of the family; Kris cries in front of a wall of Birkins and the family gets together for a Zoom call. “We’ll get through this,” Khloe murmurs at the trailer’s end, rubbing her forehead with red-lacquered, two-inch acrylics.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Post Rishi Kapoor’s Demise, Here’s What Makers Are Upto With Actor’s Last Film ‘Sharmaji Namkeen’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On January 9, 2018, producer Honey Trehan along with debutant director Hitesh Bhatia reached at the residence of Rishi Kapoor for a script-narration of their upcoming film, “Sharmaji Namkeen”. The legendry actor is excited on hearing the script, he decides to sign the film.
“I am that youngster who watched, admired and loved Rishiji on-screen. There are several films that I call my favourite, and ‘Chandni’ always topped the list. So it was nostalgia and excitement rolled into one when I went to narrate the film and cast him in the project,” recalled Honey, one of the producers of the film along with Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani.
Trehan recalls that Rishi Kapoor fell sick within a few days after the start of shooting, and he flew to the US for his treatment.
“We stopped the film and waited for him to come back. He is the DNA of the film and we cannot imagine anyone else to play Sharmaji. They stayed in touch with him and he was so eager to come back and get on to the film set. So naturally, when things started rolling, his energy and high professionalism were driving us,” said the producer.
After Rishi Kapoor returned to India, shooting was scheduled to resume on January 15, 2020, in Delhi. Unfortunately Kapoor lost his sister Ritu Nanda, and on January 14 had to travel to Delhi to attend to his family amid emotional crisis.
Keeping the situation in mind, the producers decided to reschedule the shooting.
“However Rishiji said, ‘bakwas maat karo, what happened is personal but work is my profession. I am equally responsible for both. The show must go on. This is what my father taught me’. You see, under such circumstances where he lost his sister, he did not forget the high professional value that he learnt from Raj Kapoor saab. Rishi sir knew that the responsibility of the film is on his shoulder as he played the title role of the film. He knew that the unit will suffer if we stop the shooting and there comes his spirit and energy to encourage us saying, ‘the show must go on, mujhe call time bataao’,” Trehan recalled.
Remembering the affectionate nature of the legendry actor, he added: “On January 15 in the Delhi winter, our call time was 9 am. When I reached the set around 8:45 am, I find him ready — not even sitting in his vanity but standing there, on the set! He smiled at me saying, ‘Tu T-shirt pehna hai, thand nehi lagti? Jacket kyun nahin pehna?’ That’s Rishi Kapoor for you. Loving, affectionate towards everyone around him.”
Does he feel the pressure of the fact that this will be counted as Rishi Kapoor’s last film? “A film with Rishi Kapoor is always special. But this one is ‘sadly’ special, and this is not why a film should be special. Hitesh and I are really not in the frame of mind to think about how we will finish the film. We need time. We are sad, deeply sad” Honey signed off.
Regarding the future of the film, sources close to us now reveal, ““The microscopic details of how Ritesh and Farhan intend to bring the film to completion are in the works but rest assured that the film will get completed and see a theatrical release.”
Sharmaji Namkeen will see Rishi Kapoor in the lead along with Juhi Chawla. The film is produced by Excel Entertainment in association with Honey Teheran and Abhishek Choubey. The film will also mark Hitesh Bhatia’s debut as the director.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor's sudden demise has left many of his industry pals heartbroken and director Rakesh Roshan is one of them. He was a close friend of Rishi Kapoor since a long time, and the duo has always been in touch with each other. From holidaying together to dining together once or twice in a month, they have done it all!
Rishi Kapoor's Last Tweet Goes Viral; Fans Mourn And Ask 'Why Does God Need These Actors'
In a recent interaction with a senior journalist, Subhash K Jha, the Karan Arjun director blamed Rishi Kapoor's stubbornness for his deteriorated health and revealed that he had warned the Mulk actor earlier to be careful about his health. Here's what he said..
"I met him last on March 15 over dinner. Only Chintu (Rishi), his wife Neetu and I were there, and we chatted for nearly three hours. We discussed each other's health.
I am a hundred percent cured, touchwood. Chintu asked me why I didn't start a new film. I told him I will wait until September when my final medical tests will happen," said Rakesh Roshan, who himself has come out of cancer.
"Both of us had cancer, though different kinds. I am aware of how infection-prone we are. So when Chintu told me about his plans to go to Delhi in February for a wedding I advised him against it. But he still went, and had a relapse there. When I met Chintu he admitted he should've listened to me and that he made a mistake by going to Delhi," said the Krrish director.
Speaking about how he remained so close to Mr Kapoor, Rakesh Roshan revealed "We both have our good and bad points and our friendship lasted so long because we accepted each other with our faults. We had no ego issues between us. Chintu would regret what he said or did and then apologize the next day. I was also quick to say sorry to him when I erred. That's why we remained so close."
Rakesh Roshan revealed that he first met Rishi Kapoor when they were working together in the musical, Khel Khel Mein. Roshan revealed that they hit it off instantly as they had so much in common.
"That's when our professional and personal association began. No matter how busy we got we would meet 3-4 times a week. A friendship requires commitment and time to last."
He concluded saying, "I find it hard to believe that Chintu is gone.I feel he is still with me that he will call any moment. Sadly I couldn't attend his last rites because of my own health condition."
Our condolences to the near and dear ones of Rishi Kapoor.
Rishi Kapoor's LAST WISH When He Realised He Won't Be Able To Make It Will Leave You In Tears!

    <h5 class="mb-1">With Bobby, Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia set the bar for young love in Bollywood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For a child to be told to “Go give Aunty a kiss” is not unique, especially not in India. Most of us have grown up obliging our parents at parties where we meet their friends. But the 1973 movie Bobby is all about breaking the mould. So when his parents’ friend proffers her cheek to a young boy for a kiss, he does the unthinkable – he bites her. And when his father orders him to apologise, he angrily asks why he should be forced to kiss anyone.
The scene, which comes in the first few minutes of the movie, sets the tone for the story of young lovers who rebel against claustrophobic, old-fashioned ideas.
The film’s lead actor, Rishi Kapoor, has often said that contrary to popular belief, the movie wasn’t intended as a launchpad for him. His father, filmmaker Raj Kapoor, needed to recover the losses from his 1970 film Mera Naam Joker, so he couldn’t afford to cast superstar Rajesh Khanna, whom he had originally wanted. He needed to cast young people who wouldn’t cost him much, and he needed to get young audiences into theatres.
So he decided to tell the story of a teenage romance that stands up against parental objection, and he signed 20-year-old Rishi (who had appeared as a child actor in Mera Naam Joker) and 16-year-old debutante Dimple Kapadia. And he opted for a decidedly youthful look. So while Rishi was kitted out in oversize sunglasses, colourful mufflers and flared pants, Dimple’s look was all short skirts, midriff-exposing blouses and, in one scene, an orange bikini.
The decision paid off and how. The highest-grossing film of the year and one of the biggest hits of the decade, Bobby set the trend for generations of movies about young love conquering all.
As India mourns the loss of Rishi Kapoor, there could be no better movie to watch this weekend in tribute to Bollywood’s favourite baby-faced, twinkly-eyed lover with a smile that could melt even the stoniest of hearts.
Rishi Kapoor stars as Raj Nath, or Raja, who has just graduated from school. His father, a wealthy businessman (played by Pran) is cold-hearted, harsh and extremely arrogant about his wealth and social capital, while his mother (Sonia Sahni) is a more loving parent, but equally snobbish. As punishment for biting their friend, his parents had him packed off to boarding school, where a fellow student points out that there is no love between Raja and his parents. Raja doesn’t deny it, and that in itself is a bold move, given that in Hindi movies, family is usually sacrosanct.
Later, when Mr Nath, who doesn’t even remember when Raja’s birthday is (but wants to use it as an occasion for professional networking), attacks his wife’s parenting skills and makes a snide remark about her bridge parties, she doesn’t take the criticism lying down, but argues that parenting isn’t just her job.
Raja meets Bobby Braganza (Dimple), the grand daughter of his former governess (Durga Khote) and the two fall in love. But Bobby’s father is a fisherman who isn’t as wealthy as the Naths, and she is a Catholic, spelling instant disapproval from Mr Nath.
The rebellion of young people breaking the barriers of religion and class came as a breath of fresh air for audiences, as did the non-judgemental portrayal of young love and raging hormones, beautifully expressed in songs like Hum Tum Ek Kamre Mein Band Ho and Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai.
Incidentally, after Rishi Kapoor’s death, former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted a picture of the actor outside Highlands Park, the Gulmarg hotel where the song Hum Tum… was shot, which is now a beloved tourist spot that people call the Bobby Hotel.

The movie was a trendsetter, not only for its fashion in the 1970s but for its portrayal of youthful love, which moviemakers have looked to for generations. If Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (which marked Aamir Khan’s debut, in 1988) followed a similar theme, so did Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham in 2001. Director Karan Johar says he was inspired by the title of another Rishi Kapoor movie, Kabhi Kabhie (which is why he spelt his title in the same way, as a homage), but truth be told, K3G has far more in common with Bobby – the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, the overbearing father, the fact that the link between the lovers is a former governess.
Bobby‘s songs, too, have inspired countless movie titles and parodies. While Na Chahoon Sona Chandi has been part of Mr India (1987) as well as Mohabbatein (2001), the 2004 hit Hum Tum (which also stars Rishi Kapoor, this time as a dad), shares its name with the Bobby song, it also features another song from the film, Main Shaayar Toh Nahin.
But perhaps the cheekiest (and most talked-about) nod to the movie was in Saawariya (2007). Rishi’s son Ranbir Kapoor’s famous towel-dropping scene in his screen debut was a clear throwback to Rishi’s own in-the-buff moment in Bobby.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistani Actor Adnan Siddiqui Apologises To Sridevi And Irrfan Khan's Families For The 'Callous' Statement Made By An Anchor On Their Demise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOM actor Adnan Siddiqui appeared on a talk show named Jeeway Pakistan hosted by Aamir Liaquat where he braced an uncomfortable statement made by the host on actors Sridevi and Irrfan Khan
Actor Adnan Siddiqui who has shared screen space with Bollywood stars like Sridevi and Irrfan Khan was recently put in an uncomfortable spot when an anchor of a show spoke about the death of the two legends. The Pakistani actor appeared as a guest on a show called Jeeway Pakistan which is hosted by Aamir Liaquat. During the conversation, the host made some callous statements that left the actor uncomfortable. Adnan then took to social media to speak about the incident and even offer an apology to the families of Sridevi and Irrfan Khan.
Adnan penned a post on Twitter and wrote, "The anchor Aamir Liaquat Sahab joked about something extremely sensitive. Not only were they both close to me but also as a human it was wrong on so many levels. I cannot even call it hitting below the belt. It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light." During the conversation, the anchor stated that actress Rani Mukerji and Bipasha Basu are still alive because Adnan refused to do films with them. Adnan did a film Sridevi (MOM) and Irrfan Khan (A Mighty Heart) and both the actors are no more.
He further wrote, "I want to apologise to the families of Sridevi Sahiba and lrrfan Khan Sahab, their loved ones and fans. If you see my body language I was extremely uncomfortable with what he said but I didn't want to stoop to that level."

In the end, the actor said that he has learnt the lesson and that he is sorry. "I regret being on the show. I've learnt my lesson and I promise I will not tolerate such an act in future. I was hoping this bit wouldn't become public but unfortunately it has. I'm sorry," he finished.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watching ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ during lockdown: When India’s poor were still in the Bollywood frame</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I watched Amar Akbar Anthony on hearing of Rishi Kapoor’s death. It was pure nostalgia as there was a vague memory of a great qawwali enactment by Rishi Kapoor, paying Akbar, and a hysterical comedy sequence with a drunk and battered Amitabh Bachchan, playing Anthony.
I was right on both counts and the 1977 film is an absolute delight, with all the caricatured characterisations of blockbuster Hindi cinema, including the lost-and-found storylines of that age.
Watching it with my 21-year-old daughter, we found many occasions to laugh out loud. But the film also made me profoundly sad because the symbols and subliminal messaging through which it works, are now so utterly changed in India.
No, it’s not a reference to religious multiplicity and inter-faith trust stated so emphatically in the very title of the film. I am talking about the poverty in which the film is foregrounded that actually leads to the plot of three siblings being separated. The mother played by the eternal mother of that era, Nirupa Roy, has tuberculosis and the children are hungry and struggling for a meal in the beginning.
Here’s the opening storyline: Their father, a chauffeur, is in jail after taking the blame for a crime committed by his employer. Played by that doyen Pran, the father was promised the family would get extra money while he’s in jail. They do not and finding his family in dire straits when he comes out, the father confronts his boss.
There’s a memorable scene epitomising the helplessness of poor Indians working for the more prosperous ones, where he polishes the shoes of the wicked employer – the villain for the rest of the film – with the sleeves of his shirt in the hope of getting his due money.
Meanwhile, the wife has run off to commit suicide as she does not want any expense on her tuberculosis treatment and leaves a note saying whatever money there is, should be spent on the children. When the father, now being chased by employer’s henchmen, returns to the home in the ghetto, he finds the suicide note, picks up the three kids and takes them to a park where there is a statue of Gandhi, and leaves them there, intending to return. The separation of the children unfolds with Gandhi’s statue in the backdrop.
In 2020, when Indians are stranded hungry around the country, desperate to go home, get food, get work, it was a bit of a relief to see that there was a time when mainstream cinema actually showed heroes tackling poverty and dislocation. The fantastic tales of cinema were once built on mothers who had TB. The parts played by Amitabh Bachchan were in spirit those of a migrant, or an individual who fights all the terrible odds to either die a hero or come out on top after conquering the city or the ghetto. He was the angry young man because there were things to be angry about.
After the opening up of the economy, the bubble gum world of mainstream cinema that followed was often made for audiences who watched films in multiplexes. As we, the middle classes prospered, we forgot many things including the fact that 1,400 Indians still die every day from TB. These days, we remember the terrible health data of our country as the Covid-19 panic has actually brought health services for other illnesses to a halt.
Amar Akbar Anthony reminded me that once upon a time there were different narratives in popular cinema. Rishi Kapoor, in his delightful turn as Akbar Illahabadi, plays a qawwali singer who can also pull of the disguise of a bearded “masterji” tailor. He is fresh, young, and seems to just love arriving on stage to belt out one of the most popular qawwalis created by popular cinema. No actor has since pulled off the qawwali moves as Rishi Kapoor does in that memorable “purdah hai purdah” song sequence. Actress Neetu Singh, real life wife, is behind the purdah.
Towards the climax of the film, Akbar Illahabadi is singing again, this time before a statue of the Shirdi Sai Baba that song eternally linked to the tradition – “Tareef teri nikli hai dil se, aiye hai lab pe ban ke qawwali/ Shirdi wale Sai Baba Aya hai tere dar pe Sawali [Praise for you has come from the heart and is uttered from the lips in the form of a qawwali/ Oh Sai Baba of Shirdi/ the one who asks has come to your shrine].”
The Shirdi Sai Baba, as we all may know, was believed to have been a Muslim fakir who is now a national divinity. It’s one of the curious phenomena of this land filled with dualism in worship that a Muslim fakir should be so venerated by non-Muslims. One of the interesting aspects of the Shirdi tradition is that some of its most devout followers are also followers of the Hindutva project and apparently see no contradiction in the process. Sociological studies of both the Shirdi Sai Baba and Santoshi Ma traditions suggest that popular cinema has played a part in popularising them.

Seeing is believing: The miracle of sight restoration in ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’
In the film, the depiction of Akbar singing before an idol would belong to the realm of syncretistic popular Islam, the medium through which the religion spread in the sub-continent. Conservative interpretations, however, see the multiplicity of popular traditions followed by Indian Muslims as a challenge to their vision of a uniform way of life that banishes any form of idol worship or grave worship in Sufi shrines.
Popular cinema reflects popular impulses and from the lovable Akbar Illahabadi, we have moved on to sinister bearded Muslim villains. Rishi Kapoor himself would play one of the most well-etched Muslim characters coming out of Hindi cinema in recent times in the powerful 2018 film Mulk. From the light-on-his-feet, mischievous Akbar Illahabadi he moved on to portraying Murad Ali Mohammed, the heavy, dignified but grief-struck patriarch of a family confronting tragic circumstances.
Amar Akbar Anthony is a film born in the age of innocence when we had imagined a different India. It was an age when poor people were still in our frame and when all Muslims were not villains.

    <h5 class="mb-1">When Irrfan Khan left everyone including Navjot Sidhu in splits by ‘threatening’ to strangulate Kapil Sharma on The Kapil Sharma Show for comedian’s controversial tweet against BMC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood legend Irrfan Khan passed away last week after battling cancer for two years at the age of 53. His tragic death left Bollywood stunned as his millions of fans paid him rich tribute for his extraordinary contribution to the entertainment industry. Kapil Sharma was one of the very few stars, who attended the veteran actor’s last rites. Not many would know that Irrfan had once teased The Kapil Sharma Show host by threatening to strangulate him for causing trouble in his life by his controversial tweet.
When asked about hsi family’s well-being, Irrfan had said, “Yaar, my family is fine but if you talk about my house, I will strangulate you.” This left everyone including Navjot Singh Sidhu in splits. Then addressing Sidhu, Irrfan said, “Paji, I bought a house. Then I learnt that Kapil stays in the same building. I was very happy that being an elder brother Kapil will visit me from time to time. I didn’t know that he is so powerful that he will ruin my life by a single tweet. And our media is also so ‘responsible’ that they are making me suffer for the crime committed by him (Kapil). It is as if only Kapil and I stay in that building, no one  else lives there.”
Irrfan asked Kapil why he was invisible since he had not seen him once even though both lived in the same building. Kapil replied that he was embroiled into legal wrangles even before he could enter his house. Irrfan had jokingly asked him if he ever felt bad for causing trouble to him by his controversial tweet.
Irrfan once again raked up the issue of Kapil’s tweet during the conversation when the comedian told him that children these days did not get a beating as was the case when he was growing up. To which Irrfan once again teased Kapil as he said, “I almost got (thrashed) because of your tweet.” This once again left the audience in splits.
Irrfan continued, “I had never realised your real power. I was aware of your talent as a comedian and the strength of my friendship with you. But never realised that you can wreak havoc in my life with just one tweet.”
The comedian in September 2016 had kicked up a controversy by alleging in a tweet that he had been asked to pay a bribe of Rs 5 lakh by an official from the BMC for the construction of his premises in Versova, suburban Andheri. He had also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his tweet.
“I am paying Rs 15 cr income tax from last 5 year n still i have to pay Rs 5 lakhs bribe to BMC office for making my office @narendramodi (sic),” Kapil had said in his tweet.
Later, he was accused of destroying mangroves in the area with an illegal structure. The BMC had sent notices to many other residents including Irrfan.
Irrfan was diagnosed with NeuroEndocrine cancer in 2018. He had travelled to London for the treatment and returned home last year. After his return to Mumbai, the popular actor had penned an emotional note to his fans, stating that he wanted to ‘pause to be grateful’ for the ‘immense love and support’ that he received from them.
Kapil was one of the very few celebrities from Bollywood who braved the COVID-19 lockdown to attend his funeral in Mumbai. He had also written an emotional note on Irrfan’s death.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aamir Liaquat Makes Shockingly Insensitive Comment About Irrfan Khan’s Death</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aamir Liaquat Hussain is best known for his controversial comments.
Recently, he made another shocking statement on live TV when he joked about the death of Bollywood megastar Irrfan Khan on his show, Jeevay Pakistan.
Pakistan’s showbiz star, Adnan Siddiqui, appeared as a guest on his show. The two spoke about different things from personal life to showbiz. Adnan Siddiqui was left in shock when Aamir Liaquat said that two people owe their lives to you, Rani Mukherjee and Bipasha Basu.
Adnan Siddiqui didn’t know what the host was talking about until he explained himself.
Highlighting the career of the Pakistani actor, he said, “You worked in Mom and Sri Devi died, you worked with Irrfan Khan as well and he passed away.”
“You were offered roles in Mardaani 2 and Jism 2 but you declined, so the actors of that movie owe their life to you,” he continued.
Siddiqui, who was taken aback by Liaquat’s comment merely said that it was not something to joke about.
There’s no doubt that Aamir Liaquat has no limit to his humor and is a self-centered individual. But to joke about someone’s death is a whole different thing. Previously, the host-turned politician was seen taking a dig at his own party leader and Prime Minister, Imran Khan. Moreover, rumors suggest that Liaquat has been wanting a ministry but is not getting one so, the only option left for him is to defame Imran Khan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor: His own man</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The connection of the lightning call from Bombay to Bikaner was full of static — Rishi Kapoor could barely make out what Manmohan Desai was trying to tell him, something about a role in a film called Amar Akbar Anthony. Desai wanted Kapoor to play Akbar but the young actor was confused. “How can I play Akbar? My grandfather (Prithviraj Kapoor) played Akbar in Mughal-e-Azam!” The hit filmmaker was flummoxed by his response and said, “What’s wrong with this stupid man?” to Ghanshyam, Kapoor’s secretary, who was with Desai in Bombay during the call.
The matter was cleared up soon after and Kapoor went on to star in one of Hindi cinema’s most enduring hits, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and the late Vinod Khanna. If he had ever worried about being eclipsed by the ‘Angry Young Man’, and the ‘Angsty Young Man’, he needn’t have — as the qawwali-singing Akbar, the tailor who wooed the girl with much abandon, and the most optimistic one of three brothers, Kapoor held his own.
The anecdote is one of many he recounted in his 2017 autobiography, Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored, a breezy chronicle of the life and loves of Raj Kapoor’s most successful son, who made his debut as a 16-year-old in Mera Naam Joker (1970) and had an illustrious career as Hindi cinema’s singing and dancing youngster, a jersey-sporting lover, before he embarked on a second innings as an efficient supporting actor in films such as Luck By Chance (2009), Agneepath (2012), D-Day (2013), Kapoor & Sons (2016) and Mulk (2018).
In his nearly 50-year-old career, Kapoor courted stardom, critical acclaim and controversy with spontaneity, a trait he prided himself on having as an actor and otherwise. In the age of social media, his ill-considered opinions and comments would frequently land him in hot water, but Kapoor was never one to back down. He was always aware of the privilege afforded to him from birth, and all through his life. He’d always backed himself, whether it came to his choice of films, the sweaters he wore in most of them till he was 44, and even his reckless tweets. He lived large and openly, and often became an example of the ways in which long-lasting stardom matures, or not, with the passing of time.

In the last few years, Kapoor reminded us of how natural an actor he could be, how he could handle even the most saccharine or righteous roles with a deft touch, and had us cheer him on his rewarding comeback to the industry. In interviews and other conversations, he could be a jester and a tease, he was his own person, no filters please. In 2014, when he discovered that the national archives of The Indian Express in Chandigarh had a photograph of him with a young Ranbir on the sets of Prem Granth (1996), he wanted it for his autobiography. Upon being informed that it had to be purchased, Kapoor joked, “Mera photo khichte ho aur mujhse se hi paise lete ho? (You take my photo and you charge me for it?).” Those who knew him will tell you, he was only being himself.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taapsee Pannu steps in Rahul Dholakia’s next after Kriti Sanon’s exit?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After Rahul Dholakia postponed the shooting of his next film in 2019, a woman-centric project, starring Kriti Sanon, the actress was unable to accommodate the new dates and thus walked out. Since then, Dholakia has been on the hunt out for his new leading lady.
PinkVilla reports that Taapsee Pannu has been roped in for the film, with an announcement expected soon. A source told the publication, “After Kriti decided to step out of the film, Rahul had approached Sara Ali Khan for the same role but even she couldn’t accommodate this film. Then, he offered the film to Taapsee Pannu and she loved the script. It’s a brilliantly written crime thriller that is very performance driven. The producer Sunir Kheterpal was looking for a powerhouse actor who also has a good bankability at the ticket windows. He has delivered a huge hit with Taapsee last year in Badla. So when he told her about this film, she agreed to do it.”
The source added, “Taapsee has said yes to it, but now, they have to figure out her dates. There are several films she has in hand – Haseen Dillruba, then Rashmi Rocket followed by Shabaash Mithu, Loop Lapeta, Sanjay Bhansali’s next production venture. With the Covid-19 effect on the industry, it remains to be seen when the situation can return to normalcy. It’s only after that Taapsee and her team will take a call on Rahul’s film. Meanwhile, the Raees director will finish another project under Farhan Akhtar’s banner.”
The film is expected to go on the floors next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs stars pay tribute to Sam Lloyd, aka Ted Buckland, as he dies aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scrubs stars have been paying tribute to Sam Lloyd, after the actor died aged 56.
Lloyd, best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the hospital comedy, passed away on 30 April.
While his cause of death has yet to be confirmed, he had been battling cancer, having been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour at the beginning of 2019.
He was then diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, which had spread to his liver, spine and jaw bone.
Following the sad news, Sam’s Scrubs castmates shared tributes on social media, including Zach Braff, who played JD on the show.
The 45-year-old tweeted: ‘Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. 
‘He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.’
Zach went on to share a clip of Sam singing Somewhere Over The Rainbow with his a capella group The Blanks, who made recurring appearances on Scrubs, as well as pictures of some of Lloyd’s most memorable scenes.
Sarah Chalke, who played Elliot Reid, tweeted: ‘Oh Sam…I feel so lucky I got the chance to know and work with you. You were the the kindest, funniest man. Sending so much love to your family. Rest In Peace.’
Series creator Bill Lawrence posted a BTS picture from the show and wrote: ‘Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many.’
He added: ‘Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it – he had the biggest heart of all of us. 
‘But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones. #RIPTed.’
Actress Kate Micucci played Ted’s girlfriend Stephanie Gooch on the show, and posted a picture with Sam to Twitter.
‘So sad to hear the news about Sam Lloyd,’ she tweeted.
‘Sam was one of the warmest, funniest and most generous actors I’ve ever worked with. I loved getting to sing with him and it was an honor to play his girlfriend on Scrubs. He will be so missed.’
Robert Maschio, who played The Todd on Scrubs, tweeted a selfie with Sam and wrote: ‘Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met. Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace.’
Meanwhile, other actors who had worked with Sam on different shows also shared their condolences.
The Masked Singer judge Ken Jeong tweeted: ‘I was just talking about Sam Lloyd and how amazing he was when he appeared on @DrKenABC. Oh man, this hurts. It was a true honor working with you. A genius and a gentleman. Rest In Peace.’
While Lloyd was best known for his role as miserable lawyer Ted, he also starred on shows including Seinfeld, The West Wing and Desperate Housewives, and reprised his role of Ted Buckland in Cougar Town. 
Lloyd is survived by his wife Vanessa and their son Weston.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd, ‘Scrubs’ star, dies of brain tumour at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, an American actor renowned for his role as Ted Buckland in ‘Scrubs’, a comedy-drama television series, has died after battling a brain tumor.
In January last year, the 56-year-old singer was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor and cancer, which eventually spread to his lungs, jaw, liver, and spine.
Lloyd, however, breathed his last on Thursday, a year after Vanessa Lloyd, his wife, had given birth to their first child together.
“Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many,” Bill Lawrence, the creator of ‘Scrubs’, said while confirming his death on Friday.
“Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with,” Zach Braff, another US actor, who also played a role in ‘Scrubs’, wrote while paying tributes to the late actor.
“Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.”
Lloyd is also known for his roles in a slew of TV shows including ‘Desperate Housewives’, ‘Happy Together’, ‘Shameless’, ‘The West Wing’, and ‘Modern Family’.
He also had guest spots on ‘Spin City’ and ‘Seinfeld’ and notable credits in films like ‘Galaxy Quest’ and “Flubber’. The late actor is survived by his wife and a child.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' actor Sam Lloyd has died</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known as sad-sack lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, died Friday. He was 56.
The actor had been diagnosed with lung cancer in January 2019, per Entertainment Weekly, only weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their first child. At the time, doctors discovered an inoperable tumor in his brain. 
Lloyd, who is the nephew of Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd, had screen career spanning three decades. He jumped between TV and film, in projects as wide-ranging as Flubber, Galaxy Quest, Seinfeld, The West Wing, and Desperate Housewives. 
In addition to his work as an actor, Lloyd was an accomplished musician with the a cappella group The Blanks (which Scrubs fans might recognize as The Worthless Peons) and the Beatles cover band The Butties.
But Lloyd was probably most recognizable as Ted on Scrubs, appearing in all nine seasons and even reprising the role for a guest arc in Cougar Town. 
Some of Lloyd's former colleagues paid tribute to him on social media, including Scrubs star Zach Braff and Scrubs and Cougar Town creator Bill Lawrence.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs Actor Sam Lloyd Dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd, perhaps best known for his turn as morose hospital lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, has died at the age of 56. According to a GoFundMe established to help Lloyd and his family last year, the actor learned he had an inoperable brain tumor in January 2019, the result of metastatic lung cancer.
In addition to playing Scrubs’ ever-present sad-sack attorney, Lloyd appeared on Cougar Town, Modern Family, Desperate Housewives, and in films like 1997’s Flubber and 1999’s Galaxy Quest. Lloyd was the nephew of actor Christopher Lloyd, both of whom appeared on Malcom in the Middle and The West Wing. A lifelong musician, Lloyd’s a cappella group, the Blanks, appeared on Scrubs as Ted’s own a cappella group. The actor is survived by wife Vanessa Lloyd and their son, Weston.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs actor Sam Lloyd dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON – Scrubs star Sam Lloyd has died at the age of 56, after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
The actor, who was the nephew of actor Christopher Lloyd and played lawyer Ted Buckland in the medical comedy series, died on Thursday after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife previously launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for Lloyd as he battled the disease and his death was announced on the site.
They wrote: "Our dear sweet Sammy has passed away.
"On April 30th at a respiratory facility in Los Angeles with his beautiful wife, Vanessa, at his side and his sister, Laurel, FaceTiming from New Hampshire, Samuel Lloyd Jr. left this earth and was reunited with his dad (Samuel Lloyd Sr.), his mom (Marianna McGuffin), and his brother (Jackson Lloyd).
"Sam's fight began on 17 January 2019 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer that metastasized to his brain, liver, spine, and jaw. Things did not look good. After an outpouring of love from Sam's friends and people from all over the world, Sam was put on a new targeted therapy drug and had an amazing resurgence. For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment. He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom's hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, 'he made music along the way'.
"At the end of 2019, Sam found out that the targeted therapy drug which had given him such a miraculous second chance had lost its effectiveness. Determined to live, and with so much to live for, Sam fought hard, enduring multiple brain surgeries, and endless tests and procedures. Despite all these things, Sam always mustered up the strength to say "I love you" to Vanessa, Weston, and his many close friends who came to visit him.
"Eventually the fight became more intense and Sam slipped into a coma for nearly two months.
Vanessa never stopped believing that Sam would rebound and be reunited with her and Weston and all the people who love Sam so much. She stayed by his side day in and day out - even figuring out ways to visit him during the COVID restrictions.
"But alas it was time for Sam to leave this world. A world that he made a better place every day of his life.
"Rest in peace sweet, sweet Sammy boy. We loved you more than words can tell."
_Scrubs _creator Bill Lawrence wrote on Twitter: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
And show star Zach Braff added: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
"He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Lloyd - who also appeared in Cougar Town, Desperate Housewives, The West Wing and Malcolm in the Middle - is survived by his wife Vanessa and their son Weston.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Twitter is usually swirling with insults of one kind or another. Courtesy and logic go out the window. The satisfaction of unburdening oneself in the bluntest of terms might be momentarily cathartic for the writer but it’s a turn-off for many and, thankfully, soon swallowed up by the next wave of commentary.
The umbrage taken on Twitter to people merely expressing a different view is odd. Differences are everywhere: Collingwood or Carlton, AFL or NRL, Liberal or Labor, sweet or sour, cats or dogs, lark or owl, to name just a few It has never been difficult to identify how we are different and the starting point should be that different people may have different views, which they are entitled to express. That they should do so respectfully, engaging with ideas rather than attacking another person in a personal way, seems an implied rule of civilised society, required to enable it to function without descending into chaos.
Those who enlist as foot soldiers on the frontline of a keyboard battle – generating so much noise and aggression – seem to forget that the purpose of a debate is to persuade. The vitriol does not get us anywhere.
Beneath these layers of difference are the things we have in common: we love our families, have friends we cherish. We try our hardest in the unpredictable twists and turns of life. Sometimes our courage will be tested. We have an effect on those around us and the power to make it a positive or negative experience. Little acts of kindness, given to another generously, are rarely forgotten. We all leave this world through the same door.
We are bound by the bonds of our shared humanity, mortal and vulnerable. Each of us is entitled to be accorded a certain dignity as a unique individual.
Life is shorter than we think, precious and unrepeatable. Time is fleeting. Can we not, therefore, work harder to find something to appreciate in one other? If we have no peace, stated Mother Theresa, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.
The skill is not in identifying differences but in finding common ground and being objective enough to separate opinions that we might find annoying or distasteful from the person who expressed them, by seeking to understand the person and why they hold such views. As we hear everywhere, especially in these times of global pandemic, we are all in this together.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Emperor’s New Words: Trump Insists Word Salad Is Steak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Politics aside, a fair observer of Trump’s public appearances has to acknowledge that the president’s spontaneous speech is quite often bumbling, tangential, and bordering on the nonsensical. You can read sample quotes here,here, here, here or here, Etc.
Put these words in the mouth of a party guest, or a colleague during a Zoom meeting, and people may roll their eyes, snicker or feel pity, assume the person is drunk, distracted, or otherwise not quite all there. Put his words in the mouth of a child, and it may prompt a hurried call to the nearest speech-language pathologist to schedule an assessment.
Now, notwithstanding the fact that political leaders are supposed to be able to think and communicate clearly and responsibly as part of their job description in a democracy, occasions of rambling and incoherent speech are not political crimes or sins, nor signs of corruption or inherent incompetence. Misspeaking in public is neither an illness nor a character flaw. We’ve all been there ourselves, caught unprepared or tongue-tied, having missed our last train of thought; and we’ve seen our leaders there before, too. Speaking (or tweeting) badly is far from the worst thing a bad politician can do.
A reasonable, rational (and healthy) response to such occasions, from the politician and his political supporters, would have been to own the facts, apologize, offer a correction and clarification, and get on with the work; or, in the least, acknowledge the tendency toward slippage, deem it regretful yet ultimately benign, and crack some self-deprecating joke about it. The president likes to riff, and with that comes the known risk of stumbling into the inscrutable. Now let’s get on with doing the people’s important business.
But Trump and his ardent core supporters have taken another route altogether. Whenever he’s caught in another obvious incoherent fumble, they lash out at the press, the media, the deep state or some other external entity; deny it happened altogether, deny again, or deny it was the bungle it clearly was, insisting his word salad was, in fact, steak.
That reaction, rather than the bumbling itself, manifests a core corruption of Trump and his cultists—the rabid insistence that gibberish is poetry, that covfefe is a real word, albeit secret; that, in other words, the leader’s obvious faults do not in fact exist.
Politics aside, to the honest outside observer that reaction seems both unnecessary and ineffective. And it begs for explanation. So, what is it that compels Trump and his enablers to deny the clear evidence of our ears? To treat utter nonsense with fawning reverence?
Part of the answer--like part of any answer--has to do with the structure of the human mind. In this case the culprit is a principle known as ‘context effect,’ which occurs when we use environmental cues around a certain person, object or event to evaluate it. Psychological research has shown convincingly that context matters.To wit: Work that is presented in the museum will be evaluated more positively than the same work presented in a lab. A brilliant musician playing his million-dollar violin will fetch top dollar and draw adoring, and paying, audiences when appearing at Carnegie Hall, but will be ignored when busking at a busy subway station.
Included under the umbrella of context effects are the specific effects of social role. When you go to the dentist, you let a stranger put his fingers in your mouth. Why? Because the fact that the dentist is a stranger is eclipsed in your judgment by the fact of the role they occupy—a dental professional. The role shapes our reaction to the person; thus the role, to an extent, makes the person. So, once you occupy a powerful role, people project upon you the qualities they have come to associate with the role, regardless of your own true qualities.
The dentist’s role involves having expertise about teeth. If he says something about teeth that seems odd to us, we’re likely to first question our own knowledge, not his competence. The president’s role involves knowing things about running the country. If the president says something about it that strikes us as odd, we’ll suspect our ears first.
In addition, powerful people can demand big sacrifices. Making those sacrifices makes us more loyal to those in power, since we have to justify to ourselves our own obedience. We must, in psych parlance, resolve a cognitive dissonance. Those who lost a family member to war tend to become more, not less, patriotic. The country must be great and important; otherwise, how to justify the great sacrifice? Those who’ve been hazed in boot camp or fraternity initiation become more, not less committed to the organization. Those who agree to humiliatingly sever their critical faculties to bask in Trump’s reflected glory and gain his approval will consequently hold him in higher esteem.
Thus, having become more loyal and dependent on the leader for their sense of power and identity, the followers are then compelled to elevate him in their minds toward the place of greatness, of infallibility. If the leader is infallible, than whatever he says can’t by definition be fallible. If the emperor says it’s a new lavish gown, then that’s what it is, and those who can’t see it are stupid. If the president says ‘covfefe’ is a word, then it is, and those who don’t know it are just not in on the secret.
This dynamic amounts to a hermetically sealed tautology: The leader said it because it is true. It is true because the leader said it. For many people, particularly those who feel besieged, anxious, and confused, such logic provides clarity and simplicity, which in turn offer a welcome relief from suffering.
Another part of the explanation has to do with Trump himself. Proper political leadership, quite like parenting, requires a robust measure of self-confidence. Over-confidence, however—in both parents and politicians—can turn toxic if it crosses over into narcissism. Trump’s narcissistic tendencies are pronounced and well documented. He checks all the boxes that make up this construct: He possesses a grandiose self image, an inflated ego, a ravenous need for attention, and the urge to be admired and seen as special, coupled with a habit of lashing out viciously at those who fail to see him as such.
Trump’s narcissism helps explain his and his followers’ reflexive blanket denial of his obvious public speech blunders, in several ways. For one, due to their disproportional (and paradoxical) sensitivity to any hint of criticism, narcissists tend to attract and select into their camp mostly followers who worship them. In turn, fervid true believers are much more likely than casual fans to go along with anything the leader says and take gibberish as gospel.
The president further fuels this devotion by heaping praise on those who praise him and scorn on all others, a ‘splitting’ mechanism commonly used by narcissistic individuals. The praise is effusive (“great people;” “the best people”) but ultimately hallow, since it is not premised on his followers’ merits but on their admiration of him. To the narcissist, people are valued only to the extent that they are admirers.
Second, the narcissist, feeling he’s better than all, tends to play by his own rules while merrily violating existing ones. This is attractive to us since it fulfills vicariously our own fantasy of freeing ourselves from the hard chore of minding others, and from the bounds of doubt, guilt, and remorse. This is why movie villains are so appealing and seductive to us. They don’t follow the rules and thus give voice to our own selfish and nihilistic impulses. That’s why the hero-villain formula never goes extinct. We don’t really want a world without villains because they represent a foundational part of our psyche. When the villain dies, a part of us dies with him.
Finally, narcissistic men tend to avoid self-reflection and, consequently, have little self-doubt. We are prone to conflate male confidence with competence, even though the two are neither inherently nor frequently connected. We are attracted to those who believe they know everything because we are anxious about the inherent incompleteness of all knowledge. This is why we make our God perfect and all-knowing—a projected fantasy of order and safety. Likewise, propping up the fiction that Trump makes sense when he doesn’t allows his followers to protect their own sense of safety and security. In their world, Covfefe is not just a word; it is The Word.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Online dating surges as singles entertain themselves in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The use of dating apps has skyrocketed as singles spend the coronavirus lockdown matching and messaging prospective partners, but taking the next step to meeting in real life remains fraught.
A leading epidemiologist has warned that even when restrictions start to ease, lovers could be limited to dating within the "germ bubble" of their own postcode, to reduce the chance of a new wave of infections.
Last weekend, activity on RSVP - including the number of members on the site and the volume of virtual winks and messages - was 45 per cent higher than in mid-March when Australia went into lockdown.
It was also 10 per cent higher than the period before lockdown, which includes Valentine's Day and is RSVP's busiest time of year.
Meanwhile, the Inner Circle, a dating platform for young professionals, reports a 64.5 per cent increase in matches since mid-March in Australia when stricter travel restrictions were imposed.
The number of messages sent by Australians through the platform was up 140 per cent. Globally, there has been a 99 per cent increase in matches and a 116 per cent increase in messages.
John Francis, 39, an IT project manager who lives in Millers Point near the CBD, said he had been spending a lot more time on dating sites, including the Inner Circle and Tinder. He used to get a couple of matches a month but is now getting one a day, progressing from exchanging messages on the platform to phone calls and FaceTime.
Mr Francis, who moved to Sydney a year ago, said he was looking forward to going on dates in real life and had a shortlist of two or three women he would like to meet.
Restrictions eased on Friday to allow up to two adults and any dependent children to visit another household in their home but Mr Francis said this did not help with planning a first date.
"It's too way early to go to a person's house," he said. "I'm a little bit confused as to how to take the next step - I just hope they start opening the restaurants and bars soon.
"You need to keep that spark of interest going for a very long time without actually seeing the person and that is very tough."
A Sydney lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had been doing more matching and messaging on dating platforms but would not take the next step until the pandemic risk had abated.
"You would be surprised at the guys who wanted to hook up at the height of the COVID curve, including one who purported to be a radiographer," she said. "No thanks!"
Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist from the University of NSW, said a revival of dating could lead to a second wave of infections.
"It's potentially going to be an amplification if there are any hidden infections out there if people are meeting up with many people that they've identified as being of interest to them," she said.
Professor McLaws said when restrictions ease, people might be asked to stay in the "germ bubble" of their postcode, meaning they could date people from their suburb but not another part of Sydney.
Given most restaurant tables did not span 1.5 metres, she suggested people might go on first dates wearing masks - though she warned they could become "hot and uncomfortable".
Matchmaker and dating coach Louanne Ward said there would be a lot of time-wasters and scammers on the online platforms at the moment.
"You've got a lot of people who are looking for entertainment at the moment, they've got no intention of following through," she said.
"They're bored and they might be doing it under their partner's noses - they're window shopping, they're tyre kicking, they're having a look to see if the grass is greener on the other side of the fence."
Ms Ward also warned romance scammers would be out in force, with the pandemic and lockdown providing the perfect excuse to avoid meeting up in person and the opportunity to invent new and compelling sob stories.
Meanwhile, many people are turning to sex toys to spice up life in lockdown. Adulttoymegastore owner Nicola Relph said sales were "unprecedented".
NSW was the biggest market for sex toys, with hot spots in Sydney, the Hunter Valley and Coffs Harbour. Melbourne, Mildura and Ballarat were the biggest markets in Victoria.
"We opened in 2009 and nothing has come close to the sales we've had in Australia in the past three weeks," Ms Relph said.

It was also 10 per cent higher than the period before lockdown, which includes Valentine's Day and is RSVP's busiest time of year.
Meanwhile, the Inner Circle, a dating platform for young professionals, reports a 64.5 per cent increase in matches since mid-March in Australia when stricter travel restrictions were imposed.
The number of messages sent by Australians through the platform was up 140 per cent. Globally, there has been a 99 per cent increase in matches and a 116 per cent increase in messages.
John Francis, 39, an IT project manager who lives in Millers Point near the CBD, said he had been spending a lot more time on dating sites, including the Inner Circle and Tinder. He used to get a couple of matches a month but is now getting one a day, progressing from exchanging messages on the platform to phone calls and FaceTime.
Mr Francis, who moved to Sydney a year ago, said he was looking forward to going on dates in real life and had a shortlist of two or three women he would like to meet.
Restrictions eased on Friday to allow up to two adults and any dependent children to visit another household in their home but Mr Francis said this did not help with planning a first date.
"It's too way early to go to a person's house," he said. "I'm a little bit confused as to how to take the next step - I just hope they start opening the restaurants and bars soon.
"You need to keep that spark of interest going for a very long time without actually seeing the person and that is very tough."
A Sydney lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had been doing more matching and messaging on dating platforms but would not take the next step until the pandemic risk had abated.
"You would be surprised at the guys who wanted to hook up at the height of the COVID curve, including one who purported to be a radiographer," she said. "No thanks!"
Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist from the University of NSW, said a revival of dating could lead to a second wave of infections.
"It's potentially going to be an amplification if there are any hidden infections out there if people are meeting up with many people that they've identified as being of interest to them," she said.
Professor McLaws said when restrictions ease, people might be asked to stay in the "germ bubble" of their postcode, meaning they could date people from their suburb but not another part of Sydney.
Given most restaurant tables did not span 1.5 metres, she suggested people might go on first dates wearing masks - though she warned they could become "hot and uncomfortable".
Matchmaker and dating coach Louanne Ward said there would be a lot of time-wasters and scammers on the online platforms at the moment.
"You've got a lot of people who are looking for entertainment at the moment, they've got no intention of following through," she said.
"They're bored and they might be doing it under their partner's noses - they're window shopping, they're tyre kicking, they're having a look to see if the grass is greener on the other side of the fence."
Ms Ward also warned romance scammers would be out in force, with the pandemic and lockdown providing the perfect excuse to avoid meeting up in person and the opportunity to invent new and compelling sob stories.
Meanwhile, many people are turning to sex toys to spice up life in lockdown. Adulttoymegastore owner Nicola Relph said sales were "unprecedented".
NSW was the biggest market for sex toys, with hot spots in Sydney, the Hunter Valley and Coffs Harbour. Melbourne, Mildura and Ballarat were the biggest markets in Victoria.
"We opened in 2009 and nothing has come close to the sales we've had in Australia in the past three weeks," Ms Relph said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.
Talk about the swings and roundabouts of racing. Sylvia's Memory was sidelined for about a year before finally returning with a clean bill of health at the trials a month ago and has been taken along quietly since.
Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.
Talk about the swings and roundabouts of racing. Sylvia's Memory was sidelined for about a year before finally returning with a clean bill of health at the trials a month ago and has been taken along quietly since.
Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

INTERNATIONAL JAZZ DAY LIVE STREAM ★★★★
April 30
Reviewed by JOHN SHAND
International Jazz Day (April 30) has celebrated jazz's role in helping unite people the world over since 2011. This year, when the host nation was to have been South Africa, it was, instead, another reminder of a community splintered into an epidemic of isolation. But, thanks to a commendable collaboration between the Sydney Improvised Music Association and Johnston St Jazz, a 140-minute mini-festival occurred via two livestreams and one pre-recorded concert.
If the bands chosen could have more thoroughly reflected the sheer diversity of what passes for jazz, they were all able to bridge the livestream remoteness. Over half the time was allotted to the final act, the Jeremy Rose Quartet, with Rose having become a composer of note, especially via his major work, Iron in the Blood, which was included in the distant memory that is this year's Sydney Festival.
Although Rose's work for his quartet stays much closer to the jazz mainstream than does Iron in the Blood, he still finds fresh compositional ideas with which to prod the idiom and to stimulate improvising options. In the piano solo on the meditative Religion, for instance, Steve Barry could deploy all his capacity to tease, suspend or subvert the listener's expectations. The dark, edgy and aptly named Precipice began with solo bass from Noel Mason, which beckoned Rose's bass clarinet, the instrument on which he has developed his most distinctive voice and widest palette of colours. On the brilliantly evocative Aktau, Mason's bass seemed to convey the enormity of Kazakhstan's White Mountains, Rose's tenor the altitude, Barry's piano the crystalline air, and Alex Hirlian's drums the excitement.
The Mezza/Ginsburg Ensemble, a collaboration co-led by Italian pianist Vittorio Mezza and Australian pianist Mark Ginsburg (with bassist Karl Dunnicliff and drummer Tim Firth) was filmed at last year's Sydney Con International Jazz Festival, and suddenly it was novel to see an audience on hand! Dunnicliff produced notably fine solos on two of Ginsburg's pieces: the gentle For You and Common Purpose, the latter made lush with the addition of a substantial choir.
Vocalist Kate Wadey, pianist Andrew Scott and bassist Sam Dobson opened the celebration and, while Wadey's breathy, unforced singing was especially effective on I've Got a Crush on You, with the piano dancing behind her, the rest of the performance proved more uneven.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Southern Queensland dips below freezing as mercury hits minus 2 degrees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The southern Queensland town of Applethorpe near the New South Wales border has plummeted to minus 2 degrees on Monday morning in a final chill for the state's weekend cold snap.
The Bureau of Meteorology expects the weather to warm up from Tuesday and Wednesday in Queensland's coastal areas, while inland parts should get relief from Thursday to Saturday.
On Monday, Darling Downs and Granite Belt was coldest with Applethorpe's minus 2 degrees, Oakey, near Toowoomba, had minus 0.2 and Warwick, south of Toowoomba, got 0.1.
In the south-east, the Scenic Rim town of Canungra shivered through 2.4 degrees, the Logan suburb of Greenbank hit 3.8, the Ipswich suburb of Amberley recorded 3.9, the Scenic Rim town of Beaudesert experienced 4.1 and Gatton in the Lockyer Valley got 5.2 degrees.
Brisbane dropped to 11.6 degrees on Monday, the Gold Coast Seaway recorded 12.5 and the Sunshine Coast Airport had a low of 12.4.
In the Wide Bay and Burnett region, Kingaroy shivered through 1.7 degrees, Gympie had a minimum of 5.3 and Gayndah recorded 5.5.
Roma, 430 kilometres north-west of Brisbane, in the Maranoa region dropped to 0.7 degrees.
Weather bureau senior meteorologist Gabriel Branescu said the Sunshine Coast was 7 degrees below the May average on Sunday, while the Wide Bay region recorded 7-10 degrees below average.
"We have a slow-moving high-pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directing the really dry and cool air mass directly across the state," he said.
“Temperatures will start to moderate from Tuesday and Wednesday next week as the winds will tend more easterly and bring in more moisture from the ocean.
"We’re expecting the minimum temperatures to stay about 13 or 14 degrees in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, around 11 or 12 degrees in the Gold Coast area.
"Cool temperatures will remain inland for another two or three mornings until the warmer and more moist air mass makes its way to the Northern Territory border later next week."
On Saturday, the mercury in Oakey, west of Toowoomba, sank to minus 0.4 degrees and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, broke the freezing barrier by the narrowest of margins with minus 0.1.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Perth to get first taste of winter after glorious autumn weather</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A cold front bringing buckets of rain and damaging winds has sparked a severe weather warning for the Perth metropolitan area, the South West and parts of the Great Southern and Southern coastal districts.
The Bureau of Meteorology said a cold front will move through the state, bringing showers, isolated thunderstorms and winds with speeds of up to 100km/h which could damage properties.
The damaging winds are most likely to occur ahead of the leading edge of the storm but thunderstorms but showers and gusty winds will continue through much of Monday morning.
Bureau of Meteorology spokesman Neil Bennett said the worst of the storm would hit Perth in the afternoon.
"We are expecting some very localised gusty winds of up to 100 km/h. But the key thing with this front is the rain, we are expecting some decent falls out this one, round about 20 millimetres for Perth," he said.
"The strongest winds will probably be about mid-afternoon and continuing with rain right through the afternoon and the evening and then slowly easing off."
On Tuesday evening a much stronger cold front is expected to come through, bringing with it more thunderstorms affecting communities in Albany, Bunbury, Busselton, Mandurah, Margaret River, Mount Barker and the Perth metropolitan area.
"We are more concerned with a front due to arrive during Tuesday evening, it does look like it will be a particularly strong front," Mr Bennett said.
He said the front is due to go through the state from mid-afternoon and winds with speeds of up to 125km/h were possible.
"This is a very much stronger front ...[it] will be packing much more of a punch."
The wet weather will continue throughout the rest of the week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘I am in too many WhatsApp groups I don’t want to be in’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: you keep getting pushed into rooms full of people, entirely against your will. Some of the people in this room, you like. Many, you barely tolerate. Yet you have to stick around, because the person who pushed you into the room will probably get offended if you try to leave.
It may sound like one of those crazy dreams we’re all having, but it’s the reality of being added to WhatsApp groups you don’t want to be in. Clearly, the online etiquette rulebook has been ripped up in what we’ll delicately call These New Times We Live In.
What was once a handy messaging service on our smartphones has now become a hotbed of cliques, banter and social trip-wires. Because the leaving and joining of these WhatsApp groups is more delicate than I ever could have imagined.
Zoom quizzes five nights a week I can manage, just about. Watching films along with groups of friends I am happy to tolerate (though honestly, how did our social schedules get so packed?). But this, the unsolicited and wayward WhatsApp group adding – it’s too much.
Because we are all using WhatsApp for work, the app is on, all the time. And this does leave most people with a smartphone in a particular quandary. Now it’s impossible to avoid the people and conversations that you could easily sidestep in real life.
Remember how we all used to say, “we must get together for pints soon”? Well, “we must get together for a Zoom soon” has decidedly less chime to it. Worse again, people are inclined to take you up on your non-offer.
I get it: everyone is looking for a social connection in These New Times We Live In. Those who live on their own want to keep socially busy. Of course people want to instigate conversations with their nearest and dearest. I just don’t understand why I, neither near nor dear, have to be involved.
Everyone has been added to at least one of these WhatsApp groups. There’s the “Wahey, we’re the wild mums” group, where the main conversational cornerstone is asking about when gin o’clock is happening, as though this is the first time gin o’clock has ever occurred to anyone in the world. They ask this at 2pm, every day.
Then, there’s the WhatsApp group in which everyone is The Best Pandemic Person, doing all sorts of strenuously performative things such as sharing sourdough recipes, showing off their painted ceiling and writing things like, “Five minutes until Joe Wick’s PE class! See you all there!” If you could set fire to a WhatsApp group, it would be this one.
There’s also the neighbours group, where messages about brown bins and teenagers not social distancing fly back and forth, making up most of the “chat”.
Then, there’s the old school friends WhatsApp (Covid Class of ’94), in which there’s always one member who has way too much time on their hands. This person is only too happy to post damning pictures of everyone sporting hockey goalie apparel/dreadlocks/penny loafers/horrifyingly hormonal acne/all of the above. Pictures that we thought and hoped would never see the light of day again, if it weren’t for this pesky WhatsApp. Of course, you have to *crying with laughter emoji * along, and be a good sport. As if life isn’t exhausting enough right now.
Worst of all, there’s the WhatsApp group that you have been added to by a girl you met in the toilet queue at Electric Picnic, years ago. In your compromised (read: absolutely leathered) state, you bonded over not having a wet wipe to call your own, and you swore to be pals forever.
Come the following Monday, of course, you looked at your new Facebook friend requests and wondered aloud: “Who the hell is Claire?” But Claire remembered. Claire remembered, and true to her word, took you into the squidgy bosom of her social circle, obediently liking every time you so much as sneezed on social media.
And now you find yourself in a WhatsApp group with her and 13 strangers, trying to ignore links to articles on 5G masts. Bloody Electric Picnic.
My favourite group, of course, is the media one, where an industry colleague added a cluster of film/TV/writer/newspaper types to a WhatsApp group, ostensibly so we could have a gripe about the precarious futures of our respective industries. Alas, there were so many egos, rivalries and enemies in the group that the conversation didn’t last beyond the first message.
Occasionally, you’ll be notified that someone Has Left The Group. This is not unlike taking a full-page advert out in this very newspaper that says “I Hate You All”. And so you stay. You stay and you endure.
I dream of starting a WhatsApp group full of people I actually like. But then, you become the creator of one of these WhatsApp groups, and who wants to be one of those? Nope, best to tell everyone that you’ll see them for pints soon. And this time, you can sort of mean it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Check If Your Tweets Have Been Quoted In The Media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As one who is never very witty on Twitter, I have almost no concern that anything I type is going to get highlighted on a website or in a news story somewhere—not unless someone really cares about my thoughts on cats and Animal Crossing. However, there’s a quick and easy way to see for yourself if your Twitter wit has ever been picked up elsewhere. (And you might be surprised!)
Said tip comes from Twitter directly:
When I tried, this, my results were all boring. I blame this on my enthusiasm for dropping my Twitter handle in every story I write ever, in a semi-delusional attempt at making myself popular through brute force. (It still hasn’t worked; maybe I need to work on tweeting more dad jokes.)
Others had more far more fulfilling (and surprising) results:
And, of course, the Twitter users quoted above will see that they were quoted in this article next time they run a search on themselves; the great circle of life continues.
This is also a great reminder that if you’re looking to back down on your Twitter fame at any point, looking up what you’ve been quoted saying and then deleting that tweet can help you reclaim a sliver of anonymity. (That’s assuming the media entity in question didn’t screenshot your tweet and embed that, instead of embedding the tweet itself.)
It’s also not the worst habit to set up some kind of auto-deletion mechanism for your older tweets. Sure, they won’t be there to pad your engagement stats—for the few of you that care about that sort of thing—but it never hurts to make sure that a snarky tweet you published years ago doesn’t come back to haunt you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I wish I'd made this simple macOS tweak years ago | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It took seconds to do, but it's made my Macs so much better and easier to use.
This is so simple I'm kicking myself I that I haven't done it years ago.I don't tweak operating systems as much as I used to. In fact, beyond setting a wallpaper and adjusting the cursor speed, I generally leave things as they are, in the assumption that what I'll mostly achieve through tweaking is making this worse.But the other day I became frustrated. I realized that I was continually losing my cursor on my Mac. I have so many windows open that is was just blending into the background.Now, before you all leave me a comment, I know about the "shake mouse pointer to locate" feature where you violently shake the cursor back and forth to make it temporarily bigger and easier to see. That's handy for sure, but it's distracting.So, what's the alternative?
Must read:How sensitive is the FLIR Lepton thermal camera built into the Blackview BV9800 Pro?Just make the darn cursor bigger!
And it's really easy to do!Fire up System Preferences, and then click Accessibility. Then click on Display in the left-hand column, and then choose Cursor (alternatively, you can just type cursor into the search box in System Preferences and click on the result).
Then just drag the Cursor size slider to suit, where you can choose from just a little bigger to ginormous!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Buescher is ready to restart the NASCAR season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - During this time of the pandemic, a lot of NASCAR driver used I Racing to keep their skills sharp, but Cup Series driver Chris Buescher says this restart of NASCAR could not have come at a better time.
“We are all competitive natured and if we sit around too long, we’re going to all be racing lawn mowers across the front yard,” said Buescher. “That doesn’t help our skill set and the I Racing hasn’t quite scratched that itch for me. I need to get in a race car and have that feeling, the power behind you, the smells that are going to go along with it. It sounds a little strange but there’s nothing like doing the real thing.”
Buescher’s best finish this season was a 3rd place finish in the Daytona 500. In that same race, his team mate at Roush Fenway Racing, Ryan Newman, had a scary crash at the finish line. He would sustain a head injury that took him out the #6 car for the next 3 races. Just last week, Newman was cleared to race again and he will be back in his ride May 17th in Darlington.
“He’s getting that itch that we all have as race car drivers to get back in that seat and go be competitive,” said Buescher. “He is eligible for the playoffs as we go back to racing which is awesome. I’m excited to get back on track with him and learn from him and really happy to see him doing so well.”
As the series gets ready to go back racing, things will look a whole lot different. They will race without fans for the first 2 stops at Darlington and Charlotte which is going to be weird.
“The amount of people in the stands, cheering and screaming to the smoke rolling out of the infield from everybody cooking and tailgating-- none of that is going to be there,” said Buescher. “It’s going to be still and quiet and just spooky.”
And that is why it is going to be important to put on a great show for the fans to watch on TV.
Of course Buescher hopes that show includes a win soon. He has one career victory in the Cup Series back in 2016 at the rain and fog shorten Pennsylvania 400 at Pocono.
“We did not go to the typical victory lane because there were tornadoes in the area,” said the 2015 Xfinity Series Champ. “The bottom fell out of the sky and it flooded the garage so we were in a make shift area and we didn’t get the normal celebration that everybody does.”
Which is great preparation for what victory lane could be now in the days of COVID-19. Normally it is packed with team members, the media, and sponsors but because of social distancing, that can not happen now.
“I guess if we go win Darlington, it will be the same situation. I won’t complain about it one bit. I’d love to go win that race."
And he will have his chance 16 days from now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MALE PERSPECTIVE: Tips on dating a much older woman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I had not even realised it until one of my boys pointed it out to me - that I always dated older.
Not crazy older, one to three years older, and so when he asked me “what’s up with that?” I did not know what to say. There was nothing up with anything – it’s what it was.
I wanted us to talk about what it is like for us guys in our 20s to be with older ladies - women who are 10-15 years older.
I’ve had my fair share of experience with ladies in that age bracket, and so have many of my age-mates; they just won’t talk about it.
The thing about dating an older woman is that people assume she is your sponsor/blesser/sugar mummy or whatever it is they are called these days.
And that is why most guys will always be shy about saying it loud; people assume that you are a 'kept boy', someone’s sex toy. The only thing further from the truth is the colour of Balala’s hair.
This is not always about money. Power to those who dated older for nothing else other than the fiduciary implications. But you know what?
Being older does not necessarily come with having money to throw around. People do not get to 35 and all of a sudden qualify for benefits from the government.
RULE ONE
If anything, they probably have more responsibilities: a child from a previous engagement, a business they are trying to bring up in this economy, a house they building - whatever.
And so the first rule of dating older is this - forget about money. Do not ask for it, and if one day they send you something, send it back unless it was previously agreed.
They can buy you a drink or take you on dates, but hard cash is a hard sell. You will get a wide variety of women in that space.
Most common is the divorced or separated kind who are loving the woman they are becoming and putting themselves first.
There is the one who - for whatever reason - never really got married or had kids, and is always seeking a new thrill.
There will be the single mom with a 'katoi' who will start calling you uncle and then it starts feeling weird.
And then there is the married one - who walked out of that marriage in her heart and mind a long time ago, but still stays.
RULE TWO
Stay away from the married ones if you can. Too risky. You’d be surprised at how cheap a bullet goes for in this Nairobi.
One day you will take her dancing, and the next thing you know, those Ghanaian funeral dancers are performing at your wake.
But with every risky situation comes a rush, a thrill. I hope it’s worth it for you.
There are so many misconceptions about dating older women. Yet that is probably one of the best things you can ever do for yourself.
These women have a certain clarity about them. Having lived longer, they know things. They won’t throw a tantrum because you cancelled a date.
They won’t go online to write a Twitter thread about you just because you forgot her birthday. And the sex - well, let’s just say seasoned food always tastes better for a reason.
Listen, if you are a young single guy in Nairobi, then perhaps you need to expand your horizons a little bit. Stretch your pallet.
Ask a 40-year-old lady out. Her life just began, after all, and yours is at its best. What is the worst that could happen?

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Social Distancing Skin-Care Stars Our Editors Are Swearing by This Month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As POPSUGAR editors, we independently select and write about stuff we love and think you'll like too. POPSUGAR has affiliate and advertising partnerships so we get revenue from sharing this content and from your purchase.
Some of the best days, these days, seem to start when you're feeling down and out, wondering if the news alerts pinging your phone by the hour could get any weirder . . . and then in stomps a new skin-care product you've never tried before, all creamy or gel-like, ready and willing to lift you right up. "At your service," you imagine them saying, as if that's not the scariest beauty equivalent to Toy Story ever.
You see, a good moisturizer or face mask — and no, not that one — or even a soothing sunscreen can work wonders at sparking joy or boosting your mood. Not even POPSUGAR beauty editors are immune. That's why we asked them to share the skin-care treatments that offer a dose of self-care on a less-than-perfect day — even though they're all sort of blurring together at this point.
"You know how a pimple looks all open and raw after it comes to the surface from wearing an acne patch? The new Hero Cosmetics Rescue Balm ($13) is designed for use at that phase. It's a balmy ointment that provides a protective layer over the pimple. This not only helps it heal faster but also allows for layering makeup overtop without causing any further irritation." — Jessica Harrington, associate beauty editor
"Even among my most beloved skin-care products, they typically fall under one of two categories: the ones I dig but am willing to share with my girlfriend, and the ones I slyly hide away so I can relish in every last drop. I've formally filed the intensely hydrating, wildly decadent Kate Somerville DeliKate Recovery Cream ($80) in the latter camp – but even she seems to be attuned to how damn soothing it feels on skin, because I've caught her on many occasions trying to grab it when she thinks I'm not looking." — Kelsey Castañon, senior beauty editor
"When Dr. Jart launches a new face mask, I immediately add it to cart. This month, I'll be testing the Cryo Rubber Mask with Moisturizing Hyaluronic Acid ($14). The brand's 'rubber' formulas have always felt extra special, and I love how the serum is separate so I can apply it on skin first before putting the cool-colored mask on my face — it feels like the ingredients are really penetrating." — Lisa Sugar, editor-in-chief
"Wearing less makeup these past few weeks has given me the opportunity to focus more on perfecting my skin-care routine, and I've been paying special attention to the oily areas on my T-Zone, around my nose, and chin. My shiny spots require a product that has both acids and humectants in it that can refine my pores without drying them out — and the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner ($34) has done just that. This formula touts itself as a Korean Aqua Peel Facial in a bottle, complete with PHA and BHA to decongest pores, plus cactus water and hyaluronic acid to help the skin retain moisture. Since incorporating this into my at-home routine, I've noticed that my makeup glides on more smoothly (even if I'm applying less of it than normal) and my skin looks way less shiny every time I hop on my next Zoom." — Alanna Martine Kilkeary, associate beauty editor, Makeup.com
"Bless my roommate's heart because she has to put up with me and the bulk stock of this hand soap I keep in our apartment. I've been recently infatuated with all things coconut and vanilla, so finding the Bath & Body Works Vanilla Coconut Gentle Foaming Hand Soap ($8) that combines the two scents into one was a dream come true. The new packaging isn't too shabby either." — Samantha Sasso, associate native editor, Group Nine Media
"Shortly before we were all home-bound, I got a facial, during which the aesthetician told me that I have to work on brightening and hydrating my skin. It was that comment that made me almost immediately reach for the Bliss Bright Idea Vitamin C + Tri-Peptide Collagen Protecting & Brightening Moisturizer ($22) that I got not too long ago. It's a vegan product that uses vitamin C and collagen to moisturize and plump the skin on top of leaving you with a little glow. I use this every day after cleansing, and I personally love how it has not only made my skin feel so much softer, but it also doesn't leave me feeling super greasy like other moisturizers I've tried in the past." — Danielle Jackson, assistant beauty editor
"The only thing making me feel better about the break in my regularly scheduled facials is getting to do my own amateur versions on my partner (god, I am such a catch) and the Pause Well-Being Fascia Stimulating Tool ($115), I hear, has been a game-changing addition. Not only does it feel weighty and pro-grade in your hand, but it also perfectly fits to the contours of the face as you to glide it across skin. And I don't want to brag or anything, but she's never looked glowier." — KC
"I love an acid — glycolic, salicylic, retinoic, I adore them all. But lately my skin has been a little less tolerant of the stronger acids in my medicine cabinet. So I'm using Lancôme Rénergie Multi-Action Milk Peel ($80) instead. It exfoliates with lipo hydroxy acid while hydrating with vitamin E, linseed extract, and micelles. And it's called a "milk peel" — can you think of a more gentle sounding peel? I'll wait. After I use it, my skin feels silky, and I swear it's smoother after just a few weeks. Maybe I don't need a strong acid after all." — Dawn Davis, senior editorial director, Group Nine Media
"The Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Oil-Infused Serum ($59) delivers seriously dewy, hydrated skin with a single use. The lightweight oil-serum hybrid layers well under a moisturizer or, if you want a glass-skin like appearance, wears well on its own when pressed into the skin. (This is my signature work-from-home beauty look on days without meetings.)" — JH
"I'm constantly on the hunt for products that will fade the acne marks and discoloration on my chin from old breakouts. I practically bathe in vitamin C every morning but the stubborn spots still stay put. The SLMD Skincare Dark Spot Fix ($50) from Dr. Pimple Popper herself is a maximum strength hydroquinone spot lightener that works on everything from dark spots to age spots and acne scars. I've only used for it a few days now and call me crazy, but I already feel like I'm seeing some progress." — JH
"Renée Rouleau is a true skin guru — she's a font of knowledge in legit everything having to do with skin care and skin health. Much of my time during shelter in place has been spent poring over her skin-care blog (yes, I'm a little obsessed with her). I love every product I've tried from her eponymous line, but theMoisture Infusion Toner ($43) is a standout. Seriously, it's gotten to the point where I will rave about it to anyone who will listen. It's more like an emulsion than a toner, with a silky, milky texture that glides over your skin — the effect should be listed as the definition of dewy in the dictionary. It has especially been saving my skin as I experiment with a prescription-strength retinoid and has calmed all the dreaded redness and flaking." — Aviel Kanter, senior native content editor, Group Nine Media
"Normally, I'd wear this Tatcha The Liquid Silk Canvas Featherweight Protective Primer ($52) under my makeup, but since I'm wearing a hell of a lot less of it these days, it's been my solo beauty step in the morning. Normally, that'd terrify me, but it gives my skin a subtle blur that's practically undetectable on Zoom calls. I'll take it." — KC
"Many have already reported on the magic of Beauty Stat's Universal C Skin Refiner ($80), and while it is one of my absolute favorite products, I also want people to know about the brand's Universal Pro-Bio Moisture Boost Cream ($50). The two together are the dynamic duo. My skin feels instantly smoother, firmer with the vitamin C, but then topped off with the lightweight cream, it feels fully sealed in and quenched to perfection." — LS
"As the days of coming home late and just barely wiping my makeup off before bed have minimized to about zero, my nighttime skin-care routine has gotten a lot stronger. Part of this ritual is slapping on a silky lip mask every night to help keep my pout hydrated and flake-free when I wake up in the morning. Enter: the Then I Met You Honey Dew Lip Mask ($22), which I haven't been able to go overnight without since it landed in my mailbox. This super slinky mask/balm comes in a mess-free silicone tube form that easily swipes on as much or as little product as you need to coat your lips. It also contains Vitamin E, plus squalane and lactic acid to gently exfoliate and smooth. After I do my makeup in the morning, I apply a lighter coat for a glossy-balm finish which complements any WFH makeup mood, from a bare face to a little winged liner and mascara." — AMK
"If there's one thing I've been experimenting with lately, it's my nighttime skin routine. I could never really find a cream — even an oil — that lasted all night long, so I thought that maybe now would be the best time to play with every jar, tube, and bottle I own. Then, I found the Naturopathica Chill Full Spectrum CBD and Kava Balm ($76) sitting in my cabinet: completely unused. My initial concern about using it was the formula. Would it be too slippery and stain my pillow? Would it be so greasy that it would clog my pores? It did neither, luckily. Instead, night after night, it leaves my skin slick but hydrated — so much so that I can wake up and gua sha my face without any tugging or pulling. It's just an added bonus that I'm noticing how much the CBD is treating my acne — goodbye redness!" — SS
"Between being on my computer all day, the constant FaceTiming and IG scrolling on my phone, and TV binging, I feel like I've been staring at screens way more than I usually do. Meaning, I've been squinting way more than usual. So I've been hyper aware of keeping wrinkles and fine lines at bay, and just generally going overboard with all things hydration. Enter: SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2 ($128) and SkinCeuticals Hyaluronic Acid Intensifier ($100) — my two holy grail fine-line-combating and skin-plumping products. The HA Intensifier is thicker than your average hyaluronic acid serum and makes my skin immediately feel more elastic. The Triple Lipid cream is a true facial in a jar; it's thick without feeling greasy, and contains natural cholesterol, pure ceramides, and fatty acids to keep skin youthful AF." — AK
"I feel like body wash is very underrated. My ideal formula lathers well, has a nice, light scent to it, and leaves skin feeling clean but not tight and uncomfortable — aka, all the things that the J.R. Watkins Detox Creamy Body Wash ($15) does. The body wash (like all of the brand's products) is made with naturally derived ingredients and you can't beat the price. This was my first time trying J.R. Watkins and I'm impressed." — JH
"Ever since I've been social distancing, my skin has looked a little lackluster. I've been clinging to this M-61 Vitablast C 20% Cream ($92) for its ability to brighten and illuminate dull-looking skin thanks to its formula with vitamin C. I also love it because it supports natural collagen production, promotes a more even skin tone, and the rich, yet lightweight consistency adds a subtle lit-from-within-glow." — Genesis Rivas, assistant editor, Makeup.com
"Warning: this Cure de Repos Gold Roll-Cit ($300) is a total splurge. Now that I've gotten that caveat out of the way, let me tell you that I've had this dermaroller sitting in my medicine cabinet for about three years. I had used it maybe five times total, but knew how expensive it was and couldn't part with it. Thank goodness I didn't, because this has become an integral part of my social-distancing evening skin-care routine. Dermarollering (also known as microneedling), for those who are curious, is a method used by aestheticians to help rejuvenate the skin and treat signs of aging. The supertiny needles on these rollers gently puncture the skin, and while the injury is superficial and controlled, it triggers the skin's wound healing response to stimulate collagen production. So how do I use it? About once every three days on clean skin at night. I then apply my serum, followed by my moisturizer. It definitely doesn't tickle, but I wouldn't say it hurts, either — more of a gentle sting that quickly dissipates. Since I've started using it, my skin feels tighter and smoother and, call me crazy, but I feel like my products are more effective. This one is gold plated and meant to suppress bacteria growth, but you can buy more affordable options at a derm store." — Amanda Elser Murray, associate style director, Group Nine Media
"When celeb dermatologist Dr. Ellen Marmur did my undereye fillers a few months ago (still obsessed, btw), there were a few wrinkles left over that the fillers didn't fix. When I asked Dr. Marmur if she could add more to make them disappear, she rightly told me I would look insane, and instead directed me to use her MMRevive Serum ($85) under my eyes every night. I'm a bit skeptical of eye creams and serums in general — none have ever given me real results and many, in fact, cause flares of perioral dermatitis around my eyes. So to say I'm shook at the results of the Revive Serum would be an understatement. Especially now when I have a lot more time on my hands to inspect the sh*t out of my skin and really keep tabs on results, I can safely say the wrinkles are visibly less deep, and my undereye skin is just generally smoother and more luminous. Maybe it's because it isn't just an eye serum, maybe it's the natural ingredients like thermus thermophilus ferment — whatever it is about this serum, trust me, the stuff works." — AK
"I've been holding a lot of stress in my neck and shoulders these last few weeks and it's really messing up my sleep schedule. Then, I started using this Saje Peppermint Halo Cooling and Soothing Oil Blend ($22) on the back of my neck and along my hairline, and wow. Within seconds the essential oil goes to work, quickly cooling down all my pressure points. It's the perfect companion piece to my reading-in-bed routine and now I don't think I can live without it." — SS
"Either I can't seem to find the most flattering lighting for a Zoom call or I'm just really frickin' tired, because my undereye circles are out in full force. That is, until I started using this eye cream under my concealer. Jafra Royal Defy Lift Express Eye Treatment ($44) is made with concentrated royal jelly (the food the queen bee of a hive eats — yes, really) to nourish skin over time, but I'm most impressed with the immediate smoothing benefits. It glides on, feels completely weightless, and makes my makeup look flawless even when I slap it on in three seconds. I guess I can stop watching lighting tutorials now." — DD
"My skin has been nightmarish the past few weeks. I feel like I spoil it with an excess of face masks, moisturizers, and serums, but for reasons unbeknownst to me, it's been seriously acting out. Dullness, dryness, acne — you name it, I've had it. While I've been trying pretty much everything to glow-up my skin, the Miami Gorgeous Vitamin C Serum ($36) is the only thing that's really worked. It's packed with antioxidants, aloe vera extract and hyaluronic acid to brighten, hydrate, and soothe the skin. Within just a few days of use, my complexion perked up, looked plump, and had its radiance back. In short: I'm obsessed." — Samantha Holender, assistant beauty editor, Makeup.com
"My skin is fussy, but I never expected it to turn against me as quickly as it did when I began staying at home. Naturally, I ran to Instagram to seek help from Renée Rouleau, my fairy skin godmother. Within days, I rotated her Rapid Response Detox Cleanser ($41) into my morning and evening routine and after the first couple of uses the inflammation from the army of acne on my chin and jawline reduced. The unwelcome presence of so many breakouts was putting a damper on my mood. Thanks to this cleanser, I feel like I can look in the mirror and breathe again." — SS
"I never go a day without wearing sunscreen, even when I'm staying indoors like I am now. I've tried my fair share of formulas, but the Lumasol Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Mist ($50) is unique in that you can reapply it over makeup. It comes in a mist applicator and goes on similar to a face mist or setting spray — perfect for midday touch ups when it's time to go back to work." — JH
"OK, yes, I realize this is a showerhead, but hear me out here. Since being at home for an extended period of time, I've made sure to only partake in the steps of my beauty routine that I actually enjoy, and while I'm certainly not showering more (in fact, uh, quite the opposite) I want to make sure it's the most luxurious it can be. The Vitaclean HQ Handheld Showerhead + Filter ($70) adds to the overall self-care experience, with its citrusy scent that steams from the head and impressive water pressure. The filtering system also means my skin is getting fewer harsh chemicals from the New York City water. Win-win." — KC
"I follow a thorough skin care routine daily, but during this time at home, I decided to add one new product to my lineup. The Dr. Barbara Sturm Scalp Serum ($100), because your scalp is skin too right? And if you want healthy hair that grows fast, it all starts from the root. The blend [features] hyaluronic acid with purslane, which is Sturm's secret weapon ingredient that acts as anti-irritation and soothes the skin. Since I've started using it my hair has this silky shine that I never knew I was missing." — Krista Jones, associate shop editor
"Yes, I am down to ingest beauty supplements. My current go-to is Bobbi Brown's Evolution18 Beauty Collagen Shot ($13). The taste reminds me of a blue raspberry snowcone, so even if I am still waiting to see the results on my skin, at least my sugar cravings are curbed by the sweet treat." — LS

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I'm here to tell you that it is Saturday, even though I almost had to check the calendar to make sure. It almost feels like 2020 is one day, a day we just keep taking power naps through. I hope you're all keeping well and finding your own sense of routine, whatever it may be. But still, it is the weekend, and I hope that you all have a good one.This week, I've been bouncing between several games. I've been breaking ribs in the excellent Streets of Rage 4, hoping to come across new secrets. Really, I just want to keep seeing amazing combat cop Estel Aguirre, who I basically want to "be." Not just in SoR 4, but in real life. I've also been searching for missing "Bromides" (that's photographs to you and I) inSakura Wars, and I also ran through Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered on Veteran. Still got it.But enough about me. What are you playing right now? After a few dry weeks, we're almost spoiled for choice with SoR 4, Sakura Wars, XCOM, Predator: Hunting Grounds, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Gears Tactics, and other recent hits such as Resident Evil 3 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A lot of fun times there, that's for sure. So fill us in on the action. You are always among friends here.Have a safe and restful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.Please keep major spoilers for recent games out of the comments, thanks!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistan expresses inability to convert 'Kapoor Haveli' into museum due to lack of funds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PESHAWAR: Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor's ancestral home, dubbed as the 'Kapoor Haveli', here cannot be converted into a museum as promised by the Pakistan government due to financial constraints, sources said on Saturday.
In 2018, the Pakistan government decided to convert the 'Kapoor Haveli' in Qissa Khwani Bazar in Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province into a museum, heeding to a request by Rishi Kapoor who died this week at a hospital in Mumbai.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had assured Rishi Kapoor that the Pakistan government will convert the actor's house into a museum.
The sources in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Heritage Department told PTI that the department prepared a comprehensive plan under which the haveli's front would be preserved and its inner portion will be repaired and renovated.
However, the plan did not go ahead due to lack of financial resources, they said.
Federal Minister Shaheryar Afridi had promised to give the status of museum to the 'Kapoor Haveli' soon after the present government of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-insaaf party came into power in July 2018.
However, the announcement to this effect could not be materialised despite a lapse of around two years.
The haveli is presently the property of a private person who made three/four attempts in the past to demolish the building but could not do it as FIRs were registered against him by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa heritage department.
The owner has now assured the government that he would not dismantle the building.
However, due to frequent rains, hailstorms and earthquakes, the condition of the building has deteriorated from inside.
The 'Kapoor Haveli' was built by Basheswarnath Kapoor, the father of Bollywood icon Prithviraj Kapoor. The Kapoor family, originally from Peshawar in Pakistan, migrated to India after the partition in 1947.
In 1990, Rishi Kapoor along with brother Randhir Kapoor visited their ancestral home where his grandfather, Prithviraj and his father Raj Kapoor, were born.
The news of Rishi Kapoor's death sent a wave of sadness and grief among people in Peshawar.
A lot of people visited the 'Kapoor Haveli' to express their grief and condolence over his demise.
"We had no relation with Rishi Kapoor, but had a liking for him because of watching him as a film hero from childhood and due to his connection with a place which is also a birth place of me," said Pervaiz Ahmad, a city dweller.
"Rishi's death has saddened me a lot", Pervaiz added.
"Perhaps the feeling expressed by Pervaiz portrays sentiments of all the dwellers of Peshawar over sad demise of Rishi," said Ibrahim Zia, a historian who wrote a book titled 'Peshawar ki Funkar' (Artists of Peshawar).

The haveli is presently the property of a private person who made three/four attempts in the past to demolish the building but could not do it as FIRs were registered against him by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa heritage department.
The owner has now assured the government that he would not dismantle the building. However, due to frequent rains, hailstorms and earthquakes, the condition of the building has deteriorated from inside.
The ‘Kapoor Haveli’ was built by Basheswarnath Kapoor, the father of Bollywood icon Prithviraj Kapoor.
The Kapoor family, originally from Peshawar in Pakistan, migrated to India after the partition in 1947.
In 1990, Rishi Kapoor along with brother Randhir Kapoor visited their ancestral home where his grandfather, Prithviraj and his father Raj Kapoor, were born.
The news of Rishi Kapoor’s death sent a wave of sadness and grief among people in Peshawar. A lot of people visited the ‘Kapoor Haveli’ to express their grief and condolence over his demise.
“We had no relation with Rishi Kapoor, but had a liking for him because of watching him as a film hero from childhood and due to his connection with a place which is also a birthplace of me, said Pervaiz Ahmad, a city dweller.
“Rishi’s death has saddened me a lot, Pervaiz added.
“Perhaps the feeling expressed by Pervaiz portrays sentiments of all the dwellers of Peshawar over the sad demise of Rishi, said Ibrahim Zia, a historian who wrote a book titled ‘Peshawar ki Funkar’ (Artists of Peshawar).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Harper May Stefanovic.
The Today host confirmed his happy news on Saturday morning, revealing Jasmine, 36, gave birth in Sydney on Friday.
"I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect," Stefanovic said in a statement to Nine. "Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep."
The Sydney Morning Herald understands the new 2.9-kilogram addition arrived via a planned Caesarean section at North Shore Private Hospital with the 45-year-old Stefanovic by his wife's side in the delivery suite.
Friend and fellow Nine employee Richard Wilkins also confirmed the exciting news on the Weekend Today Show.
"To Karl and Jas, you guys are going to love this special time in your life," Wilkins said on air.
The proud new parents shared a beautiful first photo of their daughter hours after her Friday arrival.
Sadly, friends and family close to the couple, including Karl's three older children aren't able to meet their new half-sibling due to the coronavirus and visitation restrictions at the hospital.
Jasmine's parents, Bob and Cheryl Yarbrough, are currently self-isolating in Sydney after arriving from their home in Ascot Hill, Brisbane. The first-time grandparents are understood to be overjoyed by Harper’s arrival and are staying in town to help care for the new baby.
The couple married in a lavish Mexican wedding in 2018 after they began dating in 2016. Karl shares three children – Jackson, 20, Ava, 15 and River, 12, with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn.
Nine, publishers of this masthead, confirmed Today Extra presenter David Campbell will cover Karl’s presenting duties on Today to lap up time with his girls.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PHOTO: Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine welcome baby girl</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have announced the birth of their baby girl, Harper May Stefanovic.
The Today Show host shared the exciting news with the breakfast show early on Saturday morning.
“I am in Awe, Harper is absolutely perfect,” Stefanovic said.
The program uploaded an adorable photo of the couple’s new bundle of joy, writing “Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed the arrival of a baby girl”.
Karl said Jasmine and bub are both doing well following the birth at Sydney’s North Shore Private Hospital on Friday.
It comes after the Mara & Mine shoe designer shared a photo to Instagram earlier this week, counting down their daughter’s arrival.
The couple tied the knot in a stunning ceremony in Mexico in December, 2018.
Harper May is a half-sister to Stefanovic’s three children Jackson, River, and Ava.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CONGRATULATIONS: Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl.
The baby news was announced on Saturday morning on Weekend Today by Stefanovic’s close friend and colleague, entertainment reporter Richard Wilkins.
Their daughter was born at North Shore Private Hospital in Sydney on May 1, just after midday.
The couple has named their daughter Harper May Stefanovic, with the new arrival weighing in at 2.9kg.
“Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep. I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect,” Stefanovic told Today.
Karl Stefanovic announced his wife's pregnancy in December 2019, sharing a paparazzi photo of himself emerging from the ocean while holidaying in Byron Bay.
"After a great deal of speculation… the rumours are true," Karl wrote, alongside a baby emoji.
The Channel Nine presenter met shoe designer Yarbrough onboard a luxury cruise ship in Sydney in 2016, five months following Stefanovic's divorce from his wife of 21 years, Cassandra Thorburn.
Since then, they’ve fielded many scandals along the way, starting from when the couple was forced to go public with their relationship in 2017 when they were pictured in Bora Bora on James Packer’s yacht.
At the time, Karl’s detractors thought he had moved on from his marriage too quickly. Their relationship became the catalyst for an onslaught of media attention, intense scrutiny and the ruthless intrusion of their personal lives.
But despite it all, the couple remained strong and they married in a lavish three-day wedding ceremony in San Jòse del Cabo, Mexico, in December 2018.
One year later, in December of last year, Karl and Jasmine announced they were expecting their first child together, a baby girl.
In April, Karl Stefanovic spoke to Stellar about his marriage with Jasmine.
"She’s been through so much... It’s not her fault she fell in love with bugalugs, and the accusations were wrong about her stealing me from Cassandra. It’s rubbish and it’s hurtful.
Karl admitted the relentless public scrutiny led him to ask Jasmine if she was sure she wanted to be in a relationship with him.
"There were times when I asked, ‘Do you really want to do this?’" he explained to the publication.
"She’s just a beautiful, sweet woman from Queensland who runs a business and fell in love with me."
Stefanovic has three children from his previous marriage with Cassandra Thorburn: Jackson, 20, Ava, 15, and River, 13.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Evans offers virtual hangout with Avengers for COVID-19 charity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hollywood actor Chris Evans made his debut on Instagram for the All In challenge. The Captain America actor posted a video announcing that he has accepted the All In Challenge given to him by Chris Pratt.
Evans said, “Hey everyone, Chris Evans here. I am accepting the All In Challenge. I was challenged by Chris Pratt. This is a great cause. This helps get food to the people who are in need during the COVID-19 nightmare. So, I am very happy doing this.”
Chris Evans offered a virtual hang out with the original Avengers Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner.
“I saw what Chris Pratt is offering. I can’t compete with that. I can’t get you eaten by a dinosaur. Here’s what I can offer – a virtual hang-out with me and five of my closest friends – Robert Downey Jr, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson. We can do a private Q and A and maybe some games, we can figure that out,” he concluded.
He further nominated Sabastian Stan, Billy Porter and Anthony Mackie to take the All In Challenge.
The All In Challenge is a digital fundraising effort that aims to be the world’s largest digital fundraiser in history to battle food insecurity brought on by COVID-19.

A host of other celebrities are also taking part in the All-In Challenge – a fundraiser created by Philadelphia 76ers basketballer Michael Rubin.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro have offered an amazing walk-on role on their next film, Martin Scorsese’s Killers Of The Flower Moon.
A chat with the Avengers and a role with Leo and our best pal Rob?
That’s not all as Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder has also joined to raise money for relief efforts, offering a special concert ‘birthday package’ that includes a chance to join the band on stage.
The winner and a guest would get to attend the Pearl Jam show of their choice — it doesn’t actually have to be on their birthday, it could be anything.
Fans get to start the day at the band’s soundcheck where they’ll get to see how the setlist comes together, and even offer a bit of input on song choices to Vedder.
The fund has raised $5.6 million (£4.4m) in just three days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tracing Irrfan Khan’s early days: A private person, caring flatmate and an actor in making</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Much before Irrfan Khan wowed the world with his acting talent, the actor was a shy, passionate and sincere person, who was meant to be all things great, say friends and colleagues from his early days.
Irrfan passed away on Wednesday after losing his battle with a rare form of cancer at the age of 54. The industry dubbed the actor’s untimely demise as an emotional void, which will be hard to fill.
Much of Irrfan’s journey to become the actor he eventually did, began when he got into the National School of Drama (NSD) in 1984, where Taare Zameen Par actor Vipin Sharma first saw him.
“I had already graduated but used to hang out in the hostel. I was friends with Tigmanshu Dhulia, Sanjay Mishra and would often be with them in their rooms. Irrfan was my junior and I remember he had done a play in one of the students’ productions, and when I saw it I was totally blown away by his performance,” Sharma told PTI.
The actor said back then Irrfan and Tigmanshu weren’t the best of friends and barely used to chat.
“I remember telling Tigmanshu that Irrfan was a great guy and he should connect with him. We all know how that turned out,” he said.
Tigmanshu and Irrfan went on to form a solid cinematic partnership, with consecutive acclaimed work, from Haasil, Paan Singh Tomar, for which the actor won a best actor National Award, to Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns.
Sharma recalled the actor had a small room to himself in one corner in NSD.
“He was a very private person from the beginning. Normally in the hostel, two-three people shared a room. Irrfan had picked up this room, which was single occupancy. It was in the back, right in the corner. We would see him sitting by the window, reading a book. He was in his own world. It wasn’t that we spent a lot of time in NSD but strangely our bond grew after college. I felt like he was a brother to me,” Sharma said. 
When Irrfan graduated from NSD, the actor came to Mumbai looking for work and fortunately, got cast in Mira Nair’s award-winning 1988 film Salaam Bombay.
For the film’s workshop, Irrfan was flatmates with another actor, who would go on to cement his position in the coming years: Raghubir Yadav.
The Peepli Live actor said though Irrfan was his junior in NSD, the duo met during the workshop in 1987, which lasted for nearly six weeks.
“There was me, Irrfan, Mira, writer Sooni Taraporevala, Barry John and 130 kids. We lived in an apartment behind Jaslok Hospital. Shyam Benegal would live right above us. Irrfan was an extremely hardworking person and incredibly passionate. Every day after finishing workshops, he’d say ‘Raghu bhai, let’s go to the streets, explore’”, he said.
“Both of us were new to Mumbai and were supposed to play local city characters. We just didn’t know the culture, the lingo, and lifestyle. We would travel by bus, locals and spend so much time on Grant Road. Just observing people, studying how they talk, walk. There was so much learning with him,” Yadav added.
For the film, where Yadav played a character named Chillum, the actor had to learn how to smoke which he had never done in his life.
“I remember Mira had asked us to light a bidi, my first, and it was Irrfan’s duty to get two bidi bundles everyday, which we would finish in 24 hours. We would smoke one and talk so that we remain in character,” he recounted.
Yadav said Irrfan was hoping he would get a role as one of the kids in the group in Salaam Bombay!, and when that didn’t happen, heartbreak and tears followed.
“I was already signed for Chillum but he was devastated. He cried so much that night. I calmed him down, told him we have just started. Everything that’s broken can be fixed. He didn’t get the role because of his height. Though Mira had told him he’d get something else, he was inconsolable,” he said.
The actor recalled the director came over with beer to console him and the duo made him realise that this wasn’t the end of his journey.
“I told him this is just the beginning. This is the same city which will one day embrace him. Of course, I had said that to soothe him but he was sincere and I’m not surprised my words turned prophetic. He had such passion to learn, surrender and adapt, I knew he would go far,” Raghubir Yadav added.
From a cameo in Salaam Bombay!, Irrfan went on to headline films like Maqbool, Nair’s The Namesake, The Lunchbox, Piku, Hindi Medium and his last outing, Angrezi Medium.
Even as he grew in stature, Irrfan remained deeply connected to all those he met in the beginning of his journey, his friends said.
Sharma remembered how Irrfan was “instrumental” in getting him back to acting after he had briefly quit the industry.
“When Maqbool came, he asked me to watch the film and said how cinema was changing and great things were happening. I saw the film and told him I loved it. He said, ‘If that’s the case, come back to Mumbai and start acting.’ I kept thinking about what he had said and eventually returned. I last met him when I visited him in London during his treatment. We kept in touch through messages. He told me he was coming to India in August and would meet me. I kept waiting, but it never happened… Memories are the only thing left now,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irrfan Khan: An actor who broke all boundaries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Irrfan Khan was a unique talent who broke class, caste and religious barriers to reach out to people and make a space for himself in their hearts through his distinct and alive acting style.
This is why, his passing away feels like a personal tragedy for his fans across the globe.
Irrfan, known for 'The Warrior', 'Maqbool', 'Paan Singh Tomar', 'The Namesake', passed away on Wednesday after losing his battle with a rare form of cancer at the age of 54.
Irrfan was known in his friend circles as a Sufi-esque man who was never detached from any incident, person or situation. On the contrary, he would try to live through whatever he was confronted with, often seeking out the meaning behind the same.
He was someone who believed in drawing the reality of the man and community through his portrayals.
When one would ask him about his process of picking up his projects, he would thoughtfully say, "A film with a tight structure and characters that are both interesting and highlight the complexities of the society."
London-based filmmaker Asif Kapadia's 'The Warrior' and Tigmanshu Dhulia's feature directorial debut 'Haasil', established Irrfan as a prolific actor in India as well as world cinema.
In his NSD days, Irrfan was known for striking a balance between the acting techniques of Russian theatre legend Konstantin Stanislavski and German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht.
While Stainislavski emphasised on method acting, Brecht believed in imbibing the mental and emotional statement of the character and develop a relationship with it.
Irrfan's friends, including Tigmanshu, believe he had gone beyond method acting and had developed his own technique, which could resonate with the public. They believe it is impossible to learn what Irrfan could do.
Tigmanshu said Irrfan stood out because other than his passion for acting, he never behaved like a star.
"The most special thing about Irrfan was that apart from his passion for acting he had no other quality of a star. He was like any other normal person around. He was free from the shackles of the glitz and glamour of movie business."
For the actor, social objective was more important than money but he was also someone who didn't believe that cinema is 'pure art'.
Some 'artistes', he thought, made films on social issues for their own satisfaction and when such movies get acclaim from a handful of people, they felt content. But these films never reach their target audience.
The National Award winner, who went on star in Bollywood films and world cinema such as 'The Lunchbox', 'Life of Pi', 'Piku', 'Hindi Medium', believed a good film is over and above the boundaries of language, country and cultures and speaks to the audience as someone their own.
Talking about the time when he was selected in NSD, the actor said his family members were not supportive but they had to bend before his passion.
"With a lot of arrogance and a belief that 'I'm embarking on a new journey of my life', I sat in the rickshaw with a holdall to catch a bus from Jaipur. I lied to my mother, I said I will become a professor after graduating from drama school," he once said.
Irrfan's father Shahzade Yaseen Ali Khan belonged to the respected Nawab family of Tonk, Rajasthan and his mother Saeeda Begum was also from a Nawab family. Irrfan has elder sister Rukhsana Begum and brothers Imran Khan and Salman Khan.
During an interview, when asked about the moment acting drew him in.
Irrfan said he realised the power of acting as a teenager after watching a film featuring Hollywood icon Marlon Brando.
"There were scenes in the film in which he had no dialogues. But as an audience I could understand his feelings and confusion. I was shocked to see this magic, where without even saying a single word, he could explain everything.
"This was the first step towards falling in love with acting. Looking at Brando I felt as if there was electricity in the air around him. There was an energy which made it possible for him to touch the heart of the audience."
Once when he was quizzed if NSD made him an actor, to which he replied, "An organisation can never make anyone an actor as acting is like meditation. An actor has to work a lot on himself and needs to build a relationship with anything in front of him without any preconceived notion.
"But every actor should develop his own definition of acting. To be a good actor, one needs to be a good person first. When you sink into the details of a character, then even your silence starts speaking, which connects the audience with you on a spiritual level."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor may have been a consistently charming boyfriend with an impish smile in majority of his iconic romances, but he wasn’t so charming when it came to media interactions.
Kapoor, 67, who died of leukaemia on April 30 leaving Bollywood fans shattered, was often moody and unpredictable.
An interview with him always felt like those uncomfortable first dates where you had no clue whether two strangers were going to truly hit it off or not.
During our face-to-face interaction during the 2012 International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) in Singapore, he was a portrait of gentlemanly candour, grace and wit as he discussed dancing with his actor-son Ranbir Kapoor on stage for the first time in his career.
The IIFA PR kept warning me to tread carefully around him saying something on the lines of Rishi sir’s intolerance towards intrusive and inane line of questioning. But we had nothing to worry because Kapoor was on top of his game that afternoon and spoke about how he was looking forward to dancing on stage with his son Ranbir that night.
He spoke about how he never gave career advice to his son as Ranbir was more than equipped to take care of himself. I walked out of that interview feeling mighty pleased that Kapoor wore his fame, fortune and pedigree lightly.
But five years later in March 2017, a phone interview conducted to promote his upcoming show ‘Khullam Khulla! Rishi Uncensored’ at the Dubai World Trade Centre, revealed a different facet to Kapoor’s personality. Perhaps he woke up on the wrong side of the bed or his morning bed tea wasn’t made to his liking, but Kapoor was impatient and borderline curt over the phone. He went ballistic when the word ‘Bollywood’, a popular term for Hindi film industry, was used.
“Why do you call it Bollywood? Why don’t you call it the Indian film industry? I hate our film industry being called Bollywood … I don’t like it. Period. It’s my personal choice,” said Kapoor impatiently.
Even Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have expressed their intense distaste for the term ‘Bollywood’, as they felt it was reductive. Kapoor was equally disdainful of how the West, particularly Hollywood, perceive Bollywood as their “poor imitation”.
“Let’s come up with something original, shall we?”, he said.
Coming from an actor who was born into an acting dynasty that shaped Indian cinema and derived his immortal fame from Bollywood teen romances and glitzy song-dance musicals during the first half of his career, Kapoor’s disowning of that glamorous genre was intriguing and slightly unsettling.
I never found out more on that front. But what I loved and discovered about him was that he never faked kindness like other Bollywood stars. Many are saccharinely sweet and cloyingly kind towards you during film promotions. But actor Raj Kapoor’s son, who was born into a world of privilege, wealth and acting dynasty, never faked it.
“Faking it has never been my style. I am not a stylised actor and I have been spontaneous all my life. I like to keep things natural. I know acting is about faking it, but I fake it only to make you believe in something,” said Kapoor. During that interview, he was in parts abrasive and in parts charming.
His autobiographical book was wonderfully frank and he even spoke his father’s affair with his leading lady. Kapoor didn’t believe in sanitising his own existence and wanted to reveal the warts and moles in his precious life too. But when I asked him about his unnatural and bitingly frank strain of his in that book, he laughed it off.
“You are talking as if nobody knows about it … I don’t go by any rule book. I set my own rules and not what somebody else does.”
The last line of his encapsulates Kapoor’s rise and his long-enduring fame in Bollywood. While Kapoor was known for his suave rich-boy lover or that dishy relationship rebel roles, he reinvented himself in his fifties. His role in the highly relevant legal drama ‘Mulk’, in which he played a conservative Muslim patriarch battling allegations of being anti-India, was a revelation and was a nod to his versatility as an actor. He may have got his first break in Bollywood because of ‘accident of birth’, but he sustained his fame and success in films through his bold choices.
Interestingly, there was another word that he hated more than the term ‘Bollywood’. The N-word: ‘nepotism’. For those in the dark, mainstream actors from Hindi cinema have been accused of riding on the fame of their family members and elders rather than their own merit.
Kapoor blew a lid when I broached that burning topic. Actress Kangana Ranaut had just appeared on ‘Koffee With Karan’ and had triggered a massive debate about how filmmakers like Karan Johar gave an easy pass to actor’s children and relatives rather than bolstering talents based on merit alone. But Kapoor had a different take on the whole subject and almost bit my head off over the phone with his sharp tone.
“I will start my show with that and talk openly about it … I am the oldest star kid working in cinema right now. But tell me, am I still getting work because of my father? Why do you blame star kids? Certain star kids make it and certain star kids didn’t. You need to have something in you to make it. It’s the public that makes you a star … I will clear the basic perception that people have about star kids in my show in Dubai.”
He lived up to his promise and his show was a resounding success for its acerbic and irreverent tone. But what really struck me about our conversation was that he never minced words. His confidence and arrogance in his talent and trade stood. Who else would say these lines with such gumption?
“I am not an outdated actor. I try to keep pace with today’s times so that audiences today can relate and identify with me.”
While I wasn’t able to identify with his acidic tone during that mercurial interview, he was always on-point. I would take that any day than fake niceness of some other stars.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irrfan Khan: Death of an actor who got lifetimes to his act</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Gautam Chintamani
There are only a handful of actors that you remember watching for the first time with such awe that the moment gets forever etched in your memory. The first time I saw Irrfan Khan in his element was in a soap called Banegi Apni Baat (1993). It was the early 1990s, satellite television was in its infancy and nearly every show on the only private channel, Zee TV, was discussed threadbare in schools and colleges.
Irrfan played a much elder man who falls for one of his children’s college-mate and it was for the first time where you saw such a complex character essayed without apology, and that too on television. Irrfan’s understated brilliance lay in his ability to infuse a lifetime of the character’s story in a single moment. From that point onwards, scores of viewers kept an eye out for the actor who could play a ‘lecherous uncle’ with an elegance you’d never imagine.
By the time Irrfan got a top-billing role in The Warrior (2001), he was a much-recognised face in India. However, stardom in the true sense of the word was still a few years away. In his initial years, Irrfan was the kind of the standard National School of Drama alumnus that you saw in small roles across films such as Kamla Ki Maut (1989), Drishti (1990) or Ek Doctor Ki Maut (1990).
In the 1990s, he was the household TV star thanks to shows such as Chandrakanta (1994) and became the kind of actor you notice irrespective of the length of the role. Although there was a great legacy of the likes of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Naseeruddin Shah breaking through in Bombay cinema even with the kind of face that the trade didn’t qualify to be ‘star’ material, things were not the same. The arrival of the three Khans—Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh—along with Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn made it near-impossible for someone like Irrfan to be the typical leading man. 
Irrfan would probably be the last of the stalwarts who underwent the classical journey of a stage-trained actor to become a global star. He excelled on stage, TV and after having made his name as a villain in Haasil (2003) and Aan: Men at Work (2004), a supporting actor in New York (2009), he became a global star with classics such as The Namesake (2006).
With films such as Hindi Medium (2017), he delivered blockbusters and excelled at the typical Bollywood romance with Qarib Qarib Singlle (2017), while also refusing films such as Interstellar (2014) and The Martian (2015) when many of his more famous contemporaries would have never been considered by the likes of Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott. They say one should live life to its fullest lest it seems like one died young. Even after living many lifetimes in every character he played, Irrfan, 53, still left too early, and at a time when he was truly coming into his own.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kabir Khan reveals why Irrfan Khan was left in tears after watching a scene of Nawazuddin Siddique</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Its just few days of Irrfan Khan passing away and we’re still not over the major loss to the industry. The actor served as an inspiration and left an impact on the lives of many through his work. Today, director Kabir Khan spoke to an online portal revealing why he feels he was fortunate enough to work with Irrfan in New York.
Kabir Khan’s New York starred John Abraham, Katrina Kaif, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Irrfan Khan. The director shares an incident from the set of his film which is truly amazing to know. The director was shooting Nawazuddin Siddique for a scene. Back in the day, Nawazuddin had still not shot to fame and was not a known name. However Irrfan wanted to watch the intense and emotional scene which was going to be performed by Siddqiue. Kabir Khan says in the interview that Irrfan was so moved by the scene, that he was left in tears. This clearly shows that Irrfan was really an emotional person and how much he loved movies and took the characters to be really close to his heart.
Kabir further added by saying that Irrfan was very close to his characters and understood the depth of it. He was a brilliant actor and the filmmaker is surely shaken by the sudden loss of this prolific performer. Kabir Khan’s next ’83 is based on the iconic moment of India’s winning victory at the World Cup. It recently was revealed that the Ranveer Singh starrer, will not have a direct OTT release and will go the conventional route when the time is right.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boy George says he was too “engaged chemically” to take part in Live Aid.
The Culture Club frontman did not perform at the landmark concert despite singing on Band Aid’s track Do They Know It’s Christmas.
The singer, 58, told the Grounded With Louis Theroux podcast: “I messed it up. I was otherwise engaged chemically.
“I mean, I think it was a stroke of luck that we didn’t do it because I wasn’t in a fit state to do it.”
He said: “We were originally asked but then I think everyone was just looking at the state of me and going, ‘this might be more harmful than good’. So, they basically didn’t follow up on it.”
The singer also told Theroux, 49, he thought the presenter was on drugs when he watched him on Graham Norton’s show last year.
He later deleted a tweet asking: “What’s wrong with Louis Theroux?”
The Karma Chameleon singer said: “One of the things as a recovering addict is I often watch people of TV and I go, ‘They are off their nut’. Most times I’m completely wrong.”
Grounded With Louis Theroux is available to listen to on BBC Sounds every Monday and is also broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Wednesday at 8pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Send me a sign’: Tennessee QB opens up on planned suicide attempt in inspiring post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maurer, in an Instagram post Friday, shared how close he was to taking his own life on Jan. 22.
“As I was going to do it I looked up and said ‘god if this isn’t your plan for me please send me a sign,’” he wrote.
Settle in with the best entertainment for the whole family. No installation. No lock-in contract. Start your Foxtel Now 10-day free trial. New customers only.
“2 minutes later my mom called me with my baby nephew Jeremiah and she said she was just calling to say she loved me, I then knew by ending my pain I would be causing so much more to the people who loved me.”
The 19-year-old Maurer detailed his struggle with mental health that dates back to the seventh grade, when his father was sent to prison for 25 years and his mother and stepfather separated.
While in high school, one of Maurer’s close friends killed himself.
Maurer lost two others to gun violence.
“I slipped even deeper into a black hole and I turned to everything else but seeking help,” Maurer wrote.
Maurer hopes he can help others dealing with depression and anxiety.
May is Mental Health Awareness Month and he shared his story on the first day of the month.
“My goal was not to bring attention to myself, but to bring attention to mental health,” he told ESPN.
“It’s something a lot of people struggle with. And not only younger people, but all people. They battle it every day and keep it a secret. My thinking was that if a college athlete can come out and speak about how seeking help is the most important thing you can do, then maybe all those people out there struggling will reach out to somebody and know that there is always hope.”
Maurer is now planning to get help.
Since the Instagram post, he’s heard from a lot of people, including teammates and coaches. Quarterbacks coach Chris Weinke, in particular, has helped him.
“I didn’t tell anybody about what I was going through, because you’re embarrassed,” Maurer said.
“But everybody at the University of Tennessee has been great, and Coach Weinke has been my rock. I’m excited to better myself. And most of all, to let others know who are going through the same thing that they’re not alone.”
In eight games last season, the backup freshman signal-caller was 35 of 75 for 541 yards.
He had two touchdowns against five interceptions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Does Boris Johnson's coronavirus experience show sufferers should be hospitalised before they are breathless?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is so much to ponder in the prime minister's interview about how Covid-19 almost killed him.
But in respect of the effort to protect us all, what stood out for me was how and when he was persuaded to move from Downing Street to St Thomas's Hospital.
"I wasn't struggling to breathe but I just wasn't in good shape and it wasn't getting better,” he told the Sun on Sunday.
“Then the doctors got anxious because they thought that my readings were not where they wanted them to be.
"Then I was told I had to go into St Thomas's.
"I said I really didn't want to go into hospital...
"It didn't seem to me to be a good move but they were pretty adamant.
"Looking back, they were right to force me to go".
The prime minister then describes, in an emotional way, how - in intensive care - he was given "litres and litres of oxygen for a long time".
And how after round the clock nursing and oversight by skilled doctors, he recovered enough to return to the main ward.
He did not need to be sedated into a coma and have oxygen forced into his lungs via a tube.
But he came close, and contingency plans were made for his death.
"I felt so lucky because so many people have suffered so much more than I did," he said.
One big question raised by the PM's interview is whether he was one of the many of those infected with Covid-19 who experience what's known as silent hypoxia, a condition in which oxygen levels in the blood fall to dangerously low levels but without the patient gasping for breath.
A related question is whether the PM's own experience will and should prompt him to consider whether new guidance should be issued about when those with Covid-19 should be admitted to hospital.
It is dangerous to generalise from anecdotal evidence, but I was recently contacted by the grieving family of a 56-year-old with no underlying health conditions, who died at home with Covid-19 even though he had three times asked the health-line 111 to send an ambulance for him.
According to his family, "he was begging the 111 operator to send him an ambulance but they said he wasn't ill enough because he could still breathe".
Plainly this was the wrong diagnosis.
To labour the point, the PM was taken to hospital, even though - by his own account - he was not struggling to breathe.
Understandably therefore there is a debate among doctors about whether breathing difficulties should be the trigger for hospitalisation or whether it would be sensible to monitor the oxygen saturation levels of Covid-19 sufferers while they are still at home, with the use of small portable "oximeters", and move those patients to hospitals when those saturation levels fall below a certain threshold.
This is hard to do at the moment, because when someone goes down with the virus - and unlike in Germany, where mortality rates are so much lower than here - the onus is on the sufferer to self-diagnose and monitor symptoms, rather than being monitored by a clinician or at least any outsider with some expertise.
Perhaps some of the 18,000 people being recruited by Health Secretary Matt Hancock to track and trace those with symptoms will also play a role in monitoring the health of those with the illness.
There is capacity in UK hospitals to receive more patients.
And those who believe there should be earlier hospitalisation again cite the lower death rate in Germany, where there are many more intensive care beds per capita than in most of the rest of Europe, including the UK, and where there has been a greater willingness from the outset to move those with the infection to hospital.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake on posting pictures of his son: ‘I wanted to free myself’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake has finally opened up about the reason he shared pictures of his son online, after keeping him out of the public eye for the first two years of his life.
Last month the Canadian rapper took to Instagram to share pictures of his blonde, curly haired and blue-eyed toddler Adonis, who he parents with former adult star Sophie Brussaux.
Now, he reveals to Lil Wayne why he chose to end the secrecy.
“It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned. I just woke up one morning, and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do,” said Drake.
“I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. I just wanted to free myself of that.”
The rapper said it was “great for me” to be able to do that. His comments aired on the second episode of ‘Young Money Radio’, Lil Wayne’s show.
The world first learnt of Drake’s son in 2018, when rapper Pusha T released a diss track against him titled ‘The Story of Adidon’, exposing that Drake had been hiding a child.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Little Girl’s ‘I Wonder What’s Inside Your Butthole’ Is Your Fave New Quarantine Song</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actress and musician Lisa Rieffel posted a video of her daughter singing a new song she came up with called ‘I Wonder What’s Inside Your Butthole’ and…it’s great.
I’ve had a lot of empathy for everyone’s different quarantine situations during these hard times, and a lot of that empathy has rested with parents who have had to be trapped with their children 24 hours a day, trying to entertain them. By empathy I mainly mean “god that sounds like hell to me personally, so it must be the worst.” I guess it really isn’t empathy then, and more concern about myself and what I would want. In any case, a video shared by actor and musician Lisa Rieffel of her daughter performing a new song made me realise what sort of gold can come out of kids being bored. It’s called ‘What’s Inside Your Butthole’, and it’s pretty self-explanatory.
It’s actually…..good? It’s no surprise, with her parents Lisa and Jonny both being musicians, members of alt rock band Killola. People are loving the song, with some even starting to do their own remixes.
It’s obviously a very funny and creative household, with a video supercut from 2018 showing Lisa tormenting her husband with loudly sung parts of Alanis Morissette songs.
Looking through the rest of Lisa’s hilarious twitter feed, I am obsessed with them all, and someone should give the family a TV show immediately.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake 'feels great' sharing son with the world as he opens up on fatherhood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake revealed he felt ‘great’ sharing his son with the world.
The rapper confirmed back in June 2018 that he had son Adonis, with Sophie Brussaux, and he explained it felt ‘freeing’ to be able to tell everyone.
Speaking to fellow rapper Lil Wayne on Young Money Radio, he said: ‘It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like… it wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned.
‘I just woke up one morning and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do.’
‘I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket.
‘So, I just wanted to free myself of that.’
Drake later stated that it was ‘inspiring’ to see his labelmates, such as Lil Wayne, being able to focus on music and look after their children at the same time, and has credited the Young Money record label for allowing him to do the same.
‘I’ve watched you be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father,’ he told Wayne. ‘And that gave me a lot of confidence too.
‘A lot of us, like [2] Chainz, is a great father and a lot of the guys that we came up around just being great family men on those yours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done.
‘But specifically you, just how you always just made that s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you.’
He added: ‘And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father.
‘So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.’
In the meantime, Drake has released an album of leaks and one-off tracks called the Dark Line Demo Tapes – and has teased he could drop a new studio album this summer.
He’s really spoiling us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Reveals Why He Finally Decided To Post Photos Of Son Adonis, 2: ‘It Was Great For Me’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake surprised us all when he dropped his mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, and he sat down with rapper Lil Wayne on Apple Music’s Young Money Radio to discuss the new tracks, and his role as a father. The “God’s Plan” hitmaker has a two-year-old son, Adonis, who he posted pictures of for the very first time on his Instagram page on March 30. “I posted those pictures. It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like … It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned,” he dished on episode two of Lil Wayne’s talkback show.
“I just woke up one morning and I was like, ‘you know what? This is just something that I want to do’,” Drake continued. “I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. So, I just wanted to free myself of that. And I’ve watched you [Lil Wayne] be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father.” Drake also admitted how much the “Lollipop” singer, and other rappers like 2 Chainz have inspired him to be a better father.
“A lot of the guys that we came up around [were] great family men on those tours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done,” he said. “But specifically you, just how you always just made s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you. And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father. So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.”
Drake also talked about his new music, which he announced on Instagram on April 30. The mixtape not only includes a cheeky reference to Kylie Jenner’s billionaire net worth, but also boasts features from Chris Brown (“Not You Too“), Future (“Desires”), and Playboi Carti (“Pain 1993”). The overall mixtape was a joint effort between Drake and his “brothers,” Oliver El-Khatib (co-founder of Drake’s record label OVO) and producer Noel Cadastre. “My brothers put together a lot of the songs people have been asking for (some leaks and some joints from SoundCloud and some new vibes),” Drake explained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennessee QB Brian Maurer reveals planned suicide attempt, mental health struggle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a time when pain is everywhere and the novel coronavirus pandemic has shut down the world, Tennessee quarterback Brian Maurer opened up about his own battle.
Maurer, in an Instagram post Friday, shared how close he was to taking his own life on Jan. 22
“As I was going to do it I looked up and said ‘god if this isn’t your plan for me please send me a sign,’” he wrote. “2 minutes later my mom called me with my baby nephew Jeremiah and she said she was just calling to say she loved me, I then knew by ending my pain I would be causing so much more to the people who loved me.”
The 19-year-old Maurer detailed his struggle with mental health that dates back to the seventh grade, when his father was sent to prison for 25 years and his mother and stepfather separated.
While in high school, one of Maurer’s close friends killed himself. Maurer lost two others to gun violence.
“I slipped even deeper into a black hole and I turned to everything else but seeking help,” Maurer wrote.
Maurer hopes he can help others dealing with depression and anxiety. May is Mental Health Awareness Month and he shared his story on the first day of the month.
“My goal was not to bring attention to myself, but to bring attention to mental health,” he told ESPN. “It’s something a lot of people struggle with. And not only younger people, but all people. They battle it every day and keep it a secret. My thinking was that if a college athlete can come out and speak about how seeking help is the most important thing you can do, then maybe all those people out there struggling will reach out to somebody and know that there is always hope.”
Maurer is now planning to get help. Since the Instagram post, he’s heard from a lot of people, including teammates and coaches. Quarterbacks coach Chris Weinke, in particular, has helped him.
“I didn’t tell anybody about what I was going through, because you’re embarrassed,” Maurer said. “But everybody at the University of Tennessee has been great, and Coach Weinke has been my rock. I’m excited to better myself. And most of all, to let others know who are going through the same thing that they’re not alone.”
In eight games last season, the backup freshman signal-caller was 35 of 75 for 541 yards. He had two touchdowns against five interceptions.

The former Glee star made the announcement in the form of a photo of her wearing a blue floral maternity dress. The caption below the image of her cradling her stomach says, "So grateful."
Michele, who married businessman Zandy Reich in March 2019, is now expecting her first child. Rumors about her pregnancy were already circulating last Monday, when a source for Peoplereported that the couple was expecting. Neither People nor Michele have confirmed her due date.
"They've always wanted to be parents," the People source said.
Michele and Reich started dating in July 2017, and got engaged in April of 2018. They were married in Northern California, with more than 200 guests in attendance. Michele's Glee co-stars Darren Criss and Becca Tobin were there, as well as her Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts.
"We are so excited to be married and grateful to be surrounded by our friends and family," the couple shared with People at the time. "And most of all, we’re so happy to spend the rest of our lives together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">“I’ll be back, InshAllah”: Irrfan Khan’s Pakistani co-star Adnan Siddiqui reveals 3 untold stories; inability to act in James Bond film prompted Life of Pi actor to aspire for Hollywood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s Pakistani co-star Adnan Siddiqui has revealed the last words uttered by the legendary Indian actor to him when he went to meet him in London in 2018. Adnan also shared three untold stories including one where late Irrfan’s inability to act in a James Bond film prompted the Life of Pi actor to aspire for Hollywood. Adnan also shared an incident showing the perfectionist side of late Irrfan Khan, whose tragic death last week at the age of 53 stunned Bollywood and his fans globally. Adnan, who worked alongside legendary Irrfan in A Mighty Heart, said that Irrfan’s death had left him ‘disturbed and gutted.’
In a profound note, Adnan wrote, “Disturbed and gutted!! A fine soul gone too soon. I had the honour of first meeting Irrfan as a co-star on the sets of ‘A Mighty Heart.’ For one of the scenes after learning his lines I saw him doing the scene again and again which left me puzzled.”
Adnan said that he could not stop himself from approaching Irrfan to ask, “Irrfan Sahab ye kya kar rahe hain aap? (What are you doing?) He replied, ‘we’re both playing CID agents which means we’ll be showing our ID cards everywhere. I’m practicising the scene so I don’t look clumsy while showing the ID card.’ And that was the first time I realised what a fine actor he was.”
Adnan said that they became good ‘friends on the sets and used to hang out together after the shoot.’ Sharing another incident, Adnan said, “I remember for another scene, he wanted to know a word in Urdu used commonly in Pakistan and he asked me. He was a great actor but didn’t shy away from learning and perfecting his art.”
According to Adnan, Irrfan told him once why he was determined to act in a Hollywood movie. It was because he continued, Irrfan had once got a role ‘of an extra actor in the James Bond series Octopussy, which was shot in India.’
“But because they (Irrfan and his friends) cycled to the set, they were late and the shoot was over. He told me that since then he wanted to do a Hollywood movie. Our careers in Hollywood started together, but he proved his mettle and conquered the fort,” Adnan added.
Adnan said that he met the legendary actor in 2018 for the last time when Irrfan looked positive. His last words, according to the Pakistani actor, were, “Adnan, I’ll be fine very soon and I’ll be back. InshAllah!”
Adnan was recently in the news after he sent an apology to the families of Irrfan Khan and Sridevi for being part of a show where a disgraceful Pakistani TV anchor made fun of their deaths.
Irrfan died in Mumbai last week after battling cancer for two years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistani Anchor Amir Liaquat Makes Fun Of Irrfan Khan & Sridevi’s Death While In Conversation With Actor Adnan Siddiqui</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A couple of days ago, Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan’s death news shocked the whole industry to the core. While the world mourned the demise of the legendary actor, a Pakistani anchor called Amir Liaquat mocked the death of Irrfan Khan and Sridevi in his chat show while in conversation with actor Adnan Siddiqui.
Actor Adnan Siddiqui was recently invited to a Pakistani chat show called ‘Jeeway Pakistan’ wherein the host of the show Amir Liaquat passed insensitive comments and said that Adnan Siddiqui saved Rani Mukerji and Bipasha Basu’s life by not working with the two actresses. He added that the ‘Maat’ actor was offered ‘Mardaani 2’ and ‘Jism 2’. Amir further said that Adnan worked with Sridevi and Irrfan and both of them have passed away. “Bahar aap jiske saath kaam karte ho, woh chala jata hai (Actors with whom you have worked outside Pakistan have died),” the anchor made insensitive comments on his show.
Adnan’s discomfort was evident on his face and he even tried to cut him short but Amir continued to speak. The clip from the episode surfaced on social media after a Twitter user shared it. The anchor received flak for mocking someone’s death on national television.
Check out the clip here:
Later, Adnan Siddiqui apologized to Irrfan Khan and Sridevi’s families in his post on Instagram and Twitter. He wrote, “It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light.”

Adnan, who has worked in shows ‘Mere Qatil Mere Dildar’ and ‘Pakeeza’, had shared a heartfelt post after Irrfan Khan’s demise.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dr Aamir Liaquat apologises for making insensitive remarks on TV</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain on Saturday apologised for making insensitive remarks about the deaths of Bollywood stars Sridevi and Irrfan Khan during a live Ramzan transmission.
According to the details, the anchor who does controversial Ramzan shoes every year took to Twitter saying that he was sorry for his remarks, adding that the person who asks for forgiveness is the bigger person.
The shocking incident had occurred during a show in which actor Adnan Siddiqui was a guest on the show.
Hussain shared how the Bollywood actors Siddiqui has worked with have passed away, namely Khan and Sridevi, with whom he had starred in A Mighty Heart and Mom respectively.
“On the show yesterday, I had a slip of tongue where I lost control of over the flow of my words. Such gaffes can happen in a live transmission and I regret saying what I said. When I said those words, they didn’t seem like a big deal to me but now that I have thought about it I realise that I shouldn’t have said that. I am sorry for this mistake on my part. Remember, the person who asks for forgiveness is the bigger person,” he said.
He went on to add, “Artists from across the border are very dear and respectable to us. I also praised them in the next segment of the show but that didn’t go viral. However, I sincerely apologise for the pain I might have caused to fans and followers around the world.”
Hussain continued that people should appreciate his gesture of accepting his mistake and apologising for it. “If anyone realises his wrongdoings, then the other person should display generosity and allow the person who committed the mistake to learn from it. I’m really sorry. This is my country, my people and I do everything for them. If I hurt my fellow countrymen, I would like to seek forgiveness and I hope you accept my apology.”
Earlier on Friday, Adnan had shared a post on social media expressing his shock and regret at what had happened, vowing to never be a part of such a show again.
“The anchor Aamir Liaquat Sahab joked about something extremely sensitive. Not only were they both close to me but also as a human it was wrong on so many levels. I cannot even call it hitting below the belt. It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light,” he said.
“I want to apologise to the families of Sridevi Sahiba and lrrfan Khan Sahab, their loved ones and fans. If you see my body language I was extremely uncomfortable with what he said but I didn’t want to stoop to that level. I regret being on the show. I’ve learnt my lesson and I promise I will not tolerate such an act in the future. I was hoping this bit wouldn’t become public but unfortunately, it has. I’m sorry,” he concluded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistani actor Adnan Siddiqui apologised to families of Sridevi, Irrfan Khan, here's why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Pakistani actor Adnan Siddiqui faced criticism comments made by a TV show host. The host joked about Siddiqui's deceased former co-stars Sridevi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. The actor apologised through his social media channels calling the whole episode a "callous act".
The host of the TV show 'Jeeway Pakistan', Aamir Liaquat, joked with Siddiqui on the show about how Siddiqui had 'saved lives' of two well-known stars by not doing certain movies.
After Siddiqui seemed to not get the joke, Liaquat's explanation took an insenitive turn when he brought up the now deceased former co-stars of the actor. Liaquat said, ”Look, you worked in Mom, Sri Devi passed away. You worked with Irrfan Khan, and now he died."
"Whoever works with you outside [Pakistani cinema] dies...", he added. 
Siddiqui looked uncomfortable and replied, "This isn't a joke for me. They were both very close to me..." The host then steers the conversation away.
Irrfan Khan died on Wednesday following a battle with a neuroendocrine tumour. Sridevi Kapoor died in February, 2018. Both were celebrated and respected actors, and their deaths shocked Bollywood.
Video footage of the show later went viral. Siddiqui posted an apology on his Twitter account and said, "So I don’t know how to explain what I’m feeling right now or what to say. But this needs to go out. I was invited on the live chat show ‘Jeewey Pakistan’ yesterday when this unfortunate incident happened. The anchor Amir Liaquat Sahab joked about something extremely sensitive. Not only were they both close to me but also as a human it was wrong on so many levels. I cannot even call it ‘hitting below the belt’.
"It was an extremely callous act to joke about the deceased. This is in very bad taste, not only does it show him and me but also the entire country in bad light.

I’ve learnt my lesson and I promise I will not tolerate such an act in future. I was hoping this bit wouldn’t become public but unfortunately it has. I’m sorry. Thank you."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julie Hesmondhalgh admits feeling intimidated on Corrie set was exciting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we return to the Lake District for the third series of this hit drama, two years have passed, but Alison (Morven Christie) and Paul (Lee Ingleby) are still learning how to handle their son Joe’s autism.
Meanwhile, the 10-year-old has a new reality to deal with, as the couple have divorced and Alison’s home is now in Manchester.
As their marriage fell apart, Paul was not in a good place, reckons Inspector George Gently star Lee.
‘He felt detached, lost, out of touch and a bit of a failure, actually,’ he says. ‘I think he was struggling in life.’
Lee reckons the show’s depiction of what having an autistic child can do to a relationship is one of its strengths.
‘It’s good to be open and honest, and we’re showing this has driven a wedge between Alison and Paul,’ he says.
‘They’ve got a family together and that’s going to keep them together anyway, so it’s how they manage that, heartaches and heartbreaks.’
With Joe’s Uncle Eddie single too, the only stable couple is grandad Maurice (Christopher Eccleston) and girlfriend Louise. Her son Ralph’s got some big news to share, though.
‘Maurice is happier than his children, which bemuses him,’ admits Christopher. ‘They’re in early middle age and splintering. Their lives are falling apart, or certainly changing.’
While Alison juggles a university course with work and Joe, there’s a hint of possible romance, after a tetchy first meeting with a single dad.
But how would Joe cope with more changes on the home front? Fans will be keen to find out – and the show’s biggest star, Christopher, says it has a special place in his heart.
‘I’m known for probably three other significant roles – Doctor Who, Our Friends in the North and Cracker,’ he says
 ‘And I’m a runner, so I’m often out and about and I get stopped a lot in the street.
‘I’m stopped just as much about The A Word as I am for those three, which has surprised me. It seems autism has impacted on every person you meet. I often get people crying and saying, “Thank you very much for doing it because we never see anything about autism on the television”.
'This show is as important to me as anything I’ve ever done.’
Julie Hesmondhalgh joins The A Word this series as Joe’s teacher Heather – and admits she is finding it nerve-racking.
‘I came in as a fangirl,’ she says. ‘This has happened from Corrie onwards, I always feel I should be at the gate with my autograph book and somehow I’ve got in!
‘I’ve had to really work at creating this persona that belongs in those environments, that isn’t, “That’s Morven Christie! It’s Chris Eccleston!"
'I’ve got to just be like, “Hi, here I am, an actor, like you, on our set.”‘
'I know, rationally, we’re all human beings with insecurities... but even at the end of Coronation Street after 16 years, I would sometimes be in the Rovers Return and be like, “What am I doing here? I’m in the Rovers. How did this happen?”
'So it was intimidating but exciting.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spoilers: Ben makes a sacrifice for his family in Home and Away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ben (Rohan Nichol) has been back on a good path for a little while now since his troubles with depression, which came about after he was framed for a drug trafficking crime and under investigation from the AFP. Now that he’s no longer facing potential jail time, his board shop is back up and running and his mood has improved.
Wanting to celebrate her husband’s upcoming birthday, Maggie (Kestie Morassi) suggests to Ziggy (Sophie Dillman) that they organise a birthday party for him. However, Ziggy worries it could be too much too soon for her dad. She says he’s only just entered a good place, so big crowds and being in the spotlight may not be a good idea.
In an effort to avoid disappointing Maggie, Ziggy decides to suss out the situation with Ben and runs the idea past him. He’s hesitant, and reacts the way she expected – reluctant to put himself out there and be the centre of attention.
Ziggy relays the response to Maggie, and they’re both disappointed. However, they make plans for a quieter birthday, not wanting to rock the boat and risk Ben entering a bad place with his depression again.
However, Ben is left with food for thought when he sees how upset Maggie is that she can’t celebrate him. After some consideration, he decides to have a change of heart. He tells his wife and daughter they can plan a party, and they’re thrilled. Ben is secretly unsure, though – will the event be too much for him after all?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Utah boy who beat leukemia now faces brain cancer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) - By the time doctors discovered Mac Rogers had brain cancer, he was already a leukemia survivor. Mac was three years old.
He’s seven now, and his prognosis is uncertain. But 10 months ago, parents Brittny and Jeremy Rogers of Hurricane made a momentous decision: They would take him off chemotherapy, at least for a while, and give him a chance at living without its devastating side effects.
And Brittny decided Mac’s story was worth sharing.
She’s written a children’s book called “This Is Hard But You Can Do It,” featuring Mac as the main character. Recently she found an illustrator for the project, then put it on Kickstarter to raise money for the book and audiobook. Only six hours later, it was fully funded.
“I hope that kids and families will be able to take the words that we’ve learned over lots and lots of years of doing hard things and just be able to be more hopeful in dark times,” Brittny said.
Battling leukemia
Brittny and Jeremy first noticed Mac was bruising easily when he was about 8 months old.
The bruises showed up first around his eyes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'King of Bollywood' and Will Smith in star-studded India virus benefit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI, May 4 — India's “King of Bollywood” superstar Shah Rukh Khan told jokes and sang for his adoring fans yesterday during an almost five-hour online benefit to raise funds for those affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Tens of thousands of viewers watched more than 70 of the country's biggest celebrities — including cricket captain Virat Kohli and actor Khan — as well as international names such as actor Will Smith and rock legend Mick Jagger in the I for India show broadcast on Facebook.
“I can, I will, and I must help,” Khan told fans after singing a cheerful, humourous ditty about how “everything will be alright” following the deadly crisis.
Jagger and Smith spoke about the struggles of rural migrant workers, many of whom have lost their jobs and gone hungry during an ongoing nationwide lockdown imposed from late March.
“They may have lost their jobs, they may have lost their homes. They and their families may be going hungry. So I would like to ask you to donate. Please give what you can,” Jagger said.
Bollywood's biggest names — including Indian actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas and hearthrob Hrithik Roshan — along with local choirs and children sang or spoke passionately in English and Hindi about raising money for those in need.
Other celebrities interviewed doctors and experts about the virus and how health workers were coping on the frontlines of the pandemic.
Organised by Bollywood directors Karan Johar and Zoya Akhtar, the event has so far raised 37.5 million rupees (RM2.14 million) out of a target of 60 million rupees.
The donations would be matched rupee-for-rupee by major philanthropic groups including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the organisers said yesterday.
'No work, no home'
The funds will be donated to more than 100 groups providing food and other essential services during the crisis.
Concert organisers said the money was needed “for those who have no work and no home and do not know where their next meal is coming from.”
India, the world's second-most populous nation with 1.3 billion people, late yesterday reported just over 40,000 cases of the infectious disease and 1,306 deaths.
The government has hailed the weeks-long lockdown aimed at limiting the virus's spread, but the number of new daily cases has continued to gradually rise with experts calling for more virus testing.
The lockdown was extended for two weeks on Friday, but some restrictions are set to be eased from Monday in areas with fewer virus cases.
Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of New Delhi, which has the third-highest number of virus cases among India's states and territories, said Sunday that the economic impact of the lockdown was severe in the national capital and the city needed to be reopened in non-virus “containment zones.”.
“People are facing a lot of hardships. Jobs are going. The economic infrastructure has been hit hard,” he said in an online briefing, adding that he would speak to the national government about the possibilities of opening up Delhi.
“We have to start preparations so that we can learn to live with corona. Corona has now come in our country It's not going to go anywhere.” — AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Evans assembles ‘Avengers’ stars Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner for a virtual reunion to raise funds for COVID-19 relief efforts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just a year ago fans bid their final farewell to their favourite Marvel heroes, The Avengers, in the superhit film ‘Avengers: Endgame’. Luckily, the goodbye was not for long as ‘Captain America’ star Chris Evans has announced a virtual reunion of the Original six cast members - Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.
The actor, who finally made his Instagram debut to raise funds for the fight against the novel coronavirus, promised a fun game session, and a “virtual hangout” where lucky fans can indulge in a “private Q&A.”
Making fans an offer they can’t refuse, Chris said, “You can ask us anything. We'll spill the beans.”
Evans made his debut on the photo-sharing website on May 1 and shared that he is taking part in the All In Challenge, launched to help raise money to fight hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The actor said that he feels the cause should encourage fans to join in. "This is a great cause. This helps people who are in need during this COVID nightmare. So I am very happy to be doing this."
He then passed the challenge to fellow Marvel star friends, Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie, as well as Billy Porter, with who he will be collaborating with in the upcoming film ‘Little Shop of Horrors’.
The actor's challenge page shared details that the offer of hanging out goes to one lucky winner and two friends.
"100 per cent of the money raised through this Game/Auction will go directly to Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry," read his statement.

In addition to thanking fans for all of their support over the years, they also offered words of encouragement for everyone social distancing during the coronavirus epedemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec designer launches mask line inspired by star skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a line of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of the Olympic figure skaters he dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years, including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and world silver medalist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
The profits from the mask sales go to the World Health Organization in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
"We took the same materials as the skaters’ costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks,” said Caron, who also designs dancewear, gownS and wedding dresses.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than an ordinary mask.”
The limited-edition masks are not for all budgets - the eight models cost between $150 and $300.
Japanese customers were not deterred, snatching items inspired by Uno’s costumes, which retail for $200 to $250. Initially, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
"I was surprised,” Caron said. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn’t think people had so much money to buy a mask.”
Caron says his goal was not to heighten his brand.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration,” he said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks.”
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibers. The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters’ outfits. The material is breathable, with padding to give shape and structure.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all,” Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector’s item.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hollywood artist teams up with Qatar-based sister to tutor Arabic-speaking kids during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles: It was during a phone conversation with her sister back in Qatar that the idea clicked for Hollywood animation artist Reem Ali Adeeb.
Like other regions across the world, young children in the Middle East were confined at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there was not nearly enough original content online in Arabic to keep them entertained, such as fun tutorials and other activities.
So Ali Adeeb, a Syrian-born animation artist who works at Warner Bros. Entertainment in Los Angeles, and her sister Sandi, a university lecturer of pharmaceutics in Qatar, decided to take matters into their own hands.
The pair set up "Susupreemo," a YouTube channel designed to help Arabic-speaking kids -- and their stressed-out parents -- weather the coronavirus lockdowns through basic tutorials on drawing, making origami or simply reading children's books, all in Arabic.
"The idea is to create videos to engage the kids," said Ali Adeeb, who at Warner Bros. has worked on children's shows including "Green Eggs and Ham," a Netflix animated series based on the Dr. Seuss classic.
"There's tons of content on the web in English for kids but there is not enough original content in Arabic," added the 34-year-old who is now working from home on the second season of the Netflix show.
"So the aim is to make their screen time interactive and inspiring by drawing with them, reading them a story or doing crafts."
Ali Adeeb said her sister's 7-year-old son Omar has even joined in the fun, offering origami tutorials to his peers.
"He's been the best. He's done the most among us with three videos recorded already," she said.
Ali Adeeb herself is using some of the characters from "Green Eggs and Ham," notably Chickeraffe, a chicken/giraffe hybrid, to draw young viewers into her world.
Sandi for her part keeps her young audience focused and allows their imagination to travel by reading them children's books.
"I thought I would read for kids during a time where buying or lending a book is very challenging, especially for some disadvantaged kids in some Arab countries," she told AFP in an email.
"I started with a book suitable for children aged 3 to 6 years old and now I am selecting more books that can engage the kids for longer periods," she added.
A new reality
The response, so far, has been overwhelmingly positive with children enthusiastically sharing their drawings via email and parents thankful for the opportunity to be able to hold work meetings online without being interrupted or just have some time for themselves.
In a region often wracked by war, and where children faced a harsh reality even before the pandemic, experts say such tutorials offer kids a reprieve whether in the comfort of their homes or even in refugee camps.
"Nowadays, children worldwide are confined in their homes and children in the Middle East are no exception," said Annamaria Laurini, the former head of UNICEF in Lebanon.
"Suddenly their own world has disappeared -- no more school, no more play with their friends and no more human interactions except with their family," she added. "It's a lonely reality that makes it difficult to dream, that confines their imagination to the walls of their room -- if they are so lucky to have one."
Soha Bsat Boustani, a UNICEF consultant based in Beirut, said the YouTube tutorials are much needed in a region where such material in Arabic for children is lagging in terms of creativity and innovation.
"And so, initiatives like 'Susupreemo' can only be seen in a positive light as it gives children a healthy way out of confinement and a sense of normalcy."
So far Ali Adeeb, her sister and nephew have produced seven videos and they hope to continue with their project even after the pandemic.
"I'm thinking now of teaching kids how to draw popular cartoon characters ... and I'm hoping to open this space for other artists," she said. "I have a friend who is a dancer and I would love for her to teach kids how to dance.
"There's a lot more we can do."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury pranked into thinking they landed a James Corden interview</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are the latest stars to fall victim to notorious celebrity prankster Josh Pieters.
He made the oblivious Love Island finalists think they were being interviewed by James Corden on the Late Late Show.
Clips of the US favourite asking random questions were snatched from other shows by the YouTube star, who cobbled together an interview as the pair sat on their sofa dressed to impress.
They were told by a fake producer that transatlantic issues means they couldn't actually see James asking his questions - but he could see them.
Like his others victims, they only find out when the video drops online.
They didn't even twig when a soundbite of James saying 'oh wow' was played a number of times at their less than amazing answers.
James begun: "So, you two are dating?"
Confused boxer Tommy responded: "It might be a bit past dating, but call it that if you want!"
Fake James then asked them to explain what it is they actually do.
He also wanted to know who would play them in a movie - and asked who was doing the housework in lockdown.
The comedian kept them going for a few minutes without the couple thinking a thing was wrong.
Funnyman Josh has history - he wound up Katie Hopkins by dragging the controversial star to Prague to collect a fake award earlier this year.
He presented Katie with a trophy for a lifetime achievement award at a fake ceremony for made-up campaign group The Cape Town Collective For Freedom of Speech.
Josh said he emailed her asking if she would fly to accept their made-up award, dubbed the Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy.
Things turned controversial as she was recorded mocking Muslims, Asian people and epilepsy sufferers.
Fans loved his latest prank as he stitched up the Love Island stars.
"Josh! You're spoiling us!!!" one posted.
Another said: "Let's just hope James Corden sees the funny side!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island’s Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury tricked into thinking they’re on James Corden’s US chatshow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOVE Island's Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury were duped into thinking they were appearing on James Corden's hit American chat show in a cruel prank.
The pair appeared via link from their Manchester home believing they were talking to the Gavin & Stacey star - but were actually being played old clips off him.
YouTube pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners were behind the elaborate joke, posing as TV producers who told them they wouldn't be able to see James because of technical issues.
The pair then played Tommy and Molly old clips of the Late Late Show host from previous shows, including the same recording of the host saying "Oh woooow" which popped up again and again.
The first question seemed to catch them by surprise with 'James' saying: "I don't know if people know this - you two are a couple. You're dating."
Seeming surprised that the fact might have escaped anyone, Tommy replied: "You could call it dating if you want. We might be a little bit past that, but OK."
The pair continued with their questions punctuating it regularly with the same clips of James giggling.
Another recording of the 41-year-old TV star heard him saying: "Now in the UK everybody knows what you do. Try to explain to these folks if you can a little what it is you actually do?"
Tommy, 20, replied that he was a "professional boxer" and Molly a "full-time influencer" as they explained the story of their Love Island romance.
The fake host then asked who they would want to play them in a movie, with Tommy saying Leonardo DiCaprio while Molly-Mae chose his Wolf Of Wall Street co-star Margot Robbie.
 
The clip ended with the pair seemingly none the wiser that they had been tricked - and that, contrary to what they had been told, would not be appearing on The Late Late Show.
Nonetheless it delighted YouTube fans, with one laughing: "The 'Oh wooow' sounds so fake that I die every time it comes up."
Another wrote: "I kinda feel like some of these guys are having their doubts but don’t wanna risk it actually being James Corden."
Tommy and Molly-Mae shot to reality-star fame on Love Island's summer series last year but were unexpectedly beaten to the top prize by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea.
Yet, Love Island fans will not see the popular show return in 2020 after the summer series was cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury pranked into James Corden ‘interview’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are among the latest stars to have fallen victim to prankster Josh Pieters. 
The couple were tricked into believing they had landed an interview on the Late Late Show with James Corden recently when actually, it was YouTube star Josh orchestrating the fake chat behind the scenes. 
Molly-Mae and Tommy, both 20, thought they were in communication with a producer who had booked them in for a spot on the US chat show via video link, due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, it was simply Josh and his crew using segments of an old interview James did with Julia Michaels and JP Saxe. 
In one of his lines, James says: ‘I don’t know if people know this but you are a couple? You’re dating.’ 
The reality stars nodded in unison – although slightly confused at the obvious line of questioning – as Tommy confirmed: ‘You can call it dating if you want, yeah. It might be a little bit past that but OK,’ referring to the fact they’ve lived together for months.’ 
James then ‘asked’ how the couple have been coping ‘sheltering’ together during the lockdown, to which Molly-Mae replied: ‘It’s been fine, he’s been working out a lot. I’ve been doing a lot of tidying.’ 
Boxer Tommy added: ‘I miss being punched in the face but what can you do?’ 
At one point, the so-called producers make out there’s a wifi issue between Tommy and Molly and James, prompting them to momentarily halt the interview before resuming. 
The talk show host then asks Tommy who he’d love to play in a movie to which the boxer chose Leonardo DiCaprio, while Molly-Mae opted for Margot Robbie so they could have a ‘Wolf of Wall Street moment’. 
‘Producer’ Josh then wrapped up the interview with an outro from James, bringing his prank to a close without suspicion.
Tommy and Molly shouldn’t feel too bad though as they aren’t the only stars who have been targeted in Josh’s three-day prank series – singer Craig David also made the cut. 
Earlier this year, Josh famously pranked Katie Hopkins into believing she had won a Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy award, even flying her out to Prague, but it was entirely fake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A YouTuber tricked celebrities into thinking they were appearing on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTuber Josh Pieters has had to be inventive when coming up with his social experiments during lockdown in the UK, as everything, from formulating the plan to setting it in motion, has to be done from his home in London.
However, thanks to the sudden boom in video calling, he managed to convince celebrities they were appearing on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”
Pieters scraped many of Corden’s old interviews and video segments for sound bites and collected enough to make one side of a believable conversation. There was obviously no video feed, but the guests were told they would be chaperoned by the show’s producer, who was convincingly played by Pieters’ friend and sidekick Archie Manners.
Celebrities and their managers were none the wiser, as so many late night show hosts have been doing interviews from their own homes.
In the first of three videos in the series, British pop star Craig David and the UK’s biggest TikTok star Holly Hubert,who goes by Holly H, were interviewed. While Pieters took care of the voice notes to try and come up with a coherent flow of conversation, Manners kept things moving in his own flat across town, with the help of an imaginary assistant named “Sharon.”
They were also treated to exclusive performances. David sang one of his biggest hits, “Rise and Fall,” while Hubert demonstrated the viral TikTok dance the Renegade.
“As you know, the ‘Late Late Show with James Corden’ is on TV every night, so it’s only right that our show does the same,” Pieters said at the end of the video.
The second video featured Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” and magician Julius Dein, and was posted on Saturday.
Dein sneaked in a flogging attempt for his magic box, while the couple were asked how they were getting on in quarantine.
The grand finale will air on Sunday, which you will definitely want to tune in for.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte is often compared to a young Prince William, but fans are saying she looks just like one of her distant relatives, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte turned 5 years old on Saturday, and with her birthday came a new round of royal photographs taken by Kate Middleton herself.
In the photos that were released to mark her birthday, Princess Charlotte is shown helping her family deliver packages of meals to people in need. The young royal also posed for a formal portrait, which was also taken by the Duchess of Cambridge.
Photos of Princess Charlotte, the middle child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are often compared to pictures of Prince William from when he was around the same age.
Prince William once even confused a childhood photo of himself for a picture of his daughter.
However, Princess Charlotte’s latest birthday portraits have brought to light another royal lookalike – one of her older cousins, Lady Sarah Chatto.
Lady Sarah Chatto is the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister. This makes Lady Sarah Chatto a niece of the Queen, and a second cousin of Princess Charlotte.
Above, a photo from around 1969 shows a young Lady Sarah Chatto (then Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones) with her brother, Viscount Linley.
Princess Charlotte looked especially similar to her cousin when she wore a similar green coat and even, ironically, had her hair styled in a similar fashion during the family’s Christmas celebrations in 2019.
Other photos of young Lady Sarah Chatto resemble Princess Charlotte’s signature cheeky facial expressions and bashful waves.
Another interesting detail about the two distant cousins is that Lady Sarah Chatto’s birthday is May 1, and Princess Charlotte’s birthday is May 2. The cousins are some 51 years apart in age, but photos of the two taken around the same time of their lives have some pretty uncanny similarities.
In addition to Lady Sarah Chatto and Prince William, pictures of Princess Charlotte have also been compared to childhood photos of her great-grandma Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana, and Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte is often compared to a young Prince William, but fans are saying she looks just like one of her distant relatives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte turned 5 years old on Saturday, and with her birthday came a new round of royal photographs taken by Kate Middleton herself.
In the photos that were released to mark her birthday, Princess Charlotte is shown helping her family deliver packages of meals to people in need. The young royal also posed for a formal portrait, which was also taken by the Duchess of Cambridge.
Photos of Princess Charlotte, the middle child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are often compared to pictures of Prince William from when he was around the same age.
Prince William once even confused a childhood photo of himself for a picture of his daughter.
However, Princess Charlotte’s latest birthday portraits have brought to light another royal lookalike – one of her older cousins, Lady Sarah Chatto.
Lady Sarah Chatto is the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister. This makes Lady Sarah Chatto a niece of the Queen, and a second cousin of Princess Charlotte.
Above, a photo from around 1969 shows a young Lady Sarah Chatto (then Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones) with her brother, Viscount Linley.
Princess Charlotte looked especially similar to her cousin when she wore a similar green coat and even, ironically, had her hair styled in a similar fashion during the family’s Christmas celebrations in 2019.
Other photos of young Lady Sarah Chatto resemble Princess Charlotte’s signature cheeky facial expressions and bashful waves.
Another interesting detail about the two distant cousins is that Lady Sarah Chatto’s birthday is May 1, and Princess Charlotte’s birthday is May 2. The cousins are some 51 years apart in age, but photos of the two taken around the same time of their lives have some pretty uncanny similarities.
In addition to Lady Sarah Chatto and Prince William, pictures of Princess Charlotte have also been compared to childhood photos of her great-grandma Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana, and Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte Turns 5, and Helps the Needy During Lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PRINCESS CHARLOTTE PITCHES IN: Princess Charlotte turned five on Saturday and to mark the milestone, Kensington Palace has released a series of photos that show the little royal helping the needy during lockdown.
The pictures, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge in April, were shot on Queen Elizabeth’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, where members of the royal family helped to pack up and deliver food to isolated elderly people in the local area.
 
 
The Cambridges have been staying at their home, Anmer Hall, on the estate during the lockdown. Charlotte and her elder brother Prince George are still being schooled at home — just like most British children right now — and have also been showing their support for National Health Service during lockdown. They’ve been pictured clapping for NHS workers on Thursday evening.
Last month, their little brother Prince Louis was photographed making rainbows with finger paints to help spread some cheer in these dark days. The Duchess of Cambridge took those photos, too, to mark Louis’ second birthday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Royals celebrate Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released new photographs to celebrate their daughter Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday.
The couple's middle child turned five on Saturday and they posted four new pictures to their Twitter account the day before and added a fifth picture on her birthday.
They wrote: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow.
"The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area."
A message on the couple's Kensington Palace Twitter account on Saturday added: "Thank you for all your lovely messages on Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday!
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share a new photograph of Princess Charlotte, taken by The Duchess this April."
All of the pictures were taken by keen amateur photographer Catherine and four of them showed Charlotte helping to pack homemade pasta and deliver food parcels to isolated pensioners near the family's home Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.
The entire family, including Prince William, 37, Duchess Catherine, 38, and their sons Prince George, six and Prince Louis, two, helped Charlotte deliver the food parcels, as part of an initiative started by Queen Elizabeth's staff at her Sandringham estate.
They spent two and a half hours driving around to deliver food and one delighted resident told the Daily Mail newspaper: "They got drenched as it was pouring with the rain but I think they just wanted to do their bit."
Meanwhile, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla wished the youngster a happy birthday via Twitter, sharing one of Catherine's pictures and writing: "Wishing Princess Charlotte a very Happy Birthday."
And a message on the official Royal Family's account read: "A very Happy Birthday to Princess Charlotte who is celebrating her 5th birthday today. Princess Charlotte is The Queen's fifth great-grandchild.
"To mark the day @KensingtonRoyal have released new photos of Princess Charlotte taken by The Duchess of Cambridge."

    <h5 class="mb-1">New photos released for Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2 (UPI) -- Britain's Kensington Palace released four new photos of Princess Charlotte in honor of her fifth birthday Saturday.
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow. The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area," the palace captioned Friday's snapshots, which show the tiny royal wearing a black-and-white houndstooth coat-dress.
Charlotte is the middle child of Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton.
The couple, who celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary Wednesday, are also parents to Prince George, 6, and Prince Louis, 2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte marks fifth birthday delivering food packages</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday has been marked by the release of photographs showing the young royal helping to load a van with food and delivering meals for those in need.
Charlotte was volunteering with her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis, ahead of her birthday which she celebrates on Saturday.
The princess is shown in two photographs holding white bags of fresh food for pensioners shielding themselves due to the coronavirus outbreak or other vulnerable people in lockdown in Norfolk.
In another image she knocks on the door of an elderly resident as she holds a bag of fresh pasta which William, Kate and their children spent several hours making the day before the delivery.
Four pictures, taken in April by Kate, have been released and the final photograph is a portrait of her daughter smiling as she looks straight at the camera.
The Cambridges got soaked as they made their rounds, likely to be in the area around their home of Anmer Hall which is on the Queen's Norfolk estate of Sandringham.
Over the past five weeks, the Queen's Sandringham staff have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and vulnerable people living in the local area, Buckingham Palace has said.
Around 1,000 meals were made and delivered in the first week alone.
It is not known if William was behind the wheel of the delivery van which was from the Sandringham Visitor Centre.
The birthday girl's full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge,.
She was born at the private maternity Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lb 3oz.
Kate is a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society which has regularly released pictures she has taken of George, six, and Louis, two, to mark their birthdays.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte’s birthday: Her life in pictures so far</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young royal, who has become known and loved for her cheekiness, sassiness and adorable royal waves to the press and public, will today be celebrating her birthday at home in Anmer Hall with her family. 
To mark the occasion of her fifth birthday, her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have released new images of the youngster.
Snapped by keen amateur photographer Kate recently near their home in Norfolk, the photos show Charlotte lending a helping hand in the local neighbourhood.
The new photos were taken when Prince William, Kate and the kids helped pack up and deliver homemade pasta and food packages for the vulnerable and isolated pensioners living in their local area in Norfolk. 
The photos, published by Kensington Palace on social media, have received thousands of comments from well wishers.
So, as Princess Charlotte celebrates turning the grand old age of five, we look back at her life in pictures so far, from her first introduction to the public outside the Lindo Wing in London, to her first royal tour, day of school and the moment she proved she mastered her Great Grandmother’s iconic royal wave. 
Princess Charlotte of Cambridge was born on the May 2 2015 in the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in London. 
The second child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she joined her big brother Prince George in one of the most famous families in the world and became fourth in line to the British throne. 
Despite rumours that she may be named Alice, Kate and William chose the moniker Charlotte for their little girl, which just so happens to be the middle name of her aunt – Kate’s sister – Pippa Middleton.
She is also named in honour of two very important women in Prince William’s life – his grandmother the Queen and his late mother, Princess Diana.
Princess Charlotte’s full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
There hasn’t been a member of the royal family called Charlotte in over two hundred years, so this little Princess was destined to make her mark and carve her own path. 
At the tender age of five, Princess Charlotte has already completed her fair share of royal duties and appearances, joining her parents on her first ever royal tour before she was 18 months old. 
Charlotte also joined her family on The Duke and Duchess’s official visit to Poland and Germany in July 2017.
Before joining her big brother Prince George at Thomas’s Battersea school in London in September last year, Princess Charlotte attended Willcocks Nursery School in London.
The feisty character was reportedly known as the ‘warrior princess’ at nursery thanks to her confidence. 
In March 2017, Kate revealed that Princess Charlotte was ‘the one in charge’ in their family and she was ‘very chatty and likes doing play dates with George.’
According to royal expert and author Katie Nicholl, Charlotte loves playing outside and exploring: ‘She loves climbing trees and she’s very much an adventurer, she was quite known for her feisty personality.’
Happy Birthday Charlotte!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zandra Rhodes says 'shy' party pal Princess Diana couldn't hide one bad habit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oh, I’m not enjoying myself, I really am not,’ is the opening line from Dame Zandra Rhodes, who is not having a nice time in lockdown.
‘I’ve got a lovely penthouse with a roof garden, camellias in full bloom and my lilies are coming out, but it’s like a weird, rubbish holiday. Do you know what I mean?’
Lockdown might hit harder for iconic fashion designer Zandra because The Real Marigold Hotel has just landed on our screens and she’s being reminded of her glorious trip to India.
She was lucky enough to take the journey of a lifetime along with fellow celebrities such as Bond Girl Britt Ekland, Duncan Bannatyne and Paul Chuckle.
‘It was a fabulous experience,’ she beams. ‘Britt is an old friend anyway and legendary cricket commentator Henry Blofeld is known as the man with the golden voice if you’re my age!’ she giggles.
'It was a lovely experience being plonked together with people I didn’t know that well and having an adventure. And of course I adore India, so the culture shock didn’t bother me. I’m not sure they all liked it though,’ she says, clearly remembering a few difficult moments from the trip.
Despite some guests on the show (Zandra’s tight-lipped about who) not enjoying the experience, there were a few factors that made it tricky even for seasoned travellers.
‘Blimey we had to organise a night’s sleep for ourselves when we got there!’ Zandra exclaims. ‘I’ve been lucky that every time I’ve visited before I’ve been looked after very well, but there we all were, getting our own tickets for trains and getting lost and all sorts!’ she laughs.
‘I did sneak off and have a cup of tea with the woman who had done all the beading for me for years on my dresses, so that was wonderful,’ she smiles. ‘I had to leave the show early though as my partner had fallen ill. But I still had a lovely time.’
The fashion icon sadly lost her long-term partner, Salah, in June of last year, and has moved back to her hometown of London for the time being while selling their San Diego house. It’s obvious she is feeling the loss even more in the current climate.
‘I’ve got a lot of tasks I’ve had to put on hold,’ she tells us. ‘My partner and I lived in San Diego, so when he died I packed up the home as I didn’t need a huge house, but I ended up putting a load of stuff in storage thinking I could go back to it,’ she sighs.
‘Well, funny how life turns out, eh! But I’m finding it all extra hard as I like working and being around people. I can ignore them, don’t get me wrong,’ she laughs, ‘I like just having people in my consciousness. A lot can be said for a nod or a smile,’ she says sadly.
‘My sister lives round the corner from my London flat and she rings me every morning and evening to check I’m OK,’ she tells us. ‘But the life we had together in America was quite wonderful. He worked, I worked. He was perfect for me.’
A self-proclaimed workaholic, Zandra graduated from design college in 1963 and had made a name for herself in the fashion industry by the early 70s. Despite becoming one of the UK’s most prolific fashion designers with loyal customers such as Princess Diana and rock stars and models, she’s very modest about her achievements.
‘When I started out no one would buy my designs, so I set up a shop with Sylvia Ayton (another iconic designer who turned high street shop Wallis into a hit) and it became rather trendy,’ she tells us. ‘When it closed I thought, “I ain’t giving up now!”’ she laughs.
‘I got someone to show me how to make patterns, opened a studio in Bayswater, London, and put together some dresses. Next I took them to America and was met by the editor of American Vogue who raved about them, photographed them on Natalie Wood and then I started to sell my dresses to top shops in New York. Voilà!’
The way Zandra reflects on her career in such a nonchalant way makes us think she doesn’t like to boast about her success.
In fact, when we ask her about her friendship with Princess Diana, she goes all coy.
‘She was a very shy woman,’ she says quietly. ‘I did notice she bit her nails though!’
She also downplays her pieces she created with rock legend Freddie Mercury. ‘He and Brian May came over one evening and I made him the pleated top you always saw him in,’ she smiles.
During our chat Zandra’s phone rings constantly, (‘Oh I am good at ignoring it! Don’t worry!’), and it’s clear she loves a natter, in fact she regularly reminds us we can chat about anything we like. But she has a pretty good reason as to why looking back at her career isn’t her favourite topic.
‘It makes me feel too old!’ she howls. But appearance-wise, Zandra vows to never change her style as she grows older.
‘I’ll never, ever have grey hair,’ she tells us. ‘I have my hair bleached every eight weeks and I even re-pink it myself in between so it doesn’t go too pale. I like it nice and bright!’
Her eccentric style certainly makes her stand out in a crowd and a sense of individuality is something she had from a young age.
‘My mother was encouraging of whatever I wanted to do and I think a lot can be said for that,’ she smiles. ‘But being different has always been an accident. I’m just me.
'In fact, I had a letter a while back from a lady who said, “I used to travel on the bus to school with you and I’m so sorry me and my friends laughed at you.” I replied, “That’s nice, but I never noticed anyone laughing at me,”’ she tells us honestly. ‘I’ve always had a thick skin. And that’s lucky, this industry is impossible if you don’t have it.’
Zandra regularly brings up her late partner and loves talking about him proudly. The pair met when she was 53 – she keeps his memory alive by sharing anecdotes and hanging plenty of photographs of their happiest memories.
‘Guests love the downstairs toilet for photographs!’ she exclaims. ‘My partner with Harrison Ford and various movie stars. He was always so driven, an amazing man,’ she tells us.
When the pair met at a dinner party in New York back in 1992, Zandra was impressed by how Egyptian-born Salah was a self-made man.
‘He started as an usher in a cinema in Brooklyn and became the President of Warner Brothers,’ she tells us proudly. ‘Life was glamorous of course, but we were ordinary at home. We’d have 12 people over at the weekends and I’d cook us all a three-course meal from scratch.’
Ordinarily, out of lockdown, Zandra has fashion interns who live with her to learn the tricks of the trade. It’s an opportunity for her to get in the kitchen. ‘I have a lovely room with four bunk beds and I love making lunch for everybody,’ she tells us.
‘A nice leek and potato soup we all eat round the table. Maybe some smoked salmon and salsa. A bread and butter pudding,’ she lists, drifting off into a food daydream. ‘But cooking to be sat here on my own? Forget it! I’m bored of cooking and washing up and eating leftovers… Utterly sick of it!’
Food might not be top of the agenda at the moment, but Zandra got a chance to show off her culinary skills on Celebrity MasterChef last year alongside the likes of Oti Mabuse and Joey Essex. ‘Oti thought the boys had more help than we did. And although I didn’t win, I know for sure I was a better cook than the boys. No doubt about it!’ she cackles.
She celebrated 50 years of fabulous fashion with an exhibit and book last year, is still designing and has the ball rolling to start her own charity, so Zandra has no plans to slow down.
‘I probably should slow down,’ she says coyly. ‘But I think the easiest thing for me is to keep working and drop dead in the middle of it,’ she smiles. ‘Retiring is what I’m meant to do, but will I actually do it? Probably not.’
And with that, Zandra is off to unpack boxes, hang up more photos and tend to the plants. ‘See what I mean?’ she smiles. ‘There’s always work to be done! Oh well, l’ll get there in the end, eh?’ With a work ethic like hers, we’ve no doubt about it.
Lie-in or up early?
I never, ever lie in – 8am is the latest I ever wake up.
Healthy breakfast or fry up?
I have a bowl of cereal and a coffee. I never cook breakfast just for myself.
Chores or relaxing?
Well my normal routine has all gone to smoke! Ordinarily I’d use Sunday to visit an exhibition and cook for friends. Now I do fun chores, the washing up isn’t one of them.
TV or papers?
My TV hasn’t worked for years. I’ve never seen any of the big shows, not even that dancing programme lovely Oti is on. I don’t do papers either, I just stick to Radio 4.
Go for a walk or stay inside?
I haven’t been going for my government-approved walks, I’m very naughty. I have to try and get myself in the habit of it so I keep fit and healthy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zandra Rhodes says 'shy' party pal Princess Diana couldn't hide one bad habit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oh, I’m not enjoying myself, I really am not,’ is the opening line from Dame Zandra Rhodes, who is not having a nice time in lockdown.
‘I’ve got a lovely penthouse with a roof garden, camellias in full bloom and my lilies are coming out, but it’s like a weird, rubbish holiday. Do you know what I mean?’
Lockdown might hit harder for iconic fashion designer Zandra because The Real Marigold Hotel has just landed on our screens and she’s being reminded of her glorious trip to India.
She was lucky enough to take the journey of a lifetime along with fellow celebrities such as Bond Girl Britt Ekland, Duncan Bannatyne and Paul Chuckle.
‘It was a fabulous experience,’ she beams. ‘Britt is an old friend anyway and legendary cricket commentator Henry Blofeld is known as the man with the golden voice if you’re my age!’ she giggles.
'It was a lovely experience being plonked together with people I didn’t know that well and having an adventure. And of course I adore India, so the culture shock didn’t bother me. I’m not sure they all liked it though,’ she says, clearly remembering a few difficult moments from the trip.
Despite some guests on the show (Zandra’s tight-lipped about who) not enjoying the experience, there were a few factors that made it tricky even for seasoned travellers.
‘Blimey we had to organise a night’s sleep for ourselves when we got there!’ Zandra exclaims. ‘I’ve been lucky that every time I’ve visited before I’ve been looked after very well, but there we all were, getting our own tickets for trains and getting lost and all sorts!’ she laughs.
‘I did sneak off and have a cup of tea with the woman who had done all the beading for me for years on my dresses, so that was wonderful,’ she smiles. ‘I had to leave the show early though as my partner had fallen ill. But I still had a lovely time.’
The fashion icon sadly lost her long-term partner, Salah, in June of last year, and has moved back to her hometown of London for the time being while selling their San Diego house. It’s obvious she is feeling the loss even more in the current climate.
‘I’ve got a lot of tasks I’ve had to put on hold,’ she tells us. ‘My partner and I lived in San Diego, so when he died I packed up the home as I didn’t need a huge house, but I ended up putting a load of stuff in storage thinking I could go back to it,’ she sighs.
‘Well, funny how life turns out, eh! But I’m finding it all extra hard as I like working and being around people. I can ignore them, don’t get me wrong,’ she laughs, ‘I like just having people in my consciousness. A lot can be said for a nod or a smile,’ she says sadly.
‘My sister lives round the corner from my London flat and she rings me every morning and evening to check I’m OK,’ she tells us. ‘But the life we had together in America was quite wonderful. He worked, I worked. He was perfect for me.’
A self-proclaimed workaholic, Zandra graduated from design college in 1963 and had made a name for herself in the fashion industry by the early 70s. Despite becoming one of the UK’s most prolific fashion designers with loyal customers such as Princess Diana and rock stars and models, she’s very modest about her achievements.
‘When I started out no one would buy my designs, so I set up a shop with Sylvia Ayton (another iconic designer who turned high street shop Wallis into a hit) and it became rather trendy,’ she tells us. ‘When it closed I thought, “I ain’t giving up now!”’ she laughs.
‘I got someone to show me how to make patterns, opened a studio in Bayswater, London, and put together some dresses. Next I took them to America and was met by the editor of American Vogue who raved about them, photographed them on Natalie Wood and then I started to sell my dresses to top shops in New York. Voilà!’
The way Zandra reflects on her career in such a nonchalant way makes us think she doesn’t like to boast about her success.
In fact, when we ask her about her friendship with Princess Diana, she goes all coy.
‘She was a very shy woman,’ she says quietly. ‘I did notice she bit her nails though!’
She also downplays her pieces she created with rock legend Freddie Mercury. ‘He and Brian May came over one evening and I made him the pleated top you always saw him in,’ she smiles.
During our chat Zandra’s phone rings constantly, (‘Oh I am good at ignoring it! Don’t worry!’), and it’s clear she loves a natter, in fact she regularly reminds us we can chat about anything we like. But she has a pretty good reason as to why looking back at her career isn’t her favourite topic.
‘It makes me feel too old!’ she howls. But appearance-wise, Zandra vows to never change her style as she grows older.
‘I’ll never, ever have grey hair,’ she tells us. ‘I have my hair bleached every eight weeks and I even re-pink it myself in between so it doesn’t go too pale. I like it nice and bright!’
Her eccentric style certainly makes her stand out in a crowd and a sense of individuality is something she had from a young age.
‘My mother was encouraging of whatever I wanted to do and I think a lot can be said for that,’ she smiles. ‘But being different has always been an accident. I’m just me.
'In fact, I had a letter a while back from a lady who said, “I used to travel on the bus to school with you and I’m so sorry me and my friends laughed at you.” I replied, “That’s nice, but I never noticed anyone laughing at me,”’ she tells us honestly. ‘I’ve always had a thick skin. And that’s lucky, this industry is impossible if you don’t have it.’
Zandra regularly brings up her late partner and loves talking about him proudly. The pair met when she was 53 – she keeps his memory alive by sharing anecdotes and hanging plenty of photographs of their happiest memories.
‘Guests love the downstairs toilet for photographs!’ she exclaims. ‘My partner with Harrison Ford and various movie stars. He was always so driven, an amazing man,’ she tells us.
When the pair met at a dinner party in New York back in 1992, Zandra was impressed by how Egyptian-born Salah was a self-made man.
‘He started as an usher in a cinema in Brooklyn and became the President of Warner Brothers,’ she tells us proudly. ‘Life was glamorous of course, but we were ordinary at home. We’d have 12 people over at the weekends and I’d cook us all a three-course meal from scratch.’
Ordinarily, out of lockdown, Zandra has fashion interns who live with her to learn the tricks of the trade. It’s an opportunity for her to get in the kitchen. ‘I have a lovely room with four bunk beds and I love making lunch for everybody,’ she tells us.
‘A nice leek and potato soup we all eat round the table. Maybe some smoked salmon and salsa. A bread and butter pudding,’ she lists, drifting off into a food daydream. ‘But cooking to be sat here on my own? Forget it! I’m bored of cooking and washing up and eating leftovers… Utterly sick of it!’
Food might not be top of the agenda at the moment, but Zandra got a chance to show off her culinary skills on Celebrity MasterChef last year alongside the likes of Oti Mabuse and Joey Essex. ‘Oti thought the boys had more help than we did. And although I didn’t win, I know for sure I was a better cook than the boys. No doubt about it!’ she cackles.
She celebrated 50 years of fabulous fashion with an exhibit and book last year, is still designing and has the ball rolling to start her own charity, so Zandra has no plans to slow down.
‘I probably should slow down,’ she says coyly. ‘But I think the easiest thing for me is to keep working and drop dead in the middle of it,’ she smiles. ‘Retiring is what I’m meant to do, but will I actually do it? Probably not.’
And with that, Zandra is off to unpack boxes, hang up more photos and tend to the plants. ‘See what I mean?’ she smiles. ‘There’s always work to be done! Oh well, l’ll get there in the end, eh?’ With a work ethic like hers, we’ve no doubt about it.
Lie-in or up early?
I never, ever lie in – 8am is the latest I ever wake up.
Healthy breakfast or fry up?
I have a bowl of cereal and a coffee. I never cook breakfast just for myself.
Chores or relaxing?
Well my normal routine has all gone to smoke! Ordinarily I’d use Sunday to visit an exhibition and cook for friends. Now I do fun chores, the washing up isn’t one of them.
TV or papers?
My TV hasn’t worked for years. I’ve never seen any of the big shows, not even that dancing programme lovely Oti is on. I don’t do papers either, I just stick to Radio 4.
Go for a walk or stay inside?
I haven’t been going for my government-approved walks, I’m very naughty. I have to try and get myself in the habit of it so I keep fit and healthy.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When there is hope in her name, we can use it for a little rhetoric that sounds nice, can’t we? We are talking about Tanya Hope, the Bangalore actress who was last seen in Ravi Teja’s ‘Disco Raja’ and also starred in four Telugu movies previously.
What do you think about Tanya in this latest pic? We know you’ll say, she is sensuous. The lighting is perfect on her beautiful skin.
For us, this pic is her hot and feminine vision of 2020. But, she says Tanya has got her 2020 vision when she sees her fans and followers.
That must be her inspiration, and Tanya’s hot and gorgeous pics will be the real inspiration for her followers on social media to log in to check out her hot pics.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just like her big brother Prince George, Princess Charlotte's personality shines through every time she makes a new appearance. The young princess and professional bridesmaid has definitely mastered the perfect princess wave, but she's just as likely to poke her tongue out or tease photographers as she is to pose for the perfect portrait . . . after all, royal or not, she's just a kid!
The young royal can't hide what she's thinking, whether she's overjoyed at a polo match or overtired at Trooping the Colour. We've been lucky enough to witness many of Charlotte's sweet moments as she's gained confidence and begun to really ham it up when she spots royal photographers, flashing smirks, and poking out her tongue in the grand tradition of second-born royals we've come to know and love (we're looking at you, Princess Margaret, Princess Anne, and Prince Harry). Keep reading for a look back at some of Charlotte's most memorable facial expressions!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic becomes the face of a new fashion line from prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King 's Joe Exotic has become the face of a new streetwear collection that features printed images of backstabbing, betrayal and fake friends.
The infamous tiger handler, 57, who is currently serving a 22-year jail sentence, is believed to have hammered out the business details from his jail cell.
According to TMZ, fashion label owner Odain Watson asked Joe to partner with him on a limited collection for the brand Odaingerous.
A contract is "close to being signed" as the two parties agree on the final financial terms.
Odain appears to have confirmed the news on the brand's social media page.
The clothing range, dubbed the 'Revenge' collection, will feature prints of Joe's face as well as references from the Netflix mega-hit series.
One of the staple pieces from the collection is believed to be a print t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes.
Joe Exotic and the staff of GW Zoo in Oklahoma were propelled into the spotlight when Netflix released the bizarre Tiger King docuseries on March 20.
According to the streaming giant, over 64 million homes worldwide have tuned in to watch the shocking documentary series.
Full of twists and unusual turns, the documentary details the bitter feud between Joe and his his arch-nemesis Carole Baskin, and also sheds light on the United State's harrowing big cat trade.
The tiger handler - whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage - was eventually sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for a murder for hire plot, falsifying records and a number of animal abuse violations.
Joe has also developed somewhat of a unusual cult following after the series was aired.
Among other products that are now available, fans can buy Joe Exotic condoms and even animal print bikinis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic 'becomes new face of fashion brand' while in jail</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King star Joe Exotic has reportedly become the face of a new fashion collection based on the Netflix docuseries.
The 57-year-old, who is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence for charges including murder-for-hire and animal abuse, is believed to have teamed up with fashion label owner Odain Watson from his jail cell.
TMZ has reported that Odain had asked Joe to partner with him for a limited clothing range for the fashion brand Odaingerous, and a contract is allegedly ‘closed to being signed’ as the two agree on the final financial terms.
The fashion range, which will be called the Revenge collection, includes prints of Joe’s face alongside many Tiger King references.
A t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes is set to be one of the many pieces that will be available to be purchased.
Odain appears to have already confirmed the news, as he shared pictures of some of the t-shirts on the Odaingerous Instagram page.
‘Don’t Get Mad Get Even,’ he wrote. ‘@odaingerous presents the #Revenge starring @joe_exotic #joeexotic from @netflix #tigerking coming soon.’
It comes after the UK-based online fashion retailers Missguided and In The Style launched their own Tiger King themed t-shirts.
If that wasn’t enough, there’s also plenty of other merchandise based on the series available to buy, including animal print bikinis and even condoms.
In other news, Kevin Bacon revealed that he would love to play Joe Exotic in a film about the former zoo owner.
Following on from the success of the series, there has been talk of bringing it to the big screen – and Kevin happens to be the bookmakers’ favourite to portray Joe.
During an appearance on the Today show in the US, he said: ‘I’d play Joe Exotic in a second.’
He later added that he had first throught about playing the role after his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, had asked him while he was watching the documentary.
He recalled telling her: ‘This is an amazing show. I said, “The reason that I’m watching the show is because these are the kind of characters I get asked to play.”
‘This is my type of guy, you know, so listen, fingers crossed!’
We are seriously hoping this will happen now.
Metro.co.uk has contacted a rep for Joe Exotic for further comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Apprentice star Lottie Lion apologises after Lord Sugar 'racist' comments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apprentice has had its fair share of big personalities, but you'd be hard pressed to find one who could outmatch the controversial Lottie Lion.
Lottie, who's only 20 years old, made her mark among last year's contenders and had accusations of racism levelled against her.
Now she's found herself in hot water again after her impression of Venezuelan born team mate Jemelin Artigas stoked some considerable backlash.
Jemelin, who's clashed with Lottie before, shared a video sent to her on her own Twitter, in which Lottie and contestant Ryan-Mark Parson take part in an Instagram Live.
Lottie mocks Jemelin's accent while Ryan-Mark laughs along.
She added, in her own voice: "It's like, darling, we all started from nothing - I started from nothing."
Lottie went on to say: "If we're going to talk about f**king racists, let's talk about Lord Sugar!
"He's an actual racist!"
Mirror Online have gone to Lord Sugar's rep for comment.
Lottie and Ryan-Mark have since apologised over her impersonation, telling MailOnline : "We impersonated various candidates from The Apprentice on our Instagram Live on Friday.
"We are aware one candidate has taken offence and can only apologise."
On social media she had previously defended her comments as "light entertainment" rather than anything meant to hurt.
"Doing these impressions of The Apprentice candidates last night was meant to be some light entertainment for my fans during these difficult times ," she tweeted.
"I am aware that an individual HAS taken offence, and I can only apologise."
Nor has Jemelin been silent on the matter, sharing a string of tweets explaining her position.
She branded Lottie "the biggest racist" and accused the pair of being "pathetic" after Lottie issued her apology tweet.
However, she retweeted Ryan-Mark's apology and wrote: "I will always appreciate people taking responsibility so thank you @ryanmarkparsons and even though I know some not so nice things have been said.
"I appreciate you apologising so thank you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apprentice has had its fair share of big personalities, but you'd be hard pressed to find one who could outmatch the controversial Lottie Lion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ryan-Mark apologises to Jemelin Artigas over Lottie Lion 'racist' claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apprentice’s Ryan-Mark Parsons has issued an apology to former co-star Jemelin Artigas after she accused him and Lottie Lion of being ‘racist’ for mimicking her accent.
Ryan-Mark did an Instagram live video on Friday night with his pal and former The Apprentice co-star Lottie where they spoke about their experience of the show and their fellow candidates.
Ryan-Mark’s apology comes after Lottie did a series of impressions of their fellow candidates, including one that appeared to be of Jemelin and for him laughing at the impersonations.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk about the claims, Ryan-Mark said: ‘We impersonated other candidates, including Thomas, Marianne and Pamela copying their accents.
‘No one else has taken offence and of course, I apologise for my laughter if that has hurt Jemelin.’
The 20-year-old also issued a public apology to Jemelin on Twitter.
He began: ‘I wanted to issue an apology to @JemelinArtigas. It’s clear she has been affected by Lottie’s impersonation and my laughter. Our intention of the Instagram live was not to upset anyone; we enjoyed dancing, singing and answering your questions to bring smiles to our followers.
‘I appreciate my following and the hundreds of people who watched the live on Friday. It’s important to take accountability when people are hurt by words or actions. I have already spoken to Jemelin privately.’
Jemelin has since responded to Ryan-Mark’s tweet where she said: ‘I appreciate your apology Lottie’s has not apologised to me! I actually don’t think she thinks what she has done is wrong tbh..’
Following Friday’s Instagram live video, Jemelin shared a clip of the clip to her Twitter account where she hit back at Lottie for seemingly ‘mimicking’ her accent.
The caption to the video read: ‘The level of immaturity everyone should see!! I even forgot she existed but somehow she can’t get me out of her head.
‘ See how she takes the p**s of my accent and my story! She is vile … but it’s ok you keep talking about me hun but maybe it’s time you grow up and get a life.’
Jemelin later tweeted: ‘Imitating someone’s accent while bluntly mocking them it is racist! If you did it between friends as a joke and for a laugh definitely not.
‘But to mock them and take the p**s of their story when they are not there it is! Lottie Lion from the @bbcapprentice is the biggest racist!’
Lottie has also since defended the Instagram video, apologising for any offence caused.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk she said: ‘Myself and Ryan Mark did impressions of six candidates on The Apprentice last night during our Insta Live.
‘I’m aware that one person took offence to this and I can only apologise. This was not my intention and it was only meant to be some light entertainment for my fans during these difficult times.’
Lottie also posted to social media on Saturday to explain to her followers that the video was for some ‘light entertainment’ and not to cause offence.
She said: ‘Doing these impressions of The Apprentice candidates last night was only meant to be some light entertainment for my fans during these difficult times. I’m aware that an individual HAS taken offence, and I can only apologise.’
Metro.co.uk has reached out to Jemelin Artigas for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kyle Walker's ex 'brands Lauryn Goodman heartless h**' after birth of their baby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kyle Walker's ex appears to have hit out at Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, seemed to call Lauryn a ''heartless h**' in a thinly-veiled dig on Instagram on Sunday.
She had dated the England footballer, 29, for 10 years and had three children with him but they split in April after his affair with Laura Brown.
Lauryn, also 29, and Kyle briefly dated last summer and welcomed a baby last month but they aren't a couple.
Taking to Instagram on Sunday, an angry Annie wrote: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h**."
Lauryn appeared to take the dig as directed at her and fired back.
"This is harassment," she fumed.
"I've just had a new born baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!'
She continued: "I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for your support.
"I am so lucky to have such supportive and caring followers who do not believe lies.
"I have said repeatedly, I was never ever friends with [Annie] and her using my name in the press to gain sympathy for a relationship that had ended before our baby's conception is shocking!"
Lauryn announced their baby's birth last month on Instagram, though she is yet to reveal the baby's sex or name.
She became a mum despite fearing she'd never have the chance thanks to her battle with endometriosis.
She said: "This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can't believe I've made you and you are here. I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human.
"You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me. Words can't describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kyle Walker’s ex takes swipe at the footballer and Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ENGLAND footballer Kyle Walker's ex has taken a swipe at him and Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, took to her Instagram stories last night to post a savage quote hitting out at "disrespectful men".
The post read: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless hoe."
Reality star Lauryn, 29, welcomed her baby with England footballer Kyle last week.
She posted a picture of the child on Instagram and wrote: "I can't believe I've made you."
Earlier this year The Sun exclusively revealed Kyle's long-term former partner Annie called him “gutless” after he broke the news of Lauryn's pregnancy to her over the phone.
She also called him a “homewrecker” for romping with her pal.
Annie told a friend: “He’s a fool for risking his family for this. When he told me I was heartbroken. I also felt physically sick. All the air in your body leaves you.
“My world completely caved in on me in that second.
“It was the worst-case scenario, the one thing I dreaded most but knew was possible, given his track record with women.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Not only had he cheated on me but she was pregnant with his baby.”
Manchester City full-back Kyle, who Lauryn named as the dad in February, is now a father for the fourth time.
Posting on Instagram after the birth, Lauryn wrote: "I want to introduce you all to my #MiracleBaby. It was the first night in the SnüzPod and it felt so great to have the 👶🏽 so close to me all night ❤️.
"Whenever a feed was due I could just reach on in there. This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can’t believe I’ve made you and you are here.
"I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human. You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me."
Lauryn, who had feared she was unlikely to conceive due to her endometriosis, continued: "Words can’t describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you. 💫❤️.
"There is a bit of a story labour wise and after my labour that I do want to share with you all, as I feel it’s so important to be open and honest because my platform can help others.
"But for now, I just wanted to share this moment with you all as you have been so amazing with your advice and messages! My little bed buddy 👶🏽- Welcome to this crazy 🌍."
The star, who was careful not to reveal the child's gender, concluded: "Thank you to everyone who messaged me & recommended the SnüzPod @snuzuk it’s been a dream. P.s 👶🏽 needs its first hair cut already 🤦🏼‍♀️."
She was bombarded with congratulations, with Lauren Goodger writing: "I can’t believe it I’ve been waiting for this day ! Your amazing and I can’t wait to meet bubba 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕."
Her sister, 26-year-old reality star Chloe, wrote: "The most amazing blessing ever!! I’m so obsessed with the little one already I’ve never been so in love I’m so proud of you for how you dealt with pregnancy and your labour 🤩."
Former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa posted: "Congratulations ❤️❤️."
Lauryn revealed the identity of the child's father in an interview with The Sun on Sunday, saying: "Rumours and gossip are starting to circulate and I’d rather people heard it from the horse’s mouth so I want to stop all the speculation once and for all.
“Kyle Walker and I are expecting a baby in April and it was conceived during a period we had both split from our previous partners.
"This will be the last time I comment on it and I will only be sharing the positive journey going forward.”
Lauryn's sister Chloe is also pregnant and will soon give birth to her first child, a little girl, with fiancé Grant Hall.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who will take Holly Willoughby's spot on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that Holly Willoughby had opted to leave Celebrity Juice, the show needs a new team captain.
With no official word on who will fill Holly's shoes, fans are busy speculating as to who will be baring the brunt of Keith Lemon's most outrageous gags.
Holly did just that for 12 years, having been a team captain since the show got off the ground way back in 2008 - but who will take her place?
The biggest theories are below...
The Corrie and Our Girl star is probably the front runner right now.
Both Michelle and hunky husband Mark Wright have made appearances on the show, and both were a hit with fans.
Bookies Ladbrokes are backing her too, a spokesman saying: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who will take Holly Willoughby's spot on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that Holly Willoughby had opted to leave Celebrity Juice, the show needs a new team captain.
With no official word on who will fill Holly's shoes, fans are busy speculating as to who will be baring the brunt of Keith Lemon's most outrageous gags.
Holly did just that for 12 years, having been a team captain since the show got off the ground way back in 2008 - but who will take her place?
The biggest theories are below...
The Corrie and Our Girl star is probably the front runner right now.
Both Michelle and hunky husband Mark Wright have made appearances on the show, and both were a hit with fans.
Bookies Ladbrokes are backing her too, a spokesman saying: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who is replacing Holly Willoughby on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby hasconfirmed she’s quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years which begs the question: Who will take her place?
The This Morning presenter announced her departure from Keith Lemon’s show in a touching tribute and renthused that the famous face who will take her position will be getting ‘one of the best jobs in telly’.
So who’s in the running?
Ladbrokes have given us their odds on the mystery team captain, but what do you think?
Michelle Keegan is a firm favourite to replace Holly, with the bookmakers making her the top pick for the job.
The actress recently bowed out of BBC series Our Girl, so could she be about to glide into Celebrity Juice?
Odds: 4/1
Scarlett Moffatt is no stranger to the Celebrity Juice panel and would be a perfect fit alongside Keith and Mel B.
Odds: 9/2
Fearne Cotton quit Celebrity Juice as team captain after 10 years back in 2018, but could she make a sensation return?
We can only dream…
Odds: 5/1
Emma Bunton was a panelist in the first series of Celebrity Juice and has since made a number of appearances on the show.
She once stood in for Fearne as team captain back in the day, so she has already been trained up for the role.
Not to mention the fact fellow Spice Girl Mel B is also a team captain…
Odds: 5/1
With one This Morning presenter out the door, could another be on their way in?
Eamonn Holmes is certainly no stranger to the show and is always up for a challenge. But does he have what it takes?
Odds: 6/1
Rylan Clark-Neal has truly become a household name over the past few years, having recently fronted the revived editions of Supermarket Sweep and Ready Steady Cook.
Will his busy schedule allow him to take on team captain? We’re keeping everything crossed.
Odds: 8/1
Although we’d all love to see the queen of meme as team captain on Celebrity Juice, we can’t forget that she’s not always up for playing games.
Who can forget Gemma’s iconic line from her stint in the Celebrity Big Brother house back in 2016?
‘I don’t want to play any more games. I’m f***ing gamed out.’ It doesn’t exactly bode well for a show filled with games…
Odds: 12/1

Boyce -- who is best known for his work in the Descendants and Grown-Up movies --died last year after an epileptic seizure. He was 20.
Deadline.com said the eight-episode series Paradise City is his final screen project.
Friday's previewhas gotten nearly 3 million views since it debuted on YouTube.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paradise City trailer: Musical drama series features Cameron Boyce’s final appearance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A trailer for upcoming musical drama series Paradise City’s season 1 is out. The series marks the final appearance of late American actor Cameron Boyce, known for Disney Channel series The Descendants. The actor passed away in July last year at the age of 20.
Ash Avildsen has created, written and directed the series. Paradise City is about the rock scene and is clearly geared towards teenagers and young adults and promises a psychedelic musical drama experience. Specifically, it explores a rock star and his connection to devil worship and other occult stuff.
Andy Black, Bella Thorne, Drea De Matteo, and Hopsin also star.
The logline of the series reads, “The lives of a rock star with ties to the occult and a young rookie kid who idolizes him collide through their broken homes built by the music business.”
The official Instagram handle of the series shared an emotional message for Boyce along with one of his photos from the series. The tribute read, “Cameron Boyce stars as a leading character “Simon” in all eight episodes of the first season of Paradise City. The series was filmed just months before his tragic passing. He gave us an incredible performance as a young musician, band leader and aspiring DIY executive in the music business. Cameron was a truly one of a kind spectacular talent. ❤️💙💜 Every scene he was written in was shot and completed in the first season. We will be donating a portion of the tv show’s profits to @thecameronboycefoundation #cameronboyce #paradisecityshow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cameron Boyce Debuts in his Final Project in 'Paradise City' Teaser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The late Cameron Boyce can be seen in his final on-screen performance in the teaser trailer for “Paradise City.” Watch the embed above.
“Paradise City” centers on the lives of a rock star with ties to the occult and a young rookie kid who idolizes him, as they collide through their broken homes built by the music business. The former Disney star passed away last year at age 20 from an epilepsy attack.
“Cameron Boyce stars as a leading character ‘Simon’ in all eight episodes of the first season of Paradise City,” reads a post on the show’s official Instagram account. “The series was filmed just months before his tragic passing. He gave us an incredible performance as a young musician, band leader and aspiring DIY executive in the music business.”
A portion of the series’ profits will be donated to The Cameron Boyce Foundation, which was created by his parents.
“Paradise City” is still searching for a home and is being shopped by CAA.
At age 9, the freckle-faced Los Angeles native made his acting debut in the 2008 horror film “Mirrors” and then appeared in the 2010 blockbuster comedy “Grown Ups” as one of the sons of Adam Sandler’s character.
In the early 2010s, he starred as mischievous Luke Ross opposite Debby Ryan’s title character in “Jessie,” which ran for four seasons on the Disney Channel. He then played Carlos de Vil, the son of “101 Dalmatians” villain Cruella de Vil, in the “Descendants” series of movies for the cable network.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paradise City trailer sees Cameron Boyce in final role before death</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The trailer for Paradise City has dropped and features the late Cameron Boyce in his final role before his sudden death last year.
The upcoming new show, which is set to debut later this year, follows aspiring musician Simon (played by Boyce) and a rock star he worships as their worlds become intertwined.
‘Do you think that devil worship is real in Hollywood, like the whole black magic and all that stuff,’ the star’s character asks in the gripping teaser.
‘Oh, I definitely think there’s good and evil spirits, and black magic is real,’ Perrey Reeves’ character responds.
Entourage’s Rhys Coiro and Bella Thorne also feature in the new eight-part series, created by Ash Avildsen.
Boyce passed away aged 20 on 6 July 2019 after suffering a seizure in his sleep due to epilepsy.
Last month, the cast of Jessie gathered virtually to pay tribute to their co-star Cameron, nearly a year after the young actor’s sudden death.
Peyton List thanked the late actor for teaching her ‘so much’ and making her ‘such a better person’, while Skai Jackson admitted she had been ‘so excited’ to meet the star before auditioning for the Disney Channel show.
Cameron portrayed Luke Ross on the programme, and Peyton and Skai played his sisters Emma and Zuri Ross.
According to the Los Angeles Country Medical Examiner-Corone, Boyce had a ‘sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
The Descendants’ actor’s family further confirmed after the report was revealed: ‘Cameron’s tragic passing was due to a seizure as a result of an ongoing medical condition, and that condition was epilepsy.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first teaser for Cameron Boyce's final onscreen project, Paradise City, is officially here. The clip, which dropped on May 1, features the late actor as Simon, an aspiring rock star who finds himself enwrapped in the dark side of Hollywood.

According to Paradise City's Instagram account, a portion of the program's profits will be donated to The Cameron Boyce Foundation. The organization launched this past July, shortly after the actor died from an epileptic seizure at the age of 20. "The series was filmed just months before his tragic passing," the show wrote.

The 41-year-old has been broadcasting the nightly series from his garage in LA for the last few weeks, due to coronavirus.
According to Variety, CBS covered eight weeks of salary for members of the production team who became sidelined following the changes.
The Gavin and Stacey actor is thought to picked up the responsibility himself, telling some Late Late Show staff that they will be furloughed from 4 May – and that he will be covering their salaries from his own pocket.
While the total cost is unclear, the publication states it is likely to be at least ‘five figures a week’.
Seriously generous.
James recently made headlines as he opened up about how he was dealing with life in lockdown. 
The actor – who underwent surgery this week –  struggled to contain his emotions as he lifted the lid on how the pandemic has affected him, during a recent instalment of the talk show.
’I hope [the show] has been a welcome break for you as much as it has been for me in what has been quite a scary couple of weeks,’ the star told viewers. 
‘I’ve found it tougher than I ever thought I would. I’ve found myself having these incredible spikes of anxiety and sadness when I’ve allowed myself to think about my family back home in England, or my friends or the people I love. 
‘You feel so out of control in it all. It feels so beyond our comprehension, all of it, that I’ve found I just get sort of overwhelmed with sadness in it all. 
‘And the truth is what I’ve realised is it’s OK. It’s alright to feel a bit sad.’ 
James added: ’It’s okay to feel anxious, and the best thing we can all do is try and breathe through that and try and put our minds in a positive place and think, “What can I do to help someone else who might be feeling like this?”’
Metro.co.uk has contacted James’ reps for a comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden offers to 'pay salaries for Late Late Show production staff that face being furloughed'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Corden is reportedly reaching into his own pocket to cover the salaries of 60 Late Late Show production staff.
The television host - who has been forced to film from his garage during lockdown - is said to have committed to the payments after CBS revealed they would no longer be covering their salaries.

According to Variety, James, 41, informed some staffers that they would be furloughed as of May 4 and that he would cover the salaries going forward.
While the total amount isn't clear, it is likely to be at least mid-five figures a week.
CBS covered eight weeks of salary for production staffers that were sent home by the sudden shutdown.
Fans took to Twitter to praise the star following the news.
One wrote: "Nice @JKCorden! I hope more people in your position step up and do the right thing for their staff."
Another said: "THIS! is what you do when you have the means."
A third tweeted: "Such a good human! But what is wrong with CBS? They are a major studio. They can afford to pay these people."
A fourth added: "This is leading by example! Kudos to James Corden!"
The news comes days after it was revealed Simon Cowell had continued to pay BGT staff despite the live shows being cancelled.
The 60-year-old music mogul is still paying his crew, although the programme cannot push on with filming during the coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, Victoria Beckham changed her mind about using the government scheme to pay 25 members of staff in her fashion company after coming under fire by the public.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While Ellen Degeneres has reportedly turned her show’s staffers against her due to her lack of compassion and loyalty amid the coronavirus pandemic, two of late-night’s most prominent hosts have pledged their full support to theirs. Per Variety, James Corden and Trevor Noah are both personally paying the salaries of their Late Late Show and Daily Show staffers, respectively, who have been furloughed due to their shows switching to an indefinite at-home format. Variety reports that Noah will be paying 25 crew members until “production begins to ramp back up in the television industry,” while Corden will be signing the paychecks for around 60 workers, which will “likely to be at least mid-five figures a week.” It was also reported last month that Jimmy Kimmel, in addition to the duo, was paying his stagehands out of his own pocket when the coronavirus shut down production of Jimmy Kimmel Live! And what about all the other late-night hosts, you ask? Time, and pressure, will tell.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden To Pay For The Salaries Of ‘The Late Late Show’ Out Of Work Staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Helen Storms
James Corden will pay for the salaries of around 60 furloughed staffers.
James Corden, the host of The Late Late Show, will be paying the salaries of around 60 staff members of the show that are currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In-studio production of the show was put on hold on March 15 in an effort to protect the safety of the staff, according to The Daily Mail.
Since production was placed on hold, the staff members were still receiving paychecks from CBS over the course of eight weeks. However, that will end this week meaning that they will be officially considered furloughed as of May 4. From then on Corden will be taking over paying their salaries out of his own pocket. While the total amount that he will be paying per week to cover this cost has not been released to the public, it is expected to be mid-five figures.
As of April 14 Corden has been doing a virtual version of the show from his garage at home. He has been diligent in keeping connected with staff members by providing them with at-home projects whenever possible. Corden, executive producer Ben Winston, and some staff members have also been doing daily chats via Zoom.
It is still not clear when The Late Late Show, which is filmed in California, will be able to continue to start up production as normal again. However, the state is beginning to take steps to slowly re-open its economy, allowing some people to return to work.
The pandemic has caused even the normally jovial Corden to take pause and re-access what is really important in life, he confesses recently in an article for TIME.
In addition to Corden, comedian Trevor Noah has also stepped up to help out his staff members. As The Inquisitr previously reported, the host of The Daily Show With Trevor Noah will be paying for the salaries of 25 employees out of his own pocket until they are able to return to work.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pre-Order One Year of HBO Max for 20% Off, Get HBO Now While You Wait for Launch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HBO Max doesn’t arrive until May 27, but WarnerMedia is allowing prospective subscribers to sign up for their first year of the new subscription streaming service for a discounted price of $11.99 per month. That’s 20% off the standard $14.99 per month, less than a year of Netflix’s standard high-definition streaming plan at $12.99, and the same as Hulu’s ad-free subscription. Find out how you can take advantage of this promotional price below.
Variety called our attention to the HBO Max discount subscription, which gives you an entire year of the service for a promotional price directly through WarnerMedia. Since the service won’t launch until May 27, you’ll get access to HBO Now right away. However, this promotional price is only available to new HBO Now subscribers and “returning eligible” subscribers who had the service before but canceled it. You’ll have to head over to the HBO Max website to see if you qualify for the promotional price.
For some reason, there’s only “a limited number of subscriptions to this HBO Now/HBO Max promotional offer,” so if you’re interested, you may want to act fast. But that could just be a ploy to get more people to sign up for an entire year right away.
If you’re a current HBO Now subscriber, or you have HBO Go through your cable subscriber, you won’t automatically be upgraded to HBO Max (unless you accessed HBO through another service like Hulu). However, if you’re paying for either service, it would make more sense to subscribe to HBO Max instead, because you’ll be getting all that HBO has to offer along with a a lot more streaming options, and you likely won’t even have to pay more.
For those who don’t qualify for this HBO Max discount, you might still get a good deal on the subscription service if you’re an AT&T customer. Here are all the HBO Max promotions available for AT&T customers:
Keep in mind that some of the original programming that HBO Max is slated to offer won’t immediately be available. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic shutting down production in Hollywood, many originals have been delayed. But at launch, HBO Max will have the comedy series Love Life starring Anna Kendrick, the Sundance selected documentary On the Record, the underground ballroom dance competition Legendary, YouTuber LaurDIY’s crafting show Craftopia, a new Looney Tunes Cartoons series from Warner Bros. Animation, and Sesame Workshop’s The Not Too Late Show with Elmo. You can see the trailers for those shows over here.
HBO Max launches on May 27, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">HBO Max pre-order promo drops price to $12 per month for the first year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HBO Max is taking a page out of the Disney+ playbook by offering sizeable discounts to early adopters. The streaming service is running a pre-order promotion that drops the price from $15 per month to $12 for the first year if you’re either a new subscriber or a “returning eligible” HBO Now customer. That’s less than Netflix’s standard HD plan, Variety said. However, there is a catch: you can’t just sign up wherever you intend to get service.
The discount is only available if you sign up through the HBO Max website or otherwise go directly through WarnerMedia. You can’t just go through other distributors (who already take a cut of WarnerMedia’s revenue). That shouldn’t be a problem for most people, but it’s worth noting if you were thinking of signing up through a partner.
It’s not surprising that HBO Max would tempt early adopters through a deal. This is WarnerMedia’s (and really, AT&T’s) big play at a stand-alone streaming service that can compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Early commitments could both boost its initial numbers and help build buzz that helps the service compete in the long run.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WarnerMedia offering HBO Max pre-order discount, but you have to subscribe directly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HBO Max officially launches at the end of this month, and we already know that you’ll be able to subscribe through Apple’s in-app purchase and Apple TC Channels platforms. WarnerMedia, however, is enticing you to subscribe directly with a lower rate.
HBO Max is one of the more expensive streaming services, coming in at $15 per month. This compares to Disney+ at $6.99, Apple TV+ at $4.99, and Netflix’s cheapest tier at $8.99.
As The Verge reports, however, HBO Max is offering a pre-order promotion where you can sign up for $11.99 per month for the first 12 months. This is billed monthly, not annually, and will renew at the full $14.99 per month after the first year.
The trick here is that you have to subscribe directly through the HBO Max website in order to secure this promotional rate — you can’t subscribe through Apple TV Channels or in-app billing in the HBO Max application.
The Verge points out a few caveats:
But even if you sign up for HBO Max directly through WarnerMedia, you’ll still be able to log into the HBO Max application on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, as well as through your web browser. The HBO Max app will also integrate with Apple’s TV app for features like Up Next and Watch Now.
Subscribing through Apple TV Channels does offer a few benefits, such as streaming directly in the TV app on all of your Apple devices. The video is hosted by Apple itself and all billing is managed by Apple, just like with in-app purchases.
If you plan on subscribing to HBO Max, you can secure the promotional rate on HBO’s website now. You can learn more about Apple TV Channels in our detailed roundup here and decide whether it’s worth the extra $3 per month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner sends fans wild with incredible bum snap as she models stylish co-ords at home in LA</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KYLIE Jenner sent fans wild yesterday as she showed off her famous bum in a stunning Instagram snap.
The entrepreneur emphasised her curves with a powerful pose in her LA garden as she modelled a stylish two piece that showed off her tum.
She played down her makeup for a more natural look and gave the camera a sultry stare.
The compliments flooded in, with one writing: "Looking like a SNACK 😋❤️🍧🍰."
Another said: "Such a vibe."
While a third wrote: "yes ma’am KYLIE😍😍."
It came as Kylie revealed she's scared after someone close to her tested positive for coronavirus.
"It's scary when it's someone so close to home...HAS tested positive," she said in a teaser for the September return of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
The beauty appeared to have filmed the confessional herself, as the Kar-Jenner clan are seen locking down as the coronavirus pandemic breaks out.
Kylie has been locked down with her daughter Stormi, Stormi's dad Travis Scott and her bff Stassi, during the stay at home order.
It's likely she's referring to one of the first diagnosed cases of coronavirus on March 6, which was a father and his two sons who returned from a ski-trip in Italy and lived nearby to her Calabasas home.
The season 18 mid-season trailer, documents the coronavirus shut down affecting the famous family.
As a sound bite from Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is heard, announcing the city's stay-at-home order, the family is shown doing exactly what the rest of the country currently is also doing: nothing.
Kim Kardashian appears to says she has directly spoke to the White House to discuss the virus, as she explained they have told her it's "serious."
The mother-of-four documents the madness of trying to homeschool her kids,.
Momager Kris Jenner is seen wearing a mask, and getting particularly emotional during a phone call with Khloe.
"I wish I could hug you," she tells her.
Khloe kept her energy up with a dance party indoors with True Thompson.
While, Scott Disick joked that he's going "stir crazy," during the sneak peek.
While video conferencing with Kim, Khloe and Kris, Scott asks the question on everyone's lips - whether or not Khloe has slept with her ex Tristan Thompson again.
"Oh, 100 percent," Kim replied.
"That's what I said!" Scott said, "She says no."
There was plenty more tensions caught on camera before filming was halted, as things still appear to be difficult between Khloe and Kourtney.
"You and Khlo seem disconnected," Scott said to Kourtney after Khloe tells her she's "not participating" with the rest of them.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If there’s anyone who knows how to start a weekend on the right note, it is Bollywood star Shahid Kapoor’s wife Mira Rajput. She has taken to her social media handle to share her good hair day selfie, which believe it or not is every girl’s dream.
In the click, Meera can be seen looking right into the lens while her silky hair falling freely and beautifully. She is wearing a multi-hued top and her face is looking fresh as a daisy with minimum make up and natural glow.
Check out the picture here:
Mira is one of the most active celebs on social media. Just two days back she shared a very beautiful post giving a shout out to the kids staying indoors. The mother of two applauded for all the children who are showing their patience and staying at home. She called them little heroes. Sharing the post, Meera wrote - “Love them. Hug them. Ask them how they feel and let them cry if they’re not okay. Kiss them. Paint with them and let their clothes and the walls get dirty. Watch their favourite cartoon with them. Snuggle up with them. Give them extra ketchup if they ask for it that day. And when you’re tired after doing the dishes and cooking dinner and they say “Mumma can you play with me” remember this time isn’t forever. Little hands. Big hearts. Love them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anushka Sharma: One Of The Underrated Style Icons Of Bollywood- A Quick Quarantine Saturday Read</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever seen closely how Anushka Sharma carries herself? Followed her style mantra? If not, then this would be an ideal piece to read on a locked down Saturday!
I once asked singer Kanika Kapoor (Yes, the one who has become more famous for her COVID-19 case than Baby Doll Main Sone Di) during one of our chats on fashion and style, that who according to her is the most underrated actress when it comes to vogue, and she named Anushka Sharma.
Indeed, she is. Anushka Sharma's styling is carefree, effortless and very you and me. During travel, you will not see her dress up for an 'Airport Look', while chilling with her husband at home, you will not see her dressed because the picture will go on social media. On red caprets, you will not see her attempt a look because it's in trend or because she has to make a statement. 
Anushka is fierce when it comes to donning what she feels like wearing at that moment. Most of her red carpet outfits have always landed in my Best Dressed list and guess what? I realised that while writing this piece- anymore example of the actress' understated fashion icon image? 
As someone who likes to follow fashion and trends, names like Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, pop up high on my list of fashionistas, however, if you ask me about relatable styling, Anushka Sharma and Alia Bhatt are two names which top that list.
Yes, Anushka does have her own brand of clothes, Nush, yet the actress has never presented herself as the epitome of vogue. Wonder if that's got to do with the many other roles she plays in her real life- an actor, producer, wife, animal welfare woker. 
Nonetheless, when you think of Fashion icons from Bollywood, trust this lady's name to be there for sure because Anushka has made a mark for herself in the segment quietly but strongly!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While Selena Gomez remains in lockdown due to the coronavirus, she’s making sure to keep a positive attitude by leaving herself uplifting post-it notes on her mirror. Her cosmetics brand Rare Beauty posted an Instagram photo of their boss on May 1, nearly makeup free while taking a selfie. Selena is looking down at her phone and smiling in the pic, looking so gorgeous with her hair pulled back and wearing a casual black crew-neck sweater. It’s the message in the mirror that has her appearing so content. On a post-it with her cosmetic brand’s name at the top, it reads “I am in charge of how I feel today. I am choosing happiness.”
In the caption her brand posted, “Choose happiness. Every month is Mental Health Awareness Month – we’ll be sharing more resources, community stories and ways we stay positive all month long. Enjoy your weekend, log off and do something that makes you feel good. #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #rarereminder.” May 1 marks the beginning of Mental Health Awareness Month, and Selena has long been an advocate of taking care of one’s mental health, as well as erasing the stigma around it.
Selena, 27, has been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression. She made a new revelation to Miley Cyrus, 27, on the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s Apr. 3 Instagram Live show, BRIGHT MINDED: Live With Miley that she’s bipolar. “Recently, I went to one of the best hospitals in the world — or definitely in America — McLean [Hospital, in Massachusetts], and I discussed that after going through years of a lot of different things, I realized that I was bipolar,” Selena told Miley. “And so, when I know more information it actually helps me; it doesn’t scare me once I know it. And I think people get scared of that…I’m from Texas, where it’s not known to talk about your mental health. You’ve got to seem cool.”
Selena’s first connection to McLean was in Sept. 2019, when the Boston-area psychiatric hospital gave her an award at their annual dinner for her efforts to raise awareness about mental health. Selena posed with her award in a photo that she posted to her Instagram account and wrote next to it, “So humbled to have been part of the incredible McLean Hospital’s Annual Dinner and was honored to be able to share a bit of my story. Thank you Dr. Rauch for inviting me and spending time speaking with me about mental health. And thank you to all the amazing staff at McLean. And a huge thank you to (film director) David O. Russell for connecting me with these amazing humans. These are the moments where I am so grateful for the platform God has given me.” It turns out the connection was a tight one, as Selena returned and was able to work with McLean’s doctors to realize that she was dealing with bipolar disorder.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Show From 'The Office' US And 'Parks & Recreation' Creator Drops On Prime</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's fair to say Greg Daniels  has had a bigger impact that most in the word of sitcoms over the past couple of decades. Having played a major role as a writer on both The Simpsons and King of the Hill, he would then go on to create two of the best shows of the 00s.
It was Daniels who created US version of The Office, adapting Ricky Gervais' original show for an American audience. A few years later he would bring us Parks & Recreation. Certainly not a bad resumé.
Now he is back with a new show, with the first season dropping on Amazon Prime this week.
Upload is certainly a bit different to his other offerings, but it has some potential.
It is set in the near future, where those who are near death's door can choose to have their consciousness uploaded to a virtual reality world. This basically let's people choose their own afterlife.
You can watch the trailer for the show below:
The show is summarised as:
All ten episodes of the first season were added to Prime a couple of days ago, and the early reviews are very promising.
Devindra Hardawar of Engadget says it combines elements of various other shows, and does so to great effect:
This could be one to give a go in the coming days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wondering Why Everyone's Watching Waco? The Stellar Cast Is One Reason</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever since Paramount Network's Waco dropped on Netflix, the humble miniseries has been a surprise hit with streaming audiences. The show touches on a tragedy that changed modern American history as we know it, and even consulted with a Waco survivor to straighten out the facts. But besides delving into the 51-day standoff between the Branch Davidians and FBI, the show may have also drawn viewers with its truly remarkable lineup of talent. Starring Taylor Kitsch as the notorious David Koresh, Waco also enlisted A-listers such as Knives Out's Michael Shannon and Supergirl's Melissa Benoist. Read ahead to see all of the principal players in this star-studded cast.
Known for critically acclaimed films such as Nocturnal Animals and Revolutionary Road, Michael Shannon portrays FBI agent Gary Noesner, who led the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit and was assigned to defuse the standoff at Ruby Ridge. The series is partially based on Noesner's book, Stalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiator. Shannon recently starred in Knives Out as Harlan Thrombey's son.
Friday Night Lightsalumnus Taylor Kitsch portrays David Koresh, the leader of the Branch Davidians. He last appeared in a leading role in 2019's 21 Bridges.
Castle Rock star Rory Culkin is in one of the lead roles in Waco, playing David Thibodeau, a young musician who befriends Koresh and ends up living at the Mount Carmel commune for over a year. The series is based in part on Thibodeau's memoir.
Andrea Riseborough plays Judy Schneider, a woman living on the Waco commune with her husband Steve. The prolific English actress is known for her roles in The Long Walk to Finchley and Birdman. Recently, she also led the Black Mirror episode "Crocodile."
Boardwalk Empire's Paul Sparks portrays Steve Schneider, a comparative religion graduate who served as Koresh's right-hand man. Sparks recently starred in season two of Castle Rockas Ace Merrill.
Boardwalk Empirestar Glenn Fleshler plays Tony Prince, Noesner's boss. Fleshler has appeared in shows such as Billions and True Detective, as well as 2019's Joker.
John Leguizamo is Jacob Vazquez, an undercover ATF agent who poses as a rancher to see what Koresh is doing. He portrayed Luigi in 1993's Super Mario Bros. and has since been in a number of films, including John Wick and To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. He recently portrayed Raymond's father on Ava DuVernay's When They See Us.
Supergirl's very own Kara takes on a very different role in Waco as David Koresh's first wife Rachel. Besides Supergirl, Melissa Benoist is also known for playing Marley on Glee and Carole King in the Beautiful musical.
Ozark actress Julia Garner plays Michele Jones, Rachel Jones' younger sister and Koresh's wife who legally weds to Thibodeau. Besides her role on Ozark, Garner recently starred in The Assistant and is set to play Anna Delvey in Shonda Rhimes's Inventing Anna.
Shea Whigham brings to life Mitch Decker, Noesner's colleague in the FBI who managed the situation at Ruby Ridge. Like Fleshler and Sparks, he also appeared in Boardwalk Empire. He's set to appear in Mission Impossible: 7and HBO's Perry Mason.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Where do you know the cast of Netflix's Hollywood from?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Director Ryan Murphy has returned with another intense series, Hollywood, starring many familiar faces and and a moving plot line.
The Netflix series, which dropped on 1 May, is a piece of revisionist history which shows what Hollywood could have been if it had been a little bit more open-minded back in the day.
Known for Glee, American Horror Story and Pose, it was no surprise that Murphy would provide a show that would make us cry and laugh all at once.
And for those who know of the director’s work, Ryan is a big fan of using cast members from his other shows, and this one’s no different.
Darren Criss has been a long-time favourite of Ryan, starring as half-Filipino aspiring film director Raymond Ainsley who hopes to break boundaries in the Hollywood film industry.
The star is most obviously familiar from Glee, on which he portrayed Blaine Anderson, great singer and partner of Kurt (Chris Colfer).
His next Ryan-related role was the Hotel season of American Horror Story, on which he appeared for two episodes as Justin in 2015.
He then came back for American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace as Andrew Cunanan, the man who murdered the fashion designer in 1997.
Laura Harrier starred as Camille Washington, a black actress facing prejudice because of her race, and Raymond’s girlfriend.
She rose to fame with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, in which she portrayed Liz, Peter Parker’s love interest.
From then, she went straight to play Patrice Dumas in BlacKkKlansman, a movie following the first Black detective in Colorado Springs’ police department as he set out to infiltrate and expose the local Ku Klux Klan chapter.
The 30-year-old has also modelled for campaigns with companies such as Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, Target, ALDO, Steve Madden, Calvin Klein and Louis Vuitton.
David Corenswet embodies Jack Castello, a World War II veteran who moves to Hollywood in hopes of becoming a great actor.
The star had a lot of small parts, appearing in House of Cards in 2018 and Instinct that same year.
His big break came with Netflix’s The Politician, where he plays River Barkley.
The show concerns an ambitious student Payton Hobart who runs for student body president against the popular and athletic River.
Umm, Dylan McDermott actually plays gas station owner (and pimp) Ernest West and they did a great job on making him look older.
The actor was the shining star in the first season of American Horror Story as Dr Ben Harmon and came back for AHS: 1984 as Bruce and AHS: Asylum as Johnny Morgan.
Dylan and David already know each other from their time on The Politician before rejoining for the new Netflix series.
He also starred in shows such as Hostages, Stalker, LA To Vegas and The Practice.
Samara Weaving played the part of Claire Wood, an up-and-coming actress, Camille’s rival, and the daughter of Ace and Avis Amberg (who own Ace Studios).
The star’s most acclaimed film includes her part as Penelope in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.
Appearing alongside Bella Thorne, the 28-year-old had a role in horror movie The Babysitter.
She also starred in Ready or Not and Guns Akimbo alongside Daniel Radcliffe.
Maude Apatow plays Jack Castello’s pregnant wife Henrietta Castello.
If you haven’t already recognised from the name, she’s the eldest daughter of director Judd Apatow.
She is part of the main cast of Euphoria, playing Lexi Howard, Zendaya’s characters best friend.
She also starred in Knocked Up, Funny People, This Is 40 and Assassination Nation.
Hollywood is available to stream on Netflix.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor's ashes immersed in Banganga tank in South Mumbai</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor's ashes were immersed in Banganga tank here on Sunday, his elder brother Randhir Kapoor said.
Rishi Kapoor died at the age of 67 on April 30 at H N Reliance hospital in south Mumbai, after a two-year-long battle with leukaemia.
Randhir Kapoor said a prayer meet for the actor was held on Saturday.
"We did prayer meet yesterday. Today we immersed his ashes in Banganga as we haven't received permission from the authorities to go to Haridwar," Randhir Kapoor told PTI.
A picture has gone viral on social media, where Rishi Kapoor's actor-son Ranbir and wife Neetu are seen sitting next to his photograph.

According to family sources, the actor's daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, who was unable to attend the funeral as she was travelling from Delhi by road, was present at the prayer meet.
"There were not many people, Only five-six family members," the insider said.
Rishi Kapoor had returned to India last September after undergoing treatment for cancer in the US for almost a year.
In February, he was hospitalised twice.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crucible characters day 16: Mark Allen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For every Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, snooker also boasted its bit-part players: the what-might-have-beens and never-minds, who left their own small but indelible mark upon the sport.
For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition’s last three days.
The 34-year-old from Northern Ireland has cut a controversial figure on the circuit since his World Championship debut in 2007, but is yet to summon a Crucible performance to put his off-table antics in the shade.
Allen has, variously, sparked a feud with Stuart Bingham after claiming his opponent had “no bottle”, engaged in a running battle with Barry Hearn over changes to the snooker calendar, and set about taking on a few billion Chinese snooker aficionados single-handedly.
During the 2012 World Open in Haikou, Allen sent an infamous and swiftly deleted tweet in which he derided the tournament and its associated facilities.
At the World Championships in the same year, Allen branded opponent Cao Yupeng a “cheat” for not calling a foul, and broadened the subject of his ire by adding: “It seems to be a bit of a trait for the Chinese players.”
A fresh-faced Allen had reached the Crucible semi-finals on his third appearance in 2009, including an epic second round win over Ronnie O’Sullivan, and has featured in three more subsequent last eights.
But despite winning five ranking tournaments, reaching the UK Championships final and claiming a breakthrough Masters title in 2018, his inconsistency has cost him dear.
Entering the Crucible just months after his Masters triumph and with his time seemingly set to arrive, he was dumped out in the first round by Zhou Yuelong. – of China.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Future world champ? Not a fan? O'Sullivan and Hendry rate China's snooker stars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ronnie O’Sullivan and Stephen Hendry have weighed-up the futures of China’s leading snooker players, with Zhao Xintong emerging as the brightest prospect.
Six of the world’s top 32 players hail from China, with Ding Junhui still the leading light after his UK Championship win this season has put him at number 10 in the rankings.
Of the other rising stars from the East, O’Sullivan has picked out Zhao as the most eye-catching talent, but believes he has a lot of work to do to turn himself into a tournament winner.
The 23-year-old has never been past the semi-final of a ranking event and has made just one quarter-final this season, despite his supreme talent with a cue.
‘I rate that Xintong better than all of them,’ O’Sullivan told Hendry on Instagram Live. ‘He’s unbelievably talented but he just don’t know the game.
‘I spent a bit of time on the practice table, he’s clearing the colours up, pots the brown and he’s not even near the blue, he’s near the cushion.
‘I said, “that’s not acceptable mate, you should be getting whips.” I tried to explain to him to try and get near to the ball. Just better positional play.
‘He’s a quick learner, and he got it, it’s just little things like that he needs to improve.
‘He was playing a safety shot and instead of leaving the white tight on the cushion, he was allowing the guy to get on the bottom of the white.
‘Unless you know that part of the game and respect that part of the game, however well you pot, you’re never going to be winning titles regularly. But I rate him. Very, very good.’
Hendry agreed that the man from Xi’an is hugely talented, recalling Alan McManus labelling him as a future world champion.
‘There was a tournament I did for ITV, I tipped Bingtao to beat him and McManus was in studio and said no, no, Xintong is a future world champion,’ said Hendry. ‘He’s a talented boy.’
World number 16 Yan Bingtao has made much more progress than Zhao in terms of results, winning this season’s Riga Masters, reaching the final of the Players Championship and three more ranking semis.
Despite this hugely impressive CV at just 20-years-old, Yan has not won over the Rocket or the King of the Crucible, with neither sure what kind of game he is trying to play.
‘Bingtao I don’t know what to make of him,’ said Hendry. ‘I don’t know whether he’s attacking, defending, he’s turned into a bit of a plodder.
‘He’ll win lots of matches though. Lots, and lots and lots. I just can’t work him out as a player, I don’t know what he is.
‘Every so often he’ll go for something mental, then he’ll refuse something and you think, “why’s he done that?” It’s like he still doesn’t know the shots.’
O’Sullivan agreed: ‘Bingtao, I think, is a bit limited. He don’t know what he is.
‘He’s got a very good temperament. He’s a percentage player, he ain’t going to set the world on fire.
‘Not a fan of him, really.’
Ding Junhui won his third UK Championship this season and remains the highest ranked Chinese player, but other than his unexpected success in York, he has had a very quiet campaign.
The 33-year-old has made just one other ranking quarter-final and both Hendry and O’Sullivan have questioned his motivation.
‘Ding’s a bit of a mystery as well,’ said Ronnie. ‘I think he’s got great cue control.
‘I think he might have too much money.’
Hendry again concurred: ‘I rate his game but I don’t rate his attitude and his temperament.
‘He’s been playing since he was four, I don’t know if he’s fallen out of love with the game.
‘I said to someone else he might have too much money and it’s taken the hunger out of him a little bit.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to watch 'The Last Dance': Time, TV channel & more for Michael Jordan documentary on ESPN</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Michael Jordan trash talking, Scottie Pippen contract drama and a Dennis Rodmanmidseason vacation— "The Last Dance" has it all when it comes to the 1997-98 Bulls.
ESPN's 10-part documentary series is already a massive hit, averaging six million viewersacross its first four episodes. Those numbers are strong but not surprising considering the interest in "The Last Dance" leading up to its premiere and lack of sports programming available as the world continues to deal with the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
New episodes have turned into appointment viewing and lit up social media. As Dwyane Wade noted, Jordan once again provided plenty of meme energy for the folks on Twitter.
If you've missed any episodes of "The Last Dance" and don't quite understand the references,don't worry. Here's everything you need to know about catching up on the series.
"The Last Dance"can be seen onESPN each Sunday from April 19 through May 17 in the U.S. Netflix owns the international rights to show the documentary.
Episodes will be added to Watch ESPN after they air live. For those in the U.S. waiting to binge watch the entire series without commercials, "The Last Dance" will hit Netflix onJuly 19.
Two new episodes of "The Last Dance" will airon ESPN (uncensored) and ESPN2 (edited forlanguage) each Sunday through May 17. The two previous parts of the documentary series can be watchedbefore the new episodes premiere.
Netflix will roll out episodes in similar fashion for international viewers with two new parts hitting the streaming service following the live showings in the U.S.
During the 1997-98 NBA season, a film crew was given access to follow the Bulls as they chased a second three-peat. "The Last Dance" reveals how Jordan and the Bulls captured their sixth NBA championship — and details all of the drama that surrounded one of the greatest dynasties in sports history.
With so many Jordan highlights and storiesavailable online, viewers could be wondering if "The Last Dance" will simply rehash previous works. Forany skeptics out there, this documentary does feel different.
"Michael Jordan and the '90s Bulls weren't just sports superstars, they were a global phenomenon," director Jason Hehirsaid in a press release. "Making 'The Last Dance'was an incredible opportunity to explore the extraordinary impact of one man and one team. For nearly three years, we searched far and wide to present the definitive story of an era-defining dynasty and to present these sports heroes as humans.
"I hope viewers enjoy watching our series as much as we enjoyed the opportunity to make it."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition's last three days.
If Mark Allen goes down as one of the best players never to win the world title, there is every chance he will do so shouting.
The 34-year-old from Northern Ireland has cut a controversial figure on the circuit since his World Championship debut in 2007, but is yet to summon a Crucible performance to put his off-table antics in the shade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Isiah Thomas Responds To Michael Jordan's Controversial Remarks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Is anyone out there not watching ‘The Last Dance‘?
If so, you must be living under a huge rock as the 10-part Chicago Bulls documentary is without a doubt, the most compelling show on Netflix right now.
The series, which focuses largely on Michael Jordan and his attempts to help guide the Bulls to their second three-peat of NBA titles.
it has given fans great insight into the competitiveness of Jordan, the eccentrics of Denis Rodman, the unfortunate case of the Scottie Pippen contract, as well as the ongoing behind the scenes struggle between the squad and their general manager, Jerry Krause.
Episodes three and four dropped earlier this week and focused heavily on the Bulls’ first NBA title in 1991 and how they had to overcome two-time champions, the Detroit Pistons.
Lead by coach Chuck Daly and all-time great Isiah Thomas, the Pistons picked up the moniker ‘Bad Boys’ due to their aggressive style of play and often unsportsmanlike conduct on the court.
That unsportsmanlike conduct was never more prevalent in 1991 when the Chicago Bulls swept the back-to-back champions away 4-0 en route to claiming a first-ever championship. After the realization that they had relinquished their title rang true, the Pistons proceeded to walk off the court without shaking hands or congratulating their rivals. It was a move that irked the Bulls and the entire basketball community.
Thomas featured heavily throughout the lastest two episodes of the documentary and attempted to explain that, had he known their decision to stage a walk-off would still be talked about 30 years later, he wouldn’t have done it.
Jordan is then showed footage of Thomas’ comments to which he responds before watching, “you can show me anything you want. There’s no way you’re not going to convince me he wasn’t an asshole.”
The former Piston has since responded to Jordan’s choice of words to describe him, telling CBS Sports that he was surprised by MJ’s comments.
“I was definitely surprised,” he says.
“Because we’ve been in each other’s presence before, and I’ve never gotten that type of reaction from him. We were even at dinner a couple of times and he was always pleasant. Always good to my kids. Always good to my son. He even gave my son a pair of gym shoes.
“The competition that we all had on the floor, I truly just thought it was on the floor.”
When asked whether he liked Jordan, the 12-time NBA All-Star insisted that he does like the man and admired him as a basketball player.
“I do. I do. I don’t have anything against him and I definitely admire him as a basketball player,” he says.
” Like I said … I haven’t had any interaction with him that’s been unkind.”
However, while he may have admiration for Jordan, Thomas obviously doesn’t rate the star as highly as most others.
Before Bill Reiter draws his incredibly intriguing interview with Thomas to a close, he asked him to list the top five players he played against.
The former Detroit Piston listed Jordan as number four, one ahead of Julius Erving [Dr J] but three behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, respectively.
Whilst he isn’t pushed for further explanation, his reasoning can be understood from his earlier comments alluding to the fact that the Chicago Bulls were not successful in the 1980s when Magic’s LA Lakers, Bird’s Boston Celtics, Erving’s Philadelphia 76ers or indeed Thomas’ Detroit Pistons all won titles during what was arguably the NBA’s most competitive decade.
“When you put Jordan and his basketball team in the ’80s, they weren’t a very successful team,” he says.
“They just weren’t. When you talk about Jordan and his team dominating, they dominated the ’90s. But when you put him with those Lakers teams and those Pistons teams and those Celtics teams, they all beat him. They just did.
“What separated Jordan from all of us was he was the first one to three-peat. But he didn’t three-peat against Magic, Larry and Dr J.”
It’s difficult to know whether to take Thomas’ comments at face value as he is known to be a controversial figure who feuded with both Jordan and Magic Johnson throughout his career.
However, while Thomas and his teammates are portrayed as villains in ‘The Last Dance’, the narrative differs from ESPN’s 30 for 30 documentary entitled ‘Bad Boys‘ which shows a more sympathetic portrayal of that great Detroit Pistons team.
There are two sides to every story, make this one your next watch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crucible characters day 16: Mark Allen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For every Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, snooker also boasted its bit-part players: the what-might-have-beens and never-minds, who left their own small but indelible mark upon the sport.
For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition’s last three days.
If Mark Allen goes down as one of the best players never to win the world title, there is every chance he will do so shouting.
The 34-year-old from Northern Ireland has cut a controversial figure on the circuit since his World Championship debut in 2007, but is yet to summon a Crucible performance to put his off-table antics in the shade.
Allen has, variously, sparked a feud with Stuart Bingham after claiming his opponent had “no bottle”, engaged in a running battle with Barry Hearn over changes to the snooker calendar, and set about taking on a few billion Chinese snooker aficionados single-handedly.
During the 2012 World Open in Haikou, Allen sent an infamous and swiftly deleted tweet in which he derided the tournament and its associated facilities.
At the World Championships in the same year, Allen branded opponent Cao Yupeng a “cheat” for not calling a foul, and broadened the subject of his ire by adding: “It seems to be a bit of a trait for the Chinese players.”
A fresh-faced Allen had reached the Crucible semi-finals on his third appearance in 2009, including an epic second round win over Ronnie O’Sullivan, and has featured in three more subsequent last eights.
But despite winning five ranking tournaments, reaching the UK Championships final and claiming a breakthrough Masters title in 2018, his inconsistency has cost him dear.
Entering the Crucible just months after his Masters triumph and with his time seemingly set to arrive, he was dumped out in the first round by Zhou Yuelong. – of China.

    <h5 class="mb-1">American Horror Story star Leslie Jordan said Lady Gaga 'rode him' while filming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American Horror Story star Leslie Jordan has admitted Lady Gaga ‘rode him’ on the set of the show’s sixth season, Roanoke.
Well, you know she has said all along she wants a Bad Romance.
Leslie starred as actor Ashley Gilbert, who portrays medium Cricket Marlow in the show-within-a-show aspect of the season (hold on tight, this could get complicated.)
The actor shared on an Instagram post that he was sharing a scene with Gaga in one episode, where the Stupid Love hitmaker was portraying a malevolent witch.
But you could say things took an unexpected turn as they tried to get into character, as Gaga took him into the woods before the cameras started to roll.
Leslie revealed: ‘She took me in the woods right before [the scene] and she said “I tend to sexualise all my acting parts.”
‘Well, honey, she kicked me, rolled me over and got down and started riding me and howling at the moon, I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. ‘
He continued: ‘I just lay there and thought, “how do I get myself in these situations?”‘
Well, Leslie, to be honest with you – we don’t know. But we hoped you enjoyed your time with Academy Award-nominated actress Lady Gaga, dressed up as a witch and howling at the moon.
That’s certainly something worth shouting about.
American Horror Story is currently preparing to launch its tenth season, following last year’s ninth serial 1984, which was inspired my slasher films of the 1980s.
Gaga is currently very busy – her sixth album, Chromatica, was supposed to be released last month but has been pushed back due to the coronavirus.
Featuring on the album will be fellow pop superstar Ariana Grande, on a track called Rain On Me.
American Horror Story airs on FX in the US.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's always a treat when High School Musical stars revisit songs from the Disney classic. Vanessa Hudgens is one of the latest to take a trip down memory lane, as she recently crooned a socially distanced version of "Breaking Free" with Broadway actor Max Clayton. Hudgens, who plays Gabriella Montez in the film series, initially shared a clip of her performing the tune solo. But when her friend wanted in on the fun, she was totally game. "I LOVE @maxmclayton and u probably will too after u watch this lol," Hudgens captioned an Instagram teaser. "He did a duet and it's hilarious." The pair previously teamed up for a performance of High School Musical 2's "Gotta Go My Own Way" back in April.
Hudgens recently reconnected with her High School Musical costars for a performance of "We're All in This Together" during The Disney Family Singalong. Corbin Bleu, Ashley Tisdale, Monique Coleman, and Lucas Grabeel were among the former Wildcats featured in the special. Now, please excuse us while we go rewatch all three High School Musical movies.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey have reconnected on Twitter — and we’re living for it! The actors, who starred in the romantic comedy The Wedding Planner, hinted at a sequel to the iconic flick when they reminisced on filming the 2001 movie. On the May 1 episode of Matthew’s weekly webs series, McConaughey Takes, the 50-year-old revealed he “had a lot of fun” working with J-Lo. Soon the episode was posted, the “On The Floor” singer took to Twitter and wrote “Let’s do it again soon” with a winking emoji. Our hearts!
The pair’s virtual reunion began on April 31 when the 50-year-old Super Bowl Half Time star shared a screen grab from the film to Twitter for #ThrowbackThursday and tagged her former co-star. “You are enough…,” Jen tweeted in reference to her famous line from the film. When Matthew saw the post, he quickly replied with, “You are more than enough.” He went on to discuss the film in further detail on his latest episode of McConaughey Takes. 
He said that J-Lo “was already cast [and] they were looking for the male lead,” when he was approached for the film. “I think we were coming up against a writers strike. So, what that means is the issue was trying to get as many movies made as quickly as possible … the industry needed content.” Matthew also noted that he “got paid real well” for the role because “they really needed [him].”
He also totally gushed over Jen, and her performance in the flick. “I’ve always called [Jennifer] a quad threat. What does she not do? That girl works her backside off on everything,” he said, adding, “She does not just show up and wing it at all. She’s like clockwork. Just hammers it and knocks it out.” Since starring in the film, J-Lo has become one of the biggest names in music. The multi-hyphenate talent seems to be at the height of her powers. With the success of her film Hustlers, her flawless Super Bowl LIV halftime show, and her engagement to former Yankee baseball player Alex Rodriguez, 44, everything in J. Lo’s life appears practically perfect!

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast – Britain to bask in 17C heat today as Spring weather makes welcome return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITS have been treated to a return of Spring weather this weekend, with warm temperatures set to continue today.
The sunshine is expected to stick around on Sunday, reaching 17C across much of the country.
After a week of drizzle and gloom in lockdown, the UK has basked in some light relief today.
The low pressure which has dumped torrential rain on much of the country this week has been forecast to move across Europe.
And as the UK spends its sixth weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, weather conditions are expected to be much more settled thanks to building high pressure.
According to The Met Office, the change will result in “dry, fine and settled weather” this weekend and particularly next week.
Saturday was warm with a high of 19C felt by most of the country.
Further dry, fine and settled weather is expected on Sunday, with potential for very light winds - however most places will enjoy “dry and decent weather.”
Sunday
The Met Office predict most of the country will see sunny intervals, however some rain could fall in northern and eastern parts of the nation.
For most of the country, a high of 17C will be felt, and a low of 8C.
Monday to Wednesday
Mainly dry, sunny spells developing, few showers in Eastern England on Monday. Mainly dry, sunny spells in most places, but heavy showers in SW Tuesday. Dry and sunny on Wednesday.
On Sunday, cloudier conditions are expected in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Some parts of the east coast will feel more of a chill in the air.
The high pressure will remain in charge for most of next week, meaning the warm sunny weather is here to stay for at least a few more days.
The Met Office warns that while the weather change will tempt many across the country to spend their weekend outdoors, the UK must continue to adhere to the coronavirus lockdown.
Simon Partridge encouraged people to enjoy the sunshine from their backyards, balconies and daily hour-long walks - though he did add that UV levels will be reasonably high over the weekend, so people must cover up accordingly.
The high pressure build won’t last forever, and is expected to move on by the following weekend and bring with it more wet and miserable weather.
Ministers will be hoping the resurgence of sunshine will not encourage Brits to venture outside of their homes and break lockdown rules as has been seen in the past few weeks.
For the beginning of next week, the weather still appears to be setting with the occasional shower in Eastern England on Monday ad heavy showers in the southwest on Tuesday.
Generally the UK will remain dry with some sunny spells, particularly on Wednesday.
The sunshine comes after Britain experienced as much rain in a day as it did for the rest of April two days ago.
The Met Office is now predicting settled, warmer weather for the beginning of the month, although we can still expect some showers, and it'll be much cooler than last week.
April's sunshine was caused by a high pressure system from the continent - but recently we've faced the opposite, with low pressure systems bringing in colder weather and lots of rain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forecast for the rest of the weekend is fab - but it's all going to change next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The weather forecast for the rest of the Bank Holiday weekend is for sunshine and high temperatures -but the national forecaster warns of heavy rain on the way.
Met Eireann has forecast temperatures of up to 18 degrees for Monday, with plenty of sunshine and some light breezes.
Today is to remain dry in most places, but with a spot of ran or drizzle along the southern coast. Top temperatures will be 12 to 16 degrees, and it will be warmest through parts of north midlands and Connacht.
The good weather will last throughout Bank Holiday Monday, with sunny spells across the country and remaining mostly dry. Highest temperatures will range from 12 to 18 degrees, and it is expected to be warmer in the west.
The weather is expected to change as we move through the week, however, with heavy rain showers and a drop in temperatures expected.
Met Eireann said: "There is some uncertainty but latest indications suggest Tuesday will bring rain across parts of Munster and south Leinster, with some heavy falls in places in the morning but the rain will tend to ease later in the day.
"Holding mostly dry further north with some sunny breaks in northern parts. Afternoon temperatures of 10 to 13 degrees in southern and eastern areas, 14 to 16 degrees in the midlands and west with moderate to fresh southeast breezes."
As we head into Wednesday, the outlook is for further rain showers across the country, especially in the south and west. Temperatures will range from 12 to 16 degrees, but we could see it creep up to 18 degrees at times.
So essentially, we'll be able to move within 5km of our homes - but we'll have to bring our brollies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sun set to shine as temperatures soar to 18 degrees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The sun will be splitting the rocks next week with temperatures set to soar to highs of 18 degrees from tomorrow.
Dry and sunny spells will develop on Monday as forecasters expect daytime temperatures to hit highs between 12 and 14 degrees across eastern northern coasts tomorrow while the rest of the country enjoys highs of 15 to 18 degrees.
Met Eireann forecaster Linda Hughes said Monday will be the best day for warm temperatures and sunshine.
"Tomorrow really is looking like it's going to be the best day of the week ahead, it will be dry across the country.
"There will be an easterly breeze though so along the east and north coast that's going to keep the temperatures down tomorrow to about 12 to 14 degrees, and but then across the rest of the country it's a pretty warm day tomorrow with highs of 15 to 18, degrees, so it will feel pleasant in the sunshine tomorrow," she said.
Tomorrow night will be dry in most areas with overnight lows of 4 to 8 degrees.
However, the good weather will be interrupted as forecasters say latest indications show Tuesday will be hit with heavy rainfall across parts of Munster and Leinster.
The wet weather will ease later in the day as temperatures will rise to 10 to 13 degrees in southern and eastern areas, and 14 to 16 degrees in the midlands and west .
Temperatures will surge again over Wednesday and Thursday with forecasters anticipating afternoon highs of 12 to 16 degrees and potentially 17 or 18 degrees in some central regions on Thursday.
Southeast breezes may bring outbreaks of showery rain especially to southern, western and southeastern counties.
As for this evening, forecasters have predicted dry and chilly conditions with some drizzle near southwestern coasts.
Temperatures will dip between 1 and 3 degrees or 4 to 6 degrees under thicker cloud in parts of the south and west.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather: Sunshine and 22C set to bake Britain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 22C heatwave is set to sweep across the country next week, just in time for the May Bank Holiday.
From today (Sunday), the mercury will continue to climb until it peaks at 22C on Thursday, according to weather.com.
Forecasters say Friday will be slightly cloudier, although temperatures should hit 21C, reports the Mirror.
Speaking about next week's glorious weather, a spokesman for netweather.tv said: "High pressure will build in from the north on Monday, bringing a largely dry day with sunny spells, though a few showers are likely across northern and eastern England, especially in the morning.
"Tuesday will likely see a frontal system with outbreaks of heavy rain try to push in across the south against high pressure establishing across the north.
"Cloud and rain (will) ease back to the near continent by Wednesday, with high pressure close to or over the UK dominating the weather for the rest of the week, so Wednesday and Thursday mostly dry and fine with sunny spells, warmer too with light winds.
"Most looking dry on Friday too, but we may see showers arrive in the west as high pressure begins to retreat, but some uncertainty on this."
Europe is also likely to see a spike in temperatures next week.
On Monday the mercury will hit 32C in Spain, 29C in France and 24C in Swizerland, according to weatheronline.co.uk.
And there's more good news, as the sunny weather is expected to continue beyond next week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden pays out of his own pocket for furloughed staff’s salaries as Ellen DeGeneres leaves employees hanging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LATE Late Show host James Corden has committed to paying his furloughed staff out of his own pocket.
The British host is covering the salaries of around 60 furloughed staffers after their CBS paychecks come to an end this week, according to Variety.
The host, who has been broadcasting his show from his garage in Los Angeles since April 14, picked up the responsibility for his staffers after CBS had covered their salary for eight weeks.
They had been sidelined by the sudden shutdown of the Late Late Show on March 15, as the coronavirus outbreak spurred social distancing mandates.
However, last week Corden informed some staffers that they would be furloughed as of May 4 and that he would cover the salaries going forward out of his own pocket, reports the industry publication.
The total cost to the Cats actor is unclear, but is likely to be at least mid-five figures a week, according to Variety.
New episodes of the show are still being broadcast from Ellen's own home as an in-studio production, but crew members were told to prepare for a 60 percent pay cut.
Speaking to Variety, a source said: "Radio silence from producers created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and, in that case, would need to explore unemployment benefits."
They were left further disgruntled when they discovered that Ellen had hired a non-union company to help her produce the show from home - even though the normal crew have the same skills and are out of work.
Ellen earned $80.5 million last year, according to Forbes, and has a net worth of $330 million.
Corden is estimated to have a net worth of $12 million and earns around $5 million a year for the Late Late Show.
Both shows are usually filmed in Los Angeles, which has a stay at home order.
Corden has been married to Julia Carey since September 2012 and the couple share three children: son Max, 9, and daughters Carey, 5, and two-year-old Charlotte.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trevor Noah is paying 'Daily Show' staffers' salaries out of his own pocket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South African comedian Trevor Noah is reportedly paying the salaries of 25 staffers at The Daily Show who have been furloughed as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. 
Variety reports that Trevor Noah is paying the monthly salaries of 25 members of The Daily Show (DStv 122) out of his own pocket.
He reportedly told staffers that he would continue to personally pay their salaries until The Daily Show returns to normal production from its New York studio.
"These are the people who have been on the show with Trevor from day one and help him put on the show," a source told thepublication, saying "Trevor is personally covering their salaries until the production business opens again. He respects his crew tremendously and feels it's only right that they get through this together."
This week the temporarily renamed The Daily Social Distancing Show was extended from 30 to 45 minutes. 
It will be the first time in the 24-year history of The Daily Show that episodes will be longer says Comedy Central in a statement.
"The news of supersized Daily Show episodes comes at a moment in time when viewers are heading to host Trevor Noah not just for satire and escapism, but also for an honest point of view and as a source of trustworthy information."
This week is the sixth week of The Daily Social Distancing Show that Trevor Noah now anchors from his home without the help of a live audience or the New York-based studio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trevor Noah Pays For The Salaries Of ‘Daily Show’ Employees Out Of Work Due To COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Helen Storms
Even though his staff can't work right now, Trevor Noah made sure they were taken care of financially.
Comedian Trevor Noah is paying for the salaries of the employees of the nighttime news satire show The Daily Show With Trevor Noah out of his own pocket. His staff is currently furloughed and thus out of work right now due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, he made sure that they were still taken care of financially during this difficult times, as was publicly released on Thursday, according to Tank’s Good News.
There are 25 employees who work at The Daily Show and they all have been out of work since mid March when the show had to shutdown production as a safety precaution due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, Noah has been doing an altered version of the show called The Daily Social Distancing Show With Trevor Noah. However, camera operators, audio technicians, stage management personnel, and video operators are unfortunately not needed for this virtual version. These are all people who previously physically worked in the studio.
Noah still considers these individuals an important part of his team and has not forgotten about them in the midst of the pandemic.
An inside source close to Noah explained that the comedian has a close bond with many of his team members that have been by his side for years.
“These are the people who have been on the show with Trevor from day one and help him put on the show. Trevor is personally covering their salaries until the production business opens again. He respects his crew tremendously and feels it’s only right that they get through this together,” the source said.
While it is not clear for how many weeks Noah has been paying for these salaries, the inside source did note that the comedian will continue to do this until it is safe enough for them to return to work.
Throughout this pandemic, the usually light-hearted Noah has been particularly vocal about more serious topics. He has been tough on President Trump not only in his dialogues on the show but throughout his posts on social media. One of his recent Instagram posts criticized Trump for how has responded to the coronavirus thus far.
“Coronavirus Updates: Trump Ignored Over a Dozen COVID-19 Warnings- Turns out the president who doesn’t read missed over a dozen warnings about coronavirus earlier this year,” he wrote in the caption.
As The Inquisitr previously reported, Noah is not the only television host doing virtual shows right now. Wendy Williams, Jimmy Fallon, and Ellen DeGeneres are among some of the other celebrities to alter their normal production.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden to Pay Salaries of Furloughed 'Late Late Show' Staffers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Corden will pay the salaries of around 60 “Late Late Show” staffers who are being furloughed beginning next week.
Corden returned to producing new episodes of “The Late Late Show” on April 14. Following the shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March, CBS had covered eight weeks of salary for staffers who were unable to fulfill their duties. Corden informed his staff last week that some would be furloughed beginning on Monday.
The news was first reported by Variety.
Earlier this month, CBS parent company ViacomCBS set up a relief fund for workers impacted by the Hollywood shutdown and committed $100 million.
The “Late Late Show” is filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Earlier this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom detailed the state’s plans for reopening the economy after more than a month under a state-wide “stay at home” order.
The state is likely “weeks” away from reopening some nonessential businesses, Newsom said, while the reopening of movie theaters and other entertainment venues will likely be “months” away. The relaxations of the statewide “stay at home” order come as part of a four-stage framework for reopening the economy that Newsom and Director of the Department of Public Health Sonia Angell outlined at a Tuesday press conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden & Trevor Noah To Personally Pay Wages Of TV Crews During Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic continue to be felt, a number of people are finding themselves out of work. That includes most industries, with those in entertainment not exempt.
Social distancing guidelines mean it is incredibly difficult to film television shows and movies. Late night American talkshows, which usually take place in front of large studio audiences, are now being filmed with minimal crew in small locations.
That has resulted in a number of staff losing their jobs. CBS, who air James Corden's The Late Late Show, had agreed to pay 60 members of the crew of the show for eight weeks while the pandemic stopped them from working.
That time period is now up, but according to Variety, Corden will personally pick up the bill to ensure all 60 staff continue to be paid in full. It is reported that this will cost him a five-figure sum each week.
The Late Late Show has continued to film new episodes, but have done so from Corden's home. However, that will now be put on hold after the British presenter underwent minor eye surgery.
He is not the only person in this position to make a gesture such as this.
Trevor Noah, who hosts The Daily Show on Comedy Central, will cover the salaries of 25 staff from his show who find themselves in the same position.
The South African has also been recording his show from his home during the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain’s Got Talent fans insist oldest ever contestant Nora Barton, 96, who has Alzheimer’s, needs to win</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITAIN’S Got Talent has seen many worthy acts grace its stage but this series one woman has stood out amongst others – Nora Barton, the oldest ever contestant on the show.
And now viewers of the show want the glorious pensioner to win after her utterly charming performance.
Fans were bowled over tonight by 96-year-old Nora Barton, Britain's Got Talent's oldest ever contestant, who fulfilled her dream of performing at the London Palladium.
Nora, who has Alzheimer's, left the judges, audience and viewers blown away by her performance, and fans at home think she should win the show.
The 96-year-old already had viewers hooked when she quipped to host Ant McPartlin that she was doing “nowt” when he asked her what she was up to on stage.
Helped on stage by Ant, Nora’s daughter Pam Dimbleby, 65, who accompanied her, revealed it was a dream for her mother to play there.
The great-grandmother was dressed to impress in a red top, floral skirt and a flower in her hair, before she belted out The Loveliest Night Of The Year from 1951 film The Great Caruso, with daughter Pam playing along on piano.
The nonagenarian was left thrilled as she was given a standing ovation, with Nora saying “thank you very much!”
Fans at home were as equally enthused, taking to Twitter to write: “Nora.... Hands down winner for tonight’s show' declared one viewer.”
While a second added: “OMG! I think she's the winner! Such a lovely lady with a beautiful voice. We have Colin, now we need Nora. The Royal family would adore her. Smiling face with open mouthRed heart #BGT”
And a third concluded: “I've fallen for Nora on #BritainsGotTalent surely she is a winner! Her Royal Highness our Queen of England would love her”
All the judges fell in love with Nora tonight as David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you are full of life, full of laughter, full of joy and you've just entertained the nation at 96.”
Before Alesha Dixon declared: “Once a show woman, always a show woman! I really enjoyed that whole performance, it was just completely charming! Congratulations Nora!”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent viewers moved by 96-year-old Nora's fantastic audition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent fans were blown away by 96 year old Nora Barton on Saturday night's episode.
The charming singer is the show's oldest ever contestant, and arguably the most memorable of this year's hopefuls.
Nora, who came out on stage with her daughter Pam to play the piano, captured the hearts of the judges, audience and viewers at home with her wonderful singing voice.
She sang her own rendition of The Loveliest Night of the Year, which earned her a very well-deserved standing ovation from Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams.
Daughter Pam explained before the audition: "She's sung for people all her life."
As soon as Nora started singing, the crowds began to cheer.
"She's into it now, isn't she?" host Dec said from behind the scenes.
Judge Alesha was super impressed, telling Nora after her performance: "Once a show woman, always a show woman!
"I really enjoyed that whole performance. It was completely charming!"
David added: "You're a very special lady because you're full of life, full of laughter, full of joy. You've entertained the nation at 96."
While Amanda said: "It was a very special audition. You're a generation that this country is built on. Very well done, and thank you."
Simon joked that he didn't like the act, before proudly announcing: "I loved you!"
It goes without saying that viewers loved the audition, with many taking to Twitter to share their thoughts.
One wrote: "Right. I love Nora already."
"Aww Nora," another tweeted, "What an angel!"
A third exclaimed: "GIVE NORA THE GOLDEN BUZZER!"
A fourth gushed: "Wasn't emotionally prepared for Nora! #BGT."
While a fifth admitted: "GO ON NORA! 96 years old and singing like that, what a woman!"
A sixth viewer was moved to tears, writing: "How lovely was that on BGT. Nora and her daughter Pam. Brought tears to my eyes."
Britain's Got Talent continues next Saturday at 8pm on ITV and Virgin Media One.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pensioner Nora Barton wowed the Britain’s Got Talent judges with her voice – and her audition will just melt your heart.
The 96-year-old’s performance will air on tonight’s BGT and from the moment she stepped on stage, she had the judges and the audience in complete awe.
Nora, who was accompanied by her daughter Pam sang a beautiful version of The Loveliest Night Of The Year from the film The Great Caruso.
But before she began to sing she had a chat with the judges.
Amanda Holden asked: ‘Dare I ask how old you are?’
Although Nora couldn’t quite hear Amanda as she turned to her daughter and said: ‘What did she say?’
Her daughter answered: ‘She’s 96.’
The judge then asked: ‘How long have you been playing the piano?’
Nora shakes her head and points to Pam as she said ‘Oh not me, she does.’
‘She has sung for people all of her life,’ Pam explained.
‘And at 96, this is a treat, this stage, the London Palladium.’
No Nora you are the treat!
Britain’s Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People star hits back at criticism of the show’s controversial sex scenes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORMAL People star Paul Mescal, who plays Connell in the hit BBC drama, has hit back at those criticising the show’s controversial sex scenes.
The 12-part series has been dubbed the “horniest show on TV” and been praised by many for its representation of sexual consent.
However the raunchy scenes have proved a particularly contentious talking point in Ireland, where the series is set.
Listeners to RTÉ Radio 1 Liveline show likened the scenes to “something you would expect to see in a porno movie” but Paul Mescal, who plays lead role Connell, has hit back revealing he’s "incredibly proud" of the love scenes.
Speaking on the RTE One’s The Late Late Show, he said: “I actually listened in [to Liveline] yesterday, and I suppose I was a bit surprised, but the last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they’re entitled to their opinion.
“My own perspective of it is we worked hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful representation of sex amongst young people.
“It’s something I’m incredibly proud of and incredibly proud to see on Irish screens, personally.”
Normal People is a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s best-selling novel of the same name, whichcentres around two Irish teenagers from different backgrounds who fall in love.
Set in County Sligo, Ireland, Normal People follows the couple through their highs and lows and touches on the power and vulnerability of first love.
Paul, 24, plays Connell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, 21, plays Marianne. The duos performances have won them rave reviews and become an overnight sensation.
Normal People is available to stream now on BBC iPlayer. Weekly double episodes air Mondays on BBC One from 9pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People's Paul Mescal brushes off sex scenes backlash in native Ireland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Normal People star Paul Mescal has brushed off the controversy surrounding the series’ sex scenes in his native Ireland.
The 24-year-old, who plays Connell in the series, was interviewed on RTE One’s Late Late Show, where he admitted it had been ‘a very bizarre 72 hours’ after the show dropped.
An adaption of Sally Rooney’s best-selling novel, the show follows the complicated romantic lives of students Connell (Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones). The nature of the sex scenes included in the episode drew particular ire in Ireland, where the country’s Liveline radio show hosted a debate on the topic.
Speaking on the backlash, Mescal brushed off any criticism, saying peers had thanked him for the series for ‘portraying young people in a society that they recongnise.’
‘I actually listened in [to Liveline] yesterday,’ he said. ‘and I suppose I was a bit surprised, but the last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they’re entitled to their opinion.
‘My own perspective of it is we worked hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful represention of sex amongst young people.
‘It’s something I’m incredibly proud of and incredibly proud to see on Irish screens, personally.’
We’ve already weighed in on this issue – arguing that just because Normal People shows teenagers having healthy, consensual sex, it doesn’t mean it’s going to inspire them to have the sex they were probably already having anyway.
Paul’s co-star Daisy hasn’t weighed in on the controversy, but she did yesterday post a host of excellent behind-the-scenes snaps taken as the drama was being filmed.
Brb, just stalking her entire feed.
Daisy also previously shared some insider info into the auditioning process on the show – admitting that she had to ‘snog the air.’
Which, we’re sure looked totally fine.
Anyway, don’t mind us we’re just going to binge the entire, perfect series again and cry.
Normal People is available to stream now via BBC iPlayer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Mescal gives his take on Normal People's sex scenes debate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel has been causing a stir among some viewers who have compared the sex scenes in episode two to something you'd see in a porno
Normal People's Paul Mescal who plays Connell in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel has given his take on the sex scenes thus far.
The actor was interviewed on The Late Late Show last night via video link with Ryan Tubridy bringing up the widely talked about Liveline feature on Normal People.
As you are probably aware by now, some viewers phoned in to Joe Duffy to liken the sex scenes in episode two of the series to something you would see in a porno.
One caller named Mary said: "I imagined it would be something you'd expect to see in a porno movie. Certainly not for family viewing."
Another called Tommy added: "I feel it was a bit pornographic, maybe in one or two scenes. I feel that young actress is being exploited and used just to get the ratings.
"It's giving the wrong message to young people. I have two daughters and if they think that that's what's going on in secondary school, it's shocking."
Well, last night while chatting to Ryan, the Normal People star responded to how some viewers have reacted to the show's sex scenes.
Mescal said the sex scenes are something he is really proud of as they are something the team worked really hard on to portray an accurate representation of "sex amongst young people today".
He told Ryan: "The last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they're obviously entitled to their opinion.
"My own perspective is that we worked hard - myself, Lenny, Daisy and Hettie - we worked very hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful representation of sex amongst young people today and it's actually something I'm incredibly proud of and something I'm really proud to see on Irish screens, personally."
Normal People tracks the on-off relationship between two youths, from attending the same school together in a small Sligo town to going to college and beyond.
It is a tale of modern love and how Marianne and Connell grapple with the challenges society throws at them during pivotal stages in their lives.
To catch up on the first two episodes of Normal People you can do so via the RTE Player. Don't forget to tune into RTE One next Tuesday for the third episode either.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux slices finger off making Jamie Oliver pancake recipe – and he still can’t find it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOUIS Theroux has managed to slice off part of his finger while trying his hand at making a pancake recipe by Jamie Oliver.
The hit documentary maker has risked his life over the years to make great TV but it seems an encounter with a sharp knife and a red onion has inflicted the most trauma.
Louis Theroux, 49, was trying his hand at a Jamie Oliver recipe for savoury pancakes on Saturday evening when the culinary catastrophe occurred.
The BBC filmmaker shared a photo of his finger heavily bandaged up and a devastated expression on his face to his Instagram followers.
In the caption Louis wrote: “Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes.
“Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger.”
Celeb chef Jamie Oliver is yet to comment on the missing digit but Louis's other pals sent him comforting words, including
fellow BBC presenter and former One Show host Matt Baker, who joked: “I think the recipe says Ginger not Finger.”
Louis should be a dab hand in the kitchen after starring in BBC's Great Celebrity Bake Off where he had viewers in hysterics as he thrusted into the air during the Stand Up To Cancer special.
The broadcaster was also the first to secure the coveted Paul Hollywood handshake, before Prue Leith followed suit.
Louis then insisted comedian Noel Fielding shake his hand too, which Noel did so reluctantly, deadpanning: "This means nothing."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux chops off tip of finger while making savoury pancakes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Celebrity Bake Off star Louis Theroux has sliced off the tip of his finger while attempting to make lunch.
Louis, 49, was trying to whip up carrot and coriander pancakes when the horrible mishap happened.
The documentary filmmaker was chopping up a red onion when he accidentally caught his index finger with the knife.

Louis has since admitted he "went pale" and had to "lie down" following the painful incident.
Taking to Instagram, Louis has shown off his wound, which is now wrapped heavily in a white bandage.
He also admitted he is yet to find the missing piece of his digit. Yuck!
Louis told fans: "Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes.
"Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. "Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger."
Louis married his long-term girlfriend and mother of his three sons, Nancy Strang, in 2012.
The family now live in the US, having moved there almost three years ago.
Earlier this year, Louis appeared on the celebrity version of The Great British Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer.
And while on the show, he made history.
Keen cook Louis and his fellow celeb contestants - Jenny Eclair, Ovie Soko and Russell Howard - were tasked with making a giant cookie.
Louis decided to make his pizza-themed, using raspberry icing for the sauce, grated white chocolate for the cheese and dark chocolate drops for the olives.
Judge Paul Hollywood was so impressed that he gave him a handshake. Louis then convinced Prue Leith and Noel Fielding to shake his hand too.
Louis gushed afterwards: "I got three handshakes! That’s never happened before on Bake Off."
Sadly for Louis, this didn't secure him a win. Jenny went on to take the title of Star Baker.

During the show, Louis also admitted he has a"fascination" with Paul Hollywood.
He said: "His eyes...they're like the eyes of an arctic fox, aren't they?"
Louis added: "Why is he called Hollywood? What a ridiculous name."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux ‘slices finger’ while trying Jamie Oliver pancake recipe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Louis Theroux risked it all while trying his hand at a Jamie Oliver recipe this weekend and ended up ‘slicing off’ part of his finger in the process.
The BBC filmmaker got busy in the kitchen on Saturday night and decided to try one of Jamie’s quirky recipes for savoury pancakes. 
However, it all ended in bloodshed with Louis, 49, sharing a photo of his poor finger bandaged up and a devastated expression on his face. 
‘Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes,’ Louis revealed to his Instagram followers. 
‘Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger.’ 
While Jamie is yet to respond to Louis’ kitchen nightmare, the documentarian’s followers had plenty to say. 
Former One Show host Matt Baker joked: ‘I think the recipe says Ginger not Finger.’ 
‘That’s the universe’s way of saying you should stick with the lasagne,’ quipped another of Louis’ followers. 
Keen to avoid the recipe themselves, one added: ‘Reasons why not to make carrot and coriander pancakes number 26.’ 
Another fan cried: ‘For Gods sake Louis, stop cooking!!!!’ 
It’s safe to say he’ll probably be ordering take out more often going forward. 
Aside from creating a mess in the kitchen, Louis also opened up about his past interview with Tiger King’s Joe Exotic. 
The pair met in 2011 for Louis’ BBC documentary America’s Most Dangerous Pets before Joe became the single most talked about man on the planet following the Netflix series. 
‘I knew him before he was famous,’ Louis said on The Graham Norton Show. 
‘I spent the best part of a week with him for a documentary on dangerous pets in 2011.’ ‘If I have any regrets, it’s not talking to him more about his two husbands and his rules of engagement for three-person love making!’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux cuts off top of his finger during horror cooking accident</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Louis Theroux was left bandaged up after suffering a cooking accident.
The documentary maker, 49, took to Instagram on Saturday evening to reveal he'd cut off the top of his finger while chopping an onion.
He shared a picture of his injury all wrapped up as he pulled a sad face for the camera looking very sorry for himself.
Louis explained that he'd been following Jamie Oliver's recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes when he had the accident.
The dad-of-three captioned the post: "Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes."
The accident came as a shock and he admitted he had to have a lie down afterwards.
Louis continued: "Briefly went pale and had to lie down.
"Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly.
"Still haven't found the missing piece of finger."
The fact that he managed to post a selfie seems to suggest he is recovering well from his accident.
Louis has found himself in the headlines again lately thanks to the Netflix series Tiger King.
He was one of the first to interview to the show's leading man Joe Exotic.
Tiger King follows Joe as he ran his zoo full of big cats before he was eventually arrested and jailed for animal cruelty and murder for hire.
Louis interviewed Joe before his imprisonment for America's Most Dangerous Pets in 2011.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ Oscars bodyguard accuses host of being ‘cold, sly and demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who was hired to protect Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars has criticised the host for being “kind of demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was looking after DeGeneres as well as her mother and wife Portia de Rossi in 2014, the year Ellen was hosting the awards ceremony,
In an interview with Fox News, he claimed that Ellen was the one celebrity he’s worked with “that has never taken the time to say hi to me”, adding: “And I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities.”
Majercak said that things started off well thanks to de Rossi, who he described as “very pleasant”. However, things “started going negatively” when de Rossi introduced him to DeGeneres.
“Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife, and me,’” he continued.
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
Majercak also said that celebrities had to be approved to come and talk to DeGeneres at her table during a high-profile after party.
He said that he came forward with his story after people claiming to be Ellen’s ex-employees shared some startling experiences they’re said to have had with the presenter on social media.
One story claimed that DeGeneres would send her staff at The Ellen DeGeneres Show home if they had failed to chew gum before speaking to her.
Another added: “A new staff member was told ‘every day she picks someone different to really hate. It’s not your fault, just suck it up for the day and she’ll be mean to someone else the next day.’ They didn’t believe it but it ended up being entirely true.”
“It’s bugged me for years,” Majercak said. “I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome and everybody loves her and is in awe, and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person.”
A representative for DeGeneres has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen not so nice? - Entertainment News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres' reputation as the nicest woman in Hollywood has taken another hit - from a former bodyguard.Tom Majercak, who worked for the actress and TV personality at the 2014 Oscars, has opened up about his experience with the Finding Dory star, accusing her of being "cold" and "demeaning."He also claims she refused to look at him.Majercak, a senior manager of operations for Security Imagery Specialists, tells Fox News, "Ellen is the one person that I've been assigned to - and I've been assigned to quite a few celebrities - that has never taken the time to say hi to me."Adding that Ellen's wife, Portia De Rossi, was "very pleasant", he adds, "It started going negatively when she (Portia) introduced me to Ellen and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn't even say 'hello,' or 'thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me...'""It was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle... When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado."DeGeneres first came under attack from transgender YouTube star NikkieTutorials, who took aim at the TV host for being "cold" towards her during an appearance on her daytime show in January."Maybe I'm being naive, but I expected them to welcome me with confetti: 'Welcome to The Ellen DeGeneres Show!'" she said in an interview weeks after her appearance. "Instead I got greeted by an angry intern, who was a bit overworked. I expected a Disney show, but I got a Teletubbies after dark."Ellen has also been slammed by unnamed members of her TV crew, who are disappointed about salary cuts and a lack of communication during the coronavirus shutdown, during which the talk show host has been virtually interviewing famous friends like Pink, Melissa McCarthy, and Jennifer Lopez.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres' ex-bodyguard claims star is 'cold' and 'sly'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard claimed the star’s TV persona is a ‘false facade and bravado.’
Her former security, Tom Majercak, was assigned to protect the comedian at the 2014 Oscars and according to him, his experience felt ‘demeaning.’
Speaking to Fox News, Tom explained: ‘I’m holding their hands and walking them through individuals and large groups of people. Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to – and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities – that has never taken the time to say hi to me.
‘It started going negatively when she introduced me to Ellen and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say “hello,” or “thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.”
‘It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.’
He went on to say that he thought Ellen was ‘enlightened and positive’ when he saw her on TV, but it wasn’t the case in person.
Tom looked after her during the same Academy Award show the famous celebrity selfie was taken, which included Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Luptia Nyongo Bradley Cooper, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
‘When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado,’ he continued.  ‘You start hearing these stories and I was like, “Man, there’s got to be more to this.”
‘She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion.’
His coming forward comes after many staff members of her talk show slammed her for failing to communicate the status of their jobs and pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Beauty blogger NikkieTutorials also hit out at Ellen, saying the host ‘didn’t even say hello’ when she appeared on the show in January.
The beauty guru – real name Nikkie de Jager – came out as transgender earlier this year, with her first interview afterwards.
However, Ellen has previously slammed claims about how she treats staff, calling it an ‘outright lie.’
‘That bugs me if someone is saying that because it’s an outright lie,’ she told the New York Times in 2018.
‘The first day I said: “The one thing I want is everyone here to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don’t work here.” No one is going to raise their voice or not be grateful. That’s the rule to this day.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard slams her as ‘cold’ and ‘demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard has slammed her as “cold” and “demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was hired to protect the talk show host while she hosted the 2014 Oscars, and he also shadowed Ellen’s mother, and her wife Portia de Rossi.
Speaking to Fox News, Tom said it was one of the worst jobs he’s ever signed up for, in the ten years he’s worked in security.
He said: “Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to, and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities, that has never taken the time to say hi to me.”
Although Tom said Portia was “very pleasant and carried on a conversation”, he couldn’t say the same for Ellen.
He said: “[She] pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.’”
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
“It’s bugged me for years. I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome. And everybody loves her and is in awe and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person,” he said.
“When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado. You start hearing these stories and I was like, ‘Man, there’s got to be more to this.’
“She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion,” he added.
The news comes after Ellen was criticised by staff members over lack of communication about their pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Production on The Ellen Show halted in March, and Ellen has since been hosting the show from her house.
A source told Variety: “Radio silence from producers created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and, in that case, would need to explore unemployment benefits.”
Staff were also furious over Ellen hiring a non-union company to help her produce the show from her house, when her usual crew members have the same skills and are currently out of work.
The chat show host also hit headlines for all the wrong reasons last month, when YouTube star NikkieTutorials called her “cold” after she appeared on The Ellen Show earlier this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sherlyn Chopra, who is known as one of the boldest, breathtaking and controversial divas in the Indian showbiz, has recently opened up about all her controversies, lifestyle and sex appeal.
The 36-year-old diva has always managed to stay in limelight with bold and nude pictures on her social media handles. Recently, she mocked another controversy queen, Rakhi Sawant in an interview with IBTimes.
In an interview, when Sherlyn was asked about who has the least sex appeal in the industry, she said, "I don't know!!! I guess, Rakhi Sawant. I'm just kidding! Hope she doesn't kill me!"
Sherlyn Chopra is the first woman to have posed nude for the cover of an adult American magazine. When asked it, Sherlyn said, "Most perceptions are fickle and frivolous. The thing that I value the most is genuineness. I've never pretended or claimed to be somebody who I am not. There is sincerity & honesty in my craft which I truly treasure."
Nowadays, celebrities try to impress their fans with their sex appeal. But Sherlyn Chopra has a different take on it. She said, "For me, sex appeal is 99 per cent mental and 1 per cent physical. There are so many people who have great physiques but uninspiring personalities. It's a sad situation."
Sherlyn Chopra often shares her nude pictures on social media for which she gets various kind of replies. Speaking about the same, Sherlyn said, "Now, I live to please myself. I shoot pics & videos to entertain myself and when I share the same with the world, not only do they appreciate it but also pay a price to watch my premium content on the Sherlyn Chopra App."
After sharing nude pictures, Sherlyn Chopra often receives derogatory comments. When asked about how she deals with it, Sherlyn said, "My late father had taught me to never take anything personally from people whom I don't know personally. So, I simply refuse to give my attention to naysayers. As a matter of fact, most naysayers are unemployed, bored, frustrated and dejected and they love to constantly engage in unnecessary hostile and combative interactions with strangers."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chupke Se Anup Jalota ke saath shaadi? Hear it from the horse's mouth. Jasleen is ready to talk about the chain of events, rather candidly
On Tuesday, Jasleen Matharu (of Bigg Boss 12) posted a picture, where the actress was dressed in a floral night suit and seen wearing a chooda, with sindoor on her forehead. This made many wonder if she has tied the nuptial knot. 
However, talking to us later in the day, Ms Matharu clarified that she hasn't got married but this is her look for a project. Interestingly, in another of her earlier interviews with us, Jasleen had revealed, "I am in the mood of getting married but it's just that I haven't found the right person yet. Mere dil ki ghanti nahi baji ab tak."
And now, as per Jasleen some people are still not believing her that she hasn't exchanged marriage vows. Speaking to us exclusively about it, she said, "Ever since I posted that picture, people are sending me congratulatory messages. Many friends are even wishing me 'A Happy Married Life'. In fact, that very day, Kashmera Shah texted me on similar lines."
And what did she tell Ms Shah? "Well, I told her the truth, what else? I was touched with her gesture, though."
Jasleen signs off by saying that some of her fans are still in the 'No Belief' zone and telling her that 'they're heartbroken'. On the other hand, some of them have asked her: 'Who is the man?  Anup Jalota se toh shaadi nahin karli?'
Talking about how it all started, Ms Matharu explained, "I was shooting a music video on the song Chupke Se from Saathiya at home. Yes, I dressed like a newly-wed girl at her honeymoon. But surely, I didn't expect that it would lead to so much chaos."Image Source:- instagram/jasleenmatharu/ jalotaanup/ sunil.r.khandare

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seven years on, actress Tope Osoba still crushes on Don Jazzy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
In 2013, delectable Yoruba actress, Temitope Osoba still a greenhorn then, had an interview with “Yours Truly” in Vanguard, where she revealed her crush, then Mo’Hits henchman, Michael Collins Ajereh, famously known as Don Jazzy.
In the interview which was then done over Blackberry chat, the actress was full of admiration for the now Mavin Records overlord and aptly dubbed the Dorobucci perennial bachelor her crush, for many reasons, maybe now primordial.
Interestingly, it appears it wasn’t a girlish fantasy as the actress, seven years after, still seems to have a thing or two for the music maker, if the TikTok video she did days ago has any substance in it.
The actress, like so many celebrities, probably shaking off boredom occasioned by the lockdown, made a video of herself in a romantic conversation with her supposed crush, Don Jazzy!
In the said TikTok video posted on Tope Osoba’s Instagram page, she was having a duet with Don Jazzy and both looked to be hopelessly in love and in tears as if there was a force holding them back from expressing their inner feeling to each other.
“Did you ever love me?” teary Don Jazzy was asking the sobbing actress and her reply was, “I don’t know.” Only her distraught face showed otherwise.
However, the question remains: Does Temitope Osoba still have a crush on Don Jazzy? It must be noted that the video was made by an app called TikTok and Don Jazzy had no real hand in the drama. It was all creation of the actress.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Actors of Mean Girls Have Changed After 16 Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s been 16 years since Lindsay Lohan played Cady Heron in Mean Girls, the comedy that became a modern classic among millennials-to-be, back when they were still in high school. The strength of this story is that it’s very relatable. After all, we’ve all suffered some type of bullying at some point.
To remember the actors that brightened our teenage years, the Bright Side team decided to check and see what the Mean Girls actors are up to today. Here’s what we found:
In 2014, actress, singer, and model Lindsay Lohan worked on an 8-episode series about her personal and professional life called Lindsay. In 2017, she was cast for the second season of Sick Note, to play Katerina West, and, in 2019, she had her own reality show called Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club, produced by MTV.
Rachel McAdams has had a prolific career as a movie actress since 2001, but it wasn’t until 2004 that she was truly launched into fame. In 2011, she was cast to play a part in Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris. She also starred in other known movies such as The Vow and The Notebook and series like True Detective in 2015. Then in 2016, she was nominated for the first time in her career for an Oscar as Best Supporting actress for her performance in Spotlight. She was also cast to participate in the filmEurovision, produced by Netflix.
In 2014, comedian Tim Meadows got the leading role in Marry Me, a popular comedy series. 2 years later, he participated in Son of Zorn, a series mixing the sitcom and the animated genres produced by Fox Television. He also worked in other comic films like Jack and Jill or Popstar: Never Stop, Never Stopping, among others.
After co-writing the Mean Girl’s script and playing a leading role, Tina Fey’s prolific career led her to work on about other comic films, where, not only did she act or write screenplays (see30 Rock), but she also gave voice to characters such as Megamind’s Roxanne Ritchie. In 2019, she played Tammy in Amy Poehler’s Wine Country.
Amy’s successful career doesn’t stop at acting. She has produced various sitcoms and movies. She played the lead role in the sitcom Parks and Recreation from 2009 to 2015 and she gave voice to several animated characters, even appearing on SpongeBob SquarePants. She also voiced Joy for Inside Out in 2015. Then, in 2019 she worked again with Tina Fey in Wine Country.
Lacey’s prolific career in the film and TV industry started a few years before Mean Girls came along, but its release certainly didn’t hurt. On the contrary, she kept working on movies, like 2006’s Bratz, based on the doll collection and she played Zatanna Zatara in the Young Justice TV series. In 2017 she played Chloe Grange for My Secret Valentine, which was released in 2018.
Unlike Lacey Chabert, Lizzy Caplan’s performance in Mean Girls did launch her into fame. She did the voiceover for Debbie in Seth MacFarlane’s animated sitcom American Dad!, and she has been cast in both films and series, like Extinction (2018), Now You See Me 2 (2016), and even the popular satirical film The Interview. She’s also played parts in True Blood and in the German series Das Boot. Her character Julia appeared in 4 episodes of New Girl.
Amanda Seyfried appeared in a few episodes of series like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,Law & Order: Special Victim Unit, and House M.D., as a guest in the first season. In 2018, she starred in the second part of the musical Mamma Mia! and she recently played Daphne Blake in the new remake of the animated movie of Scooby Doo, Scoob!. She also played in the movie adaption of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables.
Besides playing Damian in Mean Girls, Daniel Franzese has played in movies such as 2005’s War of the Worlds, where he played a National Guardsman. In 2016, he played in the television film Looking: The Movie, which was released by HBO. To this day, he has appeared in various movies since his debut in Bully, from 2001.
Ana Gasteyer is a professional comedian and actor with a long CV to show off. She’s best known for her Saturday Night Live appearances and imitations of public figures and celebrities such as Joan Rivers, Celine Dion, and Barbra Streisand, among others. Her last appearance in a film was in Wine Country. She also played a role in 3 episodes of the series Schooled.
You might remember Neil Flynn’s performance in the sitcom The Middle, where he plays the lead role of Michael “Mike” Heck Jr., the dad. This experienced comedian has played in plenty of movies and TV shows and series, including Smallville, The King of the Hill, a few episodes of Joey, a spin-off of the popular ’90s sitcom, Friends.
And last but not least, the ladies’ man who drove Cady crazy in Mean Girls became the host of the show Cake Wars in 2015, a reality show in which competitors try to bake the best cake for a professional jury. Jonathan Bennett also had quick cameos in TV series such as Smallville and played Adam Chandler in ABC’s All My Children. He also appears in Ariana Grande’s music video “thank u, next” that was released in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Go-Go’s’ Kathy Valentine Looks Back on Rock ‘N’ Roll ‘Vacation’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All I Ever Wanted, the new book from Kathy Valentine of the Go-Go’s collects her stories from the incredible journey that the bassist has taken as a member of the group.
Clocking in at just under 300 pages, It’s also unflinchingly honest, taking stock of the low points and the things that could have been, while also illustrating the path that Valentine took and the struggles she faced as she was growing up. All I Ever Wanted details how those challenges ultimately helped to prepare her to soldier through the unbelievable series of events that would follow once she left Austin, Texas, and went to Hollywood to make her dreams real.
Along the way, there would be plenty of learning experiences and, in addition to the war stories that are inside the book, there’s also valuable perspective that Valentine feels can still be beneficial knowledge for people who are making their own music today.
“I think it [will be] fun for people to read why we just rushed into a second record [1982’s Vacation] and how that was the band was doing that -- how dumb it was,” she tells UCR. “Hopefully, musicians will get something out of that. Even though it’s a very different music business now, some things never change and I hope that young bands or young people -- musicians that read my book, will learn from those mistakes. Maybe you have a team behind you for a reason. Maybe you listen to other people. It was just so funny, we were like, 'We’re calling the shots. We know what’s best for us.' And it was just the dumbest thing that we ever did.”
Late nights with John Belushi found the comedy legend making a call to the local Guitar Center and getting them to open the door so that he and Valentine and friends could jam. Another adventure included Belushi concocting a plan to shoplift a six-pack of beer. “Drinking and cocaine were vices, for sure,” Valentine writes in her book. “But they played a secondary role to wanting to hang out like a couple of teenagers digging music and having a couple of beers.”
The band would open for their heroes -- hand-picked by the Rolling Stones for a date in Rockford, Ill., during the Tattoo Youtour. Playing a well-received set to kick off the night, the rest of the evening would take on new meaning as Valentine watched the Stones run through their setlist, still glowing from her own performance and wondering what was up ahead for the Go-Go’s.
They had already been working hard, touring for nearly half a year. Their success was a combination of things, including the belief of their label, I.R.S. Records, the early airplay support of college stations and "rogue DJs” and tireless interviews and promotion that would eventually see “Our Lips Are Sealed” rise to the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. “We Got the Beat” would climb even higher, peaking at No. 2.
Beauty and the Beat, their debut album, ultimately spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. As Valentine worked on the book, she finally had the chance to revisit those early moments and remember what they were like.
“I wrote about making Beauty and the Beat and what it felt like to be in New York and to be young," she says. "Even though it was a dream come true to be in a band making an album, sometimes, that was almost overshadowed by how much fun I was having. I likened it to being on a honeymoon and newlyweds on this pink cloud. At the end of writing about it, I was like, I didn’t know that it would never be that easy again to be in a band.”
“Realizing as I wrote it, that had to get in the album. It had to adhere to the tape. Reliving that joy and remembering what it felt like and to fall in love for the first time and feel like I had met a guy that cared about me and to be 22 years old. It was just an amazing time for me,” she continues. “I really got to sit in it, the whole time that I wrote that chapter and revel in it and exalt in what I got to experience and how amazing it was. And what came out of it. All of that would have been just enough by itself. But on top of that, we made a No. 1 record.”
To this day, they own a powerful statistic. The Go-Go’s were the first multi-platinum selling, all-female band to play instruments themselves, write their own songs and have a No. 1 album. The impact of what they accomplished is something that they unknowingly passed forward to the next generation that would follow.
“I remember in the ‘90s when those radio stations started doing the Christmas shows where a bunch of bands would go play, we did one and Hole was playing right after us. I was scared,” Valentine recalls. “I was scared what Courtney [Love] would say. I felt like, ‘Oh, we’re the old dinosaurs’ or something. But Courtney went out on stage and the first thing she started saying was, 'If it wasn’t for the fucking Go-Go’s, I wouldn’t be here!'”
Beyond the singles, the Go-Go’s albums as a whole showed that there was a lot of depth to their songwriting. They were hardly churning out pop fluff.
“I was super-proud of the first album, because I really liked the subject matter. It wasn’t all a bunch of love songs. Even if it was about romance, it was about empowered women. It wasn’t sappy stuff at all,” Valentine says. “ I was so proud of that and it gave us something to strive for. Vacation was a rushed album, but those songs on the first album, lyrically, gave us something to strive for and not trying to come from a place that it’s okay to write about relationship stuff and love stuff. That’s a big part of life and that’s what everyone is always going to write songs about that stuff. But as women, there’s a way that you can do it.”
As fans take the ride through Valentine’s back pages, they can enjoy the accompanying soundtrack, available on Bandcamp and also included as part of the audio version of the book, which adds a unique twist to the stories that they correspond with.
“It ended up just being the most fun. After I finished the book, I just felt like I wasn’t done. I felt like I wanted to just keep going,” she says. “The not-so-sexy answer is that I thought, ‘Who’s going to care about my book? Who is going to give a shit?’ I thought, what can I do that other writers can’t do? And I thought, ‘Well, I can write songs.’ Then I started thinking, ‘Oh, soundtrack!’ Then I started thinking, ‘Why the hell has no other musician done this?’”
Valentine would spend eight months working on the musical companion to All I Ever Wanted and enjoyed the lack of boundaries and restrictions.
“I didn’t have to follow any convention of songwriting. Because I thought of it very much as a score or a soundtrack like a movie would have. But at the same time, I could employ everything that I knew about writing songs,” she says. “I could put guitar hooks and vocal hooks and build up choruses. I could do one verse. In a song, it’s like, oh, you’ve got to write a second verse. You have to. You know, that’s the rule, the song rule. But in a soundtrack, I could do whatever I wanted! I could write a verse and then I could do this and then I could have no music. I could just do whatever I wanted.”
Ultimately, the experience of working on the soundtrack was “almost as meaningful” as writing the book, according to the songwriter. In one particular case, it allowed her to fully come to terms with a painful part of her early life.
“The song ‘Just Do It’ was inspired by the chapter where I relate being raped. When I wrote that chapter, I processed it to a degree. It was kind of like, ‘Oh, wow, this was basically being raped.’ I’d always kind of thought, ‘Oh, you said, just do it.’ and you put yourself in a stupid situation. So I never really equated it with that,” she says now. “But when I wrote it, I was like, ‘Okay, I was 14 and I was saying, ‘No, I don’t want to do this.’ So one and one equals two. I had processed it to one degree, but I’ve got to tell you, when I did the music and I wrote that chorus, all of the sudden, it just opened this thing into this buried grieving and mourning and for three days, I cried and cried and cried. It was the music that opened that door. It was the music that did it. So I was really happy with that one and I can still start crying when I play it. It’s just the key and it opens the box every time.”
With a planned book tour so far scuttled by the current pandemic situation, Valentine has taken the trek virtual, setting up a series of Zoom conversations with authors and fellow musicians to discuss the book. New events, tied in with local independent booksellers, are revealed weekly via her social media.
The Go-Go’s, a new documentary on the history of the group, premiered earlier this year at Sundance and will get a wider release via Showtime in the coming months.
“I think it’s really good for the band. It’s been a part of our healing and I don’t know, when it premiered at Sundance, the whole band was there and we got up out of our seats and we just all hugged each other. It was a very different kind of feeling than we’ve ever had. There was something about the way [director Alison Ellwood] captured the band that just has kind of made us very proud and feel really good about who we are.”
 
The Pretenders (1980): Chrissie Hynde was a new-school punk with a classic-rock heart. She loved the Kinks as much as she loved the Sex Pistols, and on the Pretenders' stinging debut she comes off like the biggest badass on the planet.
Rush (1980): Compact, radio-ready items like "The Spirit of Radio" and "Freewill" signalled a move away from longer-form compositions for Rush and let to a trip up the Billboard charts. 'Permanent Waves' became their first American Top Five album, eventually going platinum.
Bob Seger (1980): A two-time Grammy winner that knocked Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' off the top of the charts, 'Against the Wind' found its strengths in Bob Seger's balladry, rather than his typical meat-and-potatoes rockers.
Elvis Costello (1980): Costello's first experiment with the genre-hopping that would define his career was 1980's 'Get Happy.' An excursion into soul music, it sounds like Booker T. and the M.G.s crossed with speed and a rhyming dictionary.
Van Halen (1980): Dark elements begin to creep into Van Halen's sound, after a pair of well-received party-rock albums. That creative tension - somber Eddie, versus impish Dave - would spark the band for years, then (perhaps inevitably) tear it apart.
Black Sabbath (1980): When the Ozzy Osbourne-led sessions for 'Heaven and Hell' fell apart, Black Sabbath brought in former Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio to take his place. Suddenly the band was reborn, producing their best album since 'Masters of Reality.'
Judas Priest (1980): Judas Priest began to couple their earlier complexity with more polished, groove-focused songs, hurtling NWOBHM into the mainstream. Fun moments like "Breaking the Law" are perfectly balanced by darker triumphs like "Metal Gods."
Pete Townshend (1980): After 15 years of writing mostly for Roger Daltrey's voice, Pete Townshend discovered his own on his proper solo debut. He also matched the Who's highest charting single when "Let My Love Open the Door" reached No. 9.
AC/DC (1980): AC/DC's powerhouse tribute to their late singer Bon Scott doubles as a declaration of purpose. With new singer Brian Johnson leading the charge, the group delivered their best album (about sex, death and, um, sex), and suddenly found themselves as one of the planet's biggest bands.
David Bowie (1980): After the critically lauded but commercially less successful Berlin Trilogy, Bowie began blending in more obvious pop sensibilities - and quickly returned to the top of the UK charts. 'Scary Monsters' can be seen now as a capstone on his '70s-era experimentalism.
Ozzy Osbourne (1980): There wasn't much momentum behind Osbourne as he emerged from his post-Black Sabbath firing. But the quick maturation of ex-Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoads, coupled with Ozzy's sudden knack for finding neo-metal hooks, quickly turned things around.
Bruce Springsteen (1980): Springsteen's double-album follow-up to 1978's 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' plays like an old Hollywood movie, with characters making some bad choices on their way to redemption. He had way too many ideas and songs to pull it all together without losing some focus. But close enough.
Dire Straits (1980): Mark Knopfler begins to widen Dire Straits' sonic palette, bringing in jazzier textures and some new-wave sensibilities. His narrative command is growing, too. As such, 'Making Movies' opened the door for every success that followed.
Talking Heads (1980): Bringing in horns, funk session players and Brian Eno, Talking Heads crafted their polyrhythmic masterpiece at the dawn of the decade and changed their direction forever. It sounded amazing and ahead of its time in 1980. It still does.
John Lennon/Yoko Ono (1980): After a five-year break from music to focus on being a husband and father, Lennon returned with a bunch of songs ... about being a husband and father. Three weeks after its release, he was killed, instilling the work (a collaboration with wife Ono) with even more poignancy.
The Clash (1980): The Clash followed up their double-album masterpiece 'London Calling' with a three-record set that was even more sprawling. It's messy at times, and isn't as focused as their three previous LPs, but it's brimming with ideas, innovation and brilliance.
Styx (1981): The most successful album in terms of achieving Styx's early goals of mixing of prog-rock ideals and AOR musicality, 'Paradise Theatre' perfectly balances grandiose pieces with short, sharp shocks like "Too Much Time on My Hands," "Snowblind" and "Half-Penny, Two-Penny."
Phil Collins (1980): This not only redefined Genesis’ new-ish frontman as a solo artist, it worked as a fulcrum for everything that came later as Phil Collins' main band began rapidly metamorphosing from prog into an '80s hit machine.
Rush (1981): Still their biggest-selling U.S. album, this plays like an early-'80s greatest hits package (Side one's radio and concert favorites include "Tom Sawyer," "Red Barchetta," "YYZ" and "Limelight"), before Rush settles into long-form thoughts.
The Police (1980): If the Police's first three albums were about building styles, subjects and songcraft, their fourth expands the arsenal outright. It's their most political album, and at times their smartest and most melodic.
Billy Squier (1980): For a moment in time, Billy Squier was everywhere, as songs like "My Kinda Lover" and "The Stroke" ruled the airwaves. 'Don't Say No,' in fact, remained on the Billboard album chart for more than two years.
Van Halen (1981): The slowest-selling album of the Roth era, 'Fair Warning' may showcase Van Halen at their least commercial - but also perhaps at their most compelling. Eddie Van Halen's guitar is a central element in this dark and dirty triumph.
Foreigner (1981): This career peak found Foreigner firing on all commercial cylinders, from the anthemic rock-star love letter of "Jukebox Hero" to tender power ballads like "Waiting on a Girl Like You" to something brand new in "Urgent" - which benefited greatly from a funky cameo on sax by Motown's Junior Parker.
Journey (1981): The addition of Jonathan Cain made a commercial juggernaut out of Journey, which had started as a Bay Area jam band. Cain, in fact, had a songwriting credit for every song on 'Escape,' which reeled off four Top 20 hits - including "Open Arms," the era's definitive power ballad.
Stevie Nicks (1981): Stevie Nicks' long-awaited solo career got off to a fast start with this smash hit, though she still seemed to favor collaborations -- working with Don Henley, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Waddy Wachtel, rather than Lindsey Buckingham.
The Rolling Stones (1981): The Stones stitched together 'Tattoo You' from various leftover songs dating back to the mid-'70s. But the seams barely show on this tight collection - their last classic album - of sexed-up and riff-driven rockers.
Genesis (1981): A bold update of the Genesis sound, 'Abacab' focused more on of-the-moment synths even while creating far more space than a group which once ballooned to five members had ever allowed. At the same time, songs like "No Reply At All" make clear their pop intentions for this decade.
King Crimson (1981): King Crimson returned after a seven-year layoff boasting the snappy new-wave vibe of the day, thanks in no small way to the addition of former David Bowie/Talking Heads sideman Adrian Belew. Tony Levin, fresh off some early solo career-defining work with Peter Gabriel, added new depth, too.
Motley Crue (1981): Motley Crue's punkish, bracingly lo-fi 1981 debut may not be their heaviest, best produced or most popular album - but it comes just a 'Shout' short of being their best.
Ozzy Osbourne (1981): Randy Rhoads' interest in neo-classical guitar stylings didn't just propel the quickly assembled 'Diary of a Madman' to near-classic status, it pointed to a larger career statement that - tragically - was never to be. In retrospect, it was good Ozzy rushed this out at the end of 1981. By March 1982, Rhoads was gone.
Asia (1982): It wasn't the prog-redux moment many might have expected with a new supergroup featuring members of Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer and King Crimson. Instead, it was a huge pop hit. So huge, in fact, that Asia almost immediately started splitting apart.
Iron Maiden (1982): New singer Bruce Dickinson's powerful, operatic voice unlocked the gates to metal immortality for Iron Maiden, inspring Steve Harris to take his songwrting to a new level on jaw-dropping tracks like "Run to the Hills" and "Hallowed Be Thy Name."
Richard and Linda Thompson (1982): Richard and Linda Thompson were ending their 10-year marriage when they recorded 'Shoot Out the Lights,' and the resentment, hopelessness and regret are palpable in the songs. One of rock's all-time greatest breakup albums.
Paul McCartney (1982): McCartney scored his final No. 1 album so far, largely on the strength of the smash Steve Wonder duet "Ebony and Ivory." Dig deeper, however, and you'll find far more interesting gems such as "Wanderlust" and "Take it Away." A great Wings song that wasn’t, the latter should have been the bigger hit.
Toto (1982): To this point, Toto hadn't managed a hit album, something all the more curious considering the studio pedigree of its core members. So, they put their heads together and came up with one. A huge one.
Roxy Music (1982): Roxy Music departed on a high note with this elegant synth-pop gem. 'Avalon' rose to No. 1 in the UK behind the sophisticated, Bryan Ferry-crooned romance of songs like "More Than This" and the title track.
Fleetwood Mac (1982): After indulging in the sprawling, wildly expensive, weirdly effective 'Tusk,' Fleetwood Mac returned with a comfy retro vibe for 'Mirage' - and fans raced back for the lacey mysteries of "Gypsy" and the soaring joys of "Hold Me."
Joe Jackson (1982): Joe Jackson's first album after moving to New York was a love note to his new home. A shimmering collection of songs that touched on rock, Latin, jazz and pop, 'Night and Day' had two Top 20 hits in "Steppin' Out" and "Breaking Us in Two."
Elvis Costello (1982): After setting the bar for dense, layered post-punk with 1979's 'Armed Forces,' Elvis Costello raised it again with 'Imperial Bedroom.' The album was a musically adventurous excursion in genre-hopping that earned comparisons to George Gershwin and Cole Porter.
Judas Priest (1982): And to think, the best-known track on Judas Priest's breakthrough album almost didn't make it. Needing one more song to complete the project, they turned to an unfinished number that became "You've Got Another Thing Comin'."
Bruce Springsteen (1982): Springsteen originally meant for these stark, desolate songs to serve as demos for the E Street Band, but their themes - mostly death and despair, and lots of it - worked better as stripped-down acoustic numbers. We can't imagine them any other way.
Peter Gabriel (1982): Yes, this was to be Peter Gabriel's fourth consecutive self-titled solo album. (A frustrated Geffen Records added a sticker saying 'Security' in the U.S.) Inside, however, much had changed, as Gabriel began to dabble in the African and Latin rhythms that would make 'So' a career-changing smash.
Kiss (1982): With their career in tatters, Kiss finally stopped messing around with disco, pop and concept albums and delivered their heaviest and most sophisticated album ever. Someday we're going to convince them to play "Saint and Sinner" and "Rock and Roll Hell" live.
Def Leppard (1983): With this album, both Def Leppard and producer Mutt Lange came into their own. Focusing less on raw energy and more on pristine melodicism, they created a gleaming tower of pop-metal.
ZZ Top (1983): ZZ Top traded their blues stylings for synth-driven pop on the MTV-conquering 'Eliminator,' and in effect became arena-filling pop stars. But beneath all that new polish was the same ol' boogie that helped define them a decade before.
David Bowie (1983): David Bowie's decision to work with Nile Rodgers, and by extension his suave and funky band Chic, gave this album a sleek approachability in keeping with the times - and Bowie his biggest hit ever. A dash of grit comes courtesy of guest guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, then largely unknown.
Dio (1983): After extremely productive stints as lead singer for Rainbow and Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio stepped out on his own and delivered another masterpiece right out of the gate with 'Holy Diver.' The still-ubiquitous title track and "Rainbow in the Dark" get all the attention, but the entire album is worthy of your time.
Iron Maiden (1983): Iron Maiden's most famous lineup finally locked into place on their fourth album with the arrival of the technically dazzling Nicko McBrain. Meanwhile, on his second studio effort with the group, Bruce Dickinson proves himelf an important songwriting partner as well as one of the genre's best singers on tracks like "Revelations" and "Die With Your Boots On."
Stevie Ray Vaughan (1983): All of the guitar gods were gone, or otherwise occupied. Drum machines had replaced stomping feet. There were synthesizers instead of someone slapping on the 88s. Into this unlikeliest of scenarios stepped Stevie Ray Vaughan.
The Police (1983): The ultimate lesson on leaving at the top of your game, the Police's last album is a dark and complex masterpiece that was light-years from the reggae-infused punk of their first few records. But it was tuneful and accessible enough to sell eight million copies and have four smash hit singles.
Metallica (1983): The future kings of metal went all Nuke LaLoosh and announced their presence with authority on their debut album, mixing breakneck speed with technical precision to help create the thrash genre on "Hit the Lights," "Whiplash" and "Seek & Destroy."
Billy Joel (1983): As he was falling in love with supermodel Christie Brinkley, Billy Joel looked back at the rock and soul music of his youth on 'An Innocent Man.' It spawned three Top 10 hits and remained on the charts for more than 100 weeks.
Motley Crue (1983): Motley Crue's relentless, riff-filled second record immediately catapulted them into hard rock superstardom, and remains their masterpiece. Some of us (definitely not all of us) think they even managed to out-do the Beatles with their scorching take on "Helter Skelter."
Billy Idol (1983): As immediate as this album sounds, it's easy to forget that Billy Idol had to perfect quite a complex formula to create 'Rebel Yell.' Punk attitude, metal guitar, pop smarts, soulful vocals - and yes, the accompanying MTV-ready visuals - all blended together in perfect doses to create this essential '80s sensation.
Yes (1983): Yes’ best-selling U.S. single ever, “Owner of a Lonely Heart” shot to No. 1 on the strength of its new-wave attitude then its weirdly transfixing video - and this legacy group was reborn for a new age.
Van Halen (1984): For his band's sixth album, Eddie Van Halen pulled out a synthesizer, wrote songs rather than riffs and changed the group's fortunes. It eventually tore apart the band (David Lee Roth was gone the next year), but it left us with classics like "Jump," "Panama" and "Hot for Teacher."
The Cars (1984): Trading in the edgy new wave sound of their earlier triumphs, the Cars enlisted now-mega-producer Mutt Lange to help produce something poppier, glossier and arguably even more radio-friendly. Naturally, it sold a bazillion copies. Sadly, it was also pretty much the end of the group.
Twisted Sister (1984): After years of slowly conquering the Long Island and New York metal scene, Twisted Sister grabbed the brass ring with their third album's undeniable twin anthems, "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "I Wanna Rock." In retrospect, the only shame is that those pop-tinged hits drowned out the rest of this impressive album's more diverse and aggresive songs.
Bruce Springsteen (1984): The moment where Springsteen became the biggest rock star on the planet. And he managed it with one of his best set of songs - all rage, sorrow and nostalgia for better days. A landmark record of the '80s and a timeless classic.
Metallica (1984): Metallic fearlessly left the pioneering style of their barely-a-year-old first album far behind with their sophomore effort. Happily, the dramatic advances in production values and songwriting complexity did absolutely nothing to diminish the band's primal fury.
Talking Heads (1984): One of rock's greatest live albums, by one of rock's greatest live bands. Talking Heads were full into their expanded lineup when they recorded their concert movie and this excellent soundtrack, which rework their already formidable catalog into dizzying new heights.
Bryan Adams (1984): 'Reckless' had peaked, it seemed, outside the Top Five in January 1985. But Bryan Adams kept releasing songs, and they kept becoming hits, and pretty soon his album had not only reached No. 1 but had become the first by a Canadian to sell one million copies in his home country.
Don Henley (1984): If this synth-laden, distinctively modern album was your first taste of Don Henley, you might have found it difficult to believe he was once a country-rock pioneer with the Eagles. But beneath that '80s veneer, Henley's familiar songwriting strengths emerge.
Los Lobos (1984): Before they started exploring meticulously crafted soundscapes in the studio, and before they hit No. 1 with their cover of "La Bamba," Los Lobos made one of the '80s' best roots records. Smart, sharp ... and you can dance to it.
John Fogerty (1985): After a 10-year vacation from music, Fogerty returned with his most Creendence-like set of songs since he shut down the band in the early '70s. It's a self-referential work, with lyrical and musical quotes to his CCR days, and a renewed sense of purpose from one of rock's greatest songwriters.
Tom Petty (1985): Petty explores the South and his connection to it, while also enlisting Eurythmics Dave Stewart to produce a handful of mind-warping tracks. It's not Petty's most focused album (and he and his band fought during its completion), but it's an interesting '80s sidetrack.
Dire Straits (1985): Mark Knopfler polished and fine-tuned the tracks on 'Brothers in Arms' to the point where they sounded like perfectly constructed packages of the digital future. All that airlessness would be stifling if the songs ("Money for Nothing," "So Far Away," "Walk of Life") weren't so great.
Sting (1985): After dissolving the Police, Sting hooked up with some of jazz's hottest young guns for his first solo album. 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles' falls somewhere in between the two genres, creating a unique sound and some of the decade's most pointed social commentary.
John Mellencamp (1985): Mellencamp got serious and political on his eighth album, an exploration of deep-rooted Americana that he had first played around with on "Pink Houses" a couple of years earlier. The former John Cougar got even rootsier on the follow-up, 'The Lonesome Jubilee,' but 'Scarecrow' is where it all comes together for him.
Tom Waits (1985): Waits began transforming himself from boozy beatnik to avant-rock weirdo around the turn of the decade. On 'Rain Dogs' he completely gives in to his weirdo side. Trashcan percussion, bullhorn vocals and a Keith Richards cameo - all-around brilliant.
Bob Dylan (1985): This box (originally five LPs) gathers more than 50 songs from Dylan's first three decades - nearly half of them never released or collected on album. It's a riveting portrait of one of music's most influential figures.
Metallica (1986): On their third album, Metallica perfected the thrash assault they were working their way up to since the decade's start. It influenced tons of other likeminded artists, and, more importantly, on songs like the battering title track, it runs circles around the rest of '80s metal.
Van Halen (1986): On this fanbase-polarizing but ultimately undeniable album, Van Halen take full advantage of new frontman Sammy Hagar's considerable vocal abilities, expanding their range on songs like the soaring "Dreams" and the surprisingly sophisticated "Best of Both Worlds."
Peter Gabriel (1986): After four albums of demanding art-rock, Gabriel switched gears a bit on his fifth solo LP (and the first to feature an actual title). Its mainstream success - thanks to hit singles "Sledgehammer" and "In Your Eyes," among others - proved that even intimidating '70s prog-rockers could be world-dominating pop stars.
David Lee Roth (1986): Diamond Dave sure seemed screwed after acrimoniously leaving hard rock's best and most popular act at the height of their fame. But shockingly, while his former battery mate Eddie Van Halen experimented with keyboards and (gasp!) maturity, Roth recruited a three-headed monster of a band and beat his old crew hands down in terms of pure rock thrills.
Bon Jovi (1986): With the possible exception of U2, there isn't a band that was more honest about priortizing world domination than Bon Jovi circa 1986. Purists cried foul over the band's carefully calculated, literally focus-grouped songcraft and mom-friendly sound. But over 12,000,000 people ignored those haters and made Bon Jovi the biggest band of the decade.
Motorhead (1986): We realize we're courting controversy by choosing this over 'Ace of Spades,' but it's not a stunt. There's something just foreign enough about the production on this one to cast Motorhead's awesomely predictable sound in a whole new light. Plus, the first five songs are sequenced together so tightly it's like hearing the 'Abbey Road' medley on amphetamines.
Paul Simon (1986): Nobody's done more for world music than Simon, who enlisted South African musicians to liven his greatest solo LP. 'Graceland' is a joyous, super-catchy collection of songs about growing up, growing old and seizing the moment. Forget the controversy; this is music to get lost in.
Def Leppard (1987): No album defines the sound of the '80s more than this gazillion-selling hit. With Mutt Lange again behind the boards, Def Leppard crafted a set of polished pop-rock gems (like the eternal "Pour Some Sugar on Me") that glisten beneath the weight of their stellar hooks.
U2 (1987): U2's masterpiece sounds epic from the very first notes of the opening "Where the Streets Have No Name." Bono and band made their legend here, on their fifth album, with shimmering guitars, arena-shaking hooks and a soundscape as big as their imaginations would allow.
The Cult (1987): Ever wonder how Jim Morrison would sound fronting early-70's AC/DC? Luckily, with help from Rick Rubin's spartan production methods the Cult tried that look out for this one glorious album. It fit perfectly, so naturally they changed their style again the next time out.
Guns N' Roses (1987): Guns N' Roses busted outta Los Angeles like they had something to prove. Before Nirvana got around to killing hair metal once and for all, GNR got in the first blow on this still-powerful debut assault of riffs, hooks and attitude.
John Mellencamp (1987): Mellencamp dove deeper into the introspective socio-political themes he’d begun exploring with 1985’s 'Scarecrow,' even as rootsier sounds - accordion, melodica, fiddle - moved to the fore.
Warren Zevon (1987): Fresh out of rehab, Warren Zevon rediscovered his muse and savage wit on 'Sentimental Hygeine.' It was recorded with an all-star cast, including Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Don Henley and members of the Heartbreakers and R.E.M.
Bruce Springsteen (1987): After the massive success of 'Born in the U.S.A.,' Springsteen scaled back his music and changed his focus. The result was a stunning song cycle about the pitfalls of falling in love when you're not emotionally ready for it.
Joe Satriani (1987): Steve Vai and Kirk Hammet's former guitar teacher proves that guitar wizardy is about 100 times more impressive when paired up with great songwriting on his commercial breakthrough, 'Surfing With the Alien.' Plus, for crying out loud, the guitar is laughing like a chimpanzee with hiccups at the end of the title track!
Robert Plant (1988): After too long ignoring everything that came before, Plant begins a tentative return to his Led Zeppelin legacy by way of a couple of collaborations here with Jimmy Page. At the same time, a group of younger collaborators goosed him into exciting new sounds.
Eric Clapton (1988): One of rock's first box sets of the CD era, and still one of the best. Collecting material from Clapton's vast career - including the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Cream, Derek and the Dominoes and solo material - 'Crossroads' included enough previously unreleased tracks to entice old fans.
Living Colour (1988): Living Colour obliterated the lines between rock, funk, metal and jazz on their debut. 'Vivid' took on topics like racism, slumlords and celebrity culture while giving some of the decade's most accessibly complex music.
Jane's Addiction (1988): Jane's Addiction were too artsy to fit in with L.A.'s metal scene, too heavy to be part of the alternative club. So they basically became their own entity, combining Zeppelin-sized riffs with tricky art-rock poses on their classic studio debut.
Metallica (1987): Metallica's fourth album (and first to feature Jason Newsted on bass following Cliff Burton's death) expanded the ideas and sprawling set pieces found on the band's earlier LPs. For years, fans have complained about 'Justice''s thin production, but that doesn't take anything away from epic songs like "One."
Keith Richards (1988): Mick Jagger had issued his platinum-selling solo debut in 1985, but to this point Richards had refrained from working outside the framework of the Rolling Stones. 'Talk is Cheap,' a brilliantly nasty little aside that went gold, equalized things - and the Stones were back on track for an improbable reunion that continued into a new millennium.
Traveling Wilburys (1988): When needing a b-side, George Harrison roped in Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne and wound up with a full album, While supergroups often disappoint due to a desire to overwhelm, the Traveling Wilburys succeed because they kept things loose.
Lou Reed (1989): The last best thing that Lou Reed ever did, 'New York' (with its flinty ripped-from-the-headlines references like the "Statue of Bigotry") helped nudge rock toward a better self - even as it put a period on what had become a deeply overindulgent period in American history.
Tom Petty (1989): Although this was Petty's first solo album, all of the Heartbreakers but drummer Stan Lynch played on it. Produced by Jeff Lynne, it contains some of Petty's biggest hits, including "I Won't Back Down," "Running Down a Dream" and the majestic "Free Fallin'."
Don Henley (1989): Henley shifted priorities from decadent rock star to socially aware crusader sometime in the '80s, and on his best album, he chronicles the effects of eight years of Reaganomics on his struggling Everyman. He catalogs matters of the heart too, but the pained title track sums up the decade's dashed dreams.
Aerosmith (1989): After spending the first half of the '80s barely visible, Aerosmith staged a comeback with 1987's 'Permanent Vacation.' But it's 1989's 'Pump' that sealed it. The slickly produced but hook-stuffed album kicked off the band's most commercially successful era, culminating in multiple chart-topping hits.
Bob Dylan (1989): Dylan gave in to worry, seeming to rebuke everything he'd preached on hope-filled albums like 'Saved' - not to mention his goofball turns with the Traveling Wilburys. The result was a late-period classic, governed by producer Daniel Lanois' atmospheric process.
Motley Crue (1989): Already riding an impressive streak of multi-platinum albums, Motley Crue really buckled down for their fifth album. They got sober and brought in producer Bob Rock to tighten up their songs and pump up their sound. Their hard work was rewarded with five hit singles and the biggest-selling album of their career.
Neil Young (1989): The artistic reemergence hinted at on Neil Young's rootsy 1988 return to Reprise, ‘This Note’s for You,’ was realized a year later with ‘Freedom’ - his most varied, most topical, most complete work since the ’70s.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s son Babil posted an unseen video of his father enjoying pani-puri at a restaurant and fans soon started missing the legendary actor. Irrfan was captured enjoying a hearty meal in the video which Babil had captioned, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.” Fans of the actor flooded the post with emotional comments, expressing grief and strength to the late actor’s family.
Irrfan Khan passed away on Wednesday after a battle with neuroendocrine cancer for over two years. In a gratitude note, the actor’s wife Sutapa expressed that it was not a loss but a gain of the things that he taught them. She shared, “How can I write this as a family statement when the whole world is taking it as a personal loss? How can I begin to feel alone when millions are grieving with us at the moment? I want to assure everyone that this is not a loss, it is a gain. It’s a gain of the things he taught us, and now we shall finally begin to truly implement it and evolve. Yet I want to try to fill in the things that people don’t already know. Funnily, our life was a masterclass in acting, so when the dramatic entry of the ‘uninvited guests’ happened, I had by then learnt, to see a harmony in the cacophony. The doctor’s reports were like scripts which I wanted to perfect, so I never miss any detail that he sought for in his performance. We met some amazing people in this journey and the list is endless, but there are some whom I have to mention, our oncologist Dr. Nitesh Rohtogi (Max hospital Saket) who held our hand in the beginning, Dr. Dan Krell (UK), Dr. Shidravi (UK), my heartbeat and my lantern in the dark Dr. Sevanti Limaye (Kokilaben hospital).”
“I see my little family, in a boat, with both my sons Babil and Ayaan, paddling it forward, with Irrfan guiding them ‘wahan nahi, yahan se modo’ but since life is not cinema and there are no retakes, I sincerely wish my children sail this boat safely with their father’s guidance in mind and rockabye through the storm,” Sutapa added in the note.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irrfan Khan’s Son Babil Shares Throwback Video Of Actor Eating Pani Puri & It Will Bring A Smile On Your Face</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan left a gaping hole in not just Bollywood, but in world cinema as a whole! While fans were shattered when news broke out of the Maqbool actor passing away, it was his family who mourns the most. While the late actor’s wife
wrote an emotional letter on the actor’s demise, his son Babil too shared his heartfelt condolences.
But today, Babil has taken to his social media handle to share yet another post of his father and the veteran Irrfan Khan. While Khan looks content in the video as he relishes Pani Puri at a fancy restaurant, we can’t stop our tears from flowing.
Babil took to his Instagram handle to share the video with a caption that read, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.”
Fans of Irrfan Khan are however heartbroken as they see this video with some of the commenting,” For a second mujhe laga jaise he is there. Kuch hua hi na ho (feels like nothing ever happened). Love and power to sutapa ji, you and Ayan.”
Meanwhile, Babil also took to his social media handle to thank all the fans of the late Irrfan Khan for their prayers and condolences. He wrote on his Instagram story, “I’m deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although I hope you understand that right now I’m not being able to reply because my vocabolary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much. I love you.”
Irrfan Khan had a long and painful battle against cancer to which he eventually succumbed yesterday at the Kokilaben Ambani hospital, where he was admitted for a colon infection.
On the professional front, Irrfan Khan was last seen in Angrezi Medium alongside Kareena Kapoor Khan, Deepak Dobriyal, Radhika Madan, and Dimple Kapadia in pivotal roles. The Indian Cinema gem was one of the few actors to be a part of several Oscar-winning films.
Our heart reaches out to Irrfan Khan’s family and may God bless them with strength and courage to deal with these difficult days.

One of the incredible actors of Bollywood Irrfan Khan has left us for the heavenly abode.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The demise of one of the Hindi film industry's iconic actors, Rishi Kapoor, has left a void that many in the industry are struggling to cope with. Tributes and condolences are pouring in from his colleagues in the industry. The younger generation in Bollywood is grateful to Rishi for being the inspiration and loving guide that he was.
Hrithik Roshan took to his Instagram handle to write a lengthy note about how much impact Rishi Kapoor had on his life. Hrithik shared the touching tribute along with a candid photo of him, Rishi and Neetu Kapoor. Take a look.
"Even your love had so much energy that I had to stand at attention every time you called. .I don't think I have ever in my life been able to continue sitting down when you spoke to me .," started Hrithik.
He continued, "Everytime dad called and said "chintu uncle just saw your movie and he is calling you ", I used to get up, heart palpitating and start walking around in the room , preparing myself for the deluge of love and reprimand mixed so genuinely together in your own inimitable way that it was difficult for an observer to distinguish which was which. You gave me strength at my weakest moments. It felt so god damn amazing to think that Rishi Kapoor liked my work. That It made me believe in myself."
He further wrote, "Thank you for every time you picked up the phone and took the effort , thank you for repeatedly pointing out my mistakes , thank you for that consistent support and encouragement chintu uncle, there will never be any actor or human like you. Thank you for being my childhood , for literally shouting out loud into my ear drums about the importance of hard work. And for being so blatantly and ridiculously honest that it made me believe every single word you ever said . I and the world and everyone you touched and inspired is going to miss you. So so much . ❤️" (sic).
Hrithik shared screen space with Rishi in the 2012 film Agneepath, which was directed by Karan Malhotra and produced by Dharma Productions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Voice contestants team up for charity single after live final cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The contestants of The Voice have banded together following the postponement of the live finals to release a new charity single in aid of the NHS.
Earlier this year, ITV made the decision to put the live shows of the hit singing contest on hold until later in the year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
And now one of the groups of the competition, harmonisers Belle Noir, have rounded up all the finalists to sing a rendition of Stevie Wonder's classic As and set up a Just Giving page where fans can make donations to NHS Charities Together.
The singers have also recorded a music video of them all singing from their respective homes, with the finalists vocals blending together to produce impressive harmonies and top notes.
Explaining their decision to instigate the fundraises, Belle Noir said: “We are using our voices to raise money for the NHS and NHS Charities Together because we want to recognise the brilliant work of the NHS.”
The video and charity work have proved a hit with fans who took to Belle Noir’s Instagram page to congratulate the team on using music for a good cause.
One fan wrote: “Awesome work @bellenoirband! Amazing.”
While others praised the song choice for the cover, with one commenting: “Aaahhh yes! What a song."
And another typing: “Yes!!!!! Tuuuuune!” alongside fire, rainbow and heart emojis.
Show bosses of The Voice opted to halt live shows before they began back in March – before the UK government introduced lockdown procedures.
A show spokesperson said the decision had been made in order to "keep everyone as safe and secure as possible".
And now a source has told The Sun that the new charity single will boost spirits for those who just missed out being able to sing during the live rounds.
They said: "The postponement of the series caused quite a bit of anxiety among the contestants still in the competition.
"The live shows were so close, and now who knows how long they'll have to wait until they can compete again.
"The acts on the show formed a close bond and decided they wanted to do something to raise money for the NHS, in the hope that at the same time it would raise the semi-finalists' spirits."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Queen releases ‘You Are The Champions’ for healthcare workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rock band Queen and singer Adam Lambert are raising money for health workers fighting COVID-19 with new single You Are The Champions, an updated version of classic hit We Are The Champions recorded on mobile phones under lockdown.
The track is for “all those in the frontline, all around the world… the people who are risking their lives to save us and save our families,” guitarist Brian May told Reuters in a video conference call interview from his home in London.
The single came to life when May posted a video online of himself playing his part, inviting the public to jam. He then urged drummer Roger Taylor and Lambert, who tours with the band in the place of late singer Freddie Mercury, to join in.
The band discussed whether to update the lyrics. In the end, Lambert swapped in “you” for “we” in the final verse, and left the rest of the words unchanged. It was an unusual move for Queen to alter even a single word of a classic song written by Mercury more than 40 years ago.
“But I think this is the type of event that warranted such a change. And it really, because it’s such a well-known title, changing that one word makes a huge impact,” Lambert told Reuters from his home in Los Angeles.
The lyrics still stand as the ideal anthem for the fight against coronavirus, he added: “It’s really a song about overcoming obstacles. It’s a song about, you know, defying the odds. And I think that’s what we’re doing right now.”
Taylor’s wife filmed him adding drums from his home in the English county of Cornwall. He listened to May’s track on headphones and played along while watching on a computer.
“It was quite tricky because Brian was just playing without a metronome or anything,” Taylor confided to Reuters.
The musicians and Mercury’s estate are donating their proceeds to a World Health Organization fund for health workers. The music video shows footage of frontline workers around the world, including Taylor’s daughter, Dr Rory Taylor, a family doctor in West London.
“People feel it in themselves,” May said of Mercury’s song. “They feel this challenge. They want to be the best. They want to win. And the song just has it. So it’s become a wonderful way of expressing triumph and determination in the face of something very difficult.”
The band was meant to be on the road now but had to postpone a 27-date UK and European tour. May said it was “heartbreaking” to call off shows after fans bought 400,000 tickets, and the band hopes to reschedule for next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nathan Carter and Brian Kennedy on lockdown and teaming up for charity song</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">INSTEAD of trekking the country singing to thousands of fans, musicians too are stuck at home during this coronavirus pandemic.
However, Enniskillen-based country star Nathan Carter has used the power of music to help both his own mental health and to remind everyone of the importance of self-isolating.
Used to a busy life on the road, Nathan has never spent so much time at home. After reading an article from Fr Brian D’Arcy, where he mentioned that someone should really write a song for this time, he worked with manager and co-writer John Farry to write a response to the pandemic.
And with the help of a few friends from the Irish music industry, the result was #StayAtHomeStayAlive, which can be downloaded to raise money to buy personal protective clothing and equipment for NHS and HSE staff.
The accompanying video features Nathan and the other artists: Brian Kennedy, Johnny Logan, Chloe Agnew, Tommy Fleming and Sean Keane, in their own homes, as well as some of the brave frontline staff working tirelessly to keep us all safe.
“We are all in awe of the work people are doing to keep us safe, so it was so important to include them in the video,” says Nathan, admitting that the project helped give him a focus and a “reason to get out of bed in the morning” again.
“To be honest, I've been pretty bored the past few weeks. I've been pottering about the house doing jobs and chores – cutting the grass, painting fences and jet washing – but to get back to doing a project like this was great for me.”
The opening lyrics say ‘I never thought I'd see the day; when I can't shake your hand’ and Nathan, who has shaken thousands of fans' hands over the years, admits: “I think we're all going to be a little bit different after all of this is over."
“Social distancing will probably linger on for a long time, but I’m hoping they will find a vaccine and the people in the music industry can get back to enjoying what we do and bringing music to people.”
The experience has made Nathan, who is self-isolating with his brother and fellow singer Jake, re-evaluate his own life.
“This time has made me realise I'm away too much and in the future I will alter my work-life balance,” says Nathan who has been keeping in touch with his family back home in Liverpool on FaceTime.
“I think I’ve seen and spoken to them more in the past month, than I have in the past 10 years,” he laughs.
Grateful for the sunny weather, he has been enjoying taking his daily exercise in the Fermanagh countryside. “I try to do a few miles on the bike every day.”
And he’s also used the downtime to pen some new songs. “I've written three or four songs and I've just got some new recording equipment for the house.”
For Belfast-born singer-songwriter Brian Kennedy, this time of self-isolation is strangely familiar, as in the past couples of years he has battled and recovered from rectal cancer.
“I more than most, have a deep understanding of the tremendous work doctors and nurses do. They are ordinary workers who have their own lives and families that they need to protect and get back to," he says.
“Having been through six months of chemo and stays in hospitals in both London and Dublin, I’ve seen how selfless, caring and optimistic these people are. I call them an army of angels.”
He is delighted to have been asked to sing in #StayAtHomeStayAlive and spread this important message of staying at home.
“As a musician you are taken back when people come up to you and tell you your song really got them through an illness or a death or something. During this pandemic us musicians have all been feeling a bit useless, so it was amazing to do this song together.”
He was amazed at how quick and simply the song was put together, and at the quality of the finished project.
“I recorded my voice by singing into the little built-in microphone on my phone. For once technology is on our side,” adds Brian, who recently took part in an online concert for the suicide prevention charity Pieta House.
The video features him sitting in the stunning music room in his Dublin home.
“One of the things I did after getting home from hospital was to treat myself by buying a really beautiful old piano. The music room is a space where I can come in and work on songs and write.
“I hang my guitars on the walls here and take them down when I need them. I have all kinds of memorabilia on the walls such as posters from Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell, George Best things and platinum discs.”
“An upside of this pandemic is that as well as baking sourdough bread, I had time to re-alphabetise my CD collection.”
I couldn’t help but pry further into Brian's eclectic collection and ask him what the first and the last CDs in it were. “My first is an album by Engine Alley and the last one is Neil Young's Harvest.”
Brian, who also has asthma, confesses that the pandemic has been a worrying time for him.
“A few weeks ago I did have a fever and sore head for about two days, but overnight it disappeared. I didn't feel the need to go to the GP and never had a sore throat, but maybe I did have it?
“As someone who has had a cancer journey I’m conscious that my immune system has been seriously compromised and I’m taking extra care to avoid infection. I go shopping once a week, but it’s like a military exercise. I know exactly where I'm going and exactly what I'm buying and I wear protection.”
He has also been keeping in touch with his brother Stuart, who lives in Belfast, about the health of his parents, Elizabeth and Jimmy, who both reside in a west Belfast care home.
“It’s an extraordinary situation, where no-one is allowed to visit them. There was a great concern as some of the residents had succumbed to Covid-19. But my parents have been tested and don’t have it.”
Brian has also shot a new piece of video at home for Things is Going to Change, the duet he sings with Boy George on his new album.
“Once again the lyrics are so eerily pertinent to this time,” he adds.
So what is he looking forward to most when normality hopefully returns?
“Just a really delicious, slow lunch with my nearest and dearest in Dublin.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gorillaz have released their latest single, “How Far?” as a tribute to the late Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, who features on the song along with Skepta. Allen died last Thursday and was a pioneer of the Afrobeat genre, drumming with Fela Kuti for 15 years. Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn was Allen’s bandmate in the supergroup Good, the Bad and the Queen, as well as a close friend and collaborator on other projects like Rocket Juice & the Moon. Albarn tweeted out a short video of Allen performing in concert captioned “There is no end,” following news of Allen’s death. “The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” the band shared in a press release. “How Far?” is the latest single in the band’s “Song Machine” series.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gorillaz have paid homage to Tony Allen with a new song called “How Far.” The track features the late drummer, as well as English rapper Skepta.
“The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” Gorillaz wrote in a statement.
The band also shared some inspiring words from the Afrobeat pioneer: “I want to take care of youngsters, they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat.”
Listen to “How Far” below.
Allen passed away on Thursday (April 30) at the age of 79. He was known for his work with Fela Kuti, and in his later years became a frequent collaborator and good friend to Gorillaz’ Damon Albarn. The two made music together as The Good, The Bad & The Queen, along with The Clash bassist Paul Simonon.
He also drummed on a project called Rocket Juice & The Moon with Albarn and Flea. The Red Hot Pepper bassist wrote a touching tribute to Allen on Instagram after hearing of his death. He called him his “hero” and “one of the greatest drummers to ever walk this earth.”

The world of music faced another tragic death this week after it was announced that legendary Afropop drummer Tony Allen passed away. Allen was revolutionary in helping pioneer the Afrobeats sound, though his musical resume expanded into other genres. Allen and Gorillaz' Damon Albarn were also in the supergroup The Good, the Bad and the Queen together that dabbled into rock, reggae, and dub.
In tribute to Allen, Gorillaz released their new single, "How Far?" which features Tony Allen and Skepta. The song was recorded in recent times, prior to the global lockdown. "The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” it reads in a press release.
Allen died this week after suffering a heart attack. He worked closely with Fela Kuti who said that "without Tony Allen, there would be no afrobeat".
Check out the track below. RIP Tony Allen.
Quotable LyricsMore money, more problems and more ladiesEveryday somebody dies, still mothers give birth to more babiesThe earth spins, the world gets more crazyYou got to have a suit for the ChristeningA suit for the wedding and a suit for the court caseProbably wear the same suit to the funeralTryna see the bigger picture, man it's bigger than the portrait

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor’s demise has put people across the country in a state of shock. The actor spent most of last year in New York undergoing cancer treatment and when he made his return to India, people felt that things were going back to normal. However, the sudden turn of events have left fans of cinema absolutely devastated.
Neeetu Kapoor is someone who’s always been by his side through the ups and downs in life. We cannot even imagine the pain she’s going through right now but instead of being in a constant state of grief, the former is actress celebrating Rishi Kapoor’s life in typical Rishi Kapoor fashion. Earlier today, Neetu Kapoor took to social media and shared a picture of Rishi Kapoor where he’s seen lifting a drink with a smile on his face. Neetu Kapoor’s caption for the picture read, “End Of Our Story”. Take a look at the picture below.
Even though we might not see Rishi Kapoor on the big screen again, his contribution to Bollywood will always remain in our hearts. He was a true legend in every sense and shall never be forgotten.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There’s something common in reactions to Ranbir Kapoor’s jeans, Brexit and Khan Market gang</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Among the many reactions to actor Rishi Kapoor’s cremation Thursday, one caught my attention. Ritu Rathaur, who calls herself a “Himachali Thakurian and Civilizational Hindu”, criticised Ranbir Kapoor for wearing ‘torn’ jeans to his father’s cremation.
Two things stand out. One is the obvious poor taste of the tweet and how it ignores that the Kapoor family was asked by the authorities to go straight from the hospital to the crematorium in view of the lockdown, so obviously Ranbir couldn’t change his clothes, even in the unlikely event that clothes were uppermost on his mind on the day his father died. The second is the word “deracination”.
Deracination means a removal or separation from one’s native environment or culture, especially in terms of racial or ethnic identity, but the way it is used in India, it is less about race and far more about religion, language and clothes.
In India, if you don’t engage with religion and religious customs (and particularly the majoritarian ones), you are called deracinated, because you obviously don’t understand your ‘culture’ and ‘roots’.
The use of the word in India assumes that anyone who is liberal, who speaks and thinks in English, who dresses in Western clothes and isn’t concerned with a narrow and surface-level concept of Indianness, is deracinated. Anyone who talks about global issues and human rights instead of muscular nationalism is not in touch with ‘real India’. Never mind that there are many Indias, each of them equally real and valid — the English-educated liberal elite’s Indianness doesn’t get invalidated because of their privilege, and the white kurta-wearing funeral attendee isn’t more desi than someone who wears jeans, ripped or not.
It is also a lazy pejorative because, as sociologist Shiv Visvanathan told ThePrint, “When we in India talk about deracination, we are talking of a very superficial way of looking at a person’s Indianness. It’s a failure of our use of language, we didn’t look at the root of the word before using it to describe someone who is just more cosmopolitan.”
It is the same narrow logic that compelled many people, in June 2015, to make snarky comments about why Indians were celebrating when the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, and the same argument that is dredged up every four years when someone questions on social media why Indians care who becomes the US president. Because, you know, real Indians should only be concerned with what happens in our country.
It is also the same narrow logic behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s use of the term ‘Khan Market gang’ to describe the capital’s elite class, epitomised by the Nehru-Gandhi family, whose ideas of secularism and diversity, and cosmopolitan, outward-looking ways are at odds with the Right’s obsession with the glories of our (Hindu) past.
In a 2017 article, the BJP’s National General Secretary, Ram Madhav (who also, in 2019, criticised the “pseudo-secular/liberal cartels of Khan Market”), wrote that India’s native genius “is rooted in its religio-social institutions like state, family, caste, guru and festival”, adding that at the time of Independence, conflict arose between a “colonised” Nehru and a Gandhi more attached to native wisdom. “Nehru sought to take the country in the direction of the ideas he had inherited from the colonial masters and from his personal experience in Europe. The crucial formative years after independence were thus dominated by a western liberal discourse that had very little Indian content,” Madhav wrote.
Incidentally, after the BJP’s victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Madhav took party workers out for a celebration – to Khan Market.
R. Jagannathan, editorial director of Swarajya magazine, says a deracinated Indian is someone whose “mind is almost entirely driven by the English language”. He told ThePrint, “When you think and express yourself in a regional language, you are far more rooted. Not that one can paint everyone with the same brush, but yes, someone who is mentally colonised by the English language is broadly what I would call deracinated. Of course, English is an Indian language, but it should be used only for looking outward. Forcing it as the language with which to look inwards, at regional issues, is problematic.”

In his book, The Road to Somewhere: The Populist Revolt and The Future of Politics, British writer and social commentator David Goodhart divides people into Somewheres (those who are deeply rooted in a certain ethnic, linguistic, religious, geographical community and geography, typically conservative, often not well-educated, and wedded to homogeneity) and Anywheres (urban, well-educated, well-travelled, at home anywhere in the world).
Goodhart uses these terms to explain, and justify, the demand for Brexit in the UK, citing the sense of threat to their identity that the Somewheres feel due to immigrants, despite the fact that they are in a majority over the Anywheres.
The terms can easily be transplanted to India, with the whole ‘Hindu khatre mein hai’ narrative of the BJP. In India, the Anywheres are also in a minority, but they do hold some sway over public thought, be it in the media, in cinema, literature, big business or the civil services. And yes, they do need to confront the fact that there is a disenchantment with them that has led to Narendra Modi’s consecutive landslide electoral victories.
It is not enough to just call all the Somewheres bigots and cocoon oneself in a bubble. It is also not enough to call all the Anywheres deracinated and out of touch with reality and cocoon oneself in that bubble.
It is similar to the fear thatthe institutions of marriage and family are breaking down – but why is every change seen as bad? Marriage as it stood, as a patriarchal construct, was in need of a breakdown and overhaul to accommodate a changed gender dynamic. Family was a very narrow idea, and the nuclear unit, and now live-in partners, are changing that and it’s a good thing. These upheavals are not threats. These are signs that something that needed to change is finally changing.
To go back to the attack on Ranbir Kapoor’s clothes, Visvanathan says that “the Kapoor family actually carries the tradition of the ‘deracinated’ Indian, what with bringing to India the idea of Charlie Chaplin, the proletariat and clown, as the hero. Rishi Kapoor also always carried himself with ease, didn’t take himself too seriously, and it’s the same with Ranbir. The Kapoors did not adhere to standard nationalist models, they broke stereotypes”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In photos: Irrfan on the sets of Vishal Bhardwaj’s ‘7 Khoon Maaf’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was January 2010. We landed in Gulmarg straight from Bombay in our canvas sneakers for the first night’s shoot of 7 Khoon Maaf.
I will always remember it as the coldest night of my life as we shot in knee-deep snow, all night, completely unprepared.
What kept us going through that freezing night was the magic unfolding before us – Vishal Bhardwaj directing the magnificently talented Irrfan and Priyanka Chopra in a very dark and psychological scene.
This duo of Vishal-Irrfan had created cinematic magic before with Maqbool, and it was an honour for me to see their incredible chemistry.
We shot in Kashmir for 10 days.
This was my second film with Vishal as a still photographer, but the only time I worked with Irrfan. He played Waseeullah, an intense, brooding poet. Irrfan’s deep-set eyes and quiet intensity did perfect justice to the part.
Crowds would throng our shoot to catch a glimpse of him and Priyanka Chopra.
Irrfan was a pleasure to follow through my lens and I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to make some memorable images of him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irrfan always saw a rhythm in everything, even in chaos: Sutapa Sikdar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two days after the death of Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan, his wife Sutapa Sikdar on Friday released a heartbreaking statement.
Looking back at her life with Irrfan Khan, Sutapa said, “It’s difficult to explain what a wondrous, beautiful, overwhelming, painful and exciting this journey has been. I find this 2 and 1/2 years to have been an interlude, which had it’s own beginning, middle and culmination with Irrfan helming the role of the orchestra conductor, separate from the 35 years of our companionship, ours was not a marriage, it was a union.”
“How can I write this as a family statement when the whole world is taking it as a personal loss? How can I begin to feel alone when millions are grieving with us at the moment? I want to assure everyone that this is not a loss, it is a gain. It’s a gain of the things he taught us, and now we shall finally begin to truly implement it and evolve. Yet I want to try to fill in the things that people don’t already know.
It’s unbelievable for us but I would put it in Irrfan’s words, “it’s magical” whether he is there or not there, and that’s what he loved, he never loved one dimensional reality. The only thing I have a grudge against him is; he has spoiled me for life. His strive for perfection doesn’t let me settle for ordinary in anything. There was a rhythm which he always saw in everything, even in cacophony and chaos, so I have learnt to sing and dance to the music of that rhythm, even with my tone-deaf voice and two left feet. Funnily, our life was a masterclass in acting, so when the dramatic entry of the “uninvited guests” happened, I had by then learnt to see a harmony in the cacophony. The doctor’s reports were like scripts which I wanted to perfect, so I never miss any detail that he sought for in his performance. We met some amazing people in this journey and the list is endless, but there are some whom I have to mention, our oncologist Dr. Nitesh Rohtogi (Max hospital Saket) who held our hand in the beginning, Dr. Dan Krell (UK), Dr. Shidravi (UK), my heartbeat and my lantern in the dark Dr. Sevanti Limaye (Kokilaben hospital). It’s difficult to explain what a wondrous, beautiful, overwhelming, painful and exciting this journey has been. I find this 2 and 1/2 years to have been an interlude, which had it’s own beginning, middle and culmination with Irrfan helming the role of the orchestra conductor, separate from the 35 years of our companionship, ours was not a marriage, it was a union. I see my little family, in a boat, with both my sons Babil and Ayaan, paddling it forward, with Irrfan guiding them “wahan nahi, yahan se modo” but since life is not cinema and there are no retakes, I sincerely wish my children sail this boat safely with their father’s guidance in mind and rockabye through the storm. I asked my children, if possible, they could sum up a lesson taught by their father that has been important to them;
Babil: ’Learn to surrender to the dance of uncertainty and trust your faith in the universe”Ayaan: “Learn to control your mind and to not let it control you.”
Tears will flow as we will plant a raat ki rani tree, his favourite, to the place where you have put him to rest after a victorious journey. It takes time but it will bloom and the fragrance will spread and touch all the souls whom I won’t call them fans but family for years to come.”
Irrfan Khan’s elder son Babil had on Thursday posted a note in his Instagram stories, thanking friends for their love.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The news of Rishi Kapoor's death is yet to sink in. After battling leukemia for two years, the evergreen star passed away on April 30 and left fans across the globe shattered. The film industry too, is deeply saddened by Rishi's passing away.
Filmmaker Umesh Shukla, who worked with the veteran star in films like 102 Not Out and All Is Well, says it was devastating for him not being able to pay his last respects to the actor amid the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown.
He was quoted as saying by IANS, "It is devastating that we couldn't even go. The sight of seeing the van going away was shocking," Shukla told IANS while talking about being unable to attend Rishi Kapoor's last rites."
He further added, "He was a great friend and a great brother, and we had a great memory shooting two films together. He was a great person."
Contrary to Kapoor's widely believed intimidating image, Shukla revealed that he was "not at all intimidating."
"He was very sorted, passionate, intense and subtle as an actor. He was spontaneous, too. These are rare qualities to find in an actor. Even if he was essaying a passive character, he would stand out," he told the news agency.
Rishi Kapoor's demise comes a day after Irrfan Khan's death sent shock waves across the world.
"Upar koi badi film bann rahii hogi, jismein do best actor chaiyeh honge industry ke (A big film must be in development in heaven, for which they needed two of the best actors of the industry)," Shukla said.
Earlier, the filmmaker lauded Rishi's acting prowess and was quoted as saying by a daily, "Rishiji was so good. He never carried his characters with him. He would be his character in one second, and Rishi Kapoor in the next second. It was so easy for him to get in and out of character. I would wonder how he does it. Once he is dressed as his character, he would be that person in a split second. He was magic. He truly was magic."
He called Rishi's demise a huge loss for the film fraternity and added, "It is a huge loss. He always said that his second innings was much better than the first one. He would say that in his first innings, he always roamed around trees and sang songs on mountains wearing sweaters. Whereas, he was happy that he was getting good meaty characters in his second innings. He would tell us, 'This is my best time, and I want to make the best of it.' I have never seen anyone enjoy their work as much as he did."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Too Hot To Handle's David Birtwistle exposes show's secret bromance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Too Hot To Handle David Birtwistlehas revealed that he and three of the boys forged a sweet bromance during their time on the Netflix show in deleted scenes.
Although the series saw a bunch of stunning singletons thrown together in a paradise location in Mexico and banned from sexual activities, audiences didn’t get a glimpse at the lads as they poured open their hearts to one another every morning.
Speaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk about what didn’t make it to the final cut, David spilled: ‘Something that happened almost every morning was me, Sharron [Townsend], Kelz [Dyke] and Matt [Smith] would get together in after breakfast and talk.
‘We called it “The Three Wise Men and Jesus”.
‘We’d basically chat through the stuff that had been going on the day before and effectively we created this group where we could openly discuss our feelings, chat about what was going on, process the things that were happening like the relationship and group dynamics.’
David continued: ‘It was a really refreshing thing because most guys don’t do that.
‘To be able to sit and talk for an hour or two in a group of men without judgement, without worry, that was something that was really beneficial for all of us, which really didn’t make much of it in the show.’
It’s recently been announced that the Netflix hit will also be getting a follow-up episode after its worldwide success, so we’ll soon get to see the cast back in action.
Francesca Farago and Harry Jowsey, of course, are still seeing each other after their on-again, off-again relationship during the programme, while Bryce Hirschberg and Nicole O’Brien have sparked up a little romance.
Too Hot To Handle is available to stream on Netflix.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent saw some pretty weird performances this evening, from a dancing Princess Leia to dancing turtles to a dancing crab.
Kath and Joe, from Salford, have tried their hand at BGT twice before - as a singing-dancing double act, the pair get dressed up as Disney characters for all their performances.
They've previously done Beauty and the Beast, as well as Frozen, and as soon as they came on stage recognition dawned on the judges' faces.
But Amanda made a blunder that the Internet didn't take lightly.
This year, they were having a go as Ariel and Sebastian the Crab from the Little Mermaid.
Simon wasn't convinced by the act, and when he asked Amanda to explain it she called Sebastian (Joe) a "lobster."
Disney fans took to social media after the blunder.
One wrote: "Amanda thinking sebastian from the little mermaid was a lobster..."
Another shared a gif Sebastian telling Ariel: "The human world is a mess!"
David meanwhile described the act as "erotic", one fan laughing: "This sums up #BGT. Amanda: I thought he was a lobster. David: I found ir highly erotic."
The duo gave each other a hug after their performance, and earned even more support from the audience.
"Katherine, you're not a bad singer," said Simon, who'd buzzed them.
Amanda added: "Joe, your tap dancing was furious. You never stopped moving!"
David even called them "the spirit of Britain's Got Talent."
They managed to get three yeses, putting them through to next week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Francesca Farago Thinks This Scene With Harry Jowsey Didn't Make it Into Too Hot to Handle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Francesca Farago and Harry Jowsey were two of the stars on Netflix's hit series Too Hot to Handle. They left the show, which was filmed more than a year ago, as a couple, and with the exception of a short break, they are together today. But, like every reality show, THTH left some good stuff on the cutting room floor, especially where Farago and Jowsey are concerned. In a BuzzFeed video, Farago answered all of fans' "burning questions" about the show, including which scene she wishes Neflix hadn't cut.
"The one thing that I was hoping to see was when Harry asked me to be his girlfriend—it was the night we lost the $20,000—but I think we were naked when that happened ... [and] obviously they can't air [us being] naked when he was asking me to be his girlfriend," she said. "[I wish that] made it, but it's probably a good thing that it didn't make it."
When Farago refers to the "night [they] lost the 20,000," she means the night she and her boyfriend had sex and cost the whole group a significant portion of their collective $100,000 prize. Sorry for the spoilers, but if you haven't watched at this point, then are you ever really going to watch? The pair was able to win back all the money they lost by spending one night together without having sex.
The pair also cost their co-stars $6,000 when they Farago appeared to give Jowsey a blow job under the covers.
"We wanted to make it acceptable to break the rules so that we would have a show, but we also didn’t want to be too much about the money...We felt that $20,000 for sex was big enough, but it was those middle ground things that were a big debate. We eventually settled on $6,000 [for oral sex], but I think that was a bit cheap, as well," Viki Kolar told TheWrap.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of The Wedding Planner are about to be reminded why the movie is so damn great.
Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey fell in love onscreen in the romantic comedy, and anyone that's ever wished they'd return for a sequel should prepare themselves. In a new Twitter exchange, McConaghey and Lopez hinted that they loved making the movie, so there's most definitely hope of a reunion.
During the weekly series, McConaughey Takes, the Oscar winner revealed how he got involved in the movie. He said, "Jennifer was already cast, they were looking for the male lead. I think we were coming up against a writers strike. So, what that means is the issue was trying to get as many movies made as quickly as possible… the industry needed content." As a result, the actor was able to negotiate a great deal to play the part of Dr. Steve Edison in The Wedding Planner.

As for working with Hustlers icon J.Lo, McConaughey said, "I’ve always called her a quad threat. What does she not do? That girl works her backside off on everything. She does not just show up and wing it at all. She’s like clockwork. Just hammers it and knocks it out."
Lopez was clearly thrilled by McConaughey's endorsement, as she retweeted his video, and wrote, "@McConaughey let’s do it again soon!" She ended her tweet with a winking emoji and sparkles.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phillip Schofield's dramatic hairstyle after moving out of home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When he's not presenting This Morning, Phillip Schofield is trying out a number of new hairstyles - to varying degrees of success.
The 58-year-old has been posting her new looks on social media, as his usual short spiky hair has become rather long due to lockdown.
Earlier this week, Phil revealed he was struggling with his wild hair before going live on TV.
But today he managed to tame his unruly locks, reports OK.
In one snap, the much-loved host showed off his messy silver locks while pulling a funny expression, next to a much smarter look where his hair is pushed back with gel.
Alongside the photo, he wrote: “Lockdown hair options.”
It comes after Phillip revealed how frustrated he was becoming over being unable to keep his signature hair short and stylish.
The presenter showed things are far from glamorous for him outside the set of the ITV daytime show as he posted the honest snap to his story.
Phillip’s photo is a screenshot of him on his Apple Mac computer after a Skype video call with his mum, Pat.
The snap shows Phillip wearing a blue t-shirt, and his cheeky expression reflects his amusement at his hair, which is strikingly different to how This Morning fans are used to seeing it on TV.
His silver fox locks are standing on their ends in different directions, giving a true bed head look.
He wrote above the image: “Skype’d my mum, my hair made her jump”.
Later, on Snapchat, Phillip, who was recently pictured arriving at the London flat he is staying at after moving out of family home, admitted he isn’t a fan of the messy look.
As he shared a close up photo of the unkempt do, he placed a cartoon pair of scissors, revealing his desperation for a haircut.
Phillip then revealed how fed up he was getting of his hair as he wrote above the picture: “This is getting ridiculous”.
As he shared the photo on his Instagram story, Phillip revealed his messy hairdo gave his mum quite the shock during their video call.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phillip Schofield debuts new lockdown hair</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield is lauded for his silver-fox locks, but he's struggling without access to a hair stylist.
Like many of us, his hair has grown a lot since salons were forced to close a month ago - and it's got a little wild.
He revealed this week that he'd been in touch with his mum, who was shocked by the state of his barnet.
So now he's been experimenting and has created a new slicked-back look.
He shared a side-by-side shot of the results next to his wilder style and captioned the Instagram post: "Lockdown hair options."
One fan remarked: "Is that like Tom Hardy vs Boris Johnson?" while another made the comparison of "Richard Gere V Freddie Boswell"!
Another said: "I feel the pain."
A third advised: "Cut it all offfffffff."
Phillip Schofield has been working hard to keep the nation entertained during lockdown, as he and co-star Holly Willoughby host This Morning from the studio.
It is understood that Phil is staying at his new apartment in central London, having moved out of the family home in Oxfordshire.
Aside from his trips to the studio, he's confined to indoors like the rest of us and lockdown appears to be having a similar effect on him!
Yesterday he shared a clip of him watching a bunch of animated mouths stretched out and warbling!
"Yes Phil!" said one follower. "I'm laughing like crazy!"
Another commented: "Any other time I'd say to you that perhaps you need to get out more."
A third asked: "Should we be scared?"
Someone else put: "What has quarantine done to people?"
"What was that all about?" asked a fifth puzzled follower.
"That's just weird," wrote another.
"Kinda weird, not going to lie," another said.
Whatever gets us all through, we say!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phillip Schofield has given up on lockdown routine as he shows off unruly hair</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has given up on his usual styling routines like the rest of us and showed off his new hair.
The This Morning host debuted his unruly mane, looking rather similar to Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown from Back To The Future.
Sharing a side-by-side picture to his Instagram, the 58-year-old captioned the post: ‘Lockdown hair options.’
One of the photos had Phillip slick his hair back with gel and all he’s missing is a tuxedo.
Of course, the snap had to be black and white to add to the suave effect.
Fans found the two styles hilarious, leaving jokes under his post.
One fan made the perfect comparison, stating: ‘Is that like Tom Hardy vs Boris Johnson.’
However, some weren’t too appreciative of the slicked back look, writing: ‘Deffo the second look!😂😂’
Or maybe this comparison is more accurate: ‘Richard Gere V Freddie Boswell 🤣 ❤️ u Phil.’
The talk show host has been isolating in his new flat, after being spotted moving out of his £2 million family home after coming out as gay.
However, Phillip and Holly Willoughby continue filming This Morning from the studio.
And ITV boss Kevin Lygo has plans in place if the coronavirus pandemic ever forces the show out of ITV studios.
Holly and Phil have been equipped with expensive cameras in their respective homes so they can continue filming the day time TV show as normal.
Lygo said: ‘When it looked that lockdown was coming, I quickly went into what are our priorities here, what are the main things ITV should be doing?
‘I prioritised quite early the news and the regional news, we have to keep them on air, they must continue broadcasting for a long as possible.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart Slams ‘Cancel Culture’ And Defends Boyfriend Cole Sprouse From All The ‘Vile’ Haters Trending #ColeSprouseIsOver On Twitter!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Twitter tried to cancel Cole Sprouse, the hashtag‘#colesprouseisover’ managing to trend on the social media page! However, his girlfriend and Riverdale co-star, Lili Reinhart, was quick to come to his defense against the ‘vile’ haters!
It was also the actress’ way of slamming the whole canceling trend, her message being pretty much a PSA against it as well!
In a series of tweets that have been deleted in the meantime, Lili made it very clear that she’d like people to stop with the ‘#colesprouseisoverparty’ tweets!
She also stressed just how sick and tired she was of the whole ‘cancel culture.’
‘Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say s**t behind your f***ing phone, isn’t it? This is why people keep their relationships private… this is why people do not have social media.. because of this bullying. I don’t tolerate any of that s**t. Bully me? Sure fine. But attacking somebody for no reason, just for the sake of a f***ing twitter trend? Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you post another tweet into the abyss,’ she wrote.
And that was not all! Reinhart stressed that people really need to stop with the canceling parties as well!
After all, sometimes they just come out of nowhere with no reason, just like it happened to her man, Cole Sprouse.
‘It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them. Truth is… you do not. Saying you hate someone or do not like them gives you no power over them. You need to tweet about someone you do not know in order to feel you have something going on in your life? That is sad. It’s really f***ing sad.’
The Riverdale actress went on to tell haters that attacking people online will never help them feel validated like they’d like to.
Instead, she encouraged them to ‘be better’ and do something ‘helpful with [their] time.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart hits out at trolls 'bullying' boyfriend Cole Sprouse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lili Reinhart hit out at trolls for ‘bullying’ her boyfriend Cole Sprouse on Twitter.
The Riverdale star saw that the hashtag #ColeSprouseIsOverParty was trending and decided to call people out in a lengthy rant.
However, it looks as though the hashtag is trending for no apparent reason as many used the tag just to ask why Cole was even ‘over’.
Lili wrote in a now-deleted post: ‘Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say shit behind your f**king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying.
‘Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.
‘I refuse to keep my mouth shut about things like this. You have no idea how destructive this can be to someone. To anyone. It’s abusive. There is no excuse for this. You need god in your life or some form of help if you participate in cancel culture.’
Cole has yet to respond to the hashtag.
This incident isn’t the first time the Suite Life of Zack and Cody star has been the target of online abuse.
Cole had a massive rant about fans sending him death threats over rumours about his dating life and keeping his private life private.
Lili later appeared to add her two cents about the matter.
Taking to Twitter, she wrote: ‘Twitter is actually the most toxic form of social media. People are a**holes for the sake of being a**holes.
‘Do you not understand karma? It’s fine if you don’t, you’ll understand when it bites your miserable a**.’
While The Hustlers star also vented on Instagram too, writing: ‘Dear everyone on social media, Don’t put down people for the sake of putting them down.
‘Don’t be a f**king a**hole. The world doesn’t need anymore of that shit.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Twitter Tried to Cancel Cole Sprouse & Lili Reinhart Defended Him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No one is quite sure why Twitter tried to cancel Cole Sprouse this week, but his girlfriend Lili Reinhart is not having it.
The actress took to Twitter to post a series of tweets, which have since been deleted, to slam those who were using the #ColeSprouseIsOverParty hashtag.
“Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say sh-t behind your f–king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying,” Lili wrote in a tweet that was since deleted.
“I don’t tolerate any of that s–t. Bully me? Sure fine. But attacking someone for literally no reason, just for the sake of a f–king twitter trend?” Lili continued. “Please… reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.”
“It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them,” Lili said. “Truth is… you don’t. Saying you hate someone or don’t like them gives you absolutely no power over them.”
“You need to tweet about someone you literally don’t know in order to feel like you have something going on in your life? That’s sad. It’s really f–king sad. You want to feel validated or important? Attacking someone online won’t give that to you. Do something helpful with your time and be better,” Lili concluded.
Lili and Cole, who both star on The CW’s Riverdale, have been a couple since 2017. Just a couple weeks ago, she spoke out amid rumors that they had split.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sopranos' Joe Pantoliano hospitalised after being hit by car in horror accident</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sopranos actor Joe Pantoliano was rushed to hospital on Friday after being involved in a horrifying car accident while out for a walk.
The 68-year-old American actor was thrown through the air and into a fence while his distressed family quickly called an ambulance when the incident took place in Connecticut.
Joe was struck by a Porsche which skidded out of control across the street before smashing into another car, according to TMZ.
The actor’s wife, former model Nancy Sheppard, gave an eyewitness account but also explained she thinks her husband will make a full recovery following the accident.
TMZ reports that Nancy explained: “Joe was sent flying a couple feet backward into an old wooden fence."
They add: "He suffered a gash on his head, plus injuries to his left leg and a shoulder.”
The actor was then rushed to hospital where he was given a CT scan.
Joe later took Instagram to share photographs of himself smiling and giving a thumbs up – while also sporting a nasty looking cut on his head – after returning home from hospital.
The actor looked upbeat, despite the injury, as he posed in a red t-shirt and blue coat.
Sharing the snaps online, a statement reads: “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”
The statement continues: “He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering.”
And adds: “Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming! We'll reading them to him to help him get better.”
Fans flooded the comments section with words of encouragement, with one fan telling The Matrix star: “Praying for a speedy and full recovery.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Pantoliano was reportedly rushed to a hospital after being struck by a car.
Pantoliano and his family were walking in their Connecticut neighbourhood when a skidding Porsche struck the “Sopranos” actor, according to a report from TMZ. The Porsche had been T-boned by another vehicle, the publication added, sourcing the actor’s wife Nancy Pantoliano.
“Nancy says Joe was sent flying a couple feet backward into an old wooden fence. He suffered a gash on his head, plus injuries to his left leg and a shoulder,” the report reads. “EMTs quickly arrived and rushed Joe to a hospital where he’s being treated and waiting on the results of a CT scan.”
Pantoliano is expected to pull through, local police are investigating the situation and both drivers stayed at the potential crime scene.
ET Canada reached out to a rep for the actor, who said Pantoliano “is home recovering and being monitored for a concussion and chest trauma. He is grateful for the good wishes of his fans.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Sopranos' star Joe Pantoliano struck by car while walking</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. (AP) - Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.
The impact left him with a gash on his head and other injuries. His agent told Variety that Pantoliano was taken to a nearby hospital.
A post on Instagram showed Pantoliano with stitches in his head and giving a thumbs-up sign. It read, “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones': 10 Series That Could Be the Next Epic Fantasy Show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones came to its end in 2019, not in the best fashion either. But despite the fan response to the end of the HBO series, the age of fantasy TV adaptations is likely just beginning.
Game of Thrones introduced audiences to the sprawling fictional landscape created by author George R.R. Martin with its own geography, economy and politics completely divorced from the real world. The show sucked in many trepidatious viewers who had never picked up a fantasy novel before in their lives, and now studios are hoping to capture that magic in a bottle again.
Fantasy and science fiction adaptations are nothing new on Hollywood, though in the past they have tended to get more play as movies. This was not always a bad thing — see Harry Potter andThe Lord of the Rings, for instance. It was not always good either — see the 2006 film adaptation of Eragon.
These days, many fantasy adaptations are being developed as series instead. This makes sense for a lot of reasons. To start, epic fantasy tends to include a lot of world-building, exposition and groundwork. It can be nearly impossible to cram all of that into one movie, and even if you do that knowledge is watered down.
In the world of fantasy, readers are rewarded for investing time in a series. The more fluency they bring to a world, the more they are rewarded with new twists and turns in the story itself, rather than trying to remember names or understand how magic works.
Therefore, TV is a good home for fantasy adaptations, as the minds behind Game of Thrones have learned. There are countless others working frantically to try and mimic their success, but there is no telling who will get there first.
Here is a look at some of the most promising fantasy adaptations either planned or rumored to be coming to TV next.
One of the top contenders for the "Next Game of Thrones" title is undoubtedly Who Fears Death, based on the novel by Nnedi Okorafor. The story has been in development at HBO since the fall of 2017, with GoT author George R.R. Martin attached as a co-executive producer. Martin and Okorafor attended the Emmys together in September, where he raved to reporters about the project.
Who Fears Death is set in a post-apocalyptic future version of Sudan. It is set in the midst of an oppressive regime lead by the light-skinned Nuru people, lording over the dark-skinned Okeke. Its protagonist is a girl named Onyesonwu, which translates to "who fears death." Onyesonwu is half Nuru and half Okeke, and in this coming of age story she goes on a quest to defeat her father, a dark sorcerer, with her own magical powers.
There have not been a lot of recent updates on Who Fears Death,and HBO has not officially ordered the series or even a pilot. However, with Martin at the helm, it seems likely that we will be seeing Onyesonwu on-screen sometime soon.
In terms of timing, Netflix may win the title of "Next Game of Thrones" with its series adaptation of The Witcher. The show's first season was a hit and Henry Cavill's performance as Geralt won over fans of the series and video games.
The Witcher already has a huge following, not just from Andrzej Sapkowski's books but from the video game adaptations. On top of that, the show has an all-star cast, including Man of Steel star Henry Cavill and Vikings' Stephen Wall. And while season one had some confusion with its timeline, the fantasy elements and action were top notch.
The Witcher season two is expected to air on Netflix in 2021, but don't expect the same type of series as Game of Thrones. It is in the same genre, but the show will not be a Game of Thrones clone.
Another promising story trapped in development deadlock is The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisin. The series takes place on a fantasy world inhabited by people of different races, species and castes, all of whom believe that the end of their world is at hand. At the center are a group of three women with the power to influence seismic activity beneath the supercontinent they live on.
The Broken Earth was optioned for TV by TNT in 2017, but there has been no news since then. The show was given big TV names to help it along such as Leigh Dana Jackson of Sleepy Hollow, who was set to write the pilot, and Tim Kring of Heroes, who was set to executive produce.
While fans are generally looking to premium networks or streaming services for the next big fantasy adaptation, it would be a surprise if TNT could swoop in and steal the crown. Still, given the source material, they have every chance. It also has some welcome neighbors with the adaptation of Snowpiercer premiering on the network soon.
Last year, Netflix acquired the rights to make a TV adaptation of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series. The beloved books have already had a successful run on the big screen before stopping, so fans would likely tune in for another round, especially in series form.
Lewis was a contemporary of The Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien, and the two workshopped books together from time to time. The Chronicles of Narnia are known for non-linear storytelling and overt Christian symbolism, with an almost parable-like quality to some stories. That could lend itself well to a series, especially in today's anthology-crazed TV climate.
Netflix announced that its adaptation of the series would include both movies and TV shows, perhaps alternating between the two from book to book. The projects will be executive produced by Mark Gordon, Douglas Gresham and Vincent Seiber.
It also stands in opposition to His Dark Materials on HBO, another fantasy series vying for the crown that also had a run at the theaters with The Golden Compass. It is like the anti-Narnia tale.
The Wheel of Time series is one of the largest high fantasy epics ever devised. Spanning 17 books in total, including one prequel and two companion books, the story is set in a world that seems at once to be ancient and futuristic, and it is never made clear whether it is set on earth or not.
Obviously, there is more than enough story to fuel an adaptation here, and fans have been waiting a long time for one. Jordan first referenced the possibility of a TV adaptation in 2000, telling CNN reporters that NBC had optioned the first book in the series for a show.
FXX aired an adaptation of part of the story in 2015, though the low-budget project was not well received. The studio ultimately stepped back to re-examine the potential of the series, which has a huge international fan base.
In February of 2018, Sony Pictures Television and Amazon Studios announced that they were co-developing a Wheel of Time series for Amazon Instant Video. The show was officially greenlit in October, though there is no word yet on when we might see it on screen.
There is some massive talent behind The Wheel of Time adaptation, including showrunner Rafe Judkins, who worked on Chuck and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Still, Amazon has not proven itself as a hitmaker yet, so fans are still weary.
Neil Gaiman's epic Vertigo series was snatched up by Netflix last year and it has been a long time coming. We've seen plenty of pieces of the Sandman universe pop up elsewhere on DC Comics and Warner Brothers television. That includes the short-lived Constantine on NBC and Lucifer from Fox before its move to Netflix. There was also the Swamp Thing series that was canceled before its premiere on DC's streaming platform.
Nobody knows what to truly expect from the series but Gaiman's involvement in both this and Lucifer paints a brighter picture than we've seen in the past. Will be interesting to see how it unfolds because the world (and underworld) are interesting as can be.
Another series snatched up by Netflix in the wake of Game of Thrones, Shadow and Bone is full of monsters, magic and the 1800s. The Russian origins of the book will come into play here and offer a unique perspective on the fantasy genre, much like Metro 2033 has done for the post-apocalyptic genre.
The show has a rabid fanbase and will be ready to pick the show apart once it is in production. The case announced in the fall of 2019, with Narnia alum and Westworld actor Ben Barnes in a lead role.
Kurt Vonnegut's sci-fi classic The Sirens of Titan has been in the works since at least July 2017, when word got out that Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon was writing the script. The project came up again in May of 2018 in a GQ profile of Harmon.
“And there is today’s ordeal, a limited-series adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s The Sirens of Titan, which has sat dormant more or less since it was announced in 2017," wrote Sean O'Neal at the time. "Harmon’s racing to produce a script by tonight, before he lets everyone down again. We had activities planned, but Harmon needs to work. Was I just supposed to watch him write, or...?”
Later, O'Neal was present when Harmon got glowing notes on the script from a studio executive, though that was the last real update on the project. The show is being produced by Universal Cable Productions, and no network or outlet has been specified yet.
Sirens of Titan follows a wealthy man in a futuristic version of America, using his influence to try and navigate an interplanetary war between Earth, Mars and Mercury. Ultimately, he finds himself on Titan, a moon of Saturn that scientists believe may be habitable.
Of course, in the world of modern fantasy adaptations Tolkien's Lord of the Rings set the bar, and it makes sense that studios simply want to do the whole thing again. Amazon is currently working on a prequel series to Lord of the Rings, based on Tolkien's additional writing outside of the series, such as The Silmarillion. The show will be set in Middle-Earth, though it will take place thousands of years before Bilbo's harrowing journey.
Right now, the show is slated for release in 2021. That in mind, it is remarkable how much press the show has already gotten. Many fantasy readers and authors have turned their noses up at the show, asking Tolkien to give other stories a chance. But the series is moving on and will likely focus on the younger years of Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen's character from the film trilogy.
Finally, let's not forget that Game of Thrones' ending doesn't mean fans will be forced to leave Westeros for good. HBO developed several spinoff series for Game of Thrones, with two sent to production before the first choice starring Naomi Watts was shelved. The second spin-off is currently titled House of the Dragon but is set a while before the original show to highlight the founding of the kingdom under the Targaryen clan.
The show will likely be based on material from Martin's other works outside the main series, primarily the encyclopedia-style book The World of Ice and Fire and the recent compilation titled Fire & Blood.
House of the Dragon will be set around 300 years before the events of the main series featured in Game of Thrones. Author George R. R. Martin has confirmed that it will be based on material in Fire & Blood. However, but he was the first to admit that that does not narrow it down much. Fans are definitely excited to see what comes, though.
Game of Thrones can be streamed on HBO and the upcoming HBO Max streaming service.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Between jobs: Stuntman Justin’s double life in the movies put on hold</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lockdown means a slowing of pace for a man used to risking life and limb to step into the shoes of major film stars.
From the Midlands to the Hollywood hills – action man Justin Pearson has graced the screen in some of the world’s biggest movie franchises.
His credits read like a blockbuster who’s who, including a couple of Harry Potter films, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, two 007 movies, plus Marvel and DC Comics adventures – not to mention the TV phenomenon Game of Thrones.
Right now, though, the 48-year-old stunt co-ordinator and performer is just one of the many self-employed people who find themselves out of work, and socially isolating at home.
So what exactly does a man with such an adrenaline-pumping, globe-trotting lifestyle do when the lights, cameras and action grind to a halt?
“I’ve got to admit, it was a real shock to the system when the shutdown began,” says Justin, who was born and raised in south Shropshire, but now lives with his wife Lisa and their two young children in Wem in the north of the county.
“At the time, as well as starting rehearsals on my next major feature film, I was training for a white-collar boxing fight – I was about six weeks into an eight-week training programme. So as you can imagine, I was doing quite a lot of fitness work.
“We were also well under way with rehearsals for action scenes on The Batman in London, and about to move up to Liverpool to start shooting, when everyone started talking about the news headlines that Tom Hanks had contracted coronavirus.
“It made us realise that literally anybody could get this thing, and we knew straight away at that time that rehearsals would be curtailed and that the shoot in Liverpool would be either postponed or cancelled.
“That’s exactly what happened. So since the lockdown, I’ve been here in Shropshire with the family, going out cycling every other day to keep active. But probably like most people, I also seem to be eating my own bodyweight in food almost daily! This kind of lifestyle is not great for the diet.”
Alongside his movie industry work, Justin is a former champion horseman and founder of medieval jousting display team The Knights of the Damned, which has performed in the past at Shrewsbury Flower Show and other events in the West Midlands. The touring show is currently mothballed while Justin focuses on his growing body of screen work, but that’s ended up coming in very handy right now.
He explains: “I’ve actually built a full-scale medieval jousting arena in the back garden for the kids – I’ve got Archie who is seven, and Millie who is two. I went in the shed the other day, and there was all the equipment, stacked up; the rail that the knights go up and down, and the man-shaped targets, known as quintains – Archie and I had a bit of fun getting all that out and blowing off the cobwebs.”
So, does this mean Pearson junior may be thinking of following in his father’s footsteps? Justin says: “It’s too early to say at seven years old. When I was that age, I could barely even tie my laces. He shows an interest, but I don’t know whether that’s because it’s all he has got at the moment in between so many hours on the iPad or Playstation.”
One of the most arduous tasks for Justin right now has been getting to grips with the challenges of home schooling.
“My wife has been doing most of that, to be fair, and I’ve been picking up the PE sessions – a bit of football in the garden, and some shooting practice. I have to take my hat off to teachers when you realise what they have to do on a daily basis; it’s hard work keeping young kids occupied for that amount of time.”
With a history of horsemanship in his family (his grandparents ran a stables business in the Stretton valley) Justin naturally found himself gravitating towards equestrian sports as a child. Little did he know, however, where it was all going to lead.
Through his early life and into his teens, he became heavily involved in show jumping and mounted games, and represented England on eight occasions, at the highest level with the Great Britain team. He became mounted games British Champion in 1995, and Reserve World Champion in 2004.
At the age of 18, Justin auditioned for a medieval jousting team which was about to embark on a world tour taking in Europe, Asia and Russia, and it was here that he discovered a love of performing action and stunts in a live show format.
There was already an established pathway for performers in such shows into the movie stunt world, and it wasn’t long before Justin began training for a place on the prestigious British Stunt Register.
Since the early days cutting his teeth on TV dramas such as The Hunt, and Lorna Doone, Justin has amassed some 200 screen credits to his name, in a career spanning more than 20 years.
During that time, he has stunt doubled actors from Kevin Costner and Sean Bean to Billy Zane, Sam Worthington, Jeremy Irvine, and Christopher Eccleston, and worked everywhere from Manchester to the Maldives. He has three Screen Actors Guild awards for work on James Bond movie Skyfall, plus Wonder Woman and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, and two further nominations for Doctor Strange and Fast and Furious 6.
Most recently, Justin co-ordinated the action on a couple of episodes of the BBC drama The Nest, and was part of the stunt team in Oscar-winning Bohemian Rhapsody, Elton John biopic Rocketman, and Mary Poppins Returns.
He has also completed work on two yet-to-be-released movies, The Hitman’s Bodyguard 2, and Fast & Furious 9.
“I’ve been very fortunate in my career to get the chance to work on some of the biggest movie franchises in the world," he says.
“I’ve been lucky enough to travel all over the world, experience many different cultures and meet some incredible people.
“Every day is different on a film set, and it’s a real rollercoaster ride. From the outside looking in, it’s every little boy’s dream, isn’t it But it’s a very hard-working industry with professional people.
“As a professional stuntman these days, you can’t just make your living doing one kind of thing. They do say that the most difficult kind of stunts to perform are the horse stunts, because you are dealing with another brain, and brains are unpredictable.
“I’ve been a professional stuntman for over 20 years now, and I’ve taken a lot of knocks in that time. So the natural progression for me has been to move up to the role of stunt co-ordinator, and pass on a bit of the knowledge that I’ve learned over the years.”
So what’s the most dangerous or visually spectacular stunt which Justin has been asked to perform on screen?
“That’s a tough one, but I worked on a Sky series last year called Curfew, about an illegal car race set in the future. I did quite a bit of driving on that one.
“One of the stunts involved me driving a tow truck which had a car attached to the back of it. Someone runs out into the middle of the road in front of me, and I have to swerve, and turn the truck over into a lake, which was quite tricky. Something like that takes a lot of time and planning. Fortunately, it went well.”
Justin’s autobiography, Rolling With The Punches, is due for publication soon, and he believes there are plenty more chapters of his story yet to be written.
He is confident that when we do eventually emerge from the other side of the pandemic, the movie industry will be quickly back in its stride.
“Who knows when that is going to be, though? They were talking about maybe restrictions starting to be lifted in June, but no-one really knows, do they?
“If that’s true, though, it would be great, as it would mean that the peak has arrived and passed. But this year, like so many other people, my work has just been completely decimated.
“I’ve got a lot of friends that work in the film industry, not just in the stunt department, but costume makers, caterers, hair and make-up – we’re all in the same boat. We’re freelance, self-employed, and just keeping an eye on what the Government is able to offer in terms of remuneration.
“A lot of people are falling through the cracks, but it’s just a wait-and-see game right now.”
Having been in the business for more than two decades, it’s certainly not the first economic challenge that Justin has overcome – hence his confidence that the good times will return.
“We had that big recession in 2007 and 2008, and I remember that from the back-end of that second year, through to about 2011 or 2012, the film-making industry in the UK was booming.
“All the studios were full, there was so much work out there, and people like me were going from job to job, living out of a suitcase and never at home.
“That was helped by the tax breaks which the UK was offering to overseas production companies, which created a big boost.
“Hopefully the film industry can recover in the same way once again, and we’ll all be back to work again soon.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Where was the Netflix series Hollywood filmed?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the many new shows to have dropped onto to Netflix this May, Hollywood is the intriguing period drama from Glee creator Ryan Murphy.
The series, which is available to stream on Netflix now, follows a group of aspiring actors and filmmakers in post-World War II Hollywood as they try to make it in LA.
Exploring a Hollywood in a parallel universe, the diverse characters aren’t afraid to be bold in chasing their dreams and fulfilling their ambitions. 
The show has received mixed reviews so far, with Metro.co.uk saying: ‘It covers a lot of ground and a lot of talking points – mainly successfully. This show isn’t just a letter to Hollywood – it’s built for die-hard Murphy fans who has made his career on shining a spotlight on representation, in particular queer representation, when there wasn’t one before.’
Unsurprisingly for a show named Hollywood, the primary filming location for this new Netflix series was Los Angeles, California. 
Most of the scenes from the series were filmed inside sets on a film studio lot in LA, allowing the makers of the show to style the world of the show in true 1940s old Hollywood glamour.
However, there are elements of the location and set that are inspired by places that exisit in real life in Hollywood – just as many of the characters in the series are inspired be real-life people.
For example, Ace Studios, the fictional move studio where most of the drama takes place in Hollywood is modelled on the Bronson Gate from Paramount Pictures’ studio which you can still see today in LA. 
Hollywood is available to stream on Netflix now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With Hollywood, Ryan Murphy Gives Cinema's Outsiders the Happy Ending They Deserved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On an ordinary quarantine-era Monday in April, a bolt of joy shot through the Internet courtesy of producers Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan. The first trailer for their Netflix miniseries Hollywoodpromised a sexy gas station, A-list Broadway stars, 1940s glamour, May-December romances and, most importantly, a story that looks at the Hollywood that could have been, with a true resistance to hatred.
Set in the film industry's Golden Age, the series mixes fictional characters with real-life figures like Hattie McDaniel, Anna May Wong, and Rock Hudson. It takes a revisionist lens to the era, giving characters from marginalized groups storylines in which they fulfill their dreams. “I was interested in doing something very optimistic and very uplifting and giving these disenfranchised people happy endings,” Murphy says.
The show is the mega-producer's second with Netflix as part of a 2018 deal he signed with the company, thought to be the largest TV contract in history. The partnership marks a new phase in his career and only fuels his already prodigious output. He’s currently at work on a feature film adaptation of the play The Boys in the Band, a miniseries version of A Chorus Line, season 2 of The Politician, a series focused on One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’s Nurse Ratched, and a film version of the Broadway hit The Prom, all for Netflix. That’s in addition to new seasons of Pose, American Crime Story (this time focusing on Monica Lewinsky), and American Horror Story, all on FX.
In a spare brief moment between projects, Murphy spoke to ELLE.com about Hollywood’s dark history, his eye for new talent, and the freedom of showing nudity on Netflix.
I think it was a combination of two things. I was raised by my grandmother. She was a big movie fan, so I grew up watching a lot of old movies and reading a lot of golden-era Hollywood books. There were three people I was always interested in: Rock Hudson, Anna May Wong, and Hattie McDaniel. I was always moved by how they never got their happy ending, how they had to live inauthentically and were never given the opportunities they deserved.
After I did Versace, I was interested in the world of that gas station in Hollywood [in his memoir, "fixer" Scotty Bowers recounted being employed at a gas station that offered sex work in the ‘40s], not so much because of the sordid sexual stuff, but the idea that people had to go to a gas station to find companionship or sexuality in a world where they could be arrested or even killed for being authentically who they were.
What's interesting is I'd worked with almost all of the “older” actors before. I've worked with Jim Parsons and Joe Mantello and Patti LuPone and Darren Criss and David Corenswet. We were all friends. But I was really interested in going after young, sparkling new voices with this show.
The hardest part that took me the longest time to cast was Rock Hudson. I read hundreds and hundreds of guys for that part. Many of them looked a lot like Rock. And in the case of Jake [Picking], he gave a really interesting audition. I thought he was great, but I still wasn't sure. So I wanted to meet him and he came in and sat in my office and talked to me about his life and how he had been new to Hollywood and how hard it was. He had spent many nights up watching Golden-era movies. I was so moved by him that we did a makeup test and added a lot of prosthetics to him and we were all just blown away. I think people don't realize there's so much of his face that we [changed]. His eyelids, his chin, his cheeks, his teeth, his nose. We really worked hard on that look for him. I'm very proud of how it looks.
What we wanted was somebody to protect Rock Hudson. And that's what he did. He's so good at it and he's so emotional and he holds his own in those big hard scenes with Jim Parsons. Jim came to love him. Everyone just loves Jake.
There's a lot of tears on the final episode and those are real tears. In many cases I used all of the first takes because so many people were so emotional about Anna May Wong and Rock Hudson and Hattie McDaniel, and the new people like Jeremy's character and Laura's character, actually being seen by a system that has for years neglected them. So all those tears were real emotions. It was cathartic making this show because it was thrilling to give justice to that group of people who deserve it.
There's so many of them. I liked all the unexpected relationships. I loved the relationship between Holland Taylor and Dylan McDermott. I loved the relationship between Patti LuPone and her daughter, and also David Corenswet because you don't really see women past 40 ever given a chance to play something romantic or sexualized. It was fun to do that.
But my favorite thing by far was the final episode, because we got to really dig in and we were given the time and the money. That last episode went three weeks over budget and overshooting because it took so much time to get it all right. Historically right. That was my favorite thing that we did—not only was it emotional, but I loved that set. I loved those clothes, I loved the props.
I've never been able to do full male nudity until now—and also full female nudity, I might add. That was liberating. I've spent a lot of time in my career having ridiculous conversations about nipples. I cannot tell you how many conversations where I'm like ‘Really?!’ To be able to just go for it is great.
We had always planned on this coming out. We've been working for a year toward this date. It's a very dark time. It's a very scary time. It's a very troubling time. I know that I personally am looking for things to watch to feel uplifted and hopeful. I think this show has the exact thing we're looking for at this moment. It leaves you with a feeling of maybe things could be better. Maybe the good guys will win, maybe we're going to be okay, and we can come together as a group to change the world. That's what this merry band of people are doing in this finale.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A-listers join former presidents to call for unity against pandemic threat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actors and musicians joined two former US presidents to try and lift morale and call for unity amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The messages were both universal and personal as the Call To Unite livestream, a 24-hour event, stretched into its second day.
Former US president Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey were among those who participated on Friday night, and Quincy Jones, Jennifer Garner, Common, Maria Shriver, Questlove, Yo-Yo Ma, were also participating in the event, being livestreamed at unite.us and on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, LinkedIn and SiriusXM Stars.
Director Lee Daniels, in an emotional message, talked about his past drug use during the Aids epidemic in the 1980s.
He talked about the pain of losing friends to the disease, which he said decimated the African-American gay community.
And he urged people not to resort to drug use during the current pandemic.
“Stay in the moment. Don’t use. Be safe.”
Eva Longoria cited the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi as she urged people to “be the change you want to see in the world”.
“We’re in a moment where we have a chance to reset and start anew,” she said.
She praised nurses and doctors especially for risking their lives to save others, and therapists donating services to tend to people’s mental health.
LeAnn Rimes sang There Will Be A Better Day.
On Friday evening, Winfrey said she keeps updated with coronavirus news, but has often focused her attention more on positive “acts of valour”.
Former president George W. Bush said: “Even at an appropriate social distance, we can find ways to be present in the lives of others to ease their anxiety and share their burdens.”
Mr Clinton delivered the message that “we can get through this together”.
Sean Combs said the pandemic was giving humanity a chance to unite.
“We don’t have to wait until the pandemic is over,” he said.
“This can come true right now.”
He urged people to “give someone an extra mask, check on an elderly neighbour”.
The event kicked off with a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.
Instead of performing collectively, each member clapped and danced individually in various places from inside their apartment, rooftop or park to the tune of Ailey’s Rocka My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A-listers join former presidents to call for unity against pandemic threat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The livestream saw former rivals Bill Clinton and George W. Bush pleaded for action.
Actors and musicians joined two former US presidents to try and lift morale and call for unity amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The messages were both universal and personal as the Call To Unite livestream, a 24-hour event, stretched into its second day.
Former US president Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey were among those who participated on Friday night, and Quincy Jones, Jennifer Garner, Common, Maria Shriver, Questlove, Yo-Yo Ma, were also participating in the event, being livestreamed at unite.us and on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, LinkedIn and SiriusXM Stars.
Director Lee Daniels, in an emotional message, talked about his past drug use during the Aids epidemic in the 1980s.
He talked about the pain of losing friends to the disease, which he said decimated the African-American gay community.
And he urged people not to resort to drug use during the current pandemic.
“You’re not alone,” he said.
“Stay in the moment. Don’t use. Be safe.”
Eva Longoria cited the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi as she urged people to “be the change you want to see in the world”.
“We’re in a moment where we have a chance to reset and start anew,” she said.
She praised nurses and doctors especially for risking their lives to save others, and therapists donating services to tend to people’s mental health.
LeAnn Rimes sang There Will Be A Better Day.
On Friday evening, Winfrey said she keeps updated with coronavirus news, but has often focused her attention more on positive “acts of valour”.
The event, organised by Tim Shriver, was launched to help inspire people to endure and overcome the challenges of the pandemic.
Former president George W. Bush said: “Even at an appropriate social distance, we can find ways to be present in the lives of others to ease their anxiety and share their burdens.”
Mr Clinton delivered the message that “we can get through this together”.
Sean Combs said the pandemic was giving humanity a chance to unite.
“We don’t have to wait until the pandemic is over,” he said.
“This can come true right now.”
He urged people to “give someone an extra mask, check on an elderly neighbour”.
The event kicked off with a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.
Instead of performing collectively, each member clapped and danced individually in various places from inside their apartment, rooftop or park to the tune of Ailey’s Rocka My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Called social media sensations for trials to appear hands-on: Rijiju</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said that calling for urgent trials for social media sprint sensations, seen running with buffaloes, were decisions taken under pressure to appear hands-on in his job.
Kambala jockey Srinivas Gowda of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh’s Rameshwar Gurjar had hit national headlines last year for running in slushy and dusty fields respectively.
They were believed to have completed 100m sprints in 11 seconds, creating a flutter on social media platforms, where some dubbed them, one after another, the next Usain Bolt.
“In Madhya Pradesh, somebody had a video of a village boy’s running and posted it on social media, commented that he runs faster than Usain Bolt. When it became viral, I could have ignored it but suppose I don’t react on that time, people will say the sports minister is silent, is not taking cognizance,” he said.
In the trial though, Mr. Gurjar could not live up to the expectations and could barely complete the 100m distance in 12.9 seconds.
Mr. Rijiju added, “Shivraj Singh Chouhan also asked me to look into the matter. So I sent my SAI team to test the guy in Bhopal. I knew his capability but the country doesn’t know what is the nature of sports. People just started saying he runs faster than Bolt and that is because of lack of awareness.”
“During the test he wouldn’t even compete with the junior guys forget the seniors, he can’t run even 13 seconds flat in 100m. He never trained. He was 25-26, so age was also not on his side; he didn’t know how to wear spikes.”
Mr. Rijiju also spoke about the story around Mr. Gowda, whose exploits during a traditional buffalo race in Karnataka created a buzz on social media, forcing the Minister to call the 28-year-old for a trail at the SAI, Bengaluru centre.
This was after after video clips of him running a distance of 100 metres in just 9.55 seconds surfaced.
“Then 4-5 months back a news broke out that somebody broke Usain Bolt’s record in a bull race in Karnataka. Even some of the professional people, some of the businessmen, some of the renowned people of India stated that now this guy will bring Olympic gold in 100m,” Mr. Rijiju said.
“People must be thinking that what is the sports minister doing, he is responding to such kinds of amateur talks but I had to show sections who don’t know sports that I am hands on with Indian sports and I am there for the athletes. I will give all the opportunities to all potentials, so I had to show that,” he said.
The Minister said it’s high time people broaden their knowledge about sports other than cricket to enable India become a sporting powerhouse.
“Many people complained to me that government does not contribute enough for the development of sports in India. Let me make it very clear — knowledge about sports in India is very, very low. People know only about cricket, people don’t know about other sports,” Mr. Rijiju said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eddie Marsan recruits family to film TV scenes during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new TV series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers.
The Happy Go Lucky star and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting.
Marsan – whose career has seen him directed by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Mike Leigh – hailed his wife’s directorial debut.
He told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.”
Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom, but said she did not think she would start a new film career.
Marsan explained that he is due to appear in an episode entitled Karen, which sees him play a “heartbroken” man whose marriage has collapsed and is self-isolating at home with his two teenage sons.
His ex-partner’s father, played by actor David Threlfall, comes to his house to persuade him to let his former wife see the children.
Due to strict social-distancing rules, Threlfall had to remain in the Marsan family garden while performing his scenes.
“The whole premise is to tell stories about what’s happening in everyday people’s lives but within the context of isolation and the difficulties that that brings,” Marsan explained.
He said his children had grown up on film sets and he thought the challenge of helping film scenes at home would teach them to collaborate.
“They loved it. It was very hard work and they wanted to get off their school work, but we didn’t let them,” he said.
“So every time we said ‘cut’ and we had to change things, they had to go down and do some more work, and they wanted to just play on the Xbox or something. We didn’t let them.”
Isolation Stories airs at 9pm over four nights on ITV, starting on Monday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Michael Palin has revealed an elderly neighbour pulled him to safety after he accidentally set fire to his house while recovering from heart surgery.
The Monty Python star, 76, said he had open-heart surgery in September to repair two valves and was told by doctors to relax at home.
However, during his recovery he was doing breathing exercises and accidentally blew kitchen roll towards a naked flame and it caught fire.
Writing in Idler magazine, Sir Michael said: “I leapt up and grasped a hand towel, which briefly smothered the flames before itself catching alight.
“In some alarm now, as flames licked up towards the ceiling, I dialled the emergency services – but the moment we connected, the smoke alarm went off and I couldn’t hear a word they were saying.
“Just caught something about washing my hands which made me realise that, without my glasses on, I’d rung 111 instead of 999. But I washed my hands anyway, and by a fantastic stroke of luck, the loose tap that we never had fixed finally came apart, dousing the ceiling and partially extinguishing the fire.”
At that point, Sir Michael said, his 86-year-old neighbour – who had undergone heart surgery the previous week – wrenched open the window and pulled him to safety.
He added: “Thank God he’d been told to take it easy, otherwise he’d have been out playing golf and my house would have been a write-off.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Monty Python star Michael Palin reveals he accidentally set fire to his house</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Michael Palin has revealed an elderly neighbour pulled him to safety after he accidentally set fire to his house while recovering from heart surgery.
The Monty Python star, 76, said he had open-heart surgery in September to repair two valves and was told by doctors to relax at home.
However, during his recovery he was doing breathing exercises and accidentally blew kitchen roll towards a naked flame and it caught fire.
Writing in Idler magazine, Sir Michael said: “I leapt up and grasped a hand towel, which briefly smothered the flames before itself catching alight.
“In some alarm now, as flames licked up towards the ceiling, I dialled the emergency services – but the moment we connected, the smoke alarm went off and I couldn’t hear a word they were saying.
“Just caught something about washing my hands which made me realise that, without my glasses on, I’d rung 111 instead of 999. But I washed my hands anyway, and by a fantastic stroke of luck, the loose tap that we never had fixed finally came apart, dousing the ceiling and partially extinguishing the fire.”
At that point, Sir Michael said, his 86-year-old neighbour – who had undergone heart surgery the previous week – wrenched open the window and pulled him to safety.
He added: “Thank God he’d been told to take it easy, otherwise he’d have been out playing golf and my house would have been a write-off.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Monty Python's Sir Michael Palin accidentally set his house on fire</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Michael Palin was pulled to safety by his 86-year-old neighbour after he accidentally started a house fire. 
The Monty Python legend underwent open heart surgery last September to repair two valves and was instructed by doctors to relax at home for three months. 
However, it seems the 76-year-old didn’t quite get the memo, as his efforts to relax resulted in a house fire.
Writing for Idler magazine, Palin explained that while doing breathing exercises, he accidentally blew a naked flame towards a kitchen roll nearby – which went up in flames and set a Sainsbury’s receipt alight too. 
The A Fish Called Wanda star wrote: ‘As flames licked up towards the ceiling, I dialled the emergency services – but the moment we connected, the smoke alarm went off and I couldn’t hear a word they were saying. 
‘Just caught something about washing my hands which made me realise that, without my glasses on, I’d rung 111 instead of 999. 
‘But I washed my hands anyway, and by a fantastic stroke of luck, the loose tap that we never had fixed finally came apart, dousing the ceiling and partially extinguishing the fire.’
Luckily for Sir Michael, at that point, he was ‘pulled to safety’ from a window by an unlikely rescuer – his 86-year-old neighbour who had a sextuple bypass the week before.
He said: ‘Thank God he’d been told to take it easy, otherwise he’d have been out playing golf and my house would have been a write-off.’
Between Michael’s accident and Britney Spears burning down her gym with candles, we reckon celebrities need to go through some fire safety training, stat.
Sir Michael underwent the heart operation at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, and a month on, he told fans in a blog post that he was no longer feeling like ‘an old Ford Anglia’.
The travel documentary-maker wrote: ‘Terrific team at Bart’s Hospital opened me up, had a look around, found a second valve that needed attention, and now instead of feeling like an old Ford Anglia I’m well on my way to feeling like a one previous owner Golf GTI.
‘The operation took over four hours but I felt very little pain afterwards. Main problem now is trying hard not to do too much.
‘My chest won’t really be ready for any gold medallions for at least six weeks, and I’m told the ticker, which enlarges to deal with the extra work-load from dysfunctional valves, may take a year to return to normal size.’
He also shared that he was looking forward to his three months off, saying: ‘Longest period without major work since I started in the biz in 1965. A chance to look around and see what others are doing. Which at the moment seems largely shouting at each other.’
While he stuck to doctor’s orders and stayed at home, Palin did make an appearance at the National Television Awards in January to accept the Special Recognition Award.
At the ceremony, the comic became emotional as he remembered Terry Jones, who had died a week earlier. 
Sir Michael said: ‘I want to dedicate this award tonight to someone who taught me more about television than anyone else, my dear friend and Python, Terry Jones. 
‘Anyone who knows or who has worked with Terry will have been infected by his enthusiasm. Terry always worked to get something right. He had a certain skill in being very ruthless but also charming at the same time.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Reportedly Agree to Tell-All Biography</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget about the adorable elephant documentary, this is the juicy stuff we’ve been waiting for. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who are now more than a month into their unceremonious exit from the British royal family, have reportedly cooperated with journalists who penned a tell-all biography about their new life. Deadline reports that Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, secured an interview with the couple just before they left the United Kingdom for sunnier pastures in Canada (and now Los Angeles). The book, set for an August 20 release, is teased as going “beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together,” in addition to getting participation “of those closest to the couple.” Our hearts say it’s a cooing baby Archie, but our minds say Meghan’s yogi momma.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Harry & Meghan Reportedly Agreed To Spicy Tell-All Bio & Somewhere, Lizzy Is Clenching</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, otherwise known as Harry and Meghan, have reportedly given their blessing to an upcoming royal biography about them. Deadline reports the couple even gave an interview to the book’s authors before they waved ta-ta to the UK.
Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family was written by journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, who have extensively covered the British Royal Family over the years.
“For the very first time, Finding Freedom goes beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond,” part of the synopsis on Amazon reads.
“With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.”
The biography will be released on August 11, you can suss out more details about it right here.
And then there’s the other book, the one called Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir From Queen Mary To Meghan Markle, which will be released in September. In an excerpt from the book published by the couple’s fave, the Daily Mail, anonymous sources told stories of Meghan’s behaviour in Kensington Palace. One source, a former servant, described an incident that contributed to the couple’s decision to split their household from William and Kate‘s. Apparently “Meghan shouted at a member of Kate’s staff”, which was “definitely the beginning of discussions about leaving Kensington Palace.” Other sources claimed Meghan was jealous of Kate, because “she is not married to the next king.” Bummer. The anonymous sources threw more of the same shit at Meghan, even adding that she was jealous that her former home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, was “tiny in comparison to the vast apartment complex where Kate and William live.”
In conclusion, it’s just another day on the royal beat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan & Harry Will Reportedly Spill Some Royal Tea In A Tell-All Biography</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Could Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex soon spill some royal tea? Meghan and Harry reportedly granted an interview for an upcoming tell-all biography titled Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making Of A Modern Royal Family. According to a Deadline report published on May 3, Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie, royal editor for Harper's Bazaar, and Carolyn Durand, royal contributor for Elle and O, The Oprah Magazine, reportedly interviewed Meghan and Harry prior to their move from the UK to Canada (and later, Los Angeles). Bustle has reached out to Meghan and Harry's rep for comment.
Finding Freedom, available on August 11, will go “beyond the headlines” and chronicle “unknown details” about Meghan and Harry’s life together, as well as dispel the “rumors and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond,” per the biography’s blurb on Amazon. With Scobie and Durand’s “unique access” and the “participation of those closest to the couple,” the biography promises an intimate portrait of the “confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition” and “determined to create a new path away from the spotlight.”
The reported interview will be one of the first since Meghan and Harry officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March. Since their relocation to Los Angeles with son Archie that same month, the two have been spotted out and about delivering groceries to families in need with charity Project Angel Food during the global health crisis, surgical masks and gloves in tow.
The tell-all would mark Meghan’s second project post-royal split. The duchess last narrated the Disney+ nature documentary Elephant, which follows a herd of resilient African elephants as they journey across the Kalahari Desert. In partnership with Elephants Without Borders, Disney donated Meghan's voiceover fees to the charity dedicated to wildlife conservation in Botswana.
“She was absolutely intrigued by the elephants, and transfixed, especially by the female empowerment side,” co-director Vanessa Berlowitz told PEOPLE of Meghan’s involvement in April. “How important the matriarchs are to the story; it really is all about female leadership. It’s a different form of power. She was absolutely fascinated by that.”
Since Elephant’s release, Meghan has also popped up in Zoom calls to chat with members of the UK’s Hubb Community Kitchen and to surprise a Smarts Work client before a job interview. As for what could be next for the Harry and Meghan, perhaps Finding Freedom will provide some insights.

Two photos show the celebrated actor on stage in the middle of his play while in another photo, he is seen wearing round glasses and lighting a cigarette.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan's elder son Babil Khan shares some unseen vintage pictures of his father from his National School of Drama days and they are sure to make you miss Khan even more
Irrfan Khan's death came as a big blow to the entire film industry. The actor succumbed to cancer last week and passed away in Mumbai's Kokilaben Ambani Hospital. Fans and celebrities are still mourning the irreparable loss. However, Irrfan's elder son Babil is making it a point to spread positivity and happiness amid such distressing times, by sharing some of the other precious pictures and videos of the late actor. Well, his latest post is no less than a priceless treasure.
The vintage pictures see a young Irrfan Khan from his National School of Drama days when he learnt the art of acting. The first picture is a candid shot that sees the Hindi Medium actor sitting on the ground with specs on and a cigarette in his mouth. Moving onto the next picture, a handsome Irrfan was seated on the top, as he practiced with his colleagues.  The last picture had Irrfan amid his performance or another practice session. It is impressive how Irrfan's expressions even then were convincing and top-notch, hence we aren't surprised the actor wowed all of us with her spectacular performances on the big screen. We miss him so much already!
Babil's caption read, "NSD."  Fans and stars were quick to pour in their love. Prior to this, Babil had shared an endearing video of Irrfan having pani puri with the caption, "When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri."
Check out his posts below:
On the next day of Irrfan's demise, Babil had shared a heartwarming letter thanking everyone for their support. He had written, "I'm deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although, I hope you understand that right now I'm not being able to reply because my vocabulary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much! I love you.” (ALSO READ - Irrfan Khan's Family Keeps His Twitter Account Alive, Wife Sutapa Sikdar, Sons Babil-Ayaan Khan Post Heart-Wrenching Letter)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan left a gaping hole in not just Bollywood, but in world cinema too. While fans were shattered when news broke out of the Maqbool actor passing away, it was his family who suffered the most. While the late actor’s wife Sutapa Sikder wrote an emotional letter on the actor’s demise, his son Babil too shared his heartfelt condolences.
While Babil had earlier shared a moving video that saw Irrfan Khan gorging on Pani Puri at a fancy restaurant, he has given fans yet another treat to the Maqbool actor’s NSD days.
Taking to his social media handle, Babil has shared some black and white photos from Irrfan Khan’s National School of Drama (NSD) days. Take a look at the post here:
The NSD had released an official statement on Irrfan Khan’s demise that read, “Not only the National School of Drama has lost one of its meritorious members, Irrfan’s demise is a big loss to the Indian art and cinema fraternity.”
Irrfan Khan had a long and painful battle against cancer to which he eventually succumbed on 29th April at the Kokilaben Ambani hospital, where he was admitted for a colon infection.
Babil has thanked all the fans and admirers of Irrfan Khan for the love and respect that they have showered on the deceased actor. Babil’s statement read, “I’m deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although I hope you understand that right now I’m not being able to reply because my vocabolary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much. I love you.”
Our heart reaches out to Irrfan Khan’s family and may God bless them with strength and courage to deal with these difficult days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sarah Hyland And Wells Adams Admit They Have ‘No Wedding Plans’ – Here’s Why!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">They may be very in love and happy together but Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams are not in a massive hurry to tie the knot after getting engaged back in July of last year. As fans of the famous pair know, they have been in self-isolation together amid this coronavirus, COVID-19 global pandemic and during a new interview, Wells admitted they are yet to plan their wedding despite all the free time they have in quarantine.
Of course, they can’t really do much about their future nuptials at this point because of the outbreak but they don’t even want to plan anything until the problem is all gone!
The two gave a joint interview to Access yesterday, Wells saying that: ‘There are no wedding plans. I think the thought was that we would originally start thinking about it around this time, and now that this [the pandemic] is happening, you know, what is the point of even trying to get anything solidified with everything being so up in the air?’
The former Bachelorette contestant then made it clear that they would never do a live-streamed wedding via an app such as Zoom, even if the quarantine went on for a really long time.
Instead, they would maybe have a really small backyard ceremony but he did mention that even that was highly unlikely.
He went on to jokingly explain the reason why, saying that ‘there are too many ABC personalities that need to give us gifts. Ty Burell, I need a new fishing rod and Chris Harrison, I need some crystal.’
As for the location of their future wedding, he and Sarah are yet to decide anything and have been ‘throwing out all options.’
What really matters for them is their relationship here and now and the man confirmed things are going great!
‘This is a really good test, if we can get through quarantine together, we can get through anything. And so far, so good. We haven’t had a fight,’ Wells also mentioned during the interview.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sarah Hyland & Wells Adams Reveal Why They Currently Have ‘No Wedding Plans’ — Watch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sarah Hyland, 29, and Wells Adams, 35, are not moving forth with their future wedding until the issues brought on by the coronavirus pandemic are gone. The actor sat down for a tell-all interview while in quarantine with the actress and admitted that although they’ve been engaged since July 2019, they haven’t started any wedding planning and the stay-at-home orders that have been in effect in most U.S. states, have put a halt on things even more.
“There are no wedding plans. I think the thought was that we’d originally start thinking about that around this time and now that this is happening, you know, what’s the point of even trying to get something solidified with everything being so up in the air?” Wells said during an at-home video interview with Access on May 1.
He went to also admit that even if time in quarantine goes on for a long time, he and Sarah would never do a livestream wedding on the Zoom app and would instead maybe do something small in a backyard, but he still thinks even that is unlikely. “If it lasts really really long I think that we would do like a really small backyard thing but that’s probably not gonna happen,” he explained before cheekily saying “there’s too many ABC personalities that need to give us gifts.” “Ty Burell, I need a new fly fishing rod and Chris Harrison, I need some crystal,” he joked.
Wells also revealed that he and Sarah have been “throwing out all options” for the location of the wedding, but “haven’t decided anything” just yet. “This is a really good test, if we can get through quarantine together, we can get through anything,” the reality star said about their current situation. “And so far, so good. We haven’t had a fight.”
Sarah and Wells may not be stuck in quarantine and not in wedding planning mode just yet, but the lovebirds “can’t wait” to get hitched. “Sarah and Wells can’t wait to make things official and know it will be special no matter what,” a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. The couple excitingly got engaged during a romantic trip on a private island in Fiji almost two years after they first started dating in Sept. 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'He was gutted really'... the perfect proposal ruined by lockdown, and what it's like to get engaged in a pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For most couples, engagements are a time for celebration, usually surrounded by those we love most.
Whether it be a party or a fancy meal, they often take months of careful planning to ensure the day is one to remember. 
For one Salford pair, their engagement was certainly memorable – but not for reasons they would have liked. 
Craig Moran popped the question to his now-fiancé Lisa Potts on March 21. 
The couple had plans to jet off to Portugal on April 12 before their holiday was cancelled. 
Craig, 37, had the intention of bringing Lisa's daughter along to include her in their special day. 
He had the idea of asking 11-year-old Alara to write out a proposal in the sand before calling her mum over to see it. 
The holiday was booked, the ring was purchased – but his plans were shattered by coronavirus.
As lockdown measures were put into place, panic started to set in for a worried Craig. 
There were concerns he wouldn't be able to alter or return the ring before the jewellery shops closed.
As the deadline to return the ring approached, Craig got down on one knee in front of NHS worker Lisa at their home on one ordinary afternoon. 
Lisa, 36, said: “He had a chat with my dad that morning and said he was going to have to do it that day because he might need to take the ring back if it was too small or something.
“He said he wanted to do it at a restaurant instead, but he saw they were all closing and said he had no other option. 
“I was writing a Mother's Day card out for my mum and he came over to me and got down on one knee. 
“He said there was something special he wanted to do on holiday. 
“Because I wasn’t expecting it, I carried on writing the card.
“He started getting emotional and I was emotional!” 
The couple, who have been together since June 2018, celebrated that night by having a couple of drinks at home.
Lisa, who works in adult social care, said the celebration felt “strange” as they were unable to see their families and friends. 
She continued: “He was gutted really, it’s just one of those things. 
“It’s not about where it is, as long as we’re happy.
“It is different because we couldn’t go out and celebrate. 
“We probably wouldn’t have had a party, but would have gone for food and drinks with family and friends. 
“But under this pandemic, we couldn’t do any of that. 
“It was quite difficult and it’s strange because it feels like you haven’t really celebrated, you just have this ring and you’re engaged and no one has acknowledged it apart from a post on Facebook. 
“It’s quite sad, but it is what it is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gil Schwartz, Former CBS Communications Exec, Dies at 68</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gil Schwartz, former chief communications officer for CBS and a longtime executive for the company, has died. He was 68. 
The network on Sunday announced that Schwartz died Saturday morning of natural causes at his home in Santa Monica. 
"For the better part of three decades, Gil Schwartz led CBS Communications with creative flare, craftsman-like expertise and an abundance of personality. He was a counselor to senior management, a mentor to future PR executives and a popular presence in every hallway. His diverse and sophisticated repertoire ranged from artful media relations and gifted wordsmithing skills to an inciteful and humorous view of the media world he loved," the network in a statement.
"Gil will long be remembered by the many teams he led across entertainment, news, sports and the corporate world. Our deepest sympathies are with his wife Laura, his children, grandchildren and his entire family." 
Schwartz served as CBS Corp.'s chief communications officer and executive vp since 2006 before announcing his retirement in in 2018 (Dana McClintock was promoted to take Schwartz's place).
Born on May 20, 1951, in New York City to Bill and Ruth Schwartz, Schwartz grew up in New Rochelle before attending Brandeis University, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in theater arts and English. Passionate about art and poetry, Schwartz began his professional life as a poet, playwright and actor. He was one of the founders of The Next Move, an improv troupe in Boston. Apart from writing and theater, Schwartz was also a well-versed musician (playing instruments such as the guitar, clarinet and piano) and enjoyed photography.
He first joined CBS in 1996 as senior vp communications after working with Westinghouse Broadcasting for 14 years. During his time at CBS, Schwartz oversaw public relations, media relations, and also the corporate and internal communications functions.
In 2014, he was also named chief communications officer and senior executive vp at CBS Interactive. 
Outside CBS, Schwartz was recognized for having a long-running column in Esquire and Fortune magazines. He wrote a number of novels under the pen name Stanley Bing, including Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them; You Look Nice Today; Lloyd – What Happened and Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story. Schwartz wrote a total of 13 business books. 
He is survived by his wife of 14 years, Laura Svienty; daughter Nina Pajak (Matt Pajak); son Will Schwartz (Jean Moylan); stepson Kyle Bender; stepdaughter Rachel Bender; granddaughter Vivien; grandson Sam; brother Michael Schwartz (Trisha Schwartz); and niece Brianna Schwartz.
In lieu of flowers, friends who wish to honor his memory are encouraged to make donations to lafoodbank.org, foodbanknyc.org or sfmfoodbank.org. A memorial service will take place this fall.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gil Schwartz, aka humorist Stanley Bing, has died at 68</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gil Schwartz, the longtime CBS communications executive who wrote humorous novels and columns under the pen name Stanley Bing, has died. He was 68.
CBS representatives said Sunday that Schwartz died Saturday at his home in Santa Monica, California. His death, they said, was unexpected, but due to natural causes.
Schwartz had a distinguished nearly 40-year career in corporate America with CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse Broadcasting. He retired in 2018 from his post as senior executive vice president and chief communications officer of CBS Corporation.
But unlike most of his peers, Schwartz had a once-secret and then public side career as a lauded humorist and writer of 13 books who satirized the business world he was part of. Under the pseudonym Stanley Bing, Schwartz wrote a column in Esquire for 13 years and then in Fortune. One, “Executive Summary: Stanley Bing,” from 1991, describes an unwelcome 40th birthday in the style of a corporate presentation.
“You’ll have to excuse me if I sound a little morose. I am morose,” he wrote. “This corporation recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary of operations. Quite a few parties were held in its honor, and they succeeded in getting this speaker somewhat depressed in the way that only enforced merriment truly can.”
Although he was able to hold the dual identities in secret for a while, in the 1990s, it became “the most poorly held secret in the media business.”
Advertising
“Bing’s” books included “Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them,” “You Look Nice Today,” “Lloyd: What Happened,” and “Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story.”
Born in New York City in 1951, Schwartz studied theater arts and English at Brandeis University. He was a renaissance man: A poet, playwright, actor, guitarist and photographer of birds, food and travel.
Schwartz is survived by his wife of 14 years, Laura Svienty, two children, two step children and two grandchildren. The statement says a memorial service will take place in the fall. In lieu of flowers, the family requests anyone seeking to honor Schwartz donate to lafoodbank.org, foodbanknyc.org or sfmfoodbank.org.

But unlike most of his peers, Schwartz had a once-secret and then public side career as a lauded humorist and writer of 13 books who satirized the business world he was part of. Under the pseudonym Stanley Bing, Schwartz wrote a column in Esquire for 13 years and then in Fortune. One, “Executive Summary: Stanley Bing,” from 1991, describes an unwelcome 40th birthday in the style of a corporate presentation.
“You’ll have to excuse me if I sound a little morose. I am morose,” he wrote. “This corporation recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary of operations. Quite a few parties were held in its honor, and they succeeded in getting this speaker somewhat depressed in the way that only enforced merriment truly can.”
Although he was able to hold the dual identities in secret for a while, in the 1990s, it became “the most poorly held secret in the media business.”
“Bing’s” books included “Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them,” “You Look Nice Today,” “Lloyd: What Happened,” and “Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story.”
Born in New York City in 1951, Schwartz studied theater arts and English at Brandeis University. He was a renaissance man: A poet, playwright, actor, guitarist and photographer of birds, food and travel.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Beckham has given fans a glimpse of her family’s celebration for husband David’s birthday.
The star turned 45 on Saturday and enjoyed the day with his family at home.
Victoria, 46, who recently reversed her decision to furlough staff at her fashion label, posted a video of David blowing out candles on a cake.
“Happy Birthday David Beckham!! We we love you so, so much,” she wrote.
Their children – apart from Brooklyn Beckham who is in lockdown in the US with his girlfriend – could be heard singing “Happy birthday” with David joking it should be a “bit more upbeat”.
Victoria also posted an old snap of the couple walking their dogs in Manchester.
“Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago.
“Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much,” she said.
Victoria declared David to be the “best daddy” and wrote: “Celebrating in lockdown and missing Brooklyn Beckham and all our friends and family today.”
And she also showed off the personalised wrapping paper containing David’s presents.
“I’m quite obsessed with it,” she said of the paper, featuring his face.
Victoria made a U-turn about furloughing staff at her fashion label following controversy over the decision.

The singer had originally been set to embark on her High Road Tour in April, but postponed it amid the outbreak.
On Friday, she announced it had been cancelled, saying it is “no longer feasible” to aim for a 2020 tour and would aim to tour next year.
Writing on Instagram, she said: “This is heartbreaking, but the safety of my fans & crew is my number 1 priority.
“Because of the current situation, doing this tour in 2020 is no longer feasible. But that doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate and express ourselves together in spirit and online. I will do my best to bring you all as much art and music as I can, as we get through this all together.”
All purchased tickets will be refunded, Kesha said.
The star, whose hits include Tik Tok and Die Young, added: “I truly can’t wait to get back on the road again and play songs from High Road for you. Thank you for being here, and for your understanding. Please stay tuned for more info about new tour dates in 2021.
“I’m going to boogie with you SO hard next year. Stay well and stay strong, wishing all of you health!  XOXO. at the end of a storm comes a rainbow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Film fans prepare to ‘feel the force’ on Star Wars Day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Movie fans around the world are preparing to mark Star Wars Day.
The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with aficionados wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Fans refer to the movies’ famous phrase May The Force Be With You by declaring “May the Fourth be with you”.
Last year, after the death of Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew, his family shared a special message, saying that “May the 4th is a tribute to the scale of Star Wars reach”.
Entertainment giant Disney+ is putting the final instalment in the Skywalker saga, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, on its platform on the day.
The Rise Of Skywalker was released in December and featured a star-studded cast including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver.
It received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 52% score on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film earned just over one billion dollars at the global box office, making it less successful than both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE superstar John Cena pays homage to Irrfan Khan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WWE superstar John Cena shared a post on social media for Bollywood legend Irrfan Khan, who passed away on April 29 after a prolonged battle with cancer.
Cena, who is a 16-time WWE champion, is now a full-time actor. However, the Cenation leader has never worked with Irrfan, who featured in several Hollywood films. Irrfan’s first big break was in British Indian filmmaker Asif Kapadia’s film The Warrior (2001).
Cena’s tribute to Irrfan has gained a lot of attention on social media. A couple of days back, Cena had also posted a photo of late Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor. Here is Cena’s post for the Bollywood legend-
When he visited The Indian Express in 2013, the actor, who had already won a Padma Shri for his acting performances, said he had chosen to pursue acting over sports since he felt he could pursue it for longer.
In 2017, Irrfan appeared on the chat show Son of Abish and spoke about his love for sports and how he was forced to give up on cricket.
“I wanted to become a cricketer and make a career out of it. I was an all-rounder and the youngest one in my team in Jaipur. While I did love batting more, our captain liked my bowling and thereby made me a bowler,” said Irrfan, a self-proclaimed MS Dhoni fan.
He is survived by his wife, Sutapa Sikder, and sons Babil and Ayan. He last appeared in Hindi film Angrezi Medium, a sequel to the hit Hindi Medium that he had starred in.

He recently took to his Instagram and gave a tribute to late actor Rishi Kapoor, who passed away on the 30th of April. John just shared a picture of the veteran without living any message and now, he has done the same for late Irrfan Khan.
Actor Irrfan Khan passed away on the 29th of April and fans from all across the world mourned his loss. Apart from his brilliant acting skills, Irrfan was always praised for his down-to-earth nature, which is why he was so popular amongst Hollywood celebs too. Recently, John Cena paid his special tribute to the versatile performer.
John Cena shared a picture of Irrfan from Life Of Pi movie from his Instagram account. Just like in the case of Rishiji, he didn’t caption the image but his picture spoke a lot.
Just like John Cena, a lot of celebrities from around the world paid tribute to him. Hollywood actors like Angelina Jolie, Chris Pratt, Natalie Portman and many others remembered him and offered condolences.
Meanwhile, speaking about late Rishi Kapoor, Cena gave him a tribute by sharing a smiling picture of him. He did not caption it but fans have left comments on it.
One wrote: “Legend posting about legend.”
Another wrote: “Legend never dies #RipRishiKapoor.”
This is not the first time that Cena has posted a picture of a Bollywood celebrity. During “Bigg Boss 13”, he had taken to Instagram to post a picture of season contestant, model Asim Riaz. Back then, too, Cena did not caption the picture.

For the season's registration promo, Bachchan shot the video from his home, remotely directed by "Dangal" helmer Nitesh Tiwari.
Sony Entertainment Television announced that registrations will commence for the latest season from May 9 till May 22, where Bachchan will ask one new question every night on Sony TV, which can be answered either through SMS or through Sony LIV.
"For the first time in the history of KBC, the entire screening and selection will be managed digitally...This is the season of firsts and we are confident that this season will redefine the power of knowledge," Amit Raisinghani, Head - Business Planning and Communication, Sony Entertainment Television said in a statement.
The second step would be screening, where participants who have answered the registration questions correctly and have been shortlisted by the randomiser based on certain pre-defined reservation criteria, will be reached out to, telephonically, for further assessment.
The third step will be online audition on general knowledge test aided by a video submission.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why A Movie Like 'Dreamland' From 'Hollywood' Took So Much Longer To Get Made</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spoilers ahead for Season 1 of Hollywood. At the end of Netflix's Hollywood, production begins on Dreamland, a movie written by Henry Willson about two men who fall in love. It's positioned as the first film about a same-sex love story, but the only realistic thing about it is that it stars a straight actor as one half of the gay couple. The premise would have been unheard of for a major motion picture in the 1940s.
Though the first same-sex movie kiss is actually considered to have happened quite early, in the 1927 silent film Wings, a production code was put into place from roughly 1930 through 1968 that required movies to be more "wholesome" and "moral," and to encourage what the studios called "correct thinking," per NPR.
Hollywood takes place in roughly 1948, when the code would have prevented a movie like Dreamland from being made for mainstream audiences. But the Netflix show reimagines a history in which it could have been. It also rewrites Dreamland star Rock Hudson's story. In Hollywood, he comes out with his fictional boyfriend Archie Coleman at the 20th Academy Awards and then gets to star in gay love story. In reality, he was a closeted gay man whose sexuality wasn't made public until he died from AIDS-related complications in 1985. It's also taken the film industry a lot longer to properly represent gay people onscreen.
Wings was not a movie about a gay couple. The kiss was shared between a dying soldier and his comrade, who insisted they were just really good friends. Movies specifically about gay relationships didn't come to the forefront until the late '60s and early '70s, once the repressive production code had been lifted.
One of the first films to authentically portray gay life was the 1970 film The Boys in the Band. It helped paved the way for more representation, including modern films like Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Moonlight (2016), both gay films that also received awards show recognition.
Still, there's a long way to go. Hollywood needs to make all kinds of movies by and about gay people: harrowing coming out tales, cheesy rom-coms, and everything in between. Movies like The Thing About Harry (2020) and Love, Simon (2018) have helped to move the needle, but those are both male love stories. Gay women, bisexual people, nonbinary people, and transgender people also need to be fully represented across all races and stories before true equality can be achieved.
Perhaps if movies like Dreamland had been able to be made back in the '40s, we'd be looking at a much different movie landscape today.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg to Produce ‘Bubble’, Another Animated Film For Adults</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the United States, animation still has the reputation of being largely for children. But an entire medium of artistic expression shouldn’t be relegated to one demographic, and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are trying to help make that clear to audiences. The duo, who co-wrote and produced 2016’s outrageous animated feature Sausage Party, is getting back into animation by producing Bubble, an animated film based on the podcast of the same name. Get the details below.
According to Variety, Rogen and Goldberg – whose credits are so ingrained in the American comedy consciousness that you don’t need me to list them here – will join with Matt Tolmach (Venom, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) to produce a Bubble movie based on the scripted comedy podcast from the popular Maximum Fun podcast network. Jordan Morris, who created the podcast, will write the film’s script, and the movie is being described as an animated film for mature audiences.
Bubble was an eight-episode podcast that began in 2018. Here’s its official description:
You can listen to all eight episodes here. Morris has writing credits on Honest Trailers, @midnight, multiple Rooster Teeth projects, the LEGO Movie spin-off series Unikitty!, and is also well-known for his podcast Jordan, Jesse, Go!, which has been running for well over a decade (it started in 2007, long before podcasts were commonplace). If this film heads to theaters, it will mark his debut theatrical feature.
Even if you haven’t seen Sausage Party, you probably remember the headlines it made upon release. Rogen and Goldberg and their team put together a truly bonkers movie in which sentient foods at a grocery store interrogate ideas of sex and religion, and the results are incredibly vulgar and surprisingly profound. I encourage you to seek out that film if you skipped it – just make sure kids aren’t in the room (unless you have a very different idea of what’s acceptable than my parents did).
This shouldn’t be nearly as controversial as Sausage Party, but I’m glad to see Rogen and Goldberg jump back into animation and continue to shatter the incorrect idea that animation is just kids’ stuff with a bone thrown to adults by Pixar every once in a while.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TV for Sunday, May 3</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Audio from a rare interview, movie posters, clips and archival footage are curated with a Kubrick-like aesthetic in homage to the late, great film director, in what is much more than a tribute to an iconic collection of work. For those familiar with the films synonymous with events and changing times, there is yet more to grasp about their greater meaning, and about how the master approached his subject. For the uninitiated, this is a tantalising introduction.
Who knew that dance floor anthems lent themselves so well to room renovation reveals? Every time Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen and his judging entourage stride into a space transformed by upcycled timber and statement wallpaper, it’s to a blast of soaring vocals declaring unbridled passion. Tonight, mother-and-son team Lenore and Bradley might need more than disco power if they can’t fix their last-minute supply issues at the makeover of Tanya and Dave’s home.
Having got the country giggling with his genius lockdown stunt, Zoom meeting crasher Hamish Blake remains on fire in this friendly format that seems made just for him. And for the deft of finger of course, the remaining five of which tonight stare down another tough elimination challenge, this time involving sculpture. Don’t let anyone say this pastime is mere child’s play. Some of the creations this lot produces are gallery worthy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Weber Said He "Finally Got It Right" After Going IG Official With Kelley Flanagan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following a romantic roller coaster on his season of The Bachelor, Peter Weber says he "finally got it right" with Kelley Flanagan, as per Entertainment Tonight. Kelley, who first appeared on Peter's season of The Bachelor, but was eliminated before hometown dates, was first rumored to be dating the former star after the two were spotted together in Chicago. In April, Peter addressed the dating rumors during an episode of Nick Viall's podcast Viall Files, conceding the two were seeing each other but were, "taking it really, really slow."
On Saturday, Peter confirmed his relationship with Kelley on Instagram, sharing a photo of the two kissing in an airplane. He wrote: "You caught me. Let the adventure begin." Meanwhile, Kelley made the relationship Instagram official as well, posting a throwback photo of a lanyard she'd convinced the Swedish DJ Kygo to sign, reading, "Pilot Pete — don't be dumb, pick Kelley!" In the caption Kelley wrote, "Throwback to when I met Kygo in August and got him to sign this lanyard to gift to Peter on the show!"
Peter and Kelley's romance might be a bit of a surprise to fans of the ABC reality show. During the two-part finale, Peter proposed to Hannah Ann Sluss, only to break off the engagement weeks later. Instead, he rekindled his relationship with runner-up Madison Prewett, much to the disapproval of his mom. The two parted ways days after the final episode aired. Meanwhile, Kelley placed fifth on the show, but the two reportedly reconnected on a serendipitous night out post-Bachelor, according to ET.
In April, Kelley shared her perspective on why they didn't connect as deeply on The Bachelor. During an interview with the Almost Famous podcast, Kelley hypothesized Bachelor producers weren't thrilled she had a chance encounter with Peter ahead of filming, and that the showrunners sabotaged the relationship, as per Vulture. "I saw him, things were getting in his head that he wasn’t able to make his own decision, and it just kind of p*ssed me off," Kelley told the hosts. She added that the show's producers reportedly encouraged Peter to eliminate her, especially considering the attorney was less willing to go along with reality-television shenanigans.
In April, Chris Harrison confessed the show wasn't an ideal format for the couple's relationship to flourish. "I'll take a little blame for this, the show wasn't perfect for that relationship. I don't think Kelley was right for the show," Harrison said to ET. He added that Kelley "fought the concept" and that it "was tough for her to not be in her own head."
Kelley and Peter might not have had onscreen chemistry, but it turns out the two make a good match away from the cameras.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Weber Finally Confirms Romance With Kelley Flanagan On Social Media — ‘Let The Adventure Begin’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like Peter Weber, 28, and Kelley Flanagan, 28, have finally decided to take their friendship a step further and become a couple! Peter seemed to confirm the rumors that the two of them are dating when he shared a new photo to Instagram on May 2 along with a telling caption. In the pic, the former Bachelor star can be seen sitting with the former contestant in either a small plane or helicopter and he has his arm around her and is kissing her. “You caught me. Let the adventure begin 💫,” he captioned it while also tagging Kelley in the pic.
The confirmation comes after Peter admitted he was just good friends with Kelley, who he’s been quarantining with along with Bachelorette star Dustin Kendrick, in early April. He addressed the dating rumors then after they came up due to the two of them spending a lot of time together once The Bachelor finished filming. “Are we dating? No,” Peter said on the Apr. 7 episode of Ben Higgins and Ashley Iaconetti’s  Almost Famous podcast “I’m the first person to admit that I’ve been through so much. The last thing I need to do is jump into another relationship.”
Before spending time with Kelley, Peter made headlines when he ended up getting engaged to Hannah Ann Sluss at the end of his Bachelor season in 2019 but they broke up weeks later. He then attempted a relationship with another contestant, Madison Prewett but they also broke up only days later and by the end of Mar., he was hanging out with Kelley. “Kelley’s just someone that is just, honestly, there for me, and someone that I just really really appreciate,” Peter further reveled in the podcast. “I’m trying to be there for her and we just get along really well. We have good chemistry. Who knows what the future holds. I’m not saying nothing could happen. But right now, I’m just taking things really slow and enjoying each other’s time.”
Kelley has yet to say anything about her new romance with Peter but we can bet that she will soon! We’ll be on the lookout and wish them both happiness!

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Bachelor’s Peter Weber and Kelley Flanagan Are Dating Because Relationships Mean Nothing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sure, why not. Weeks after the duo was spotted on a very cozy date and definitely not quarantining in Chicago, The Bachelor’s Peter Weber and Kelley Flanagan have officially confirmed that they’re dating. Weber posted on Instagram over the weekend to share the news, saying that Flanagan “caught me” and he can’t wait to “let the adventure begin.” Following the finale of his Bachelor season two months ago, Weber and his indecisive behavior have rotated through three women: He was engaged to Hannah Ann Sluss for a few weeks, before dumping her to pursue a relationship with runner-up contestant Madison Prewett. (A decision that was met with furious disapproval from his mom.) However, days later Weber and Prewett announced their “mutual decision” to break-up, which initiated Weber’s interest in rekindling things with Flanagan, who was eliminated this season prior to the hometown episodes.
Flanagan has been unusually candid of late about how little she enjoyed filming her Bachelor season, saying that the show’s producers fed her “bullshit” about Weber’s feelings. She now believes this was due to how, by complete coincidence, she ran into Weber at a hotel lobby days before filming began, giving the duo a rare pre-season connection. “I told Peter, ‘They don’t let me see you. They locked me up in a closet for three hours last week, and they won’t let me see you,’” she told the Almost Famous podcast. “I said, ‘You clearly know they push some people forward and they don’t push others forward.’ It’s just — I saw him, things were getting in his head that he wasn’t able to make his own decision, and it just kind of pissed me off.” Flanagan added that the producers were constantly “in his head” and encouraged Weber to eliminate her as the season progressed, given that she wasn’t as made-for-reality-TV friendly as other contestants. (Flanagan is an attorney who did not act like a messy bitch who lived for the drama.)
Here’s hoping the third time is actually the charm, but if not, whatever.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disha Patani To Flaunt Her Killer Moves In An Item Song For Allu Arjun’s Pushpa?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Disha Patani is all set to make a comeback in Tollywood. Yes, you heard it right! The Bollywood diva, who made her debut with 2015 Telugu film Loafer, is gearing up to raise the temperature with her killer moves. As per rumours Disha, who is currently busy with her Bollywood projects, will also be a part of Allu Arjun's Pushpa. She will be sharing screen space with the Stylish Star for an item number in the action-thriller. If the rumour has anything to go by, the movie will mark her re-entry after five years of Puri Jagannadh's directorial, Loafer.
On a related note, Pushpa will have South diva Rashmika Mandanna essaying the female lead. There were also rumours suggesting that Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna will not be romantically paired in the film, which disappointed many fans. The makers rubbished the rumour saying that there is no second actress in the highly anticipated thriller. There is also buzz that Bollywood star Suniel Shetty will be essaying the antagonist in the film. Well, an official confirmation about the cast is awaited from the makers' side. Earlier, Vijay Sethupathi had walked out of the project citing creative difference with the team. He has been replaced with Kannada actor Dhananjay to reprise the role.
The first look poster, unveiled on Allu Arjun's birthday, showed a rough and tough rugged look of the actor, which stirred the excitement of his fans. Adding to the thrill, it is rumoured that he will be sporting a stylish avatar of a don in the action-thriller for a flashback sequence. Pushpa bankrolled by Mythri Movie Makers, will arrive in the theatres next year. However, the release date is yet to be confirmed.
Coming back to Disha Patani, the actress will next be seen in KTina directed by Ashima Chibber and Prabhu Deva's Radhe alongside Salman Khan. Radhe's release has been reportedly postponed from Eid to an indefinite date due to the ongoing pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Allu Arjun’s unequivocal dancing skills have been the talk of the film industry recently when superstar Hrithik Roshan, the Greek God of Bollywood who is a terrific dancer himself said that Allu Arjun’s dance is inspiring and energetic.
Presently, as reported by some media articles, Bollywood actress, the hottest Instagram sensation, Disha Patani might shake a leg with the stylish star in his upcoming movie ‘Pushpa‘ with director Sukumar.
Disha Patani is not just famous for her hottest body but also for her dancing skills. She has a flexible body and every dance movement sinks in effortlessly. No doubt, she would make a terrific dance partner for Allu Arjun.
But, let’s not make haste and therefore, let’s wait for the official confirmation on the same. However, we are going to keep our fingers crossed hoping that Allu Arjun indeed gets his match (dancing) from Bollywood.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actors Priyank Sharma and Benafsha Soonawala are enjoying the lockdown period by indulging in what they love the most — dancing and singing. Benafsha took to Instagram to post a video in which Priyank is seen dancing and she is singing.
Priyank Sharma and Benafsha Soonawala have been rumoured to be together since a very long time now but it was just a few weeks ago that they confirmed their relationship by making it Insta-official.
Priyank made his relationship with “Bigg Boss 11” housemate Benafsha Sonawala official with a mushy post on his official Instagram handle. In the photo, the two were seen cosied-up, with Priyank’s lips on her cheek. He simply captioned it: “Confirmation”, with a red heart emoji.
Benafsha Sonawala also used the same image and got a little musical for the caption. She used pop star Justin Bieber’s song to describe her emotion: “Can’t nobody keep me like you, Call it unconventional, My love is habitual.”
Priyank Sharma and Benafsha Sonawala got close during their stint in the Salman Khan hosted reality show Bigg Boss 11. The rumour mill had been buzzing ever since about a possibility of the duo being committed to each other which they eventually confirmed only a while back.

While in another post he had thanked Krishna and Ayesha Shroff, “Thank you both for the amazing company through these crazy times. Blessed to have you both in my life. See you again soon.” Eban has been posting glimpses of his quarantine life in Sydney.
Speaking about her family accepting Eban, Krishna told Mumbai Mirror in an interview, “They don’t interfere much, they trust my judgement. Families eventually do get involved, but I’d like to take my time and keep it between us for now.”

Recently, Himanshi was seen flaunting a huge diamond ring, which made everyone wonder if Asim proposed her for marriage!

During their stay in the Bigg Boss 13 house, initially, Himanshi treated Asim as her good friend and had even said that she is committed. But after she got eliminated, she broke-up with her boyfriend. When she re-entered the house, she too was seen expressing her feelings for Asim. The duo had taken some time to understand each other after their exit from the house. The couple was also seen in a music video, Kalla Sohna Nai, which has already grabbed 54M views.
They have also done a photoshoot together and graced magazine cover. Often, they share pictures together on social media. Now, during the lockdown, as they can't meet each other, they are seen exchange messages on social media.
Looks like now they know each other quite well. Hence, AsiManshi fans are eagerly waiting for the couple to take their relationship to the next level!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Kapoor family is dealing with a huge loss and so is the entire film industry. Last week on April 30, 2020, we lost veteran Rishi Kapoor, who succumbed to leukaemia after battling against it for almost two years. The sudden demise of the actor has left a void in the film industry. Cinephiles across the country are mourning the big loss.
Unable to attend the funeral, Rishi Kapoor’s daughter, Riddhima Sahni took to social media to express her grief. She was in Delhi when the funeral rites were performed on April 30. She reached Mumbai last night to attend the final prayer meet held for her father.
Today she shared a throwback picture with the entire family in one frame. The late Rishi Kapoor is seen with wife Neetu Kapoor, daughter Riddhima, son Ranbir Kapoor and granddaughter Samara. The happy family portrait is a lovely click. She captioned the picture writing, “Miss you so much!”

In the picture, Rishi Kapoor can be seen smiling and enjoying a glass of whiskey.
On Thursday, the Kapoor family had shared a statement that read, “Our dear Rishi Kapoor passed away peacefully at 8:45 am IST in hospital today after a two-year battle with leukemia. The doctors and medical staff at the hospital said he kept them entertained to the last. He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him.”
Earlier today, Amitabh Bachchan also took to social media to remember his late friend. He shared a song from their last film together 102 Not Out.

'Will never forget the love you gave me. You taught me so much in the little time I had with you. Simply broken today. Lost for words. Love you and will miss you a lot. R.I.P. Papa 🙏❤️🌺', wrote Bharath.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Artists, athletes cling to their dreams on Havana's rooftops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HAVANA: These are hot, humid days in Havana. When the afternoon breeze sweeps in off the sea, William Roblejo steps onto the roof of his building, draws his bow across the strings of his violin, and runs through his repertoire of music to soothe an anxious city.
Access to a rooftop and a breeze is a coveted luxury in the Cuban capital, areas of which have been in lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic for several weeks.
On other Havana rooftops, the country's top ballet dancer rolls out a mat and runs through his positions and pirouettes, an Olympic pentathlete lunges at an imaginary rival with an epee, and a Greco-Roman wrestling champion pumps iron.

Cuba has imposed lockdowns only in certain barrios, but the government has called on people to stay home as the number of confirmed infections climbed above 1,500 this week with 64 deaths.
With temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius, water shortages in some areas of the capital and long lines at food stores, Cubans have grown more anxious under weeks of confinement.
Adrian Sanchez, first soloist at the National Ballet of Cuba, fears above all that his muscles and his posture, used to a daily nine-hour training regime, will atrophy.
"When all this is over we have to return to the ballet, and if we come back untrained, that will be very hard," said Sanchez, 22.
He practices "two or three hours" a day on the roof of his building, reached through a skylight and overlooking the iconic Revolution Square.
"That way the time goes by faster, and I don't feel I'm being locked up so long," he says.
Like everyone else, a good part of his day is spent queuing up for food.
After decades of living under a US blockade, Cubans are adept at making do, even under the most difficult of circumstances -- not least their athletes and performers who now have to find a way to pursue their dreams during the uncertainty fuelled by the pandemic.
Leydi Moya pulls out her epee to practice her fencing as part of her preparations for the next Olympic pentathlon event, whenever that may be.
Moya, youth Olympic champion in Singapore 2020 and triple-medallist at the Pan-American Games in Lima last year, was returning from a training camp in Mexico when the pandemic hit the region.
She knows that the makeshift training regimen she is reduced to at home is a far cry from Olympic-standard fitness training.
"Performance is going to drop," she admits.
It's a similar situation for Daniel Gregorich, a Pan-American champion in Greco-Roman wrestling at his 87 kg weight level, who made Cuba's Olympic team at a recent qualifying event in Ottawa, Canada.
"Sport is health, sport is life and at least it calms my anxiety," the 23-year-old said between sessions of lifting weights and doing push-ups.
Roblejo, the musician, is at times frustrated by not having his usual concert audience because "musicians are used to delivering art live."
But he is also grateful for some of the quarantine's gifts as he plays on his rooftop above the deserted barrio of Playa, where the lulling sounds of the sea are more noticeable now there is no traffic.
"I have to thank this quarantine a little bit, because I studied a bit more and I think I've advanced in my music. Now I want this to be over so that I can show it," said Rob Lejo, head of the string section of Havana's Conservatory.
In many ways, he admits to being "very happy. I've been locked up and playing alone at home for 20 or 25 days now."
Psychologist Patricia Ares, writing in Granma, the daily of the ruling Communist Party, said "all of us will have to learn to live with adversity.
"We cannot avoid the wind, but we can build windmills."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain’s Got Talent Judges wowed by 96-year-old singer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 96-year-old has wowed Britain’s Got Talent – getting the seal of approval from the judges.
Nora Barton, from West Yorkshire, took to the stage at the London Palladium.
Her daughter told the audience: “She’s sung for people all her life so at 96 this is a treat, this stage”.
After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and a huge cheer from the audience, Barton, who wore a flower in her hair and dressed in red, said: “Thank you very much”
Judge David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you’re full of life, laughter and joy and have entertained the nation at 96.”
Amanda Holden said it was a “very special audition” adding: “You’re a generation this country is built on.”
Simon Cowell said: “I didn’t like you very much – I loved you! I think we’ve got about 4,000 yeses Nora.”
Barton, who sang Loveliest Night of The Year, said she was “very pleased” to have been at the auditions.
The ITV show was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic and live episodes have been postponed.
Saturday’s show also featured mother and daughter duo Sammy, 43, and Honey, 14.
Honey said the pair had experienced a “tough” couple of years because “my mum got diagnosed with cancer. ”
Sammy said she is now “absolutely fine” and Honey told the judges: “I’m so grateful for everything. I never thought that when singing along in the car it would bring us to this stage.”
After Cowell told the pair to return with a different song, they impressed the judges with a “faultless” performance.
Holden pressed the golden buzzer, saying, “It was the most wonderful thing to witness”, with Cowell adding: “I’m going to remember that audition for a long, long time.”
The show also featured a children’s choir from Hampshire who performed a song about climate change.
“You are exactly what I was hoping we would find this year,” Cowell said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent Judges wowed by 96-year-old singer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 96-year-old has wowed Britain’s Got Talent – getting the seal of approval from the judges.
Nora Barton, from West Yorkshire, took to the stage at the London Palladium.
Her daughter told the audience: “She’s sung for people all her life so at 96 this is a treat, this stage”.
After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and a huge cheer from the audience, Barton, who wore a flower in her hair and dressed in red, said: “Thank you very much”
Judge David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you’re full of life, laughter and joy and have entertained the nation at 96.”
Amanda Holden said it was a “very special audition” adding: “You’re a generation this country is built on.”
Simon Cowell said: “I didn’t like you very much – I loved you! I think we’ve got about 4,000 yeses Nora.”
Barton, who sang Loveliest Night of The Year, said she was “very pleased” to have been at the auditions.
The ITV show was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic and live episodes have been postponed.
Saturday’s show also featured mother and daughter duo Sammy, 43, and Honey, 14.
Honey said the pair had experienced a “tough” couple of years because “my mum got diagnosed with cancer. ”
Sammy said she is now “absolutely fine” and Honey told the judges: “I’m so grateful for everything. I never thought that when singing along in the car it would bring us to this stage.”
After Cowell told the pair to return with a different song, they impressed the judges with a “faultless” performance.
Holden pressed the golden buzzer, saying, “It was the most wonderful thing to witness”, with Cowell adding: “I’m going to remember that audition for a long, long time.”
The show also featured a children’s choir from Hampshire who performed a song about climate change.
“You are exactly what I was hoping we would find this year,” Cowell said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Life in lockdown: Psychiatrist’s survival guide for ‘new bizarre, crazy world’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Are you tired of virtual chat and find yourself guzzling snacks and alcohol while fixating on grim death tolls?
You are not alone in this “new bizarre, crazy world” where primitive instincts can ride roughshod over reason, says consultant psychiatrist Mark Salter.
Mr Salter, from Hackney, east London, shares some survival tips in a BlueJeans online chat with lawyer Jill Greenfield, from Fieldfisher.
He said: “First of all you have to start with the fact we are looking at human beings who have brains, who have lives, who have minds.
“The brain or the mind is something that, by and large, likes stability and predictability.
“So, for most of us, when things are going well, our lives are predictable and vaguely manageable and that means we are switching to a relaxed frame of mind where we can measure, deliberate and take our time.”
Mr Salter said: “Anxiety is the mother of all mental illness – the mother of all unhappiness as well.
“Fear freezes our ability to reason. And that means we fall back on the more primitive, more frightening part of our brain, which is the bit that has been with us ever since we evolved from apes, which teaches us to look after Number One.
“That involves withdrawal, flight, isolation and also a lack of abstract thinking about solutions.”
The biological effect can disrupt normal sleep patterns and people turn to snacking over meals.
Mr Salter said: “We will reach for richer, sweeter foods. We will find ourselves nipping off to the fridge a bit more frequently – comfort-snacking.
“The very important thing that goes with the sleep cycle is the one or two meals a day cycle.
“We retreat to our favourite tranquiliser – usually alcohol.”
As “sociable creatures” the crisis has also meant withdrawing from the world and relying on electronic devices to communicate.
Remote working from home has forced those from different walks of life to rely on video conferencing over face-to-face chat.
“Those squeaks of the chair, those quiet sighs, those breaks of vision, those silent moments.
“Notice how silence seems so long on Skype, Blue Jeans, Zoom or whatever.
“It’s hard to read the meaning of silence because the silence is devoid of its context and that is a very unconscious, subtle manifestation of this creeping unfamiliarity which has already got us on edge as it is.”
He suggested sitting as close to the screen as possible, ensuring videos are well lit, and discussing the strange artificiality from the start.
He said: “Let silence take effect. Normally we interrupt prematurely.
“A good therapist will understand the importance of letting silence sink in.”
Using video conferencing is like speaking a foreign language, he said.
“As you will know when you are in a country for the first time and you are using your schoolgirl French – it’s exhausting.
“You can minimise that exhaustion, but it takes a lot of patience.”
He said the whole process requires more cognitive effort, meaning the brain burns more glucose.
“The act of trying to seem as if you are familiar with a situation in which you are relatively unfamiliar burns energy. It’s exhausting.
“That’s a reason why you have to look after your body.
“Watch what comes out of your mouth and what goes into it.”
He said maintaining a normal sleep cycle, having “down time”, keeping up with friends and getting out of the house are all important.
As humans in crisis, we look out for anything that is a threat or risk and become “sensitised” to events.
People are drawn to “trigger words” like Covid, death, disaster, ventilators, and PPE, which resonate in the “new bizarre, crazy world”, he said.
“There is an old line in the media: ‘If it bleeds, it leads’. In this case it’s ‘If it coughs, wheezes and dies, it leads’.
“So what we are doing is looking out for Covid-positive items.
“That is at the expense of looking out for things we probably would have looked out for elsewhere when we were more relaxed.
“If we are not careful, we can get into this terrible ‘pas de deux’ with the media.
“Psychologists call it an availability cascade. You are frightened; journalists know they can get your attention by giving you things that are frightening that will resonate with you.”
Mr Salter advises using trusted websites, stretching the brain and trying not to “soak up more of the same because of fearful fixity on a single subject”.
And just when we get used to the new normal, a fresh fear approaches – what will the world look like when we open our doors again?
Mr Salter supports clients who have been physically and psychologically injured following terror attacks, sexual abuse and road crashes.
Ms Greenfield said: “It’s vital that support doesn’t go away during lockdown. My team, Mark and other therapists like him offer invaluable contact via online platforms to keep people going.”

“So, for most of us, when things are going well, our lives are predictable and vaguely manageable and that means we are switching to a relaxed frame of mind where we can measure, deliberate and take our time.”
But in periods of rapid change, such as in a viral pandemic, anxiety begins to rack up, he said.
Mr Salter said: “Anxiety is the mother of all mental illness – the mother of all unhappiness as well.

As “sociable creatures” the crisis has also meant withdrawing from the world and relying on electronic devices to communicate.
Remote working from home has forced those from different walks of life to rely on video conferencing over face-to-face chat.
On the challenges of speaking to vulnerable clients from afar, Mr Salter said: “It’s very, very hard to reach out to establish and maintain an empathic, understanding, caring, even some may say loving, link with someone at the other end when you are not in the room.
“Those squeaks of the chair, those quiet sighs, those breaks of vision, those silent moments.
“Notice how silence seems so long on Skype, Blue Jeans, Zoom or whatever.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Life in lockdown: Psychiatrist’s survival guide for ‘new bizarre, crazy world’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mark Salter shares some tips for coping during the coronavirus pandemic.
Are you tired of virtual chat and find yourself guzzling snacks and alcohol while fixating on grim death tolls?
You are not alone in this “new bizarre, crazy world” where primitive instincts can ride roughshod over reason, says consultant psychiatrist Mark Salter.
Mr Salter, from Hackney, east London, shares some survival tips in a BlueJeans online chat with lawyer Jill Greenfield, from Fieldfisher.
He said: “First of all you have to start with the fact we are looking at human beings who have brains, who have lives, who have minds.
“The brain or the mind is something that, by and large, likes stability and predictability.
“So, for most of us, when things are going well, our lives are predictable and vaguely manageable and that means we are switching to a relaxed frame of mind where we can measure, deliberate and take our time.”
But in periods of rapid change, such as in a viral pandemic, anxiety begins to rack up, he said.
Mr Salter said: “Anxiety is the mother of all mental illness – the mother of all unhappiness as well.
“Fear freezes our ability to reason. And that means we fall back on the more primitive, more frightening part of our brain, which is the bit that has been with us ever since we evolved from apes, which teaches us to look after Number One.
“That involves withdrawal, flight, isolation and also a lack of abstract thinking about solutions.”
The biological effect can disrupt normal sleep patterns and people turn to snacking over meals.
Mr Salter said: “We will reach for richer, sweeter foods. We will find ourselves nipping off to the fridge a bit more frequently – comfort-snacking.
“The very important thing that goes with the sleep cycle is the one or two meals a day cycle.
“We retreat to our favourite tranquiliser – usually alcohol.”
As “sociable creatures” the crisis has also meant withdrawing from the world and relying on electronic devices to communicate.
Remote working from home has forced those from different walks of life to rely on video conferencing over face-to-face chat.
On the challenges of speaking to vulnerable clients from afar, Mr Salter said: “It’s very, very hard to reach out to establish and maintain an empathic, understanding, caring, even some may say loving, link with someone at the other end when you are not in the room.
“Those squeaks of the chair, those quiet sighs, those breaks of vision, those silent moments.
“Notice how silence seems so long on Skype, Blue Jeans, Zoom or whatever.
“It’s hard to read the meaning of silence because the silence is devoid of its context and that is a very unconscious, subtle manifestation of this creeping unfamiliarity which has already got us on edge as it is.”
He suggested sitting as close to the screen as possible, ensuring videos are well lit, and discussing the strange artificiality from the start.
He said: “Let silence take effect. Normally we interrupt prematurely.
“A good therapist will understand the importance of letting silence sink in.”
Using video conferencing is like speaking a foreign language, he said.
“As you will know when you are in a country for the first time and you are using your schoolgirl French – it’s exhausting.
“You can minimise that exhaustion, but it takes a lot of patience.”
He said the whole process requires more cognitive effort, meaning the brain burns more glucose.
“The act of trying to seem as if you are familiar with a situation in which you are relatively unfamiliar burns energy. It’s exhausting.
“That’s a reason why you have to look after your body.
“Watch what comes out of your mouth and what goes into it.”
He said maintaining a normal sleep cycle, having “down time”, keeping up with friends and getting out of the house are all important.
As humans in crisis, we look out for anything that is a threat or risk and become “sensitised” to events.
Mr Salter warned against developing an unhealthy fixation with negative news.
People are drawn to “trigger words” like Covid, death, disaster, ventilators, and PPE, which resonate in the “new bizarre, crazy world”, he said.
“There is an old line in the media: ‘If it bleeds, it leads’. In this case it’s ‘If it coughs, wheezes and dies, it leads’.
“So what we are doing is looking out for Covid-positive items.
“That is at the expense of looking out for things we probably would have looked out for elsewhere when we were more relaxed.
“If we are not careful, we can get into this terrible ‘pas de deux’ with the media.
“Psychologists call it an availability cascade. You are frightened; journalists know they can get your attention by giving you things that are frightening that will resonate with you.”
Mr Salter advises using trusted websites, stretching the brain and trying not to “soak up more of the same because of fearful fixity on a single subject”.
And just when we get used to the new normal, a fresh fear approaches – what will the world look like when we open our doors again?
Mr Salter supports clients who have been physically and psychologically injured following terror attacks, sexual abuse and road crashes.
Ms Greenfield said: “It’s vital that support doesn’t go away during lockdown. My team, Mark and other therapists like him offer invaluable contact via online platforms to keep people going.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">January Jones, 42, is looking better than ever while in quarantine and her latest photo proves it! The actress shared an eye-catching photo of herself smiling and posing in a green bikini while going for a morning swim and in it, she looked fantastic. She also wore sunglasses and jewelry, including hoop earrings and a necklace in the snapshot and used the caption for the photo to give a shout-out to her mom for her birthday. “Morning lap swim! Happy Birthday Mom! 💙” the caption read. The blonde beauty also shared a few pics from her lap to her Instagram story and left a caption that advised her followers by writing “don’t forget your flotation devices.”
It didn’t take long for fans to leave positive comments on January’s pic once she posted it. “Truly a beautiful woman 💙💚” one follower wrote while another agreed by writing “beautiful picture of you.” Others simply said, “Wow” and exclaimed that she is “so pretty!”
This isn’t the first time January stunned in something green. Who could forget her amazing green jumpsuit at the 2015 Emmy Awards? The epic fashion choice was strapless and helped her show off her slim figure on the red carpet. She also looks great in other colors too like red, which she showed off when she wore a red dress in some pics she posted to Instagram in Dec. 2019. The dress included a plunging neckline with a lacy lining, a fitted waist and a draping skirt bottom.
Since we’re used to being impressed by January’s awesome fashion sense and fitting figure, her latest photos are no surprise and we hope to see more soon. It’s great to know she’s staying healthy and active in quarantine!

    <h5 class="mb-1">January Jones Risks Wardrobe Malfunction in New Quarantine Bikini Photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">January Jones is heating things up while at home for quarantine! The Mad Men and Last Man on Earth actress shared a series of selfies on Saturday that show herself wearing a tiny teal bikini while swimming. She revealed one in her main feed, while sharing two others in her Instagram Story. The photos served two purposes: they both wished her mom a happy birthday, and showed off her swimsuit look.
In her Story, she first shared a photo of her mom in a one-piece bikini with the caption, "Happy birthday hot mama!" before repeating a similar sentiment in her main photo's caption. She then shared two more pictures, adding the captions "Laps?" and "Don't forget your Flotation devices," swiping a cheeky comment her Spinning Out co-star Will Kemp left on her own photo. Elsewhere in the main photo's comments, the star, who also appeared in X-Men: First Class and The Politician, caught flak for wearing jewelry in the photos. Jones pointed out that "gold doesn’t rust" and she was doing "water aerobics," regardless.
The flirty photos earned a lot of praise in the comments, especially from Jones' famous peers. Mad Men co-star Kiernan Shipka wrote "[Oh my f—ing god]," and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills personality Lisa Rinna wrote "BODY." Resident Evil and Dazed and Confused actress Milla Jovovich also added, "Happy Birthday beautiful!!"
The bikini shots showed off Jones' figure, which she has been working on keeping in optimal shape. In February, the 42-year-old star opened up to Shape about her past ideas of fitness, which were lax to say the least.
“My dad was a trainer, so in my 20s and 30s, I didn’t work out, because he was always pushing my sisters, my mom, and me to exercise. We would rebel and not do it,” she she said. “It’s not that I wasn’t active. As kids, my two sisters were runners, I played tennis, and we all swam. But on a regular basis I wouldn’t work out, ever. Even when I was filming X-Men and they had trainers for all of us, I would lie and say I was exercising in my hotel room, when actually I was watching Friends and having full tea service."
However, her attitude soon changed, as she later added, "After I had my son, Xander, I wanted to feel strong because my body had changed so much. As he got bigger and I was hauling around a 20- or 30-pound toddler, my lower back gave out and I saw my shoulders starting to curl and hunch. I wanted to do something for my posture and core strength. Two or three years ago I started doing barre classes, and after that I took regular private Pilates lessons. Then a friend told me about Lagree Pilates. I’ve been doing it two to four times a week for the past year now, and I’ve gained weight because I’ve put on muscle. I’ve gone up a size in clothes, but I feel like I look better naked."

    <h5 class="mb-1">January Jones Stuns In A Teal Bikini: ‘Happy Birthday Mom!’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020

January revealed that she was going for a morning swim.
January Jones kicked off the weekend by flaunting her fit figure in a chic bikini. However, when she shared a photo of her stylish swimwear with her 985,000 Instagram followers, the caption she included with it had a few of her followers scratching their heads.
The 42-year-old Mad Men star wished her mother, Karen, a happy birthday. She also wrote that she was participating in a “morning lap swim” when her photo was taken. The latter revelation led to one of January’s followers making an observation about the array of accessories she was wearing with her two-piece. The actress was rocking a gold medallion necklace with a thick chain, a pair of large textured gold hoop earrings, and retro cat-eye sunglasses with metallic frames and dark lenses.
“Lap swim with necklace, earrings and sunglasses?” the seemingly skeptical commenter wrote.
“Gold doesn’t rust. and it was more a water aerobics situation,” January explained.
The teal swimsuit that January chose for her workout featured a halter neck design with adjustable sliding cups. A small panel of aqua fabric looped around the top of the bikini’s thick halter strap. The string underneath the bust was also the light cyan shade, and the entire bathing suit was trimmed with the color.
January was wearing the cups of her bikini top scrunched inwards to expose a generous amount of her ample cleavage, including more than a hint of sideboob spillage. She was standing in chest-deep water, but, because it was crystal-clear, the bottom half of her bathing suit was still visible. January was wearing a pair of high-waisted briefs that hit her right below the bellybutton. The bottoms had wide sides with low-cut leg openings that showed off her athletic thighs and a hint of her pert posterior. Her two-piece also showcased her trim waist and flat stomach.
The actress was wearing her chin-length blond hair loosely pulled back. Her pale skin was flawless, and her lips were a soft, natural shade of pink. She was flashing a big smile at the camera as she held her arms out to the sides.
Over the span of an hour, January’s morning workout photo racked up over 47,000 likes. Her followers also flocked to the comments section to share their thoughts about the snapshot.
“I’m relieved to see you using flotation devices…” read a popular response from actor Will Kemp.
“Hold up, my jaw fell, have to go back an pick it up,” another commenter wrote.
“Wow!!!!!!! You just made me take a deep breath. Flawless,” a third Instagrammer remarked.
The X-Men: First Class star isn’t the only stunning blond celebrity who has left her fans awestruck by flaunting her bikini body on Instagram. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Jessica Simpson treated her followers to a sizzling swimsuit snap that also received rave reviews.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Pantoliano Recovering From Head Injury After Being Hit by a Car</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Pantoliano is on the mend after he was hit by a car on Friday while out for a walk in his neighborhood in Connecticut.
The agent for “The Sopranos” star told USA Today that Pantoliano is being monitored for a concussion. A post on the actor’s Instagram page said he also “has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”
Pantoliano’s wife Nancy told TMZ that he was injured when a Porsche collided with another car and then skidded into the actor. He was knocked back a few feet into a fence and suffered a cut to his head and injuries to his left leg and shoulder.
Following the incident, the actor posted a few photos on his Instagram page, giving a thumbs-up and showcasing his head injury.
“Joey is home recovering,” the photos are captioned. “He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma. He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering. Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming! We’ll reading them to him to help him get better!”
A few of Pantoliano’s famous friends commented on the photo to pass along their well-wishes.
“Oh good, was worried! Feel better!!” Michael Gandolfini, son of “The Sopranos” star James Gandolfini wrote.
Jennifer Tilly added, “Lucky you’re so tough and stubborn! ❤️Try and stick around for another 40 years will ya! American cinema needs you! You are a national treasure!”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. — Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.
The impact left him with a gash on his head and other injuries. His agent told Variety that Pantoliano was taken to a nearby hospital.
A post on Instagram showed Pantoliano with stitches in his head and giving a thumbs-up sign. It read, “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”

Pantoliano is expected to pull through, local police are investigating the situation and both drivers stayed at the potential crime scene.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rebel Wilson Unzips for Flirty Quarantine Photoshoot Following Dramatic Transformation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actress and comedian Rebel Wilson is thriving in quarantine, and we are in absolute awe! The 40-year-old actress took to Instagram on May 2 to share snapshots from her smoking at-home photoshoot, showing off a slimmed-down figure while sporting a light blue tracksuit. Flaunting her enviable, curvy figure while rocking an unzipped hoodie and exposing her black bra, Wilson captioned the carousel of snaps: "At Home With Rebel" alongside a kissy emoji. The photos have raked up more than half a million likes, and a plethora of comments.
In the first snap, Wilson channels her inner Victoria's Secret model, posing on top of her lush white sofa and smizing like a professional. In the following image, the Pitch Perfect actress stands defiantly in front of the camera, with her leg popped out with her fingers at the bottom of track suit jacket's zipper. In her last photo, Wilson channels her Cats role as she crawls toward the camera.
Fans chimed into the fiery shoot, expressing their enthusiasm over the shoot with a string of emojis including flames, heart eyes and kissy faces. "Woah.. well hello Rebel [eye emoji] your (sic) such a little Rebel.. [heart eyes emoji] but when are u gonna tell us about what u was rehearsing the other day?" wrote one fan, as another added, "Work it girl!" Meanwhile another fan wrote, "Damnn Rebel Wilson !! Looking beautiful as always."
At the beginning of the year, Wilson wrote in an Instagram post that 2020 would be "The Year of Health," admitting it was time to put herself first. "I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now and trying to avoid the sugar and junk food which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!" she wrote. "Who's with me in making some positive changes this year?"
According to Hollywood Life, Wilson's dramatic transformation is all thanks to trainer, Jono Castano Acero who told the outlet that he encourages clients to an "extra bit" of cardio every day to keep moving. "A little tip is to get a watch or use your phone to count steps and aim for 10 thousand steps a day," he said. "If you're on 9000 steps at 10pm, you have to get it done." The fitness trainer adds that while Wilson is "one of the sweetest souls" he's ever met, the pair oftentimes end up burning a major dose of calories from all their laughing together.
The actress has long been an advocate for plus-size women and launched her own fashion line in 2017 called Rebel Wilson X Angels, designed specifically for sizes 14 to 24.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Genesis Lopez Leaves Little To The Imagination In Sports Bra & High-Cut Underwear</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Nicole Moore
The fitness model sizzled in her revealing ensemble.
On Sunday, May 3, American fitness model Genesis Lopez shared a series of sizzling snaps with her 4.8 million Instagram followers.
The tantalizing photos, taken with Genesis’ smartphone, show the 26-year-old posing before a sizable mirror in what appears to be her backyard. She sizzled in an olive green sports bra and a pair of black, high-cut, thong underwear. The ensemble left little to the imagination, much to the delight of her audience. Her incredible curves and toned midsection were put on full display. She kept the sexy look simple and only accessorized with a pair of gold hoop earrings.
For the casual photoshoot, the Instagram star wore her highlighted hair down a slightly tousled style. She enhanced her already gorgeous features with a full face of makeup — a striking application that featured sculpted eyebrows, glowing highlighter, and voluminous lashes.
In the first image, Genesis kneeled with her legs spread on a striped towel. She ran her fingers through her long locks and tilted her head, as she snapped the selfie. Gorgeous green foliage and a pool can be seen in the background. She turned her back to the mirror in the following photo, flaunting her pert derriere. Her German Shepherd made an appearance in the shot.
In the caption, the social media sensation seemed to be making reference to the fact that she was posing outside, surrounded by “nature.”
The post appears to be a fan favorite as it soon racked up more than 60,000 likes. Many of her admirers also flocked to the comments section to shower her with compliments.
“Wow, you look amazing,” gushed a fan, adding both a fire and red heart emoji to the comment.
“[You’re] the sexiest woman alive @genesislopezoffical everything about you great smile amazing body [the] list goes on,” added a different devotee.
“WOW!! What a heavenly body and gorgeous face!!! Absolutely amazing,” remarked another follower.
“You are so gorgeous in your picture,” chimed in a fourth Instagram user.
Some commenters, however, seemed to be rendered speechless by the photos and instead, left a trail of emoji to express their admiration for the model.
Genesis engaged with her dedicated followers by responding to some of the comments.
The digital influencer is not shy when it comes to showing off her fantastic figure on social media. As fans are aware, a majority of her Instagram posts consist of her in revealing ensembles. Earlier this week, she uploaded a picture, in which she wore a skimpy lavender bikini. That provocative post has been liked over 100,000 times since it was shared.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Halle Berry, 53, Strikes A Fierce Pose In A Sheer Lingerie Outfit During A ‘Fitting Flashback’ — Pic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Is Halle Berry, 53, capable of looking less than flawless, like ever? The Oscar winner once again broke the internet when a photo of her rocking a very sexy outfit was posted on Friday, May 1. Fashion stylist Lindsay Flores heated up Instagram when she shared a pic of Halle striking a super fierce pose in a sheer lingerie ensemble. She appeared to go makeup free for the snap with her gorgeous brown locks cascading down both sides of her shoulders. “Ahhhhh the simpler times…,” Lindsay wrote as the caption with the hashtag #fittingflashback, more than likely referring to how things were before the worldwide coronavirus pandemic hit. Naturally the comments section were filled with endless compliments for Halle as fans couldn’t get over how “smoking hot” she looked.
Halle has been one of those A-list stars that has been providing a great distraction for many of us who remain bored in self-isolation. She’s been doing this by uploading a variety of pics that highlight her ageless beauty to perfection. She, along with other actresses like Sarah Michelle Gellar, 44, and Niecy Nash, 50, excelled in the viral #pillowchallenge where people strap a pillow to their body with a belt as a cincher and nothing on underneath.
The mother-of-two also got candid about her love life during an Instagram Live session with Lena Waithe, 35, in mid-April amid romance rumors between her and DJ D-Nice. “I’ve been pretty alone, by myself, going on three years now – decidedly so,” she first revealed before adding, ” I’ve decided to take time [for myself]… I’m going to spend time with me. And it’s been so great that I might stay like this.”
She’s also been using her time in self-isolation to stay in tiptop shape. “I try to catch 10 minutes here and there with the goal of doing at least 30 total minutes of more formal exercise per day,” she explained during an interview with Women’s Health. “I piece together a bunch of little bursts of exercise (many of which I can use my full-body resistance loop and booty band for) to meet my 30-minutes-total goal. In the morning, I try to stretch and do a few rounds of abs moves, like sit-ups or planks, since I usually have some quiet time to myself while the kids eat breakfast.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Halle Berry, 53, Goes Makeup-Free & Shows Off Her Natural Curls In Stunning Selfie</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry, 53, used some of her time in quarantine to use a hair product she loves and showed off a stunning photo of herself to promote it. The actress shared a snapshot that showed her standing in front of a shower with wet curly locks and no makeup while taking a selfie with her phone and her all natural look is definitely a beautiful sight to see. “Settling in on this fine #SelfCareSaturday with a much needed #HairMask, courtesy of my girl @tarajiphenson’s new line of hair care products, @tphbytaraji . I’ve known this woman since she started in the industry, and it’s been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed. Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favorites! ♥️” Halle captioned the pic. 
Once Halle’s pic went public, her followers couldn’t help but gush over her incredible beauty and even complimented her on her support of other women. “Gorgeous. Women supporting women! 👏” one follower wrote while another wrote, “No matter what you do you look good.” Others left hearts and heart-eyed emojis to show their support.
Before her latest quarantine pic, Halle shared many other pics of herself during her time at home and throwback pics as well, including one on May 1. It showed her posing in a sheer black lingerie-style outfit that showed off her incredible figure as she put her hands up on her head. “Ahhhhh the simpler times,” she captioned the pic, most likely referring to the times when quarantine due to the coronavirus wasn’t in effect.
It’s always awesome to see pics of Halle in and out of quarantine. We’re happy she’s staying healthy and positive and hope to see more moments soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Maura Higgins Shows Off Her Toned Physique In Black Bralette And Miniskirt</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
Irish reality TV star Maura Higgins, best known for her work as a participant on the popular series Love Island, recently took to her Instagram page and wowed her 2.8 million followers with a hot, yet stylish snapshot.
In the pic, which was uploaded to the photo-sharing platform on Saturday, May 2, Maura could be seen rocking a black lace bralette that allowed her to show off a glimpse of her cleavage. That’s not all, but the sexy ensemble also drew viewers’ attention toward her bare midriff.
Staying true to form, the 29-year-old model sported a full face of makeup. The application comprised a beige foundation that complemented her tanned skin tone. She dusted her cheeks with a pink blush, opted for a mocha shade of lipstick, bronze eyeshadow, winged eyeliner, and a thick coat of mascara applied over false eyelashes. She finished off her makeup application with defined eyebrows and strobing all over her face for an illuminating look.
Maura wore her hair in a sleek ponytail. Meanwhile, she also had her perfectly-manicured nails painted with a white polish.
She paired the bralette with a black miniskirt and a matching blazer that she carried over her shoulders. In terms of accessories, she ramped up the glamour with a pair of large hoop earrings, a dainty gold pendant, multiple bracelets, a ring, and a silver wristwatch. She also carried a black purse that featured a gold chain strap.
The picture was captured at a red carpet event sponsored by the British clothing retailer, Boohoo. In the caption, Maura informed her fans that it was a throwback.
To strike a pose, she stood straight, kept a hand on her waist, lightly tugged at her bra strap, parted her lips, and sexily gazed at the camera.
Within a day of posting, the snap garnered more than 150,000 likes. Her admirers also took to the comments section and posted more than 620 messages to praise her amazing looks and sexy style.
“Omg, Maura, you are smoking hot. Love this look,” one of her fans commented on the snap.
“You’re so gorgeous, I wanna look like you, lol,” another user chimed in.
“You are the sexiest model alive. Definitely the best on Instagram,” a third follower wrote.
“Please, come to America once again. I so want to meet you, babe,” a fourth admirer requested.
Other users posted words and phrases like “the hottest,” “wifey,” and “goddess,” to express their adoration for Maura.
Aside from her regular fans and followers, the snap was also liked by many other models and influencers, including Molly Mae, Rosie Anna Williams, and Kaz Crossley.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner’s new look</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Advertisement -
Cosmetics mogul Kylie Jenner is enjoying her quarantine time with new hair and makeup makeovers. Her latest look is stunning. The reality star looked great with an ombre ponytail that she featured in a video on her Instagram account on Wednesday. The model also collects a huge number of hairpieces and extensions. Kylie has shown several looks over the past week such as a straight blond look as well as a tie-back ponytail. She has also appeared without her extensions, showing her natural hair at shoulder-length.
The mother-of-one said that the reason why she changes her look so often is that it is an addiction that makes her feel like a new person. Sharing in a post, the Lip Kits founder said that she first coloured her hair when she was 16. She had it coloured blue and she did not tell her mother. Since then, she has been addicted to changing her hairstyle. It makes her feel like a new person and she loves feeling different. Kylie added that she loves leaving the house knowing that nobody has ever seen her this way.
Kylie moved into a new home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles during the quarantine period.

This week, she and her best friend Stassie created a series for TikTok and recreated funny Keeping Up with the Kardashian clips. The massive residence was shown in the clips, with the amazing swimming pool as well as teasers into the gym and cinema. Prior to her new abode, Kylie lived with her mother Kris Jenner in Hidden Hills. The model also has a house in that neighbourhood. Kylie and her daughter Stormi seem to be enjoying themselves with Kris as Kylie shared videos of them in the mansion. There are clips of them dressing up for a TikTok video, as well as Stormi playing in the swimming pool. Kylie uploaded a funny video of Kris sleeping in the living room in the middle of the day too. /TISG

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia's most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
"All of us have ended up on a desert island and that's the most interesting thing," the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called "Quarantine Russian Style".
"Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we'll make movies!" he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the "craziest" thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
"They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa," he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians' coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour's door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include "Tango and Cash", also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
"Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,"  he said. 
"That is why we will be able to tough it out."
'Tales from Quarantine'
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the "Screenlife" format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called "Tales From The Quarantine". 
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
"Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it's where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are," Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called "Telecommuting" and features professional actors in a web conference.
"Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language," said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers "Day Watch" and "Night Watch".
"Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated," he said.
"We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks."
'We must survive'
Due to the epidemic, the Russian film industry is likely to lose around 60 percent of revenue this year, according to preliminary estimates from the culture ministry.
But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck. 
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia. 
She invited dozens of her actor friends -- who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion -- to participate in a project dubbed "The Isolated".
"'The Isolated' talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics," Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform -- one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown -- to be able to pay her actors.
"We must survive these strange times," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moscow, Russia | AFP |  The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia’s most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
“All of us have ended up on a desert island and that’s the most interesting thing,” the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called “Quarantine Russian Style”.
“Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we’ll make movies!” he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the “craziest” thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
“They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa,” he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians’ coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour’s door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include “Tango and Cash”, also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
“Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,”  he said.
“That is why we will be able to tough it out.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">St. Jude music therapists organize backyard jams for kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amy Love had to leave the Memphis hospital where she brings music to severely ill children — she and other support staff couldn’t take the risk of spreading COVID-19 to these frail patients.
But she was determined: The music must not stop.
So her house became a recording studio, and Love, fellow music therapist Celeste Douglas and intern Abigail Parrish became video stars for kids at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital who feed on their energy, their melodies, their love.
“Let’s get moving!” Love cries, as she sits cross-legged on a blanket in her backyard.
They play guitars and little drums, shakers and tambourines, and Love’s dog joins in on the fun — even as a lawn-mowing neighbor seems a bit puzzled.
“We’re really excited to be with you today, even if we can’t be there in person,” Douglas tells their early childhood group from afar.
No instruments? No problem. Love urges their viewers: “Just move around with us!”
The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.
Entertainer Danny Thomas opened the pediatric treatment and research hospital for children with catastrophic diseases in 1962. Care is free for all. Since many of the patients are immune deficient, Love and other support staff are working remotely.
The hospital’s two resident therapy dogs are on hiatus off campus, as well.
“What we’re doing is finding new ways to support our kiddos and keep them safe at the same time,” Love said.
In the hospital, the team holds the early childhood music group once a week for kids up to 3 years old.
“That’s one thing I’ve really missed,” Love said. “We’d all get together and play tons of music and were super loud.”
Switching gears was a bit of a learning curve, she said. Like the ukuleles. Asking kids to teach themselves the instrument could have gone either way, but Love was optimistic.
“It’s a really easy instrument to feel really successful with,” she said. “You can mark up different parts of the ukulele and play it pretty easy. Even with one finger you can be successful and play a chord.”
Love can’t wait for the day she can return to the hospital. In the meantime, she has a mission.
“Music is not canceled,” she said. “We’re going to continue playing music until we can all get back together again.”

The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.
Entertainer Danny Thomas opened the pediatric treatment and research hospital for children with catastrophic diseases in 1962. Care is free for all. Since many of the patients are immune deficient, Love and other support staff are working remotely.
The hospital’s two resident therapy dogs are on hiatus off campus, as well.
“What we’re doing is finding new ways to support our kiddos and keep them safe at the same time,” Love said.
In the hospital, the team holds the early childhood music group once a week for kids up to 3 years old.
“That’s one thing I’ve really missed,” Love said. “We’d all get together and play tons of music and were super loud.”
Switching gears was a bit of a learning curve, she said. Like the ukuleles. Asking kids to teach themselves the instrument could have gone either way, but Love was optimistic.
“It’s a really easy instrument to feel really successful with,” she said. “You can mark up different parts of the ukulele and play it pretty easy. Even with one finger you can be successful and play a chord.”
Love can’t wait for the day she can return to the hospital. In the meantime, she has a mission.
“Music is not cancelled,” she said. “We’re going to continue playing music until we can all get back together again.”

While nonstop global news about the effects of the coronavirus have become commonplace, so, too, are the stories about the kindness of strangers and individuals who have sacrificed for others. “One Good Thing” is an Associated Press continuing series reflecting these acts of kindness.

“Game of Thrones” actor Hafthor Bjornsson, who played Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane in the HBO series, set a deadlift world record by lifting 501 kilograms (1,104 pounds) on Saturday.
Bjornsson, the 2018 World’s Strongest Man, made the successful attempt at Thor’s Power Gym in his native Iceland.
“I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” the 31-year-old Bjornsson told ESPN. “I’m happy with this.”
Eddie Hall set the previous record in 2016 at the World Deadlift Championships, with the Englishman lifting 500 kilos (1,102 pounds).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson is best known for portraying 'The Mountain' in hit TV series Game of Thrones but he was not playing around on Saturday.
The 2018 World's Strongest Man winner set a world record with a 501-kilogram deadlift in front of a small gathering of people in a Reykjavik gym.
After lifting 420kg and 465kg in his first two attempts, the 6ft 9in, 200kg bodybuilder made history.
Bjornsson appeared to complete the deadlift comfortably and after locking into position the iron was thrown to the floor.
"I'm absolutely speechless. I'm just so happy and thankful that I got the opportunity to do this, even though the world is going through what it's going through," said Bjornsson.
"Everything went according to plan. I'm over the moon.
"I believe today I could've done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this, my family and friends were happy with this and I decided to call it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">People are filming their DIY haircuts and showing viewers how to trim bangs during as part of a new — and nerve-wracking — TikTok beauty trend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As hair salons around the US remain closed, and with many major in-person gatherings on hold, it’s only human nature that some people are finding themselves tempted to grab the scissors and snip away at their locks – whether out of boredom, or in the name of self-care.
Celebrities like Hilary Duff and Dua Lipa have experimented with neon hair colours at home, and Bella Hadid apparently even got to the point of cutting her own bangs.
As of lately, quarantine haircuts have taken over TikTok, with many creators on the video platform documenting their at-home hair transformations. Some of the videos are purely entertaining, with users poking fun at the “trend” that has become of DIY haircuts in the midst of the pandemic.
However, other TikTok users are making instructional videos on how they have cut their own hair. Here, one user shows how they trimmed excess hair at an angle to finish their newly cut bangs.
User Marresa Kazem, who makes beauty tutorials on TikTok, showed users early in March how she gives her locks a trim with damp hair, a comb, and proper scissors.
Some creators seem to be using a twisting technique to trim their bangs, which involves gathering pieces at the front of the head, twirling them together, and carefully trimming starting at the bottom.
Insider previously spoke to hair professionals who each agreed that while a seemingly simple hair trim seems innocent, it’s best left to the experts.
Any damage done by at-home treatments, whether it’s a chemical hair dye or a trim gone wrong, could be expensive and time-consuming to reverse or fix at a future appointment, said Houston, Texas-based CHI hairstylist and colorist Joy Williams.
“Stylists can do anything with healthy hair,” Williams said, saying that even if people can’t get to a salon in the desired amount of time, there are alternatives to DIY hair trimming that are less damaging and can still make people feel like their hair has a new look or feel.
One way to give hair a refresh, Williams said, is to steer clear of permanent dye, chemical treatments, and hot tools while at home.
“Now is the perfect time to do hair masks and conditioning at home, so when you get back to your stylist, you’ll spend less time and money repairing it,” Williams said.
In other words, when it comes to taking the scissors to your hair, if you’re not a trained professional, “it can wait,” Williams said.
Nisa Anderson, a hairstylist and salon owner in Hollywood, California, said that now is the perfect time for people to embrace their natural hair through protective hairstyles and by giving their hair a break from harsh treatments.
“Whatever it takes to lay off the heat can really be beneficial for all hair types,” Anderson said.
Here, TikTok users showed fans how using headbands and bobby pins can help create the illusion of bangs, or a completely new haircut, without any trims.
Even for people at home who have their heart set on emerging from quarantine with a new hairstyle, trying one of the faux-bangs tricks from TikTok might be a good place to start.
It’s safe to say that DIY bangs and haircuts aren’t the biggest issues on anyone’s plate.
But based on the popularity of hair tutorials posted on TikTok during the past two months – some with hundreds and thousands of views and “likes” – plenty of people have qualms about overdue haircuts, and many are finding comfort and joy in an uncertain time by switching up their hair.
Of course, taking steps to feel put-together at home is not something everybody has the privilege of doing, during quarantine and otherwise. That being said, one hairstylist said that in her opinion, people should not feel guilty for thinking about their hair.
Shvonne Perkins, who leads the training and education program at Madison Reed, which specialises in at-home hair colour kits and resources, previously told Insider that people should be empowered to maintain whatever part of their beauty regimen they can at home.
“I think it sort of just comes down to a moment of taking this time for yourself,” Perkins said. “Likely, where [people] are right now is that they’re not able to access their normal beauty routines. I think it’s totally accessible and really necessary to treat yourself and do any of those things that make you feel like yourself, or feel most in touch with the best version of yourself.”
Perkins continued, saying: “Everything feels so out of control, and this is one thing where it’s like, ‘I’m going to do this for myself. I can control this element of how I look and how I feel.'”

Perkins continued, saying: "Everything feels so out of control, and this is one thing where it's like, 'I'm going to do this for myself. I can control this element of how I look and how I feel.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">People are filming their DIY haircuts and showing viewers how to trim bangs during as part of a new — and nerve-wracking — TikTok beauty trend, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As hair salons around the US remain closed, and with many major in-person gatherings on hold, it’s only human nature that some people are finding themselves tempted to grab the scissors and snip away at their locks – whether out of boredom, or in the name of self-care.
Celebrities like Hilary Duff and Dua Lipa have experimented with neon hair colors at home, and Bella Hadid apparently even got to the point of cutting her own bangs.
As of lately, quarantine haircuts have taken over TikTok, with many creators on the video platform documenting their at-home hair transformations. Some of the videos are purely entertaining, with users poking fun at the “trend” that has become of DIY haircuts in the midst of the pandemic.
However, other TikTok users are making instructional videos on how they've cut their own hair. Here, one user shows how they trimmed excess hair at an angle to finish their newly cut bangs.
User Marresa Kazem, who makes beauty tutorials on TikTok, showed users early in March how she gives her locks a trim with damp hair, a comb, and proper scissors.
Some creators seem to be using a twisting technique to trim their bangs, which involves gathering pieces at the front of the head, twirling them together, and carefully trimming starting at the bottom.
Insider previously spoke to hair professionals who each agreed that while a seemingly simple hair trim seems innocent, it's best left to the experts.
Any damage done by at-home treatments, whether it's a chemical hair dye or a trim gone wrong, could be expensive and time-consuming to reverse or fix at a future appointment, said Houston, Texas-based CHI hairstylist and colorist Joy Williams.
"Stylists can do anything with healthy hair," Williams said, saying that even if people can't get to a salon in the desired amount of time, there are alternatives to DIY hair trimming that are less damaging and can still make people feel like their hair has a new look or feel.
One way to give hair a refresh, Williams said, is to steer clear of permanent dye, chemical treatments, and hot tools while at home.
"Now is the perfect time to do hair masks and conditioning at home, so when you get back to your stylist, you'll spend less time and money repairing it," Williams said.
In other words, when it comes to taking the scissors to your hair, if you're not a trained professional, "it can wait," Williams said.
Nisa Anderson, a hairstylist and salon owner in Hollywood, California, said that now is the perfect time for people to embrace their natural hair through protective hairstyles and by giving their hair a break from harsh treatments.
"Whatever it takes to lay off the heat can really be beneficial for all hair types," Anderson said.
Here, TikTok users showed fans how using headbands and bobby pins can help create the illusion of bangs, or a completely new haircut, without any trims.
Even for people at home who have their heart set on emerging from quarantine with a new hairstyle, trying one of the faux-bangs tricks from TikTok might be a good place to start.
It's safe to say that DIY bangs and haircuts aren't the biggest issues on anyone's plate.
But based on the popularity of hair tutorials posted on TikTok during the past two months - some with hundreds and thousands of views and "likes" - plenty of people have qualms about overdue haircuts, and many are finding comfort and joy in an uncertain time by switching up their hair.
Of course, taking steps to feel put-together at home is not something everybody has the privilege of doing, during quarantine and otherwise. That being said, one hairstylist said that in her opinion, people should not feel guilty for thinking about their hair.
Shvonne Perkins, who leads the training and education program at Madison Reed, which specializes in at-home hair color kits and resources, previously told Insider that people should be empowered to maintain whatever part of their beauty regimen they can at home.
"I think it sort of just comes down to a moment of taking this time for yourself," Perkins said. "Likely, where [people] are right now is that they're not able to access their normal beauty routines. I think it's totally accessible and really necessary to treat yourself and do any of those things that make you feel like yourself, or feel most in touch with the best version of yourself."
Perkins continued, saying: "Everything feels so out of control, and this is one thing where it's like, 'I'm going to do this for myself. I can control this element of how I look and how I feel.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake Gyllenhaal whispered to his rising homemade bread, and people are raving about the actor's sourdough starter expertise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jake Gyllenhaal and host Stephen Colbert recently bonded over their newfound affinity for making bread from scratch.
It’s no wonder that the actor and late-night TV show host have taken to making their own bread, as it’s recently become a popular pastime. Some people are turning loaves into edible works of art, while others have gotten creative by trying bread recipes that don’t require a sourdough starter.
In an episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that was released on Wednesday, Gyllenhaal talked about how he got his start with the art of homemade bread-making, and he appeared to whisper to his rising loaf of bread.
“I’ve found myself falling in love with sourdough,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “I have a good friend who’s a baker in San Francisco . . . we were talking, and I hate this, but I was like, ‘Can you teach me how to do a sourdough starter?’ And off I went.”
Colbert then showed Gyllenhaal his container of sourdough bread starter, which was in a plastic container.
He asked Gyllenhaal for baking advice: “Now what do I do?”
Gyllenhaal responded by lifting a rising loaf of homemade bread to the camera.
“To go from that, to this, which is resting. It’s not yet fully rising, but it’s on its way,” Gyllenhaal said in a whisper.
“What I do with it, is I take the starter, and then you have to get a nicer wheat flour,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “You make what they call, in America, a pre-ferment. You let that rest for 12 to 24 hours, and then, you can start mixing it up into some other flour, and then make your dough.”
Gyllenhaal’s soothing yet serious way of tending to his rising sourdough – and the nearly five minutes of the episode he spent talking about bread – seemed to capture the hearts of fans and viewers of the show.
Gyllenhaal also spoke to Colbert about his performance in a musical tribute to Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, as well as his attempt at the T-Shirt handstand challenge after being tagged by his “Spider-Man: Far From Home” costar Tom Holland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Black Panther' screenwriter Joe Robert Cole on directing his gritty new Netflix movie 'All Day and a Night'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At 40 years old, Joe Robert Cole is one of the most sought after screenwriters working today in Hollywood thanks to his work in TV (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”) and movies (“Black Panther”).
But for his latest project, he’s moving away from helping the vision of people like Ryan Murphy and Ryan Coogler to set out and direct his own story.
“All Day and a Night” (available on Netflix) is an unforgiving look at Jahkor (Aston Sanders of “Moonlight”), an Oakland kid who is trying to make a better life for his newborn baby with his skills as a rapper but finds himself falling into a life of crime that puts him in jail alongside his gang banging father, James (Jeffrey Wright).
This a story that Cole wanted to tell long before “Black Panther” was made. A decade to be exact. And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at. There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”
Going forward still expect Cole to pen comic book-based projects. He’s currently adapting the Vault Comics title “Failsafe” (a project also for Netflix), with Michael B. Jordan producing. But at the same time, Cole also wants to continue to direct movies like “All Day and a Night,” where the story is shedding light on someone you wouldn’t expect you’d be interested in.
“What I wanted to achieve was taking the audience on a journey and humanising someone we often struggle to see the humanity in,” he said. “I was constantly working on finding the humanity in the stylised crime genre.”

There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”
Going forward still expect Cole to pen comic book-based projects. He’s currently adapting the Vault Comics title “Failsafe” (a project also for Netflix), with Michael B. Jordan producing. But at the same time, Cole also wants to continue to direct movies like “All Day and a Night,” where the story is shedding light on someone you wouldn’t expect you’d be interested in.
“What I wanted to achieve was taking the audience on a journey and humanizing someone we often struggle to see the humanity in,” he said. “I was constantly working on finding the humanity in the stylized crime genre.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Black Panther' screenwriter Joe Robert Cole on directing his gritty new Netflix movie 'All Day and a Night', Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At 40 years old, Joe Robert Cole is one of the most sought after screenwriters working today in Hollywood thanks to his work in TV (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”) and movies (“Black Panther”).
But for his latest project, he’s moving away from helping the vision of people like Ryan Murphy and Ryan Coogler to set out and direct his own story.
“All Day and a Night” (available on Netflix) is an unforgiving look at Jahkor (Aston Sanders of “Moonlight”), an Oakland kid who is trying to make a better life for his newborn baby with his skills as a rapper but finds himself falling into a life of crime that puts him in jail alongside his gang banging father, James (Jeffrey Wright).
This a story that Cole wanted to tell long before “Black Panther” was made. A decade to be exact. And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at. There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Hemsworth said co-star Tiffany Haddish ripped apart a script because it didn't properly portray a strip club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a recent interview on The Ellen Show, “Thor” actor Chris Hemsworth talked about the upcoming movie he’s starring in with comedian Tiffany Haddish, and said that working together revealed to him Haddish’s strip-club acumen.
The movie, called “Down Under Cover,” is an action-meets-comedy about a detective duo, Hemsworth and Haddish, who are tasked with shutting down multiple casino heists. Hemsworth’s character has to go undercover as a male stripper because they believe Australian male strippers are running the heists.
“Love her work. She’s hilarious,” Hemsworth said of his co-star. “What I didn’t know was how versed she was in the world of stripping, particularly male stripping, and she’s been to many a male strip club.”
Hemsworth said that once he and Haddish were given their scripts, she immediately “ripped the script apart” because it didn’t portray male strip clubs correctly. She pointed out parts of the plot, saying “this would never happen” and explained what the experience would be like in real life, Hemsworth told Degeneres.
Degeneres said she wasn’t surprised that Haddish was well-versed in strip clubs and said that the production was lucky to have her perspective.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV and radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford is expecting her first child, with football manager Brian Barry-Murphy.
The host of the Sunday Chart Show on Hits Radio discovered she was pregnant before Christmas, and is due to give birth in early August.
After a difficult first trimester, Crawford said she was feeling “more energised” as she prepared to enter the final stage.
She told Hello! magazine: “We are both over the moon. We found out just before Christmas. It was an incredible present.
“I’ve noticed my body is changing with the seasons. When summer comes it will be the blossoming of everything. It’s an amazing journey.”
Rochdale manager Barry-Murphy, 41, has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.
Crawford said: “Blending a family is a special thing. I’ve come from a blended family too.
“Brian is very excited to be a dad all over again. He loves being a dad and he knew (being a parent) is something I really wanted, too. It’s a new chapter in our relationship.”
Crawford, who has West African and Irish heritage, said that, having dealt with insecurities, she would be passing on a positive message to her child.
She said: “I had things I hated about myself, like my lips, when I was growing up, but now I’m really proud of my looks.
“I’ll pass on the message to my child that: ‘You’re beautiful.’
“I want them to know that their uniqueness is what makes them special. I want them to feel proud of themselves and of their own natural beauty.
“When it comes to learning to love yourself, I have lots of good life experience to pass on.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Donny Hathaway, soul legend who mysteriously fell to his death from 15th floor of a NY hotel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bedeviled by paranoid schizophrenia, Donny Hathaway, nonetheless, became a soul legend, according to Rolling Stone. Yet, he is so often excluded from the histories of American popular music. Hathaway was one of the brightest new voices in soul music in the ’70s, achieving his greatest commercial success as Roberta Flack’s duet partner of choice.
Hathaway, born October 1, 1945, in Chicago, began singing in church with his grandmother at three having moved to St. Louis. He took to the piano early on, and while in high school, he was so impressive to the extent that he won a full-ride fine arts scholarship to Howard University to study music in 1964.
He tasted live performance with a cocktail jazz outfit called the Ric Powell Trio while in college and when offers in the record industry began pouring in, he left school after three years.
Hathaway first worked behind the scenes as a producer, arranger, songwriter, and session pianist/keyboardist supporting the likes of the Staple Singers, Aretha Franklin and Jerry Butler.
He joined the Mayfield Singers, a studio backing group that supported Curtis Mayfield’s Impressions. Hathaway thus became a house producer at Mayfield’s Curtom label, and in 1969 cut his first single, a duet with June Conquest called “I Thank You Baby.”
He signed with Atco as a solo artist and released his debut single, the inner-city lament “The Ghetto, Pt. 1,” which still ranks as a classic soul message track, sampled by numerous hip-hop artists.
Hathaway’s acclaimed debut LP, Everything Is Everything, got released in early 1970. In 1971, he released his eponymous second album and recorded a duet with former Howard classmate Roberta Flack, covering Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend.”
It was a significant hit, reaching the Top Ten on the R&B charts, and sparked a full album of duets, Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, which was released in 1972. The soft, romantic ballad “Where Is the Love?” topped the R&B charts, went Top Five on the pop side, and won a Grammy with the accompanying album going gold.
Also in 1972, Hathaway went into soundtrack work, recording the theme song for the TV series Maude and scoring the film Come Back Charleston Blue.
Despite things falling in place for the gifted entertainer, Hathaway battled severe bouts of depression, which occasionally landed him in the hospital. His mood swings also affected his partnership with Flack, which began to crumble in 1973, writes allmusic.com. He, nonetheless, released one more album that year, Extension of a Man, and then left the spotlight.
In 1977, Hathaway ironed out his differences with Flack and temporarily left the hospital to record another duet, “The Closer I Get to You,” for her Blue Lightsin the Basement album. The song became a hit, and in 1978, it became the pair’s second R&B number one and also made it to number two on the pop charts.
But suddenly on January 13, 1979, Hathaway was found dead on the sidewalk below the 15th-floor window of his room in New York’s Essex House. The glass had been neatly removed from the window, and there were no signs of struggle, leading investigators to rule Hathaway’s death a suicide, though there were rumors that he may not have killed himself. Just 33, his apparent suicide stunned friends and associates.
He is, however, still loved by many black listeners and singers. His songs including “The Ghetto”, “This Christmas”, “Someday We’ll All Be Free”, and “Little Ghetto Boy,” remain on the palates of music lovers. After all, he recorded some of the most beautiful and funky music of the late twentieth century.
And who knows better his staying power than Hathaway himself who told a reporter for the UK newspaper Disc and Music Echo in August of 1971 “My ambition is to get standing ovations everywhere I play. I’m working to have a performance so effective as to really carry the audience on a ride.”
According to Atlantic Records publicist Barbara Harris, after a show, fans would come up to him, and “people were just kind of … speechless. They couldn’t believe what they had just heard.”
There’s a book on the 1972 soul album Donny Hathaway Live touching on the music, the showmanship on stage, and the man behind it all. Hathaway got a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2019.
In 1990, Hathaway’s daughter Lalah launched a solo career but she had a taste of being on a record in 1969 when her father’s hit “The Ghetto,” was being recorded alongside her mother Eulaulah Hathaway who is on that record too.
Decades on, Lalah is an acclaimed singer and Grammy winner, earning one in 2017 for Lalah Hathaway Live. Her Honestly album also earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B. Lalah has five Grammys already.
She is hailed for her “astonishing ability to sing chords” and also her “sensual, inventive approach to melodies.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Epitome of the free spirit': 'Clancy descendant' dies in Paris from COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From boyhood in Melbourne to his death from COVID-19 in a Paris hospital last month, Gerald Clancy Taylor, a student and saviour of languages, refused the offices, routines and assorted dull expectations of others.
At its nomadic essence, his extraordinary life was perhaps not so dissimilar to a famous portrayal of his own grandfather Thomas Clancy, who, some believe, was the inspiration for Banjo Paterson's fictional drover named Clancy, from a station called The Overflow.
Mr Taylor never had a proper job until the age of 41. He never married, or stayed put for long. His passions were language and travel, and he indulged them wholly.
News of Mr Taylor's death at the age of 86 rippled through Peru, where he is revered for his 45-year study of indigenous language Quechuan – in particular, his translations of the 17th Century “Huarochirí Manuscript”, which has been likened to an Andean equivalent of the Epic of Gilgamesh.
The grief spread through the continents he called home since leaving Melbourne in the 1950s – Asia, Europe and South America, where he eked an existence “off the smell of an oily rag” through revolutions, beatings from police and cultural upheavals.
If old Tom Clancy was Banjo Paterson’s symbol of freedom in his 1889 poem, then the drover's grandson was the family's worldly 20th century successor.
“He was the epitome of the free spirit,” says Mr Taylor's nephew, author and artist Antoni Jach.
"He was a good role model in that way, in terms of you don’t just have to get a steady job and do that forever. You can just follow your whims.”
Born in Melbourne in 1933, Mr Taylor found refuge from his austere Anzac father and the rigid expectations of schools (plural because he was regularly expelled) in the world of words.
His bedside table as a teenager, his family says, was a mess of language guides, the contents of which he practised on the street by bailing up migrant workers.
Examiners at Xavier College, more tolerant of his caprices, were so astounded at his grasp of local colloquialisms they believed he must have lived in the countries of study. In reality, he had been slipping underage into the Young and Jacksons pub in Melbourne’s CBD.
For all his love of language and formidable intellect, Mr Taylor failed high school English, a fact that mystified him into old age. The blip meant he could not sign the matriculation roll into Melbourne University so, instead, he took his first leap outside a then-sleepy city.
“Gerald said to me on a number of occasions, ‘You couldn’t believe how boring Melbourne was in the 50s’. And he just longed to escape,” another nephew, Andrew Taylor, tells The Sunday Age.
“I don’t think Melbourne, even today, could give him what the rest of the world could give him; what Asia could give him, what Europe could give him, what South America could give him. He inhabited all those continents and made so many connections.”
Mr Taylor eventually turned his passions into income by teaching at the famous and ancient Sorbonne in Paris. By his death on April 1, he could speak as many as 40 languages, friends would say, and was a world-renowned philologist and linguist with books and breakthroughs still to publish.
“He was curious about people. He loved people. And the way to get to know people was to converse in their language,” Mr Jach says.
Andrew Taylor, the nephew, would often stay in Paris with his uncle and remembers him sitting late into the night watching old movies in Hindi, Mandarin, Bengali and Tamil.
Those days entailed talking to people on the streets and parties with academics vying to outdo each another with tales of globetrotting derring-do.
Mr Taylor last visited Melbourne over Christmas, when he became gravely ill with gallstones.
At the Frankston Hospital he spoke Malayalam with nurses from the Kerala region of southern India, the nephews say.
One night he spoke Mandarin to a Chinese doctor. It turned out she was from southern China, so he switched to Cantonese.
His last conversations in the Paris hospital were in the native Turkish of his nurses.
He was, naturally, proud of his putative Clancy of The Overflow ancestry, the family says.
Banjo Paterson maintained the character was a composite, but the family holds it was, at least in part, inspired by Mr Taylor’s grandfather, Thomas Clancy.
The family story goes that Paterson came upon the name in a small newspaper brief recording that a “Clancy” was about to drive a record number of cattle from a station called “The Overflow”.
As recorded in Grantlee Kieza’s 2018 history Banjo, Tom Clancy claimed to have once driven a "tremendous herd" from The Overflow, near Nymagee in central NSW.
Kieza also cites Clancy’s diary entry from September 29, 1882 which places him with a mob of sheep at the Lachlan River, where the narrator of the poem said he met Clancy “years ago”.
Other families have made claims over the years, including descendants of Tom’s brother, John Clancy, who did for a time actually work at a station called The Overflow.
Mr Jach says the connections are tantalising but, ultimately, the specifics are “not so important”. The mystery is part of the fun. Part of the legend.
“Banjo Paterson was quoted as saying that he wanted a particular type. Clancy stands as that particular type – reckless, independent, strong, courageous,” Mr Jach says.
Kieza comes to the same conclusion, adding some of the literary Clancy may have been from Paterson’s own late father.
Whatever the case, Thomas Clancy struck up a correspondence with the famous balladeer and the family still has his will signed by the Sydney solicitor, A.B Paterson.
Clancy also wrote his own poem, a counter to the romantic drover's life depicted by Paterson. Clancy's riposte talks of “drought-scourged plains extended” and “stock in hundreds dying, along the road are lying”.
Mr Taylor could recite his grandfather’s verses by heart. One of them reads:
Then a roving fancy took me,
Which has never since forsook me,
And decided me to travel,
And leave the Overflow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Publicist shares memories of life among the stars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After several decades abroad, Nanaimo native Prudence Emery finally moved back to Vancouver Island in 2007. But the 83-year-old former film-industry publicist did not trade her starry social circles for her condominium in Oak Bay to fade quietly into black.
Emery used the quietude to write a page-turning memoir, Nanaimo Girl. “I wanted to call the book Death By Champagne, Emery said — a reference to her once-lavish lifestyle, which orbited around swinging London in the late 1960s and the movie industry in the 1990s. “But the publisher insisted on Nanaimo Girl.”
Emery is a natural storyteller, which serves her well in Nanaimo Girl. Recently published by Toronto’s Cormorant Books imprint, the book covers Emery’s life to date, but really soars as she pinballs from 1957 to 1975 between Canada and England.
During one of her return trips to Canada, she worked with visitor services for Expo 67. Her post at the world’s fair in Montreal was to escort guests, including Liberace, Edward Albee, Hugh Hefner, Jack Benny and Twiggy. Her position put her in contact with national and international media, who clearly took a liking to her no-nonsense, can-do attitude and high-level efficiency.
She was hired as the press and public relations officer for London’s Savoy Hotel in 1968, and though she was only in the position for five years, her stories of the period are otherworldly.
Among her many interesting asides were experiences with giants of the screen and stage, from a friendship with playwright Noël Coward to her task of organizing, with Liza Minelli, the actor-singer’s public engagement to actor Peter Sellers.
Emery also arranged for then prime minister Pierre Trudeau to attend the première party for Funny Girl, starring Barbra Steisand, whom Trudeau later squired. It wasn’t all wine and roses for Emery, however.
She moved in and out of relationships with everyone from Jean Charpentier, the Canadian journalist who later served as Trudeau’s press secretary, to the son of Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev.
Alcohol dependency became an issue during her time at the Savoy — champagne was her vice. But Emery came out of the fog and into a career as a publicist in the film industry, where she spent three decades working with another side of the cultural elite.
The pages of Nanaimo Girl feature photographs of Emery on set with stars of the era: Michael Douglas, Peter O’Toole, Bette Midler, Christopher Plummer, Jeremy Irons and Robin Williams. In conversation, Emery mourned the death of the “old industry,” where cast and crew would socialize together. “It was wonderful. It was like being in the film. Now, it’s much more corporate. I’m so glad I’m not in it anymore.”
Her career as an on-set film publicist began with the 1974 horror film Black Christmas. It was the first of more than 120 films she worked on between 1974 and 2010.
Ten of those films, on locations ranging from China to Budapest, were directed by David Cronenberg, for whom she has the highest of praise. “He’s hugely intelligent, but he has a very gentle demeanor. He’s not fey; he’s just rather low-key. He runs a set like a babbling brook. It’s kind of comforting.”
The last film she worked on was Cronenberg’s 2007 movie Eastern Promises, starring Viggo Mortensen, another Emery favourite. The completion of the film coincided with her move back to Victoria, where she had lived on and off for years following home bases in Toronto and Montreal.
She wrote and produced a movie of her own in 2013, Hattie’s Heist, but her days in the film industry are mostly a thing of the past.
“Moving here kind of took me out of circulation,” Emery said. “I guess it was a natural ending.”
There are a few actors whose company Emery did not enjoy, though she would only discuss them off the record. Nanaimo Girl wasn’t mean to be a tell-all, she admitted. But while she stayed mum on certain subjects, the memoir doesn’t skimp on details when it comes to her own upbringing.
Emery described herself as a “rebel with a cause” during her youth, a baseball-playing, jeans-wearing tomboy who explored every corner of the Island between Nanaimo and Victoria with her family in the 1940s. She lost touch with the area at various points, due to the demands of her job, but came to appreciate what she left behind when she returned permanently in 2007.
“When you’re brought up here, the landscape imprints itself on you. The mountains, the sea. And you don’t realize it. But then you come back, and think: ‘Wow, this is so incredibly beautiful.’ ”
Emery wrote the book over several years, with a painstaking eye for local detail. She had help from a treasure trove she discovered in her parents’ belongings, shoeboxes full of ephemera — including her mother’s Nanaimo bar recipe — and letters she had written during her travels. “I couldn’t have written the book without those letters. There is no way I could have.”
She has kept only select bits of memorabilia from her time in movies, as she donated much of it to the Toronto International Film Festival archives. She does have the memories in her head, however, and has come to trust what she experienced first-hand over what was written down in a movie press kit.
Her instincts were honed to a fine point over decades of experience. She had encounters with ingrates, to be sure. But her fond memories include time spent with raucous rockers Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop in the 1980s, which changed her perspective on the industry.
At first, she was wary of both. “I thought: ‘Oh my god, I’m going to be working with these guys, and they are going to be wild, how am I going to deal with this?’ But they both turned out to be the nicest, most down-to-earth, charming guys. I nearly died.
“Iggy Pop was doing an interview with The Globe and Mail and he was called to the set. I thought, ‘Well, that’s that.’ But he came back after on his own volition — he didn’t need to be dragged — and continued the interview. They were really amiable guys. It’s always a surprise. The ones you think are going to be terrific turn out to be dorks, and the ones you are nervous of turn out to be really cool types.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demi Lovato Goes Makeup-Free for Swimsuit Selfies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Demi Lovato seems to be spending her weekend in one of the best ways possible — by hanging out poolside. On Saturday, the singer posted a couple of photos on Instagram in which she donned a makeup-free look whilst donning a swimsuit. And, of course, the snaps were nothing short of stunning.
In her caption, Lovato related that she learned how to use the self-timer feature in order to capture her selfies. She got to put her new skill to use as she posed in a crimson swimsuit for a couple of seriously stylish and beautiful snaps. The "Cool for the Summer" singer's post has already garnered plenty of reactions from fans and friends alike. Model Ashley Graham even commented on the post to write, "my girl is straight fire," and she's definitely not wrong.
This isn't the first time that Lovato has chosen to go a makeup-free route on Instagram. In September 2019, the singer took things a step further by posting a completely unedited photo of herself wearing a bikini. At the time, she noted that she wanted to post the photo because she wants the new chapter in her life to be an authentic one.
"This is my biggest fear. A photo of me in a bikini unedited. And guess what, it’s CELLULIT!!!! I’m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited - and I hate that I did that but it’s the truth) so that others think I’m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it’s just not me," she explained. "This is what I got. I want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else’s standards. So here’s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day." As she continued on in her caption, she hoped that by posting the snap that she can inspire others to be authentically themselves, as well.
"Anyway, here’s me, RAW, REAL! And I love me," Lovato continued. "And you should love you too! Now back to the studio.. I’m working on an anthem.. also. Just so everyone’s clear.. I’m not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that’s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demi Lovato Stuns In Sultry Pool Pics And Her Man Is Loving It!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Demi Lovato is taking advantage of the free time she has because of the quarantine orders to learn new skills including how to use the self timer on her phone and take steamy pool pics! She shared a couple of snaps on her Instagram and it’s safe to say that her boyfriend, Max Ehrich was impressed and so were her followers!
Demi looked stunning and sultry with no makeup on and wearing a strapless one piece swimsuit while she posed by the pool.
In the caption, she jokingly wrote: ‘Swipe to see how I discovered the self-timer feature for taking pics. @angelokritikos [her photographer] – you in trouble boo boo 😝🌴.’
The photographer was quick to respond, playing along: ‘BRING IT ON BOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 😍😍😍😍.’
In the meantime, her boyfriend also took to the comment section to show her some love by simply leaving a heart-eyes emoji!
Fellow celebs gushed over Demi as well, including Ashley Graham and JoJo.
Demi and her new man haven’t been together for very long but they already seem like they have a great bond.
One insider dished that they really love spending time together so the joint quarantine is no problem.
Speaking of relationships, during an interview on the I Weigh podcast with actress Jameela Jamil, Demi revealed that she is not in touch with any of her ex boyfriends.
‘I kind of used to have this mentality that if I had a negative experience with somebody, I needed to mend it or needed to make things right. The fact of the matter is that I’m not really friends with any of my exes because I had to realize that that was not healthy either.’
‘Now that I have been able to fully let go of people, that is another thing I had to learn when it comes to cutting the toxic people out of your life – if they are an ex, it is for a reason,’ she dished.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Demi revealed that she just learned how to use her self-timer.
Demi Lovato upped her selfie game by learning to use the self-timer feature on her phone, and her fans were the beneficiaries of her newfound knowledge when she snapped a steamy swimsuit snapshot.
On Saturday, Demi took to Instagram to share a set of two photos with her 80.9 million followers. For her intimate solo photo shoot, the 27-year-old singer rocked a strapless bathing suit that was a rich wine color. The garment featured all-over ruching, a design element that elevated its appearance by giving it texture and depth. The folds of gathered fabric also added a touch of elegance to Demi’s figure-flattering swimwear, while a sweetheart neckline gave it a romantic feel.
In Demi’s first photo, all of her bathing suit was submerged in the crystal-clear water of a a hot tub. However, the “Sorry Not Sorry” singer was providing a close look at the tantalizing amount of cleavage that the garment’s low neckline was leaving exposed. In this picture, Demi was reaching out to take the selfie by holding the camera away from her.
Her pale freckled skin looked radiant. Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her lips were a natural shade of pink. If Demi was wearing any eye makeup at all, it was subtle. However, her dark eyelashes did appear to be curled.
Demi’s second photo was taken from a distance. She was standing up so that the bubbling water in the stone hot tub came up to her hips, which provided a peek at the top of her curvy derriere. She had her back arched, and she was reaching up with both hands to grasp her long, dark hair. The musician had her lips slightly parted, and she was gazing at the camera with a dreamy look on her face.
In the caption of her post, Demi seemingly suggested that she won’t need the help of celebrity photographer Angelo Kritikos as much now that she’s mastered the art of taking timed photos.
It took just one hour for Demi’s demonstration of her photography skills to earn her over 1.1 million likes. Her natural beauty look proved to be a big hit with her followers.
“You look so amazing without your makeup Demi,” read one response to her photos.
“You are so naturally beautiful!” another admirer remarked.
However, one fan was impressed with an area of Demi’s body other than her flawless face.
“How do you get your armpits to look so good?” the commenter asked.
Earlier this year, Demi shared another gorgeous selfie that received rave reviews from her fans. She was completely barefaced, and she let her Instagram followers know that she was “proud” of her freckles and her “booty chin.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nobody wants this free house because it's 'haunted'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A house is being given away for nothing in the US state of Louisiana – but interest from potential owners has waned because of chilling stories from former residents and locals.
The four-bedroom home was built in the 1930s and has been compared to the Amityville Horror house.
A woman who used to live their claims her great grandmother haunts the house and is "well known" to stir something that's cooking on the hob.
In a bid to get someone to move the house to another location and then restore it Sylvia McLain, a co-owner of McLain Investments, shared images of it on Facebook.
But that didn't go to plan after people left comments about the creepy goings-on and their own experiences.
Sylvia, who wants to use the land to build on, says that she too had "all the stories" about it being haunted by an old woman and said former owners had even had ghost hunters in to get her to leave.
Dawn Vallot DeClout, who once lived at the house, claims her great grandmother Adele, haunts the place
The house was built on a 160-acre plot of land which was owned by Dawn's predecessors.
Adele died in the front room of the house in 1967 and the family moved out in the 80s.
Dawn said: "We believe [Adele] is the ghost, but she's not menacing at all. She was probably like 4ft 9in and weighed about 100lb.
"She lived to be almost 90 and she was always digging in the pots, like when you have something on the stove and someone goes and looks in the pot and stirs it around.
"She was well-known for that, and so when we lived there, we used to hear her all the time jangling the pots when we had something on the stove.
"You could hear somebody picking up the lid but there was nobody in the kitchen."
Sylvia added that there were 'some really cute stories about it being haunted'.
Among the hundreds of responses on Sylvia's Facebook post were: "Yes it is [haunted]. I experienced three things there that could not be explained and my friend that lived there had more than that.
"We actually experienced one together and we still talk about it."
Another added: "Most likely the haunting will stay attached to the land and whoever lives in the new home they build will deal with it."
A third said they visited the home and reported 'a lot of weird noises in the ceilings and walls'.
Sylvia remains hopeful that someone will want the house, she said: "It's probably going to need to be taken apart in order to move it unless it's going really close.
"It's bittersweet. We know somebody will have a nice place with some historical value and a little bit of a story, but it's a chapter of our family that will be moving on.
"We probably won't tear the house down. We'll probably either restore it or find a place for it unless we have to."

    <h5 class="mb-1">No one wants free 'haunted' house after former owner shares creepy backstory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The owners of a home compared to the Amityville Horror house are struggling to give it away for free as locals spread stories about it being haunted.
The four-bedroom home in Louisiana, US, was built in the 1930s and has gained a spooky reputation, meaning no one has dared to move in despite not having to spend a penny to make it theirs.
One former resident claims the home is haunted by her great grandmother, who is 'well known' to stir cooking left unattended in the kitchen and move the pots around.
Sylvia McLain, a co-owner of McLain Investments, took to Facebook to share snaps of the home in a bid to convince someone to move and restore the home so they could build new property on the land.
However, it appears potential suitors were put off by a flood of comments below from ex-residents and visitors who reported the creepy goings-on they claim to have experienced.
Sylvia admitted she's heard 'all the stories' about it being haunted by an old woman and said former owners had even had ghost hunters in to banish her.
But she remains hopeful the 'history of the home' can be saved, and it's free for anyone to take on to 'move to another location for restoration'.
Former resident Dawn Vallot DeClout claims the house is occupied by the spirit of her great grandmother Adele, a 4ft 9in woman who lived until about 90 and was known for meddling in the kitchen.
Dawn's family owned the 160-acre plot the house was built on from 1860, and her great grandmother died in the front room in 1967.
Dawn, whose family moved out in the 80s, said: "We believe [Adele] is the ghost, but she's not menacing at all. She was probably like 4ft 9in and weighed about 100lb.
"She lived to be almost 90 and she was always digging in the pots, like when you have something on the stove and someone goes and looks in the pot and stirs it around.
"She was well-known for that, and so when we lived there, we used to hear her all the time jangling the pots when we had something on the stove.
"You could hear somebody picking up the lid but there was nobody in the kitchen."
Sylvia said there is a lot of rumours surrounding the house, with 'some really cute stories about it being haunted'.
One suitor had offered to take the home, but had a change of heart when they discovered it would cost about £64,000 to move and reassemble.
Sylvia believes if the two-storey, 2,400 square foot property was kept close by, it would only cost about half of that.
However, locals comparing it to a notorious house in Amityville, where a man shot and killed six members of his family, isn't making it any easier.
The post on Facebook got hundreds of responses with one writing: "Yes it is [haunted]. I experienced three things there that could not be explained and my friend that lived there had more than that.
"We actually experienced one together and we still talk about it."
Another replied: "Most likely the haunting will stay attached to the land and whoever lives in the new home they build will deal with it."
A third said they visited the home and reported 'a lot of weird noises in the ceilings and walls'.
Sylvia is worried she may not be able to find someone to take on the project due to the costs after any interest following the Facebook post quickly fell away.
She said: "It's probably going to need to be taken apart in order to move it unless it's going really close.
"It's bittersweet. We know somebody will have a nice place with some historical value and a little bit of a story, but it's a chapter of our family that will be moving on.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal drama 'All Rise' adapts to pandemic for season finale</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES - The legal drama “All Rise” has become the first U.S. scripted television series to adapt the the pandemic by producing an episode remotely, enlisting its stars to work from home on their own makeup, set design and lighting.
The season finale, airing Monday night on CBS, finds Simone Missick’s Judge Lola Carmichael presiding over a Los Angeles Superior Court bench trial via video conference.
Missick said she was exhausted at the end of each shooting day after making her own adjustments to costume and sound, converting her living room into an office and her dining room into a court room.
“I did pick up new skills. I think that I could be a location scout-slash-set design co-ordinator. I don’t need to lead the department, but I could be in the background,” Missick laughed in a Zoom interview. “So if this acting stuff doesn’t work out, I could maybe pick up a career doing it virtually because that was the fun part.”
While most full-season shows cut production short due to stay-home orders, “All Rise” creator Greg Spottiswood said he realized that the dialogue-heavy nature of his show allowed for remote production. A key challenge — predicting how the legal world would adjust to the novel coronavirus, with prisons becoming outbreak hotspots and video chats replacing in-court hearings.
“The justice system needs to find a way to respond to this moment. Technology is one of the ways that they’re responding to it,” he said.
Spottiswood said producers paid the full crew, even those that weren’t able to work, for the episode. While the show could produce more episodes remotely in a second season if necessary, he’s anxious to get back to sets and real-world locations.
Missick said her mother-in-law in Atlanta had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for eight days, with symptoms serious enough to require a ventilator. She had fully recovered by the time Missick began shooting, but it brought the coronavirus crisis close to home for the 38-year-old actress.
In her downtime after production, Missick has enjoyed Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and the Netflix series “Unorthodox.” But she’s been struck by how far away from today’s reality the action on the screen can feel.
“Everything is BC. It’s ‘before coronavirus.’ You’re watching people — they’re in restaurants, they’re hugging each other. You’re like, ‘God, I remember what that was like.’ Now, I think every show that comes after is going to have to deal with what this pandemic is.”

In her downtime after production, Missick has enjoyed Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and the Netflix series “Unorthodox.” But she’s been struck by how far away from today’s reality the action on the screen can feel.
“Everything is BC. It’s ‘before coronavirus.’ You’re watching people — they’re in restaurants, they’re hugging each other. You’re like, ‘God, I remember what that was like.’ Now, I think every show that comes after is going to have to deal with what this pandemic is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal drama 'All Rise' adapts to pandemic for season finale</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (AP) - The legal drama “All Rise” has become the first U.S. scripted television series to adapt the the pandemic by producing an episode remotely, enlisting its stars to work from home on their own makeup, set design and lighting.
The season finale, airing Monday night on CBS, finds Simone Missick’s Judge Lola Carmichael presiding over a Los Angeles Superior Court bench trial via video conference.
Missick said she was exhausted at the end of each shooting day after making her own adjustments to costume and sound, converting her living room into an office and her dining room into a court room.
“I did pick up new skills. I think that I could be a location scout-slash-set design coordinator. I don’t need to lead the department, but I could be in the background,” Missick laughed in a Zoom interview. “So if this acting stuff doesn’t work out, I could maybe pick up a career doing it virtually because that was the fun part.”
While most full-season shows cut production short due to stay-home orders, “All Rise” creator Greg Spottiswood said he realized that the dialogue-heavy nature of his show allowed for remote production. A key challenge - predicting how the legal world would adjust to the novel coronavirus, with prisons becoming outbreak hotspots and video chats replacing in-court hearings.
“The justice system needs to find a way to respond to this moment. Technology is one of the ways that they’re responding to it,” he said.
Spottiswood said producers paid the full crew, even those that weren’t able to work, for the episode. While the show could produce more episodes remotely in a second season if necessary, he’s anxious to get back to sets and real-world locations.
Missick said her mother-in-law in Atlanta had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for eight days, with symptoms serious enough to require a ventilator. She had fully recovered by the time Missick began shooting, but it brought the coronavirus crisis close to home for the 38-year-old actress.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On the front line: I’ve had dreams where I’ve seen myself on ventilators</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a part-time GP and cabinet member for Oldham Council, Dr Zahid Chauhan has a broad view of the coronavirus response in the UK.
In the latest of a series of profiles looking at workers on the front line of the battle against Covid-19, Dr Chauhan, who is also chief clinical officer for a social enterprise in Greater Manchester, tells the PA news agency what life is like right now.
– What was a normal working day like before coronavirus?
“My normal day would have been that I would do some surgeries in the morning, then have some lunch and do some afternoon surgery on certain days; on certain days I will just do my council work. Saturday, Sunday I will meet with my constituents, I do my case work, and sometimes I have to meet my organisational work as well.”
– How has that changed now?
“Since coronavirus, I’m on call more or less 24 hours. I get phone calls at four o’clock in the morning if I’m not already at the workplace. We might have issues day to day, on a daily basis we might be trying to convince a colleague the PPE you’ve got is enough to go and see their patient, trying to convince a driver who carries a doctor to say ‘no, you are safe’, might be trying to find GPs to do certain things – and then at the same time go into the acute clinics for Covid and see those patients.”
– How is it affecting you?
“Initially it was really worrying, because you come home and see your children, so you learn to change your life, you don’t allow your kids to hug you… but, you get a bit anxious as well. You come home and then you read in the newspapers and things that your colleagues have died, you have experience of people you know closely being on ventilators and some of them die, and you think, ‘what’s going to happen with me, with my family?’
“You remember, that if you don’t do it, who else is going to do it? As clinical leadership, you need to set an example.
“I’ve had dreams where I’ve seen myself on ventilators, I’ve had dreams of writing my own will, it always happens after seeing or hearing about the death of a colleague.
“On the other side, positive side, the huge satisfaction you get by helping people who need you most. It’s worth doing it even only for that reason… I’ve tried to do my best to fulfil my social responsibility.”
– Who do you think the heroes of this pandemic are?
“Everyone. It’s not easy to sit at home and be locked into the house, that’s the most difficult thing to do. It’s not easy to be a carer, and work on minimum wage and go and look after the most vulnerable people, and also being vulnerable yourself and worrying about infections and things. It’s not easy to be a bin man, and go and collect the bins of people who might be infected, or have contaminated surfaces. It’s not easy to be working nights as admin people to support your health and social care colleagues.
“It’s not a doctor or a nurse who can single-handedly help you and care about you, it’s hundreds of people who put themselves at risk, who work on minimum wage to deliver the best care.”
– What lessons can people learn from this experience?
“This is not the time to divide us, but this is definitely going to be a time where we should reflect on what our needs are and reflect from our mistakes, and say what do we need to do to reinvest in our social care, reinvest in our health system, reinvest in our other services and deal with social deprivation, deal with austerity and many other things.
“I’m sure we are going to have analysis of the coronavirus crisis afterwards and I hope that politicians are going to be brave enough to stand up and say sorry, we thought this was the best way, but I wish we would have done this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">50 Cent Clowns Mike Pence For Not Wearing Mask During Clinic Visit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Recently, an Australian artist has been painting murals of 50 Cent’s face placed on to various figures in music and politics. However, they haven’t been flattering figures, which has caused 50 Cent to re-post the murals along with his commentary. Artist Lushux previously put 50’s face on Taylor Swift and Donald Trump, and now the artist put the Queens rapper’s face on Vice President Mike Pence. In true 50 fashion, he gave his thoughts on the artist as well as Mike Pence.
On the caption of his Instagram post, 50 said: “👀This f**king guy won’t stop, SMH 🤦‍♂️I guess I’m not wearing a mask because i’m tested frequently. 😤.” 50’s comment is calling out Pence who reportedly didn’t wear a mask while visiting the Mayo Clinic, even though the clinic states that all visitors are required to wear a mask while in the building. Take a look above.

    <h5 class="mb-1">50 Cent Reveals Painting of Himself as Mike Pence</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson had a very interesting surprise in store for his fans on Instagram recently. On Sunday, he posted a photo of a painting of himself portrayed as Mike Pence — yes, really. In addition to posting the snaps, he included some very choice words for the artist behind the image. As you might have guessed, the wild 50 Cent/Pence mural is truly something to behold.
The mural appears to showcase Pence, but his face is morphed by Jackson's. On Instagram, 50 Cent wrote alongside the snap, "This f—ing guy won’t stop, [shake my head] I guess i’m not wearing a mask because i’m tested frequently." He added, in a separate Instagram post, "wait how does this even happen, what is this guys problem with me. f—ing lunatic i need a drink." According to Billboard, murals, crafted by Melbourne-based graffiti artist Lushsux, featuring 50 Cent's likeness have appeared all over Australia. Not only has the rapper appeared as Pence, but portraits have also popped up featuring him as Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, and Post Malone, which is why he mentioned that the artist "won't stop" with the wild murals.
It's particularly interesting to see Jackson's likeness morphed with Pence's because of the rapper's thoughts regarding the Trump administration. In August of 2019, 50 Cent told the Daily Beast that he was offered a large sum of money to appear at Trump's January 2017 inauguration. But, he refused the offer for a very specific reason.
“He offered me a half-million just to come!” 50 Cent said. “I didn’t think that was a good move at that point. You find out that every dollar is not a good dollar, and how do you repair the damage that that does?” Elsewhere in his conversation with the publication, the conversation turned towards rapper A$AP Rocky, who received support from the president after he was placed in jail in Sweden following an alleged assault incident.
“He’s still the president of America at the present moment. You’re gonna help A$AP? Wait… this kid is from Harlem!” the rapper said, with a laugh. “This is more exciting than an Emmy or a Golden Globe. I would take the tweet, print it out, and have the little picture from Twitter go next to it and put it on the wall, because he’s talking specifically about me while he’s the president of America. We’re just living in a different climate right now. It’s crazy.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rapper 50 Cent is not amused by an Australian street artist who’s been depicting him as other celebrities.
The latest featured 50 Cent, a.k.a. Curtis Jackson, as U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence.
“This f**king guy won’t stop, SMH,” he wrote on Instagram.
He added, “what is this guys problem with me. f**king lunatic.”
Previously, he’s complained about the artist — who goes by the name Lushsux — who’s been plastering walls with murals of 50 Cent, including this one in which he has no teeth due to “too many trips to the candy shop.”
The “Power” star was also not amused by a mural that depicted him as Taylor Swift (“Swifty Cent”), while others included Chairman Mao, Post Malone and even Donald Trump.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vanessa Bryant posted a sweet tribute to her late daughter Gigi on what would have been her 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”
Vanessa wrote in a follow-up post that her daughter “loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures,” and wanted people to “commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She posted a picture of a red bracelet with the words Gigi’s name and her nickname, “Mambacita,” writing that it will soon be on sale, the proceeds of which would benefit the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which was started in their memory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vanessa Bryant posted a sweet tribute to her late daughter Gigi on what would have been her 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”
Vanessa wrote in a follow-up post that her daughter “loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures,” and wanted people to “commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
captionMarty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels to 2015 in 1989’s “Back to the Future Part II.”
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to cope with stress and be kind to yourself, according to the World Health Organization's new illustrated guide</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With most of the world still reeling from the effects of COVID-19, the World Health Organization has put out an illustrated guide to coping with stress, which comes with segments on grounding yourself and unhooking from unkind thoughts.
The guide, published April 29, coincides with the start of Mental Health Awareness Month, marked globally in May. Though it was commissioned years before the pandemic, it echoes much of what WHO leaders have been speaking about over the last few weeks: we need to take mental health seriously during the pandemic.
“Although it wasn’t specifically developed to help people manage stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that it will help people who are currently feeling under stress as a result of the pandemic,” WHO communications officer Alison Brunier told Insider in an email.
Some sociologists have warned the public about an impending “grief tsunami,” as many mourn the deaths of those who have passed due to COVID-19, and many suffer the effects of being socially isolated or lacking support for mental health, eating disorders, or alcohol use disorders. Overdose deaths are on the rise in many states, from Texas to Pennsylvania.
The guide was put out by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use and comes with audio narrated by African voiceover talent Sanjo Ogunseye and illustrations by Julie Smith. It is currently being translated into other languages, and the translation versions will be online sometime in the next few weeks.
A number of guides are being published, from one on how to support the mental health of frontline workers to guides created by California’s surgeon general on how to stay calm during a crisis to the CDC’s official mental health guides.
There are mental health guides for beverage and hospitality professionals, for caregivers of veterans, and for people with mental illness.
“America is about to experience an unprecedented loss of life. Even while it is very difficult to predict just how many we’ll lose to COVID-19, we wanted to shed light on the collateral damage this will have on families,” said Emily Smith-Greenaway, author of the grief tsunami study.
“It is important that the burden of bereavement, and its potential mental and physical health consequences, is factored into discussions of the public health challenge facing America and all nations.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Host of stars announced for second Disney Family Singalong</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The broadcast raises money for the coronavirus relief effort.
Shakira, Lion King star Donald Glover and Frozen’s Idina Menzel have been announced as taking part in the second Disney Family Singalong.
The entertainment giant is bringing together a host of stars to perform some of its best known songs for a broadcast raising money for the coronavirus relief effort.
During the first show last month, Beyonce made a surprise appearance while Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato also performed.
For the next broadcast, acts announced so far include Shakira, who will be singing her hit Try Everything from 2016 animated blockbuster Zootopia.
Menzel will team up with Broadway star Ben Platt for a duet of A Whole New World from Aladdin while Glover is set to reunite with  his Lion King remake co-stars Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner for a performance of Hakuna Matata.
Other highlights from the May 10 show include Halsey singing Part Of Your World from The Little Mermaid and Rebel Wilson covering Poor Unfortunate Souls from the same film.
And following news that Disney is working on a live-action remake of 1997 animated classic Hercules, Keke Palmer will take on Zero To Hero.
Additional celebrities and performance details will be announced soon, Disney said.
The Disney Family Singalong: Volume II, hosted by Ryan Seacrest, will air in the US on May 10 and will be available to stream on Disney+ “in the days that follow,” the company said.
Money raised will go to food bank charity Feeding America and its work feeding families amid the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec fashion designer Mathieu Caron launches line of masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a limited edition of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of professional figure skaters he typically dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champ Tessa Virtue and world silver medallist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, that material is being used to create designer masks — with profits going to the World Health Organization.
"We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks," said Caron, a Longueuil, Que.-based skatewear, dancewear, gown and wedding dress designer.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask."
The unique masks are not for all budgets — with the eight models costing between $150 and $300.
It hasn't stymied interest in the masks. Japanese customers snatched up the items inspired by Uno's costumes, which retailed for $200 to $250.
"I was surprised," Caron admitted. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn't think people had so much money to buy a mask."
Caron said at the beginning, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
In three hours, 245 masks were sold, giving birth to the hashtag #Shomask in Japan, with stocks of the three models flying off the shelves.
When the items were first made available, a few masks were ready to ship. But given the demand, Caron had to move quickly to fill orders.
The goal wasn't a big marketing campaign, Caron said.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration," Caron said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks."
The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters' outfits and are very breathable material, with padding included to give them shape and structure.
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibres.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all," Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Designer Mathieu Caron launches high-end masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL -- Quebec designer Mathieu Caron, whose creations are among the most seen in the world, is launching a line of limited edition, high-end masks inspired by figure skating costumes he designed.
For years, Caron, who hails from Longueuil, has designed spectacular skating costumes seen by millions of viewers, including those of Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and Olympic silver medalist Shoma Uno.
“We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely redid the form to make masks,' said Caron, who also makes dance clothes and other clothing equipment for sports and training.
PROCEEDS GO TO THE WHO
The eight luxury mask models are priced between $150 and $300.
“During this pandemic, my main goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask,” said Caron, noting that all of the proceeds from mask sales will go to the World Health Organization.
Caron reportedly sold over 245 masks in three hours.
The masks especially gained popularity in Japan where the retail price ranges between $200 and $250. 
“I was surprised. I didn't think that in times of crisis like this, people had so much money to buy a mask, honestly,” he said. 
The mask craze quickly led to the hashtag #Showmask. 
ADEQUATE PROTECTION 
Although the mask designs follow health recommendations, Caron insists that they should not be considered medical equipment. 
“It protects very well,” said Caron. “In terms of fabrics, there are cotton and polyester fibers, so it follows the recommendations…. But is this something ‘medical’ ? Not at all. We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s son Ayaan took to Instagram to share some rare photos of his father recently. The first black and white memory captured the father-son duo enjoying a bike ride while Ayaan was a child. And a second throwback photo saw Irrfan and Ayaan walking down a street, which seems to be a more recent one. Remembering his father, Ayaan had captioned the post, “The flesh we roam this earth in is a blessing, not a promise.”

Irrfan Khan’s older son Babil had also posted an unseen video of his father relishing pani-puri. Babil had captioned the clip, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.” Babil’s post was flooded with emotional comments by grieving fans, expressing strength to the late actor’s family.
Irrfan Khan passed away on Wednesday after a two year long battle against neuroendocrine cancer. In a gratitude note, the actor’s wife Sutapa had expressed that it was not a loss but a gain of the things that he taught them. She shared, “How can I write this as a family statement when the whole world is taking it as a personal loss? How can I begin to feel alone when millions are grieving with us at the moment? I want to assure everyone that this is not a loss, it is a gain. It’s a gain of the things he taught us, and now we shall finally begin to truly implement it and evolve. Yet I want to try to fill in the things that people don’t already know. Funnily, our life was a masterclass in acting, so when the dramatic entry of the ‘uninvited guests’ happened, I had by then learnt, to see a harmony in the cacophony. The doctor’s reports were like scripts which I wanted to perfect, so I never miss any detail that he sought for in his performance.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor’s wife Neetu Kapoor has bid the farewell to her husband in the most heartbreaking and emotional manner and it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. Two days after the death of the actor, she took to Instagram to share a throwback picture of the Bobby actor where he can be seen holding a drink in his hand and smiles brightly in the picture. Sharing the photo, she wrote, “End of our story.” Also Read - Amitabh Bachchan Reflects on Irrfan Khan And Rishi Kapoor's Death, Answers Why Losing Younger Celeb Feels More Tragic Than Losing an Elder
Earlier, Neetu shared a long post and stated he would like to be remembered with smile and not with tears. The post reads, “Our dear Rishi Kapoor passed away peacefully at 8:45am IST in hospital today after a two-year battle with leukemia. The doctors and medical staff at the hospital said he kept them entertained to the last. He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him.”
“He was grateful for the love of his fans that poured in from the world over. In his passing, they would all understand that he would like to be remembered with a smile and not with tears.In this hour of personal loss, we also recognise the world is going through a very difficult and troubled time. There are numerous restrictions around movement and gathering in public. We would like to request all his fans and well-wishers and friends of the family to please respect the laws that are in force. He would not have it any other way”, it further stated.
The Mulk actor died at the age of 67 on April 30 after a long battle with bone marrow cancer. He was cremated in Chandanwadi crematorium with family members and few industry celebrities in attendance. The funeral was attended by Ranbir Kapoor, wife Neetu Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Randhir Kapoor, Babita Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Ayan Mukerji, Anil Ambani among others.
In 2018, Rishi was diagnosed with cancer and got treated in the US for a year and had returned to India in September 2019. The actor is survived by his wife Neetu Kapoor and children Ranbir and Riddhima Kapoor.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After Irrfan Khan's untimely demise on April 29, his family has been penning heartfelt tribute to him and sharing their happy memories with him. Yesterday, the actor's wife, Sutapa Sikdar penned a moving eulogy, which spoke volumes about their love for each other. And now, Irrfan's younger son Ayaan shared some of his unseen pictures with dad.
Posting two pictures of himself with the late actor, Ayaan captioned them as, 'The flesh we roam this earth in is a blessing, not a promise....'
The first picture features Ayaan riding a bike with Irrfan and it's such a cute father-son moment!
In the second picture, Ayaan and Irrfan are seen walking on a street, perhaps in London, where the actor underwent cancer treatment for several months.
Meanwhile, Irrfan's elder son Babil, too, walked down the memory lane and shared a throwback video of his late father on his Instagram page. In the video, the Angrezi Medium actor is seen relishing pani-puri at a restaurant. Babil captioned the video as, 'When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani-puri.'
In his last interview with Filmfare, Irrfan opened up about his struggle as an actor and said, "I have waited for work, and I have waited long. I used to think I'll meet X director and show him Y pictures and boom! Whenever I have tried that, it has actually worked adversely. You can't start performing when you meet someone right? And besides, I am shy, so it works against my temperament. I am lucky to never be out of work, but I have always waited. When I was in TV, I waited for films, when was in films, I waited for the right role, when I had the right role, I waited for the right film... it's a never ending process."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Allen, Drummer Who Created the Beat of Afrobeat, Dies at 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tony Allen, the drummer who created the steadfast, subtle beat of the Nigerian protest funk known as Afrobeat, died on Thursday in Paris. He was 79.
His manager, Eric Trosset, said the cause was an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
From 1964 to 1978, Mr. Allen worked with the bandleader Fela Ransome-Kuti, who became known worldwide simply as Fela. He was the musical director for Fela’s band Africa 70, which forged music that was both politically committed and danceable, merging West African styles with American jazz and funk.
Mr. Allen made more than three dozen albums with Fela and the band, including the indelible “Zombie” and “Gentleman,” as well as solo albums on which Mr. Allen led Africa 70. The music of Fela and Africa 70 reached listeners and emulators all over the world. On Twitter, Peter Gabriel wrote, “As a musician & aspiring drummer, it was thrilling to get lost in their new, smart, sexy & political music full of killer grooves.”
The songs that defined Afrobeat, with Mr. Allen’s drumming at their core, move at a deliberate, unhurried tempo, geared for marathon six-hour sets and dancing until dawn. On albums, many of Fela’s 1970s Afrobeat songs stretched the length of an LP side.
While Fela composed the parts for the band’s other instruments, Mr. Allen created his own drum parts. His playing was open-ended and improvisatory rather than bluntly repetitive; complex patterns drove a shifting dialogue with every element of the band. “You listen to it flowing like a river,” Mr. Allen explained in a 2016 interview with The Guardian.
After he left Africa 70 in 1979, Mr. Allen went on to an international solo career, leading his own bands and collaborating with rock, jazz, reggae, R&B and electronic musicians. The composer and producer Brian Eno, a fan since the 1970s, once called Mr. Allen “perhaps the greatest drummer who ever lived.”
Tony Oladipo Allen was born on Aug. 12, 1940, in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He was the eldest of six children of James Alabi Allen, a Nigerian auto mechanic, and Prudencia Anna (Mettle) Allen, whose family was from Ghana.
As a teenager he learned electronics and worked as a radio technician — skills that would come in handy in his early days as a touring musician, when he repaired the band’s amplifiers. He didn’t start playing drums until he was 18.
He had grown up listening to West African music, but he also immersed himself in jazz, studying the drumming of Gene Krupa, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams and others. “These guys were telling a story by playing different rhythms, and they were doing it with independent coordination,” he said in the 2013 book “Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat,” which he wrote with Michael Veal. “That’s the way the drums should be played, man.”
As he taught himself to play, Mr. Allen became particularly interested in the pedal-operated pair of cymbals known as the hi-hat, which he felt other African drummers neglected. The whoosh, rustle and ping of his hi-hats animated Mr. Allen’s drumming with an additional layer of polyrhythm.
“I’m creating different patterns with my four limbs,” Mr. Allen told The Guardian in 2014. “They are all playing something different, which means you need to split your mind into four elements with the one central idea running through.”
Martin Perna, the founder of the Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band Antibalas, which performed with Mr. Allen in the 2000s, said Mr. Allen “was the embodiment of rhythm.” He added, “What’s so magical is with all that variation, he’s somehow more hypnotic than a pattern that doesn’t change.”
Mr. Allen soon found work in Lagos highlife bands and groups that played whatever was popular. In 1964 he auditioned for Fela Ransome-Kuti, who was putting together a jazz band, beginning a 15-year musical alliance that survived chronic disputes over getting paid.
That first band’s pure jazz drew only small audiences, and Fela soon decided to combine jazz with African pop; as Fela Ransome-Kuti and His Koola Lobitos, the band played what it called “highlife jazz.”
The group toured Nigeria and neighboring Ghana. In the late 1960s a Ghanaian promoter, Raymond Aziz, came up with a new name for their musical hybrid: Afrobeat.
During a lengthy stay in Los Angeles in 1969 when the band was on tour in the United States, Fela grew politicized by the Black Power movement. When the band returned to Nigeria, Fela renamed it first Nigeria 70 and then Africa 70. His new songs were more streamlined and merged James Brown-style funk with Mr. Allen’s rolling, crackling rhythms.
“I had developed the drumming concept for Afrobeat from many things that I heard while I was growing up,” Mr. Allen said in his autobiography. “It was a fusion of beats and patterns. There was highlife, there was local Yoruba music like apala and sakara, there was jazz, and there was Western popular music like funk and R&B.”
Fela’s new songs also carried messages, at first couched in proverbs and then increasingly direct, that condemned corruption and taunted Nigeria’s military dictatorship. Although Fela and Africa 70 recorded extensively and performed regularly at his club, the Shrine, Fela was repeatedly arrested and beaten.
Africa 70 persisted, and Mr. Allen stayed on as bandleader until September 1978, when, after years of feeling musically fulfilled but financially exploited, he quit.
Mr. Allen was backed by Africa 70 on his 1979 album, “No Accommodation for Lagos,” but he struggled to start his own band in Nigeria. Eventually, after recording in London, he settled in Paris in 1985.
In 1987 he married Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him, as do their three sons and four children from an earlier relationship in Nigeria, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He lived in Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris.
Mr. Allen was frustrated with the first recordings he made in France, on which trendy-minded producers smothered his drumming with electronics. But in the 1990s he forged the blend of Afrobeat and dub electronics that he wanted on “Black Voices,” which featured guest appearances by singers from Parliament-Funkadelic. He found more compatible collaborators in the next decades.
A longtime fan, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, appeared on Mr. Allen’s 2002 album, “Home Cooking,” starting a long affiliation. Mr. Allen joined Mr. Albarn in the band the Good, the Bad and the Queen and in a project with Flea, the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist, called Rocket Juice & the Moon. He also made small-group jazz albums and recorded with the reggae guitarist Ernest Ranglin and the techno producer Jeff Mills. This year he completed “Rejoice,” an album featuring the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela that was begun at sessions in 2010. On Saturday, Gorillaz released a new song with Mr. Allen and the grime rapper Skepta, “How Far?”
“I still challenge myself every time with my playing,” Mr. Allen wrote in his autobiography. “I still want to play something impossible, something that I never played before. That’s what I’m after.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor was full of positivity: Sharmaji Namkeen producer on veteran actor’s last film</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bollywood veteran Rishi Kapoor was never the one to mention his illness and was always full of positive attitude, says filmmaker Honey Trehan as he fondly remembers working with the actor on his last film, Sharmaji Namkeen.
Kapoor died at the age of 67 on April 30 after a two year long battle with leukaemia at H N Reliance hospital in south Mumbai.
The film is produced by Excel Entertainment in association with Trehan and Abhishek Choubey under their banner MacGuffin Pictures. It is directed by the debutant Hitesh Bhatia.
“It is a coming-of-age story of a 60-year-old man. It is about a middle-class man who wants to discover life after retirement. This film was meant for him, he is the DNA of the film. I was looking to work with Rishi sir for the longest time and I am glad this script clicked well,” Trehan told PTI in an interview.
The producer said he was amazed by the actor’s professionalism.
“He was so child-like, he was like a newcomer. He was so charged up. At the age of 67, he would shoot for 10-12 hours a day. There was no negative thought ever. There was no mention about his illness.
“And if you would ask him, ‘How are you feeling?’ He would say, ‘How am I looking?’ His attitude was commendable.”
Asked if the shooting schedule was changed due to his health, Trehan said, “He never allowed it.”
Trehan recalled that the Delhi schedule of the film was to start from mid-January this year and Kapoor was to arrive a day before and the actor’s sister Ritu Nanda had passed away the same day.

“It was a tragedy in the family and he happened to be in Delhi. We were planning to reschedule the shoot as per his convenience and he said, ‘No. The one thing I have learnt from my father is the show must go on’.
“He knew it would have been very difficult for the unit to shift any scene or sequence because he is there in every scene. He didn’t want us to put in an uncomfortable situation and he rather put himself into an uncomfortable situation.”
After roping in Kapoor, Trehan said, they approached Juhi Chawla, who too was eager about working on the film.
Chawla is among the few actors with whom Kapoor extensively worked in the 1990s. The two starred in movies such as “Bol Radha Bol”, “Eena Meena Deeka”, “Daraar” and “Luck By Chance”.
“To see them on screen together was so nostalgic for all of us,” the producer said.
Trehan added that the team shot for the film till mid-February and when lockdown was announced on March 24 they had to put their plans on hold.
“The film went on floors in December in Mumbai then we moved to Delhi and the last schedule was planned in Mumbai. But then COVID-19 warnings came and we were planning how to go ahead. We decided to wait and shoot once the lockdown lifted.”
The filmmaker said a few days of shooting was left on the film with Kapoor.
“Sadly this is his last project and we are sure we will finish it somehow soon. We will bring it out to his fans. Once things settle down, we will sit with our team and decide what to do,” he added.
Trehan said though the makers were yet to zero in on a release date, the film will hit the theatres this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor obituary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor, who has died aged 67 of bone marrow cancer, starred as a leading man in almost 100 Bollywood films and was a member of the remarkable Kapoor family of actors and film-makers.
The son of the great director, producer and actor Raj Kapoor, Rishi started as a child actor, aged three, in his father’s hugely popular film Shree 420 (1955). But his proper debut came in Raj’s 1970 film Mera Naam Joker, playing the younger version of his father’s leading role. Rishi said that his father only gave him the part as he was unable to pay for a recognised star, and the film was not a commercial success in any case. The movie that gave Rishi stardom was his next, Bobby (1973), the story of a love affair between Raja, a rich Bombay teenager, and a poor girl, Bobby, from the wrong side of the tracks, played by Dimple Kapadia. In the story, also directed by Raj, he was Hindu and she was Catholic, which was in itself a bold move.
Despite this the film was a sensation, becoming hugely successful at the Indian box office and earning vast sums of money in the Soviet Union. It was said that more than 60 million people saw Bobby in the USSR and the film is regarded as one of the all-time Bollywood greats, regularly shown in cinemas and on television.Rishi, who won the Hindi film industry’s Filmfare award for best actor for the role, was always a modest man and complained that the award was all very well but that it had cost him a considerable bribe to get it. Latterly he explained that he was never quite sure whether the money (30,000 rupees) was paid to the right person or whether it was a giant con. Nonetheless, he was now a major star and through the 1970s and 80s he appeared in dozens of films, including Kabhi Kabhie (1976), a romantic drama noted for its award-wining soundtrack, Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), a comedy that makes a case for religious tolerance, and the reincarnation thriller Karz (1980), with its chart-topping, disco-inspired soundtrack. These were often shot simultaneously, which meant that, arriving on the set, Rishi had to enquire exactly who he was playing and what were the lines and songs he had to accomplish.
At the turn of the century he played character roles to acclaim in another series of successful films. He was honoured with the Filmfare lifetime achievement award in 2008, and went on to win the Filmfare critics’ award as best actor for Do Dooni Chaar (2010) and best supporting actor for Kapoor & Sons (2016). His last film appearance was in The Body (2019).
Born in Bombay (now Mumbai), to Raj and Krishna (nee Malhotra), Rishi, who attended Campion school in the city, and Mayo College, in Ajmer, Rajasthan, was destined for the movies. His grandfather Prithviraj Kapoor was a pioneer of Indian theatre and early cinema, and the father of the Bollywood greats Shammi and Shashi Kapoor, as well as Raj. Rishi’s uncles on his mother’s side, including Prem Nath and Prem Chopra, were actors, as are his brothers, Randhir and Rajiv. In 1974, while shooting the film Zehreela Insaan, he began dating his co-star, Neetu Singh, and they married in 1980.
If Rishi had the advantage of being from a glamorous family that commanded immense respect in the entertainment world over three generations, he made his way without expecting any favours. In recent years he was often in considerable pain from his illness, but retained his good humour. He was also never afraid to be controversial, often saying that religion and eating were separate from each other, which was why he was “a beef-eating Hindu”. This caused considerable outrage in some quarters. But he was a charming man and, though not a great actor, possessed charisma that almost always carried him through.
In a way, Rishi was representative of the old Bollywood that has now virtually disappeared in favour of an industry that espouses new techniques and more relevant themes. Yet nobody could claim him as an old-fashioned star. His progression from male leads to character studies was remarkable for a range that not only kept him his fans but constantly broadened his appeal. And it has to be said that few Bollywood stars were regarded with more affection.
He is survived by Neetu, their son, Ranbir, who is also an actor, and daughter, Riddhima, a granddaughter, and Randhir and Rajiv.
• Rishi Raj Kapoor, actor, born 4 September 1952; died 30 April 2020

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby 'quits Celebrity Juice' after 12 years on the popular TV show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has dropped a television bombshell – she’s quit Celebrity Juice.
The 39-year-old This Morning presenter has been a team captain on Keith Lemon’s raunchy late night quiz show for 12 years – but has called time on her involvement on the show in order to spend more time with her family.
Holly has three young children with her 45-year-old producer husband Dan Baldwin, while a string of lockdown special episodes of the madcap quiz show are due to be the last to feature the blonde beauty.
Taking part on the raunchy show has allowed Holly – who is mum to 10-year-old son Harry, eight-year-old daughter Belle, and five-year-old Chester – to show off a wilder side compared to her mild mannered daytime talkshow hostess role.
But now Holly is hanging up her captain’s hat – two years after fellow original captain Fearne Cotton quit the show in 2018.
A show source told The Sun on Sunday: “Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show — it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.”
They added: “She’s still the best of pals with Leigh Francis and will continue to support the series.”
Keith paid tribute to Holly with an f-bomb video clip that he shared on Instagram just hours before news of her quitting his show broke.
A short clip showed Keith – who is the alter ego of 47-year-old comedian Leigh Francis – reacting in shock as Holly screamed “F***!” at the camera.
He captioned the moment: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.
“A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at. Don’t look into her eyes though, cos she can make you do anything. What a lady!”
He added: "The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of... well me I guess."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby QUITS Celebrity Juice 12 years after ITV panel show helped make her a household name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has quit ITV’s Celebrity Juice – the show that helped make her a household name – after 12 years.
The presenter will end her reign as a team captain on the award-winning panel show at the end of the current series.
Insiders say the decision comes as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers.
Although 39-year-old Miss Willoughby had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.
She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term ‘Holly Willoughbooby’ was coined to described her curvaceous figure.
Her resignation comes shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice’s creators – stopped producing the ITV2 show. 
The mother of three’s departure now throws the future of the series into doubt after its host Keith Lemon, the comic alter-ego of Leigh Francis, said it would be over if she quit. 
A friend of Miss Willoughby told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She absolutely loves being on the show, she has loved it but she felt it was time now. 
'She wants to spend more time with her family, filming Celebrity Juice takes up an evening that she could be spending with her family.
‘She is, after all, one of the busiest women in showbiz.’
Yesterday, Francis paid tribute to Miss Willoughby on Instagram under his guise as Keith Lemon, saying: ‘Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.’ A spokesman for Miss Willoughby last night declined to comment.
It is believed the star will make an announcement on Sunday May 3.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Couple marry in their garden with dogs as bridesmaids after wedding cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Autumn Wood and Christian Miller’s wedding was cancelled because of coronavirus, they decided to get married anyway.
They held a ceremony in their back garden and as they couldn’t have any guests, their dogs acted as bridesmaids.
The rest of their friend and family watched on Facebook Live as they wore face masks and drank Corona beer in a nod to the current situation.
After months of planning the perfect day, the engaged pair were devastated when lockdown caused their wedding on on May 23 to be cancelled.
Instead, Autumn and Christian, both 28, were married by his brother, who is isolating with them, at their home in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Autumn’s mum Cindi and Christian’s parents Tom and Barb were also present from a social distance as the couple got married on April 20 – the anniversary of the day they met.
Newlywed Autumn, an IT supervisor, said: ‘I had already gathered a lot of decorations and with our anniversary coming up, we just didn’t want to wait to be married any longer.
‘Christian, his parents and I spent the day transforming the backyard with things we had planned to use in May and we sent out a notice on Facebook for our families to join the livestream so they could watch our ceremony.
‘Our dogs Sasha and Oreo were my stand in bridesmaids and although they were very good and didn’t bark at all, they totally stole the show!
‘My new brother in law Ben married us and then cooked us all an incredible steak dinner followed by a delicious carrot cheesecake made by my mother in law Barb.’
After the ceremony, they sat by the fire and listened to their wedding playlist for the rest of the night.
Autumn added: ‘It was perfect – it wasn’t what I planned and it didn’t go the way I had been planning for months but I wouldn’t trade it.
‘I felt beautiful, it was all about me and the love of my life and I think looking back it’s going to be a wonderful story and moment for us.
‘I think our friends and family needed a break from the chaos and for a moment, we gave them that peace. I’ll cherish that forever.’
The couple have also rescheduled their honeymoon to Disneyland, planned for August.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Couple who were due to get married yesterday reveal their friends surprised them with an impromptu celebration on the street outside their flat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bride-to-be has revealed her joy after her friends visited her home to congratulate her and her fiancé on what would have been their wedding day. 
James Dunn and Rachel Harrison, both 32, from London, have been together for 14-years and were due to get married yesterday at Higher Eggbeer Farm in Devon. 
They were forced to put their plans on hold after lock-down was announced - but that didn't stop friends Emmert Roberts, Constant Allarcon and Flabbie De Langautier from stopping by and congratulating them. 
Rachel, a wedding planner, told FEMAIL how their 'spirits were lifted' after seeing their pals, and said they also received video messages from their friends and family around the world. 
The couple's original wedding was set to have 150 people, and Rachel had been planning the day for around 18-months.
She explained that the couple had planned for a full wedding weekend for guests, saying: 'We booked a place in Devon to have for the whole weekend.
'Family staying in the house, people able to camp and today would have been the party, a bit of a BBQ.'
The couple were set to tie the knot at 2pm and Rachel explained that she was left in tears after her head bridesmaid arranged for her friends and family to send video messages that afternoon.
She explained: 'One of my best friends and my chief bridesmaids live in New Zealand, she was meant to be coming to the wedding and arranged for all of our friends and families to send us videos.' 
'So when two o'clock came round, we had this bombardment of videos of people toasting, which was really sweet and I was already in tears. So it was quite emotional.' 
She said: 'We've been really lucky, lots of our friends have sent deliveries and messages.'
However Rachel said the couple were particularly amazed when they received a text from some friends to say they were outside their window. 
Emmert, Constant and Flabbie decided to surprise their friends, donning party hats and elaborate masks to get into the party spirit.
The brightly coloured face masks were decorated with shoes, London buses and cupcakes to make sure they weren't spreading the virus. 
The group, who are isolating together, all wore jeans and trainers, but decided to add some flare to their outfits with a bow ties - with Flabbie even donning a borrowed top hat for the occasion. 
Rachel revealed: 'We felt very loved and our spirits were lifted of seeing human faces that weren't through a screen.'   
Rachel, who founded wedding planning business The Capston Second in 2015, hung out the window to chat with her pals while James stood in the doorway drinking a small bottle of champagne.  
The wedding planner went on to explain that while they were sad their big day was cancelled, having been together for so long the couple were happy to wait a little longer to tie the knot.
She said: 'I'm a wedding planner but I didn't manage to plan for a pandemic, we've been together for 14-years so we can wait another one.'
But she added: 'The mains stress was re-organising everything and it was upsetting then and now we've sorted everything that's a weight off. 
'We've just all been living in a parallel universe so the thought of having our wedding wasn't really anything. Everything changed so quickly. '

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘John Wick 4’ Moves Away From ‘Matrix 4,’ Avoiding The Great Keanu Reeves Box Office Showdown Of Summer 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alas, Keanu Reeves' John Wick: Chapter 4 and Keanu Reeves' The Matrix 4 are no longer scheduled to open on the same day.
Lionsgate dropped a ridiculous number of new release dates yesterday. Since they did this while I was on extended “dad duty,” consider this a “yesterday’s news today” post. Yes, Antebellum is now slated for August 21, 2020, just a week after Wonder Woman 1984. And yes, as feared, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard has been moved from August 28, 2020 to August 21, 2020. Meanwhile, Lionsgate lacked the courage to move Spiral: From the Book of Saw to October 30, 2020 and will instead schedule it for May 21, 2021 instead. To be fair, they placed Deon Taylor’s new thriller Fatale (starring Michael Ealy and Hillary Swank) into that Halloween weekend, so that’s a relative win. Alas, since Spiral is now slated for next May, John Wick: Chapter 4 has been moved to May 27, 2022.
The bad news is we now have to wait an additional year for the next John Wick installment. The good news is that, presuming it too is not delayed from the May 21, 2021 slot, Warner Bros.’ The Matrix 4 is no longer playing chicken with Lionsgate’s John Wick 4. Yes, Warner Bros. dropped the Lana Wachowki-directed sequel into the same pre-Memorial Day weekend frame already occupied by John Wick 4. It made sense for both franchises. The Matrix Reloaded broke records in 2003 with a $91 million Fri-Sun/$134 million Thurs-Sun debut in that prime release date. John Wick: Chapter 3 opened with $56 million last May in the same frame before legging out to $171 million domestic. Needless to say, we weren’t actually going to get two prime Keanu Reeves “part fours” opening on the same day.
The notion of The Matrix 4 and John Wick 4 opening on the same day was about as likely as Batman v Superman opening concurrently with Captain America: Civil War in May of 2016. And since The Matrix 4 was in the middle of production when the coronavirus pandemic caused and industry-wide production shutdown, while John Wick 4 was (at best) in early development, the sci-fi franchise was always going to open before the action franchise. Of course, it’s always possible that Warner Bros. will have to delay The Matrix 4 and move that big-budget sequel to May 27, 2022 as well. Or, maybe Matrix 4 will stick to its summer 2021 slot while Orion moves Bill and Ted Face the Music to May 21, 2021. Okay, now I’m just being annoying just to entertain myself.
I will note that Lionsgate’s big release date shuffle sadly leaves Aneesh Chaganty’s Run undated, which is bad news for folks eagerly awaiting the next movie from the guy who directed the dynamite Searching, but c’est la vie. Heck, at this rate of delay and rescheduling (bye bye The Batman and Spider-Man 3), The Matrix 4 may end up being one of the very biggest movies of the summer by default, alongside Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Illumination’s Minions 2 and (if it stays the course) Universal’s Jurassic World: Dominion. But the great Keanu Reeves vs. Keanu Reeves showdown is not to be, to the extent that it ever was. We’re going to have to wait until 2022 until the next John Wick movie. Let’s hope we still get a Matrix movie next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'John Wick 4' Pushed to Summer 2022, Chris Rock's 'Saw' Movie 'Spiral' Moves to 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“John Wick: Chapter 4” starring Keanu Reeves has been pushed back from its 2021 release date a full year to May 27, 2022 as part of a shuffle of Lionsgate’s release calendar, the latest studio to do so in the wake of the coronavirus.
Lionsgate also pushed back Chris Rock’s new take on the “Saw” franchise called “Spiral,” moving it a full year to May 21, 2021 after it was meant to open this May.
The Deon Taylor thriller “Fatale” is also moving to October 30, 2020. Neil Burger’s sci-fi “Voyagers” starring Tye Sheridan and Colin Farrell, Lily-Rose Depp and Fionn Whitehead will now open November 25, 2020. “The Asset,” an assassin film with Michael Keaton and Maggie Q, will now open on April 23, 2021. “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar” with Kristen Wiig will open July 16, 2021. The Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson sequel “The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard” will open August 20, 2021. And “American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story,” will now open December 10, 2021.
Staying put on their release dates are the Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley film “Chaos Walking,” which opens Jan. 22, 2021, “The Devil’s Light” on Jan. 8, 2021 and “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,” a meta-comedy starring Nicolas Cage, which opens on Mar. 19, 2021.
The horror film “Run” remains without a release date after previously being pulled from the calendar, and Jon Gunn’s “Jesus Revolution” is now without a release date as well.
“As audiences from around the world head back to theaters, most will return feeling that specialness that only the traditional theatrical experience can offer. Lionsgate is thrilled to present such a wide variety of films with many more to come. From great branded IP to unique stories from new voices, the terrifying reimagined and some truly hysterical comedy, we join with our partners in exhibition in welcoming movie lovers back to their favorite theaters with something special for everyone,” Damon Wolf, chief marketing officer and head of global distribution at Lionsgate said in a statement.
Earlier on Friday, Lionsgate announced that the horror film “Antebellum” starring Janelle Monáe would be its first summer release of 2020 and will open on Aug. 21. The studio also acquired what will be the next film from the duo behind “Antebellum,” Bush+Renz, an apocalyptic movie called “Rapture.”
The fourth “John Wick” film, the action franchise with Reeves playing a retired, master assassin on the run from countless other killers, was actually meant to open on the same day as “The Matrix 4” in 2021.
Just about every studio has been forced to push back tentpole summer releases and juggle their calendars for years ahead as they write off the summer of 2020, with no major studio movies coming out until late July.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Best Ways To Get A Nintendo Switch Right Now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We’re now two-ish months into quarantine, depending on where you are, and the Nintendo Switch hasn’t gotten any easier to find. The hybrid portable/living room console became a smash hit early on as people both sought new activities to while away quarantined hours for both themselves and their children and to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo’s surprising smash hit life simulator. While the company is reported to be increasing production and has said that more stock is on the way, the console remains difficult to find.
Here’s the truth: the Nintendo Switch is unlikely to be easy to find at MSRP for a long time now. That’s both because of the aforementioned demand and because price-gougers have taken over the marketplace using bots to snag any online availability and then shipping them over to Amazon and eBay at an inflated price point that seems to hover around $500. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that phyiscal retail is closed nearly everywhere right now, so you can’t expect to get around the bots by showing up in-person.
If you live in a state where restrictions are starting to ease, there’s a chance that a retailer selling Switches might open up. Some, like Target and Walmart, have been open throughout the crisis as essential businesses, but even then stock has been near-impossible to find. As things ease up, physical retail will be an easier place to find new consoles than online, but remember to be safe, to wear a mask, and to practice social distancing.
If you absolutely want a new console right now, you likely have no choice than to get one from a reseller at a significant markup.
You should be reminded, however, that the base model Switch is not the only machine in this console family. Nintendo released the Switch Lite last fall, and it’s a capable little handheld. You can’t play it on the TV, and the side controllers don’t come off for multiplayer action. It’s less than ideal if you want to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the family, but it’s great if you’re trying to get your kid something to do.
Switch Lite comes in and out of stock from time to time, but it’s available right now at Amazon.
Even if you’re remiss to get the “budget” console, it’s worth considering either for a child or for yourself. It’s more portable for anyone with a public transit commute, for one thing, and it plays everything that the Switch plays. Other than that, you’ll need to wait or shell out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Guide: Upcoming PS4 Games for May and June 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What a turbulent time it is -- not only for the games industry, but for basically everything. With most people trapped indoors as we deal with the coronavirus outbreak, 2020 is turning out to be one heck of a year so far. Until things improve, we need to find ways to entertain ourselves, and video games are perfect for escaping from real world issues.
While we don't recommend you spend your entire quarantine playing PlayStation 4 games, we can at least go through some of the titles you might be looking to purchase in order to kill some time. The Last of Us: Part II is easily the biggest game in the next two months with its revised release date of 19th June, but there's plenty more to look forward to. Let's have a peek.
A remaster nobody expected, but it seems 2020 is a year full of surprises. PlatinumGames took to Kickstarter to crowdfund the return of this former Wii U exclusive action game, and it's been a tremendous success. The game is coming to PS4 for the first time, and is a very unusual beast that sees you controlling an army of heroes combining to take on huge enemies in colourful battles.
After delays, leaks, and other drama besides, we really cannot wait to finally play this Naughty Dog sequel. Telling the story of a vengeful Ellie out for blood, this is the follow-up to one of PlayStation's most beloved games ever. Set to have an even darker tone than the first outing, this will be quite the ride, and it's bound to be absolutely gorgeous to boot. Little has been shown of this PS4 exclusive, but it's now just around the corner. Hype!
Are you ready, kids? The beloved PS2 platformer is making a return on PS4 in this vibrant remake. Released at the height of the character's popularity, this 3D collect-athon struck a chord with fans in 2003 with its humour and surprisingly robust gameplay. It's unlikely to blow anything out of the water, but if you're looking to cool off with a lighthearted action adventure, this could be worth splashing out on.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TL;DR: Learn to create drawings that give the illusion of being 3D with the Complete Creative Art and Science of Drawing Bundle for $39.96, a 96% savings as of May 3.
While drawing is an excellent skill to pick up anytime, it's even more appropriate during these days. Why? Because it can help you enter a state of flow. Or, in other words, it can make the outside world (and all the chaos that comes with it) fall away, and heighten your imagination, mindfulness, focus, and introspection. That's something we all could use.
You don't even really need to be good at it. Although, naturally, we all want to at least understand the basics before diving into a new hobby. That's where this Complete Creative Art and Science of Drawing Bundle comes in.
Featuring 12 courses and over 56 hours of content, this bundle will help you unleash your inner artist. The content itself is designed for beginners and will walk you through fundamental drawing skills for both traditional and digital mediums. You'll start with the art and science of drawing, which kicks off with topics as simple as how to hold the pencil correctly and how to draw shapes. It will then lead you through more complex concepts like cross-hatching, shading, atmospheric perspective, and linework. You'll also learn the step-by-step process of drawing specific things like figures, heads, animals, and even superheroes. And lastly, you'll take a brief look at how to translate your drawings to the digital world via Adobe Illustrator.
The instructors — including Brent Eviston, Robert Marzullo, and Ethan Nguyen — are all professional artists and designers with a 4.5-star rating or higher. Over 34,000 students have already enrolled in the basic skills course alone, with many leaving positive reviews after completing the coursework. 
Whether or not you become the next Picasso, this 12-course bundle will at least help you unleash some creativity during these weird times. And that's something we all could really use. Plus, since it's 90% off retail value at just $39.96, what do you have to lose?

    <h5 class="mb-1">The ‘Borderlands 3’ Mayhem 10 Guns To Farm For When Yellowcake Gets Nerfed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Right now Borderlands 3 has a lot of issues with Mayhem 10 in which there are very, very few viable builds or weapons to use there because of crazy enemy health scaling (a 12,500% increase).
There is a single exception to that in a big way, the new Cartel event Yellowcake launcher, specifically when it rolls with an anointment that gives it 300% damage to enemies over 90% health. And considering you’re using it to one-shot most enemies, that’s almost all the time.
Yellowcake is simply in a league of its own in Mayhem 10. It works best on Moze, but you can use it with anyone, and as such, I do believe that it is probably heading for a nerf. So before you spend too much time farming for it, I wanted to make you aware of other weapons that are powerful in Mayhem 10 that you also may want to farm in case Yellowcake ends up neutered pretty soon, which I imagine it will be.
There are five that I am pursuing right now in particular, most of them new. They all can hang in Mayhem 10 with the right anointments, so I’ll start with those:
The Anointments: These are the ones you’re going to be looking for as the “best” drops for all five of these. Some of them work better on different characters.
For Moze: 1% damage per consecutive hit, the 200% damage while an action skill is active if you have an Auto Bear build. Moze needs better gun anointments, frankly.
For Amara: 250% damage after Phasecast, 300% damage after Phaseslam
For Zane: 200% damage while an action skill is active, 100% cryo damage when SNTL is active
For FL4K: 200% damage when an action skill is active for a Gamma Burst build, 115% damage during Gamma Burst, 100% damage to enemies damaged by Rakks.
The 300% damage to enemies over 90% health one is good for all four, but that may get nerfed soon, as right now it only applies to red health bars, not armor or shields, so you’re doing 300% damage to those the entire time. Like Yellowcake, we may see this hamstrung soon.
The Guns
OPQ – This is an AR that drops from Cartel minibosses Josie Byte and Franco Firewall or Joey Ultraviolent himself. For some reason, this simply does way, way more damage than any other assault rifle in its class, and if anything on this list may end up nerfed alongside Yellowcake, it may be this. But I would farm one all the same just in case, particularly since these Cartel weapons may be time-limited just for this month.
Sand Hawk – This is the return of a Borderlands 2 sniper rifle that is a huge boss killer, especially in the hands of Moze or FL4K. The only problem is ammo, I’ve found. It drops from Katagawa in Atlas HQ, and only him.
Hellshock – This pistol is the only old gun on this list, but after recent buffs, just does absolutely insane damage, especially to shields with the 300% anoint on it. It outclasses every other pistol I’ve seen by a wide margin and is a must for any elemental build or any shield-based boss fight. Gigamind drops it, though you can also farm the Loot the Universe event in whatever the pistol location is when you’re reading this (right now it’s Athenas).
Monarch – I have always loved the bipod-based ARs in Borderlands 3, but this Mayhem 6+ gun is just incredible, especially on Moze or FL4K, though I am using a 200% damage one on Zane as my main boss farm. It drops from Killavolt, very, very rarely, and only him.
Kaoson – This is a DAHL SMG that fires Torgue-like stickies that explode on reload. As a fun bonus for this, the new grenade anointment that does 150% increased grenade damage when an action skill is active works for those sticky bombs. I’ve mostly been using Kaoson on Moze for a Splash damage build, or an electric one on Amara with a 250% phasecast anointment. It drops from Captain Traunt in Athenas only.
Those are my picks, though there are probably more to consider. Let me know what’s working for you in Mayhem 10.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How U.K. And Royals Will Virtually Celebrate Landmark VE-Day, May 8</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The message the world had been waiting for was brilliantly to the point. Shortly after German officials signed the first documents of surrender in Reims, France (additional papers were formalized in Berlin the next day), ending the fighting in Europe, General Dwight Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Command, notified his chiefs of staff: “The mission of this Allied Force was fulfilled at 0241, local time, May 7th, 1945.”
While the Second World War would not come to a final close until Japan’s surrender in August, the end of hostilities on the continent was marked by an outbreak of celebrations in many countries and no where more enthusiastically than in London, where thousands flocked to the streets and to well-known monuments like Buckingham Palace, Parliament and Piccadilly Circus. [To get a better understanding of Britain’s precarious first months during the war, read Erik Larson’s riveting The Splendid and the Vile, which recently topped The New York Times’ non-fiction best seller list.] “In all our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this,” Winston Churchill said when he appeared before exuberant throngs at the Ministry of Health in Whitehall.
The U.K. had hoped for a full-out celebration this year to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day; because of the pandemic all events will be virtual with individual observances taking place at home. But there are plenty of online and televised happenings to commemorate the date and honor veterans and the sacrifices made during the war. The U.K’s Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement: “In these difficult times, acts of remembrance are even more poignant and I am sure that millions will want to join me to remember and give thanks to those who gave so much to secure peace, freedom and prosperity in Europe.”
Here are some of the major events planned. For additional information go to VE-VJDay75.gov.uk. 
At 11 AM, a Two Minute Silence will be observed in the U.K. At 11:15 there will be a VE Day 75 Livestreamhosted by the Royal British Legion. For details, click here.
Queen Elizabeth’s address to the country will be aired at 9 PM, May 8, on BBC One, the time her father, King George VI, spoke to a jubilant Britain 75 years earlier. Prince Charles will commemorate VE Day 75 by reading from his grandfather’s diary entry for the day, which included the historic appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with Winston Churchill. Video chats will take place between members of the royal family and veterans.
Winston Churchill’s victory speech will be broadcast by the BBC during the program, VE Day 75: The Announcement Of Victory, starting at 2:45 PM. In the evening another special, VE Day 75: The People’s Celebration, begins at 8PM. After the Queen’s message at 9 PM, the show will end with a nationwide singing of the WWII classic, “We’ll Meet Again,” made famous by Dame Vera Lynn. For a schedule of additional VE Day television and radio programs planned by the BBC, click here.
ITV will have a program devoted to the U.K’s remarkable Captain (now honorary Colonel) Tom Moore, a British Army and WWII veteran who has recently gained international acclaim for raising more than £30 million for the country’s National Health Service charities by walking 100 laps in his garden. (Moore turned 100 on April 30.)
The Royal Air Force Museum, National Army Museum and the National Museum of the Royal Navy are presenting a Virtual VE Day 75 Festival, from May 7-9, that will include a webinar with top historian James Holland and curators from the museums, along with presentations highlighting experiences both at home and on the front lines during the Second World War
And you can time travel with vintage recipes and music. If you’re frustrated because of the shortages of certain foods during the Covid-19 pandemic, consider that rationing in the U.K.began in 1940 (to see a ration list, go to Historic UK) and continued until 1954. For at-home VE Day celebrations, there are items popular during the Second World War, when cooks had to do a lot with little, that you can make. English Heritage has a party pack that includes recipes for carrot scones and ginger beer. The VE-VJDay75.gov.org site has various assets you can download for a party, like bunting templates and posters, along with recipes for dishes like Homity Pie and an eggless fruit cake. There’s also a Spotify playlist with music from the era with such names as Frank Sinatra, Glenn Miller and Vera Lynn.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: What clues do New York, Madrid offer Indian cities about how the disease could play out?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In late January, the United Kingdom was busy with Brexit, the United States was busy following (or ignoring) the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and many in India were busy protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act. In late February, while we were trying to comprehend the horrors of the Delhi riots, US diplomats and Taliban leaders were working towards a treaty to end the war in Afghanistan, and the top civil servant in the British Home Ministry was resigning to protest against what he described as the Home Secretary’s bullying.
Then in March, Covid-19 engulfed our world and upended it.
On March 23, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US were in lockdown, and many Indians, having obeyed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to observe a “janata curfew”, or people’s curfew, were clanging pots and pans to scare away the novel coronavirus.
The pandemic raging over the last couple of months has brought mankind to its knees, causing loss of lives and of livelihoods, as also deep social and psychological stresses. How will this end? How are we going to survive it?
Sitting in the middle of Covid-19, these questions are almost unanswerable. But at this time, different parts of the world seem to be located in different phases of the pandemic cycle. The horrific disease surge that befell Italy and Spain in March and in early April has subsided. But in South Asia and in Africa, the worst might be yet to come. What clues do the experiences of some of the West’s most affected cities provide regarding our own chances of survival?
New York and Madrid have suffered greatly in the pandemic, with confirmed cases totaling 130,000 in the US city and 55,000 in the Spanish one. In India, Mumbai and Delhi have been the most affected cities till date, with about 7,600 and 3,700 cases until Saturday.
How does one compare the Covid surges across these very different cities, given that testing rates across countries have varied so much – from less than 2 tests per 10,000 people in India to more than 30 tests per 10,000 people in the US?
One way is to focus on the “daily growth rates of new infections” rather than the “daily infection numbers”, assuming that the relative testing rates across countries have remained reasonably stable over time.
Using publicly available data from city governments and from covid19india.org, I carry out that exercise to contrast the experiences of these four cities over the months of March and April, taking the date on which a city’s cumulated disease-load crossed 30 to be its start date. The following charts show the graphs of daily disease growth rates in New York and Delhi and in Madrid and Mumbai.
The graphs for New York and Madrid tell the following story. The cities have been subjected to a sequence of disease-growth surges, rather than a single big surge. The initial surges have been intense, but there has been a final surge after which daily disease growth rates have slowly subsided.
I identify the date of the last big surge – when the daily disease growth rate crossed 30% for the final time – to be a city’s “turn-around date”.
In New York and Madrid, the intensity of the Covid-19 attack reached its peak quite quickly, and then subsided slowly over a longer period of time – the turn-around happened in 12 days time. But after that, it has taken about a month for the daily disease growth rate to fall to 1%.
The nature of the Covid-19 surges have been remarkably similar for New York and Madrid (and also for Paris, Milan, and London, for which I have constructed similar graphs). This, in spite of the underlying heterogeneity of the cities – especially with respect to population density (New York has much greater density than the other cities), and the distinct lockdown strategies that the different cities have pursued. It is indeed heartening to note that in these places, the disease growth surges have decisively lost their sting and their volatility over time.
Sitting in India, can we draw hope from the experiences of these First World cities? In contrast, how have our own worst-affected cities fared?
The Covid-19 surges have occurred later in the Indian cities, after the country was locked down. Nevertheless, the graph for Delhi is not very dissimilar to that of New York: Delhi has also suffered several disease growth surges, with steeper surges early on.
There are, however, two noteworthy differences. The turn-around date has arrived later in Delhi (19 days after the start date), and beyond that date, the growth-surges have not subsided steadily – there have been recent upticks in disease growth rates.
The experience of Mumbai reinforces these concerns. Not only has there been quite a few surges after the (assumed) turn-around date, but following six days of steady decline thereafter, the city is suffering a recent continuing and significant increase in daily disease growth.
Will Mumbai face another Covid-19 surge in the near future? Some think yes.
It is possible that India’s lockdown has blunted the sharpest of the Covid-19 attacks that we have faced – the highest daily disease growth-rate has not gone beyond 95% in any India city (as it has in New York and Madrid). However, while one can reasonably predict that New York and Madrid (as well as Paris, Milan, and London) are out of the woods by now, the same cannot be said for our cities.
Of course, a part of the reason is that the disease surges started much later in India, especially in cities like Ahmedabad and Indore where the current disease growth rate is significant. But the worry is that in dampening the intensity of the disease growth surges, India might have also prolonged the possibility of their recurrence.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s staggering to think that 10 years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was yet to assemble any Avengers.
Now, 24 films later – and with the “epic conclusion” reached in Endgame, which is celebrating its first anniversary – the film series has introduced 27 world-saving characters.
After the introduction of the originals – including Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow – it seemed unlikely that characters introduced in future films would rank alongside them.
It turns out that assumption was wildly incorrect – thanks to Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther and the MCU’s first female-led film Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson, those originals have been given a run for their money.
Below, we rank every single Avenger (NB: we’ve omitted SHIELD agents Nick Fury, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Six Years After ‘Amazing Spider-Man 2’ Stumbled, Sony’s New Marvel Universe Gets A Terrible New Name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six years ago, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed and put a temporary end to Sony's hopes of an MCU-like Spidey franchise.
We got word yesterday that Sony has settled on a new name for their official universe/franchise/brand of Spider-Man and Spider-Man-related Marvel flicks. Following Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far from Home, both of which are technically part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Venom, Sony is on the brink of the very thing they sought six years ago on this day. They may just get their own Marvel cinematic universe, one which may or may not be loosely included in Disney DIS ’s current MCU. That’s the good news. The bad news is that the name is, frankly, kinda terrible. Instead of referring to this collection of movies as “the Spider-Verse” or maybe not giving it a name at all, the collection of Sony Spidey pictures will be called, uh, the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.
But first, a history lesson...
Today, May 2, is the sixth anniversary of the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The second of two Andrew Garfield/Marc Webb Peter Parker passion plays opened amid mixed reviews to a $93 million domestic launch, following a slow overseas roll-out beginning as early as April 17. The film’s reception is a complicated one. It crashed and burned in North America, earning just $202 million domestic compared to the $262 million cume of Amazing Spider-Man and the $336-$403 million cumes (sans inflation) of the previous Sam Raimi-directed trilogy. It performed slightly better than the previous Amazing Spider-Man movie overseas, earning $506 million compared to its 2012 predecessor’s $496 million cume. The $709 million global finish was considered a disappointment, both due to a $255 million budget and (more importantly) in terms of plans for a Sony-specific universe of Spider-Man movies and spin-offs.
While the movie itself was mostly stand-alone, save for a needless subplot involving Peter’s dead parents and a mid-credits tease for a potential Sinister Six movie down the road, the marketing and in-studio expectations set the film up as a backdoor pilot for a whole new world of Spider-Man heroes and Spider-Man villains. Moreover, the film pandered to the hardcore fan base by killing off its female lead (Emma Stone’s Gwen Stacey) which also removed both the new franchise’s most popular character and the new series’ most unique element (the romantic chemistry between Garfield and Stone). Alas, when the film was met with mediocre reviews and shockingly poor domestic legs, it meant that A) audiences were not jazzed for The Amazing Spider-Man 3 and B) audiences were certainly not jazzed for various spin-off movies (Venom, a young Aunt May spy flick, etc.).
Six years later, Sony seems to have discovered the gold at the end of the rainbow which they were pursuing with Marc Webb’s doomed Spider-Man reboot. Spider-Man: Homecoming, featuring Tom Holland as a young Peter Parker palling around with Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and the rest of the MCU,earned solid reviews and $334 million domestic/$881 million worldwide on a $175 million budget, which is frankly what the Amazing Spider-Man movies should have cost. That’s one reason why Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a “flop” at $709 million but the $170 million-budgeted Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a “blockbuster” at $714 million in the same year. Spider-Man: Far From Home was sold as an epilogue to Avengers: Endgame and earned $390 million/$1.128 billion on a $165 million budget, passing Skyfall ($1.108 billion) as Sony’s biggest global grosser.
More importantly, Tom Hardy’s Venom overcame years of dismissal to score an $80 million domestic debut on its way to $214 million domestic, $279 million in China and $854 million worldwide on a mere $90 million budget. Jared Leto’s Morbius was supposed to open this July but will now debut in March of next year. Oh, and Sony’s animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse brought Miles Morales into the fold, earned rave reviews, earned $190 million domestic/$375 million worldwide (great for a superhero toon) and won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature over Pixar’s $1.2 billion-grossing Incredibles 2. A sequel has now been slated for October 23, 2022. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (starring Woody Harrelson as Carnage) will now open on June 25, 2021.
So the good news is that Sony may just get the “Spider-Man cinematic universe” they’ve been chasing for years. The bad news is that they’ve settled on an inexplicably terrible title for their franchise/brand. To be fair, a dumb name for a cinematic universe isn’t going to be a deal breaker if the movies work on a case-by-case basis. Shock of shocks, Reuben Fleischer’s Venom turned out to be an entirely stand-alone superhero origin story with only a standard mid-credit sequel tease, so it seems that Sony is learning the Iron Man lesson (happy 12th birthday to the first Iron Man, which opened May 2, 2008) of making stand-alone movies that work on their own terms. Nonetheless, why the hell they didn’t just call this the “Spider-Verse” is beyond me. That’s what we’ve all been calling it for the last year or two anyway.
It rolls off the tongue and it reminds folks of one of the best superhero movies ever made. The “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” feels like a name created by an algorithm meant to clog headlines and never be spoken by anyone outside of the industry or the media. I don’t think folks are going to be using “SPUMC” either. As Iron Man taught us 12 years ago, a ridiculous word salad (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) only works when it can be shortened to something snappy (S.H.I.E.L.D.). Yes, Into the Spider-Verse was a singular franchise and the Sony Marvel flicks won’t just be about Spider-Man, but heck, calling it “Sony Pictures’ Marvel Characters Universe” would at least get folks to (unofficially) call it “Sony’s MCU.” Which, especially if Michael Keaton’s Vulture is showing up in Morbius, is probably an accurate assessment.
This can only be an issue because Sony was successful in launching four well-received, commercially-successful and (save for Venom) well-reviewed Spider-Man or Spider-Man-ish comic book superhero flicks. The deal Disney and Sony reached in early 2015 allowed for a new Spider-Man series within the MCU, while also turning Andrew Garfield into the George Lazenby of the series. Yes, Holland is Roger Moore compared to Toby Maguire’s Sean Connery, and that’s not an insult to any of them. Even Venom shows that spin-offs can work. A really silly franchise name is A) mere trivia if the movies score and B) indicative of the kind of executive overthinking that turned Amazing Spider-Man from a cheap “Twilight with webs” into a $235 million “Spidey does Batman Begins” remake of Spider-Man and forced Amazing Spider-Man 2 to be a backdoor pilot for Sinister Six. Let’s hope I’m just overthinking it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Last of Us Part 2 was not leaked by individuals associated with Sony or Naughty Dog</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, Sony and Naughty Dog suffered a major blow when The Last of Us Part 2 was leaked across social media. This leak was huge and contained plot points and footage from a development build of what will likely be one of Sony’s biggest gaming blockbusters.  The leak even had the ending plus evidence pointing to multiplayer code, as well as a look at the chapter selection screens. Of course, Sony was quick to act to remove the original sources of the leak but it remains that a lot of the information is now out in the public domain. At the time there were rumours that the leaker was someone who worked at Naughty Dog and had leaked The Last of Us Part 2 due to not being paid and having other issues with Naughty Dog.
That rumour, Sony has clarified, is false. In an update to Gamesindustry.biz Sony confirmed that the individuals that were the source of the leak were not employees of either Naughty Dog or Sony. That obviously begs the question that if these people were not part of the development team or Sony then how did they get access to all of this content in the first place? Did someone send it to them? Were they able to obtain copies through other means? There are no publicly available answers to that as Sony is not commenting due to the fact this is part of an ongoing investigation.
On the same day, Sony confirmed the new release date for The Last of Us Part 2 and that has been set for June 19th. On the same day Ghost of Tsushima’s new date was confirmed as July 17th. In a statement, Head of Worldwide Studios Herman Hulst said:
I want to personally congratulate and thank both the teams at Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch Productions on their achievements, as we know it’s not an easy feat to reach the finish line under these circumstances. Both teams have worked hard to deliver world-class experiences, and we can’t wait to see what you think of them when they release in just a few short months.
Just be careful when browsing the web as the leaks are out there. Earlier, it was revealed just how much space you will need for The Last of Us Part 2 on the PS4. Word of advice, it may be time to do a digital spring clean of the PS4.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Those ‘Last Of Us Part 2’ Leaks Were Not From An Angry Sony Or Naughty Dog Employee</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All week long, huge leaks about The Last of Us Part 2 have been circulated ahead of the game’s release in late June, though it appears a key part of that story has turned out to be false.
Almost as soon as the leaked footage and development materials began circulating, a rumbling started that this was a “disgruntled Naughty Dog employee” that had leaked the footage. This story evolved from rumors that it was about the long-reported issues of crunch at the studio, and eventually I heard it was about a pay dispute.
Now, the studio is saying outright that this portion of the story is not true.
While it’s not exactly clear how this portion of the rumor snowballed, it’s now been confirmed to Gameindustry.biz “that [Sony] has identified the primary individuals responsible for the leaks earlier this week, saying they were not affiliated with Sony Interactive Entertainment or Naughty Dog, as was rumored.”
They are not saying anything past that, but it does dismantle the core premise of the leak, though all the damage the leak did remains in place. I had major plot points spoiled for me within the first 24 hours, even without looking for them, as did countless others. Gamers tuning in to an event like the livestream reveal for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla were greeted with spam chat messages of Last of Us 2 spoilers, and they’ve been spreading widely across Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, reddit, everywhere.
This rumor may have begun because the footage seems to be tagged with all “dev build” stuff, and the hasty conclusion was that a dev had leaked it.
But the official rule-out of Sony or Naughty Dog raises some additional questions.
Could someone “not affiliated” with Sony or Naughty Dog be a third-party contractor who was upset for the previous reasons stated (crunch, pay, etc). Or if it wasn’t that, was this a hack? That kind of thing has happened before, though rarely on this scale, so that would be a significant issue if so.
For now, we just don’t know, and may never know unless Sony comments further on the issue when the investigation concludes. I do have to imagine that someone is going to end up sued for this when all is said and done, after all.
Update: Apparently this does also include contractors in “affiliated”
We’ll see what impact this leak has on Last of Us Part 2 sales, but my guess is…not much. Yes, I have heard people say the spoilers they heard made them not want to play the game, knowing certain plot points they didn’t appreciate, and yet I am sure most of that is talk. Even though I’m not enamored with what I heard or the fact that I heard it, I will be there on day one playing all the same.
More to come as this investigation continues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte Has a Surprise Royal Twin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today is Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday, which means she joins the ranks of those of us who have to celebrate in quarantine. But her parents seem to be doing their best to give her a great birthday. On Friday, they posted four new photos that Kate Middleton took of the little royal to mark her special day. Royal fans who saw the images noticed one thing in particular: Charlotte has a royal twin.
Per Hello! magazine, the princess bears a resemblance to Lady Sarah Chatto, the only daughter of Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth's sister. Charlotte has also been compared to her great-grandmother the Queen; People magazine compared their childhood photos on the occasion of Charlotte's birthday, and the resemblance is definitely clear.
It makes sense that others would think she looks like Elizabeth's niece Sarah. When you look at Elizabeth, Margaret, and Sarah, it's very obvious that they're all related. It looks like Charlotte is taking after the Windsor side! Here's another photo of her that her parents added today:
One of the photos Kate took shows Princess Charlotte delivering food to people who are self-isolating in the global pandemic. In the photo, you can see a reflection of Kate and William in the door on which Charlotte is knocking.
Besides doing good deeds for others in quarantine, Charlotte and her brothers appear to have been having a lot of fun at home with their parents.
"Children have got such stamina," Kate said in a BBC interview last month. "I don't know how, honestly. You get to the end of the day and you write a list of all the things you've done in that day. You've pitched a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake, you get to the end of the day. They've had a lovely time. It's amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure."
Let's hope Charlotte has a birthday full of tens, cooking, baking, and lots of birthday hugs from her family.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Royal fans are going wild over  the 'uncanny' family resemblance between Princess Charlotte and the Queen's niece Lady Sarah Chatto in childhood snaps.
To mark her birthday, Kensington Palace has released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped her parents deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week. 
And many have been left stunned by the likeness between Princess Charlotte, 5, and Princess Margaret's daughter Lady Sarah, 56, after royal expert Victoria Arbiter tweeted a side-by-side of the duo.
The post was quickly inundated with comments noting the similarities between the two royal ladies. 
One person said: 'I'm blue in the face from saying she is Lady Sarah's double since she was born.'
Meanwhile another commented: 'Amazing resemblance to her cousin.'
Another wrote: 'Oh wow! Look at that resemblance.'
Another added: 'I've always thought Charlotte favours Sarah.' 
After she shared the side-by-side comparison, Victoria commented: 'I've always thought she looked like Lady Sarah, but with them both aged 5 the resemblance is uncanny.' 
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate. 
The entire family helped out with a local initiative started by the monarch's staff, who have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and the vulnerable in the area during the lockdown.
After sharing four images of the little royal yesterday, the couple went on to thank fans for their well wishes and released a fifth picture today.
In the new snap, which was taken by Kate as part of the series, the little royal can be seen thoughtfully holding one of the parcels of pasta.
Around 1,000 meals were dispensed in the first week alone, and the scheme has been running for five weeks so far.
This time the Cambridges, all keen cooks, rustled up some home-made pasta which they separated into 12 large bags and tied up with raffia to add to the food parcels. Sources said all the children – even little Louis, two – were involved.
The following day, the family – Charlotte smartly dressed in a black and white checked dress with grey tights and black Mary Jane shoes – then helped to load bags of fresh produce into a van from the Sandringham Visitors' Centre ready for delivery.
Sources say William, Kate, Charlotte and George spent two and a half hours driving around the area delivering food to those in need.
The princess can even be seen in one picture proudly knocking on an elderly resident's door with her goodies, standing on a mat which reads 'Welcome Home, Wipe Your Feet'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry eye up £10million LA mansion with ‘granny annexe’ flat for mum Doria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are eyeing a sprawling £10million mansion — and planning to move her mum Doria in with them.
Potential buyers can get a ­virtual 360-degree tour of the six-bedroom property close to LA’s affluent Pacific Palisades.
It is being sold by Fast and Furious film producer Steve Chasman, and celebrity neighbours include Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck.
Sources say Meg, 38, and Harry, 35, want to find a property with large grounds for them and Archie — plus a “granny annexe” flat for 63-year-old social worker Doria.
Tonight one said: “Once quarantine and lockdown are over, Harry and Meghan will be moving into their new pad — and they want Doria to be included in these plans.
“She is hugely independent though, and doesn’t want to be in their space.
“She will have her own granny annexe.
"The family have been joking that Meghan and Harry will now have a babysitter on tap, but the reality is Meghan doesn’t trust many people and Doria is her rock and her biggest champion.
“Harry has also grown close to her so, believe it or not, he was receptive to the idea of living with his mother-in-law.
"Obviously, under lockdown, they won’t be moving house any time soon but they are both looking forward to laying down more permanent roots in Los Angeles, and ­making it home.”
The luxury mansion overlooks the sea and boasts a cinema, swimming pool, one-acre garden and a pergola.
It also offers a giant children’s play area — perfect for Archie, who turns one this week.
According to the glossy prospectus, other perks include a chef’s kitchen and in-built BBQ area — ideal for foodie Meghan.
The property has been on the market since September, and its gated community is said to be one of the safest in the area.
Since moving from Canada to the US, the couple have been renting a home close to Sir Elton John.
They have been spotted walking their dog in LA while wearing protective facemasks.
Last month we told how they had also shown an interest in movie star Mel Gibson’s £12million mansion in Malibu.
One local estate agent posted online they had actually bought it but a veil of secrecy surrounded the potential purchase.
The property is understood to still be on the market.
CORONAVIRUS could slash royal income by up to £100million this year.
Rentals from the Duchy of Cornwall and Crown Estate are down and residences can’t attract visitors.
A source admitted: “Finances are in severe trouble.”
The cash woe could impact Palace repairs and 1,200 staff.
The Palace said its focus was on following guidelines in the lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle look to buy $13 million mansion round the corner from Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck - complete with a 'granny annex' for Doria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are looking to buy a $13 million mansion round the corner from Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck, complete with a 'granny annex' for Doria, according to sources close to the couple. 
The Sussexes are said to be eyeing up a sprawling six-bedroom home near LA's wealthy neighborhood of Pacific Palisades and are planning to have Meghan's mom Doria move in with them and baby Archie. 
'Once quarantine and lockdown are over, Harry and Meghan will be moving into their new pad - and they want Doria to be included in these plans,' a source told The Sun.
'She is hugely independent though, and doesn't want to be in their space. She will have her own granny annex.'
The source said Meghan wants to keep her mother, 63, close as she is 'her rock' and now 'doesn't trust many people' outside of an immediate circle of family and friends.
'The family have been joking that Meghan and Harry will now have a babysitter on tap, but the reality is Meghan doesn't trust many people and Doria is her rock and her biggest champion,' they said.
The source said that, while Harry has reportedly grown increasingly distant from his own family after the couple's shock exit from Royal life, he has forged a close bond with Doria and is happy to include her as the family looks to set down roots in LA. 
'Harry has also grown close to her so, believe it or not, he was receptive to the idea of living with his mother-in-law,' the source said.
Since moving from Canada to the US, the couple have been renting a home near to Elton John and David Furnish, who they are believed to have been in regular contact with.
'Obviously, under lockdown, they won't be moving house any time soon but they are both looking forward to laying down more permanent roots in Los Angeles, and making it home.' 
The luxury mansion they have their sights set on boasts a swimming pool, cinema, a pergola and a spectacular sea view.  
According to the listing, it sits in a gated community and also features a one-acre garden and a giant play area to keep Archie entertained. 
Pictures reveal potential buyers can treat themselves to a bath with a view of the ocean in one of the six bathrooms across the property. 
Then there's the chef's kitchen, an in-built BBQ area, not to mention the celebrity neighbors - with the property just a stone's throw from the homes of A-listers Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck. 
Its current owner is Fast and Furious film producer Steve Chasman, who put the property on the market back in September. 
The property comes in in the couple's hefty budget, based on reports from TMZ last month that they were looking for a home between $12 million and $18 million in the exclusive Bel-Air area.
The couple are being bankrolled by Prince Charles for the first year of their new life. 
Meghan and Harry first moved to Canada after they announced they were stepping down as senior working royals but then flew to California in March before the borders closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  
Since then, they have kept a low profile, spotted only a few times walking their dogs and distributing meals to the needy for the Project Angel Food charity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr ‘unheard’ track going under the hammer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unheard track by Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr recorded after the Beatles split is heading for auction.
Angel In Disguise could be the only song co-written exclusively by the band’s former bassist and drummer, according to auctioneers.
The ex-Beatles recorded the demo for Sir Ringo’s 1992 solo album Time Takes Time but it did not make the cut.
Former Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince is selling the cassette, which is expected to fetch up to £20,000.
He was asked to find artists to record alternative versions of Angel In Disguise in the 1990s, after Sir Ringo rejected the track.
The song has never been heard publicly.
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: “It’s fantastic to be able to bring to the market a previously unheard and unreleased track…
“We think the track certainly had enough about it to be included in the album and I am sure if Paul was to release this himself it would certainly prove a hit with fans.”
The cassette contains two versions of the track – a rough demo with Sir Paul  on vocals and a fuller ‘mixed’ version with musicians and backing vocals and Sir Ringo singing.
Another Sir Ringo demo, Everyone Wins, which was also shelved but later released on a compilation recording, is also included on the tape.
The tape, with other memorabilia, will go under the hammer at Omega Auctions’ online sale on May 19, with 25% of proceeds donated to the NHS Charities Together Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

The Beatles announced their split in 1970, shortly before the release of their twelfth studio album, Let It Be.
Speaking on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show in March, Sir Paul spoke candidly about the end of the world's most successful group. 
When asked why he didn't keep the band together after Lennon announced his departure, he said:  'When families break up, it's to do with the emotion and the emotional pain.
'You can't just think of a smart idea like that at the time. You're hurting too much so it wasn't going to happen.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">People around the world are making the most of their time in quarantine but it's certainly not been smooth-sailing for everyone. 
While some have been getting fit and boasting about their baking skills, others have been faced with misbehaving cats, faulty clippers and dodgy DIY disasters. 
In a gallery collated to BoredPanda, one woman attempted to cut a cat flap into her front door - only to realise it was the wrong way around.
Meanwhile a man was left in an awkward position after his cat decided to engage in an 'intimate' grooming session while he was live on TV. 
And another was left with a less than desirable hairstyle after his clippers gave up halfway through his haircut.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Social Media Watch - May 2</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With all of professional European sport on an indefinite hiatus, athletes from around the continent have been finding novel ways to keep themselves fit and entertained during the forced postponement.
Let's face it, when you're in lock down, you can get a bit bored.
Clearly, Wolves defender Jonny Castro Otto is in the same boat, after he resorted to dressing up his dog!
Getting a spare Wolves shirt, Jonny opted to put his four-legged friend into a kit too, and taking part in a customary photo shoot too.
As adorable pups go, Jonny's is right up there!
One of the biggest names in the NBA, Lebron James has been up to a fair bit during lockdown, with workouts and social media dances top of the agenda.
This week though, the LA Lakers star decided to give sports and movie fans a sneak peek of his latest project.
James is a key member of the production of the sequel to Space Jam, which is due to come out next year - and he's revealed the logo and name of the movie for all to see.
Donning a hat on Instagram featuring the title Space Jam: A New Legacy, it's safe to say we should all get a bit excited for the movie now!
Remember that time Rio Ferdinand had to go in goal for Manchester United? Well, if Liverpool ever need to stick an outfield player in goal, maybe they should get Bobby Firmino in the gloves.
The Brazilian forward shared a video of him getting some lock down exercise in, only he was playing in goal!
To be fair to him, he pulls off some very tidy saves, performing numerous acrobatics between the sticks too!
Maybe Alisson should be a bit worried...
One of the best ever in his sport, Roger Federer is known for his grace and style on and off the court.
But it seems that wasn't always the case, after he shared an old photo of himself on Instagram alongside the caption "Reminding everyone there are better days ahead".
Let's just say it's not the most en-vogue photo you'll ever see of the Swiss star - but credit to him for giving us some laughs during lock down.
Here's hoping we see this become a trend online - we'd love to see some old snaps of other famous athletes!

    <h5 class="mb-1">If you're using lockdown to get back in touch with your ex, don't</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s the modern-day Cinderella story: boy matches with girl, they go on some dates and it starts to go somewhere. 
Sex, and the promise of a new relationship feels good. She tells her friends – ‘it went so well!’ – and looks hopefully towards the next date, only for him to quite suddenly disappear into the abyss. 
She wonders what she did wrong. Was she too keen? Not keen enough? Overdressed? Not pretty enough? 
Then two years later he reappears, uttering those all important words: ‘Long time no speak! You don’t have to reply, but…’ 
This particular move has been given plenty of labels already: zombieing (speaks for itself), submarining (in which a ghoster confidently emerges months later acting like nothing happened). Now, it’s had a lockdown makeover. We’ve entered the age of the F**kboy’s Reckoning*. 
Allow me to explain. 
The world has gone topsy turvy, which means that business as usual for anyone — f**kboys included — is no more. For a lot of us that has resulted in an excess of free time. Time to twiddle your thumbs. Time to think. 
Unfortunately, though, all that thinking time has translated into a surge of repentance for many f**kboys who — starved of access to new wanking thinking material while stuck at home — have been finding solace in delving into their repertoire of past lovers. 
Faced with all their past wrongdoing and unable to distract themselves with new lovers, they’re emerging repentant for their sins — and they really want you to know.
Over Easter (quite fittingly) this happened to me. Someone I dated a few years ago who later disappeared into thin air was resurrected in my DMs, apparently not dead afterall. 
At first I read the message outlining his contrition over wrongful behaviour and I couldn’t place the name — I’ll leave it to you to decide what that says about the calibre of his contemporaries.
‘Ohhhh….HIM’, I thought eventually. His crimes had not been too serious… comparatively speaking. We had been on a couple of really good dates a few years ago before he ghosted me. 
‘Okay’, I thought, ‘But why now?’ Why was he getting in touch in the middle of a global pandemic years after the fact?
There’s something almost comforting in the predictability of it — in the inevitability of the return. These ‘boomerang boys’ you lobbed out into the ether that are now on their return voyage back from the abyss to tell you they’re ‘really f**king sorry — honestly’.
They hope you don’t mind them getting in touch. They apologise for disturbing your life — it’s just….it’s just they’ve been thinking. About what went down with the two of you. About the part they played, or the way they left you. They had some stuff going on, they’ll say, but it wasn’t fair, you didn’t deserve it. 
‘Sorry’, they’ll say, and then reassure you that they’re not looking for anything in return, just that they feel compelled to apologise.
Now, you might be thinking, ‘that’s nice isn’t it, that they want to repent, to apologise’. Of course, I can’t speak for everyone. But, for me, it’s a hard ‘no’. 
Yes, it is nice to be apologised to for pain you have been exposed to at the hands of another. But make no mistake about it, this behaviour is more about appeasing the conscience of the ghost, rather than a selfless act to rebalance your emotional health. 
There’s a self-importance to it all that is wildly frustrating — not only are they asking you to let them off the hook for something they did in the past, but there’s also an assumption that whatever form your engagement took was so meaningful that it would provoke a deep hurt only remedied by the grand gesture of their apology.
Perhaps the lockdown and the whole dystopian scenario currently playing out in countries all across the world has thrown his life into sharp focus. That sitting alone with his feelings has caused him to reflect on past behaviours and recognise wrongdoing. Good. That’s honestly productive behaviour. The thing is, I don’t need to hear about it.
Because to ask someone to forgive inexcusable behaviour that caused them hurt in the past — apropos of nothing — means shifting the emotional legwork involved in reaching a resolution back onto them. 
Not only that but it also doesn’t consider that maybe the person doesn’t need reminding of sh***y past behaviour inflicted on them in a time of global crisis. But mostly because it’s a paper-thin grasp at a bit of attention when they’re presumably at home feeling lonely… and in need of some tit pics. 
Of course, maybe it’s genuine. And I’m not arguing for a lack of repentance. It’s an expressly Good Thing to recognise past mistakes and learn from them. It’s how we grow as humans. 
The point is, you just don’t know what the context is when you barge into someone’s life unannounced and, ultimately, any apology like this has very little to do with its subject, and everything to do with easing the sender’s own guilt.
To any f**kboys out there edging towards a moment of reckoning, I have some advice: keep it in your notepad pal.
If you really must reach out, try a simple ‘Hey how are you?’
Simple, effective and gives the other person the power to engage if and when it feels safe and comfortable to — it puts the ball in their court. If they’re ready for or interested in your apology, your message invites them to let you know.
But if not, then maybe — just maybe — sitting with your feelings and reflecting on your behaviour is enough. Maybe instead of asking forgiveness you could make a commitment to never treating someone like that ever again. Just a thought.
For the moment, my f**kboy has been left on read. Although I might send him this article as a response. 
*There are definitely female and non-binary versions of this character, but I speak from personal experience here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I didn't have sex in the city (or anywhere else) for five years! SATC creator Candace Bushnell reveals her husband was stolen by a 'very determined, beautiful 23-year-old'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the woman whose newspaper columns spawned the wildly successful Sex And The City franchise, there is little about relationships and sex that Candace Bushnell hasn’t encountered. 
But ask her how the coronavirus will impact dating and the sexual landscape over the next few years and she’s momentarily stumped. 
‘I don’t know,’ she admits. ‘I think it’s really going to depend on testing. I think people are going to get tests and get it figured out. 
 'If they tell people they can have sex, then I think everybody will go out and have sex... including me! Maybe,’ she adds, ‘I’ll do it with a cub.’
A cub, for the uninitiated, is a younger man who pursues older women and is a far cry from a ‘SAP’ (‘senior-age player’) – an older man of means whose attitude to women makes Hugh Hefner seem progressive. 
Such is the lexicon of today’s dating world as laid out in Bushnell’s latest book, her semi-fictionalised memoir, Is There Still Sex In The City?
It was Bushnell’s classic depiction of the 1990s New York dating scene in her Sex And The City column which became the touchstone for women the world over. It spawned the book which produced the TV series starring Sarah Jessica Parker as Bushnell’s alter ego Carrie Bradshaw, which in turn led to two hit movies.
Therefore, if anyone is qualified to examine the dating terrain for today’s middle-aged women, it’s Bushnell.
 Yet far from being merely a treatise on dating, her latest book also delves into the thornier issues of midlife, such as divorce, money worries and bereavement.
While she was writing the book, her father died and a close friend committed suicide. Midlife, as Bushnell surmises, can be a time of profound loss and disappointment. ‘You see a lot of women who play by the rules, do everything right and who don’t necessarily get the fairytale ending - whatever that is,’ she explains.
‘And it’s bewildering for them. In a way the book is about reinventing oneself yet again - something that people seem to have to keep doing.’
It was certainly the case for Bushnell herself. In 2011, her life appeared to be perfect. With three books under contract and working on the TV adaptation of her 2010 novel, The Carrie Diaries, she was also living in apparent bliss with her husband of nine years, Charles Askegard, a ballet dancer 11 years her junior.
‘We had the great apartment, which I’d decorated and which was on the cover of Elle Decor magazine, and we had a renovated house in the country that had beautiful gardens. I look back and it was almost like I was trying to create the perfect backdrop for my marriage. But I guess there was something missing on the inside.’
The couple separated that year and divorced in 2012 when Bushnell was 53 – something she admits came as a shock ‘because I was not thinking about divorce at all’.
‘I’m not really supposed to talk about my marriage, but honestly what happened was that my husband fell in love with another woman [alleged to be ballerina, Georgina Pazcoguin]. 
'She was a younger woman, and if a 23-year-old is after your 42-year-old husband and they work, travel and dance together, there are situations where you can’t compete. It’s just kind of the law of the jungle.’
She describes her then love rival as ‘very, very determined and beautiful’ but surely as Candace Bushnell, the successful, famous and exceedingly glamorous writer, she could more than hold her own?
 ‘But that was probably part of the excitement, right?’ she says. ‘Stealing somebody out from under the poor, clueless, “famous” wife. There’s something to me that’s ultimately absurdly humorous about it.’
She adds that her ex-husband and the other woman remained together ‘for about another seven or eight years’. 
‘They probably were in love, and if two people feel they’re in love, you can’t stand in the way. But after it happened, my dog died and I just felt: that’s it, I’m done. I’m leaving.’
Bushnell escaped New York for the rural life of her home state of Connecticut and returned to the city four years later to find out whether, as her book details, for a ‘middle-aged, single white woman driving a sensible SUV’ there was still sex in the city.
Her findings, together with those of a group of her friends, make for typically eye-popping reading. She tried the dating app Tinder as part of research for a magazine article, ‘and writing that piece was for me just shockingly sad,’ she admits. ‘There was such a lack of quality men.’
She dated Arnold, a frisky septuagenarian who declared when giving Bushnell a tour of his home, including his bedroom: ‘I’ve had a lot of great sex on that bed. And I hope to have a lot more in the future.’ ‘He was so sexist,’ she says, ‘I spent most of the time yelling at him.’
As for those younger men, was she ever tempted? ‘Oh yes, absolutely!’ she exclaims. ‘But the problem is, I can’t really turn my brain off. These young guys are great, but they’re in their early- or mid-20s, so there’s not that much to talk about. And to me, talking, really communicating intellectually with someone, is actually a big turn-on.
‘Plus, these young guys all want to have this wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am sex, but I don’t want that. I want to spend an hour over it and then, if it’s good, I’ll probably want to do it again another day.’
She sighs. ‘Maybe I’m being too picky but, you know, I’m 61. I’m old enough to be their grandmother.’
Her book did ultimately have a happy ending when she took up with millionaire property developer, Jim Coleman, 58. He had initially been introduced to her by actor Chris Noth (Sex And The City’s Mr Big) and she dedicated her book to Coleman, referring to him as MNB (My New Boyfriend).
But, as she reveals, their almost three-year relationship is over. 
‘Now we’re just friends,’ she says, ‘but we talk on the phone every day. He travels a lot and I was travelling a lot, and if you don’t see each other for six weeks it’s hard to keep a relationship going.’ 
At the moment, Bushnell is on her own during lockdown at home in Sag Harbor in the Hamptons.
‘I have really good friends out here,’ she says, ‘but nobody’s seeing anybody. People drop things off on the porch and leave. So, like with everybody else, the isolation thing is pretty wearing.’
One of the most surprising things to emerge is that Bushnell, the woman whose name had become synonymous with sex and dating, had a five-year period of celibacy after her separation.
‘And I was like, how could that even happen?’ she admits. ‘But as you get older, maybe your hormones change and sex is not top of mind. It was top of mind for many years when I was younger. When I was 20, I didn’t go five days without sex.’
 She had moved to New York in the 1970s as an 18-year-old and was, she admits, ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’. She frequented the legendary Studio 54 nightclub, moved in with Gordon Parks, director of the cult movie Shaft (he was 64 to her 18), and later dated publisher Ron Galotti, the man who inspired Mr Big, the great love of Carrie Bradshaw’s life.
Meanwhile, she pursued her writing career. While working for the New York Observer in the 1990s, she started looking into rumours already circulating about Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire paedophile and friend of Prince Andrew. 
After a call from Epstein’s lawyer warning her not to investigate further, she backed off. She was also acquainted with Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul now convicted of rape.
‘Somebody I knew had an affair with him and was crazy about him,’ says Bushnell. ‘And I suppose that was initially what was so shocking about the whole thing.
‘There were some women who thought he was bizarrely attractive because of the power he had. But there are certain powerful people where you can just see they’re not a good person and you just don’t want to be involved with them.
‘I got pretty good at recognising those kinds of characters and staying away.’
Indeed, Bushnell’s recent novel, Rules For Being A Girl, was inspired by the #MeToo movement.
She also got good at recognising new dating phenomena, from ‘modelisers’ (men who only sleep with models) to ‘toxic bachelors’, all of whom she introduced to an eager public through Sex And The City.
Even now, almost 25 years since the book’s release, the public appetite for Carrie and her friends Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda has barely waned. The two movies made over £560 million at the box office and, while a third film had been in the works, the project was abruptly cancelled three years ago.
Many surmised that the bad blood between Sarah Jessica Parker and co-star Kim Cattrall, who played Samantha, was to blame. Indeed, when Cattrall’s brother Chris died two years ago, she posted an Instagram message to SJP which read: ‘I don’t need your love or support at this tragic time.’
But Bushnell refuses to be drawn on their reported feud. ‘I don’t know anything about that really, but honestly I think when somebody passes away, it’s very difficult. The only thing I can say is they’re both really nice people.’
Though she’s friendly with all the SATC women, she maintains: ‘The whole time the show was shooting, Sarah was married and starting a family, Kim was married and Cynthia Nixon [Miranda] had a kid, so we had different circles.’
Bushnell herself never had children and she says she’s never regretted it.
‘I was engaged a couple of times, in my 20s and again when I was 31. I look back and think if I had married that guy, I probably would have had kids and a very different life. But when I was engaged, I just felt like I was going to suffocate. I felt like I’m drowning, I can’t do this life.’
Instead, Bushnell created a fabulous life of her own. Plans are already under way to turn Is There Still Sex In The City? into a TV series. She is writing three novellas about how fame and success affects people and is working on a possible one-woman show.
As for finding the next Mr Big, she hasn’t given up hope. ‘Listen, I would be very happy to find a guy my age, reasonably successful who was once hot.’ She lets out a huge laugh. ‘A bit like me.’
Is There Still Sex In The City? by Candace Bushnell (Abacus, £8.99) is out on Thursday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan replaced by Ben Shephard on GMB as he's tested for coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good Morning Britain has confirmed Piers Morgan's replacement on the show on Monday, as the host was forced to take leave.
Piers, 55, has been tested for coronavirus after suffering "mild symptoms" in the last 48 hours.
While he awaits confirmation on whether he has COVID-19 or not, he's been forced to miss the show.
It isn't yet known when he will be back, depending on the what the results say - while Piers confirmed he was following medical advice.
Now, GMB have confirmed host Ben Shephard will be covering for him.
Ben normally hosts the show on the days Piers isn't scheduled in, with Piers recently upping his weekly amount to four episodes from Monday to Thursday.
As Piers remains at home, Ben will host the show alongside Susanna Reid.
Piers broke the news of his illness on Sunday on Twitter.
He told his followers: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I’ve had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."
Piers revealed he is still awaiting the test results, which should come in tomorrow (Monday).
The host, alongside co-presenter Susanna Reid, has been keeping GMB viewers up to date with all the latest COVID-19 news.
Susanna was forced to miss two weeks of GMB at the start of lockdown measures being introduced in March, after her son had a cough.
She soon returned, and Piers upped his episodes to four a week and has been vowing to get the answers the public wants on COVID-19.
After posting the news on Twitter, Piers was met with a huge response from his followers.
One fan tweeted: "I hope you’re well Piers. We need you!"
Another said: "Hope all is well Piers we need you."
Others commented on the fact Piers had been in the GMB studio for weeks, so were concerned over whether he should have been there.
But Piers had only began experiencing "mild symptoms" in the past 48 hours and wasn't on the show on Friday.
Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan to be replaced by Ben Shephard on GMB as he awaits covid-19 results</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Piers Morgan will be replaced by Ben Shephard on Good Morning Britain as the star awaits test results to see if he has coronavirus.
The TV host announced on Twitter today (Sunday) that he will be absent from Monday’s show after taking a precautionary test for the Covid-19 virus.
Assuring fans that he was OK, Piers said that he was taking the test after showing a ‘very mild symptom’ over the weekend.
A GMB spokesperson has now confirmed to Metro.co.uk that Ben will be stepping in for him during his absence.
Despite the test, Piers said it was just an ‘abundance of caution’ to ensure any potential spread was stopped in its tracks.

Taking to Twitter, he wrote: ‘UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I’ve had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow.’
The message has since been retweeted by Susanna Reid and his co-stars.
Since coronavirus made its way to the UK, Piers has been praised for his no-nonsense approach to tackling government officials about their lack of preparation.
He also has stood up for the NHS, and offered to pay all parking tickets for staff members who were being charged to park in the hospitals or while working.
However, he’s also come under fire for being ‘too combative’ with those who have appeared on the show.
Most recently, another flood of complaints to watchdog Ofcom were send after his interview with MP Victoria Atkins, the safeguarding minister.
His line of questioning was later backed up by Susanna.
Good Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russo Brothers to helm ‘Hercules’ live-action remake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Disney has started developing a live-action remake of its 1997 animated feature Hercules.
Anthony and Joe Russo of “Avengers: Endgame” fame will produce the project for the studio through their production house, AGBO.
Disney has hired Dave Callaham, the scribe of “The Expendables” and upcoming “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”, to pen the script for the live-action remake, reported Variety.
The original film, directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, was inspired by the legendary hero Heracles, the son of Zeus, in Greek mythology.
In the movie, Hercules (voiced by Tate Donovan) is snatched as a baby by Hades and forced to live among mortals as a half-man, half-god.
Veteran actors Danny DeVito and James Wood had also voice starred in the movie.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The world of ‘Hercules’ will come alive on the big screen once again, this time as a live-action film.
Disney is in early development of a live-action remake of its 1997 animated movie ‘Hercules’, with ‘Avengers’ filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo producing through their AGBO production company, reports Variety.
Action specialist Dave Callaham is also on board to write the ‘Hercules’ script. Callaham is known for teaming up with Sylvester Stallone for the original screenplay for ‘The Expendables’, creating his character for the franchise.
The 1997 movie was a musical-fantasy retelling of the Hercules legend. It was directed by Ron Clements and John Musker.
The character of Hercules was voiced by Tate Donovan, who was snatched as a baby by Hades and forced to live among mortals as a half-man, half-god.
Hercules had to perform “a rite of passage” on Earth to prove himself worthy of living with the gods on Mount Olympus. He did it with the help of his mentor, voiced by Danny DeVito.
‘Hercules’ had an $85 million (Dh312.1 million) budget and generated $252 million at the worldwide box office. Other Disney films to get an updated live-action version include: ‘Beauty and the Beast’, ‘Aladdin’ and ‘The Lion King’.
The Russo brothers opened the AGBO facilities in Los Angeles last year and co-produced the Chris Hemsworth action film ‘Extraction’, out now on Netflix.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The ray-traced worlds of Minecraft RTX shine new light on a beloved classic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">My first attempt at Minecraft’s Survival Mode was a glorious disaster. It took me most of the first day’s fleeting light to realize that all I needed to do to harvest wood was to walk up to a tree and punch it. I got as far as making a crafting table, but the sheer number of possibilities it presented intimidated me, so I went off exploring. Nightfall came, and zombies and creepers with it. I died. Several times, actually.
I persisted, and found a world that surprised and delighted me at every corner. I plumbed the depths of endless caverns, hunting for precious gems and minerals. I built the treehouse of my childhood dreams and then learned to defend it against the creatures of the night. I uncovered an alternate dimension of darkness and flame and built up my armor and weapons to go toe-to-toe with the monsters there.
I still play Minecraft with my kids. The game is an old friend, a familiar playground. I’m continually astonished at the creations of the modding community and enjoy checking in on their work, but it’s been a little while since I really dug into a creation of my own.
All of that has changed with the recent Minecraft RTX beta. Ray tracing brings new life to those familiar cubic worlds. The shadowy depths of caves and mines drip with a new sense of danger, and the overworld shines with unexpected radiance. Light plays around blocks in a deeply satisfying way as you mine them. The RTX update gives you an opportunity too rare to be wasted: a chance to play a game for the first time all over again.
What’s more, the physically based materials pipeline this update includes gives the talented creators in the Minecraft community a wealth of new tools for their projects. Some of those talented folks have already put together a set of showcase worlds, and if their early efforts are any indication of what’s to come, there are tons of stunning adventures, puzzles, and landscapes headed to Minecraft’s Marketplace in the near future.
Minecraft RTX is still in beta, so the experience isn’t totally complete or polished yet. Even so, there are many questions that we’re now able to answer. What do ray tracing and physically-based materials bring to the game? What kind of a workload do these effects put on your GPU? What settings can you adjust to improve performance?
Armed with the ROG Strix GA35, a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti inside, I went hands-on with the Minecraft RTX beta to gather some first impressions and answer these questions.
Enthusiasts have talked about using ray tracing to render video game worlds for years, but it’s a computationally complex process that’s difficult to achieve in real time. With its Turing  GPUs, NVIDIA has made real-time ray-traced effects a reality. Its GeForce RTX cards have specialized RT cores dedicated to accelerating ray tracing operations, and it’s working with developers to help them bring these effects into the rendering pipelines of their games.
The Minecraft RTX beta gives owners of the Bedrock Edition an opportunity to take a first look at what ray tracing brings to the game. The beta only works on systems with GeForce RTX GPUs, and it requires you to sign up for the free Xbox Insider program. Once you’ve loaded up the beta, head into the Marketplace. Mojang hasn’t yet enabled an option to generate your own Survival or Creative worlds with RTX on. For now, you’ll need to check out the new tech inside one of six free showcase worlds made by luminaries in the Minecraft creative community.
Take one step into Color, Light, and Shadow RTX, created by PearlescentMoon, and you’ll immediately see what ray tracing brings to the table. On a curved wall in front of you, the word “Minecraft” glows in giant letters. The light from those blocks diffuses realistically on the walls and the ceiling, blending appropriately with other colors and casting shadows perfectly across the blocky surfaces of the room. This natural diffusion of light is called global illumination, and it’s directly enabled by the engine’s accurate model of how light should bounce off of surfaces in the scene.
My jaw dropped when I first saw the reflection of those letters on the floor. A screenshot doesn’t quite do justice to how the reflection is perfectly rendered no matter where you move in the room. This effect is the fruit of NVIDIA and Mojang’s work implementing physically based textures into the game. Blocks can now be assigned a degree of reflectivity so that objects like metal, marble, and mirrors will all interact with light exactly as you think they should.
These new lighting effects are particularly striking in and around water. The surfaces of oceans and lakes reflect light and scenery to gorgeous effect, especially as the light of the rising or setting sun illuminates the surfaces of clouds over the water.
Underwater, these effects are even more breathtaking. The Aquatic Adventure RTX world created by Dr_Bond showcases the new suite of tools that bring the lakes and oceans in Minecraft RTX to life. Light refracts appropriately as it passes into the water, recreating the Snell’s Window effect and limiting your view of the world above the waves to a 96° cone. Around the rippled edges of that circle, the surface of the water murkily reflects the environment below.
The new physically based materials toolkit gives creators a wealth of options. As you explore BlockWorks’ Imagination Island RTX, you’ll find a dazzling variety of updated textures and light-emitting blocks. Catch the sun setting over the ice palace for a look at how the new lighting and materials work together to dazzling effect. And if nearby clouds catch and reflect that rosy light? It’ll stop you in your tracks.
As much as I enjoyed exploring the detailed creations of expert builders, my time with Minecraft RTX made me hungry to go back to the basics, to the first experiences that made me fall in love with the game. I went off the beaten path in the Crystal Palace RTX world to find a cave and start from scratch. I gathered some wood blocks, made a crafting table, and started caving.
It’s here, mining into an unknown cave, that I became convinced that Minecraft RTX is something special. It’s in the details. When you place a torch on a wall, there’s this extremely rewarding split second where the light diffuses out. That light only goes as far as a reasonable bounce or two will take it, though. The shadows loom, hiding the secrets of the caves. I found myself placing more torches than I ordinarily would as I fought off creatures and hunted for materials.
It’s when you start mining that you realize just how far NVIDIA’s RTX magic permeates the game. Every time you mine a block, the light adjusts naturally and immediately. The warm glow of the last torch behind you fades into shadow the farther you mine away from it. It’s satisfying in a way that’s uniquely Minecraft.
What kind of hardware do you need to play the Minecraft RTX beta? Right now, the game is limited to PCs running one of NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX GPUs. As noted, these cards are equipped with unique RT cores specially designed to accelerate the intense workloads that real-time ray tracing presents..
We plan to publish a full performance guide for Minecraft RTX down the road when the game emerges from beta. For today, I’ve gathered some first impressions of in-game performance using the ROG Strix GA35. This beast of a desktop is equipped with the range-topping GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and AMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X. The beta presents a unique rendering challenge, so this is the perfect opportunity to deploy the best gaming graphics card on the market.
As of right now, there are only a handful of ways to adjust in-game performance. Ray tracing is simply an on/off toggle, as is the upscaling option. That second toggle controls NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 2.0 tech. With DLSS activated, the game renders at a lower resolution and then harnesses the Tensor cores in GeForce RTX GPUs to upscale the image using a neural network model. The image quality of DLSS 2.0 is so good and the performance gains are so pronounced that I recommend leaving this setting enabled at all times.
In other titles with DLSS 2.0, you may be given the option to select from quality, balanced, or performance presets. Here, that automatically happens under the hood. If you load the game with resolutions of 1920x1080 or below, DLSS will load with its quality preset. At 2560x1440, it’ll use the balanced preset, while at 3840x2160 it’ll use the performance preset. That arrangement makes sure that DLSS 2.0 is increasingly optimized for smooth frame rates as users push resolution higher.
A brief side note: Vsync is enabled by default in Minecraft RTX. If you want to disable it, perhaps to do some performance testing of your own, you’ll need to do so through the NVIDIA Control Panel.
A quick look at the RTX 2080 Ti’s performance in the Aquatic Adventure RTX world is sufficient to explain why it’s best to just let DLSS 2.0 perform its upscaling magic. I loaded the level at a 1920x1080 resolution, leaving all settings alone except for disabling upscaling.
50 FPS is a fine result, considering the workout that this game gives to the graphics card, but it might not be the kind of performance that you expect to see from NVIDIA’s top-end graphics card at 1920x1080. Thankfully, a solution is ready to hand with DLSS 2.0.
Now that’s more like it. Enabling DLSS increased average FPS by 61% in this scenario. That’s a remarkable increase, especially considering that the quality difference between the two modes was minimal if not imperceptible. That increase in frame rates was readily apparent as I swam along the seafloor alongside some tall strands of kelp, which slid smoothly past my view without any distracting stutter or blur.
I unequivocally recommend leaving DLSS 2.0 enabled, but there is one performance setting in the advanced video menu that’s worth a little experimentation. That’s the ray tracing render distance slider. From my in-game experience, the slider first affects how close you need to be to an object in order to see it at all, then secondly how close you need to get to it in order for its textures to be affected by the snazzy new lighting effects.
Take, for example, the lovely scene that greets you when you open Crystal Palace RTX by GeminiTay. You start in the cabin of a ship on the sea. The wood grain of the planks and the textures of the cloth sails interact beautifully with the light, and there’s a nice shimmer on the water. But there’s so much more that we could be seeing here.
When you increase the ray tracing render distance to maximum, the full landscape comes into view and the new RTX effects are really given the chance to shine. The towers of the level’s namesake palace loom in the distance, and their reflection stretches across the murky green waters. The scene perfectly sets the tone for the survival adventure designed by the world’s creator.
The different render distance settings are measured in “chunks,” or 16x16 cubes of Minecraft blocks. By default, the game will be set at the lowest possible distance: 8 chunks. You can increase this setting in increments of 4 up to a maximum of 24 chunks. If your GPU can handle the workload, you definitely want to increase the render distance at least a notch so that you can enjoy a full view of the landscape around you.
How much does ray tracing render distance affect performance? I benchmarked each setting in the Crystal Palace RTX world at 1920x1080 to find out.
Although the RTX 2080 Ti delivered excellent frame rates even with the ray tracing render distance maxed out, the performance differential between 8 chunks and 24 chunks is pretty steep. A couple of the showcase worlds are more difficult to render than the others, and pushing this setting too far in these worlds is a quick way to make the game unplayable. The performance penalty for 16 chunks isn’t nearly so expensive, however. This setting gives you a decent view of the wide landscapes around you at a fairly light cost. If your GPU offers you the headroom, as the RTX 2080 Ti does, take advantage of it.
There’s one last option for optimizing performance and quality: adjusting resolution. Right now, this is the only way to improve performance beyond the default settings, so if you’re scrounging for frames in the beta, try playing at 1280x720. It feels a bit odd in 2020 to suggest that folks play at 1280x720, but many people don’t even play Minecraft in full screen. The game’s cubic worlds display vividly at lower resolutions when you’re in windowed mode and multitasking. You can’t manage resolution in-game, but if you lower the Windows desktop resolution to 1280x720 or play the game in windowed mode, the results inside Minecraft can be quite dramatic.
There’s no need to drop down to 720p to get smooth frame rates when you’re rocking an RTX 2080 Ti, though. With this beefy graphics card, I’m always looking for opportunities to do the opposite: to enjoy the sharper images provided by higher resolutions. The showcase world Color, Light, and Shadow RTX definitely gave me this opportunity. It gives you a close-up look at the new ray traced lighting and physically-based materials. Since this world consists entirely of a series of enclosed rooms, I left ray tracing render distance at the default 8 chunks.
Maybe I should just smile and enjoy the 90 FPS experience that the RTX 2080 Ti offered in this title at 1920x1080. Maybe I’d be a happier person if I could just enjoy the sea turtles swimming over my head in the aquarium room without relentlessly searching for optimal graphics settings. But that’s just not my way. I just can’t look at this graph without thinking that I could push the resolution higher.
As it turns out, I can bump the resolution to 2560x1440 while still enjoying high frame rates. Throughout my testing, the RTX 2080 Ti never slipped below 60 FPS. The increased pixel count lended greater clarity to the many reflections and refractions in the scene, and made the custom textures really pop.
The RTX 2080 Ti even proves itself up to the challenge of rendering Minecraft RTX at 4K. That resolution can prove quite a challenge for GPUs, even without tasking them with calculating countless rays of light in real time. Serving up 46 FPS on average under these conditions is no small feat. You’d want a variable-refresh-rate monitor to enjoy the best experience at these settings, to be sure, but the fact that it’s even possible to begin with is pretty incredible.
Color, Light and Shadow RTX gives you an up-close-and-personal look at the new ray tracing technologies, but it only does so in relatively small rooms. Minecraft is famous for the startlingly beautiful vistas it offers when you step back from your creations, so I did another round of testing on Imagination Island RTX, where I could record some long-distance looks that take advantage of increasing the render distance to 16 chunks.
The average FPS turned out to be quite similar to what I recorded in Color, Light, and Shadow RTX. Even when I double the distance that I can see objects, bringing into view much more of the diverse and colorful creations on the island, the RTX 2080 Ti faithfully maintains high frame rates. How about at a higher resolution?
Once again, the RTX 2080 Ti proves itself more than capable of rendering at 2560x1440 in this game. Frame rates averaged right around 70 FPS and often landed closer to 80 FPS. If you have a high-refresh-rate monitor with G-SYNC, that technology will match the refresh rate of your display with the frame rate of the GPU to ensure a smooth experience even as the frame rate varies like it does in the above graph.
Chalk this one up as another victory for the RTX 2080 Ti on the 4K gaming battlefield. This resolution brings a level of image quality and clarity that amplifies the next-level lighting effects in the Minecraft RTX beta.
Minecraft has long been held up as the premier example of why gameplay matters more than gorgeous graphics. The game’s chunky, cubic landscapes have withstood the test of time thanks to its rewarding gameplay loop and endlessly inventive modding community. But now, with the addition of RTX magic, Minecraft is suddenly one of the most unique looking games on the market. Its signature cubes are still there, as are its barebones textures, but the interplay of realistically-traced light throughout its spaces is nothing short of transformative.
The price of admission to this new world of ray-traced gaming is one of NVIDIA’s Turing-based GPUs, starting with the battle-proven GeForce RTX 2060. We’re planning to produce a full performance guide as Minecraft RTX moves out of beta, but even today, we can say that NVIDIA’s DLSS 2.0 upscaling magic makes sure that you can enjoy a playable experience with any RTX-series card.
There’s definitely value to be gained by opting for one of the RTX 2060’s more-powerful brethren, though. You’ll want to increase the ray trace render distance as high as you can in order to appreciate Minecraft’s broad vistas and witness the new creator worlds as they were intended to be seen. One of the GeForce RTX SUPER cards will show their mettle in this regard, as will the top-of-the-line RTX 2080 Ti.
All told, the showcase worlds in the Minecraft RTX beta give a tantalizing teaser of the popular sandbox game’s future. If these worlds are the appetizer, then I’m already excited for the main course. It’s time for a new series of showcase worlds, exotic hangouts, and creative puzzles. It’s time to tackle the challenges of Survival mode once more, the lush Overworld, dimly-lit caverns, and fiery Nether, all as immersive and awe-inspiring as when you first encountered them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New trailers: Lovecraft Country, The Painter and the Thief, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I finally caught up on the Amazon series Undone, which I’ve been wanting to watch since getting a glimpse of its wonderful rotoscoped style. I think I complained in one of these columns recently that, upon rewatching A Scanner Darkly, I felt like its animation was underused, barely scratching the surface of what such a dark, trippy film could do with that dreamy style. Undone gets it right.
The series does a wonderful job of using its dreamy look to tell a story where characters are constantly going in and out of memories, leaving moments behind only to return to them later, mid-conversation. It’s something that could easily be overdone, but the story keeps it all grounded, even as the visuals help to express just how disorienting and occasionally wonderful the feeling of slipping in and out of time can be.
And ultimately, the show’s characters are just so strong and colorful on their own that it’d be worth watching even if people weren’t constantly slipping through time and space. The rotoscoped style could have distanced us, but instead it gives the actors space to be even more expressive, as the scene focuses us on their eyes, mouth, or hands, making simple motions feel large and impactful.
Check out seven trailers from this week below.
J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele are two of the executive producers behind this new HBO series, which basically boils down to: what if the Jim Crow South also had Lovecraftian monsters? It looks like a very cool blend of genres so far. The show starts in August.
A painter confronts — and befriends — a man who stole two of her paintings in the documentary The Painter and the Thief. It looks like a fascinating story, and it’s worth checking out the trailer just for a glimpse at the relationship the two build, particularly as she begins to paint a portrait of him. The film comes out May 22nd.
It’s probably been over a decade since I’ve seen an episode of Reno 911, but this revival of the show looks like it hasn’t lost a step from the ridiculous series I remember. The show is coming to Quibi, which, alright fine. It returns May 4th.
Amazon has a new season of Homecoming coming up, and this installment has Janelle Monáe in the lead, which seems like a solid reason to revisit the show. The new season premieres May 22nd.
A year after ending the series, Netflix is bringing back Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt for a special episode to take advantage of its Choose Your Own Adventure-style (TM?) tech. The revival arrives May 12th.
Hulu has a new animated comedy coming up from two of the producers behind Robot Chicken. The comedy feels a little cheap, but I really like the animation style, which has the characters and world all looking like little woodblock toys. The show premieres June 12th.
Here’s the first real look at Jerry Seinfeld’s new comedy special, his first in more than two decades. There’s something very charming about seeing bits of Seinfeld’s routine — he has his style down so perfectly, it feels a little like listening to a forgotten track on an old album you used to love. The special comes to Netflix on May 5th.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Debra Messing slammed for sharing anti-Tara Reade blog post, deletes tweet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Television actress Debra Messing deleted an anti-Tara Reade tweet Saturday after intense backlash, with the woman who has accused presidential hopeful Joe Biden of sexual assault calling the message “slander.”
“Biden Accuser, Tara Reade, Allegedly Stole from Non-Profit Organization,” Messing’s tweet said, featuring a link to a Medium post by the controversial Krassenstein brothers.
BIDEN DENIES SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION, IN HIS FIRST COMMENTS ON TARA READE'S CLAIMS
It appears Messing simply shared the Krassenstein brothers’ story, as her tweet mirrored the story’s headline.
Brian and Ed Krassenstein were prominent anti-Trump activists, labeled “two of the biggest stars of #Resistance Twitter,” by The Daily Beast until they were permanently banned from the platform in 2019 for violating the site’s rules.
The brothers now attack the president on other platforms, and lately have been attempting to cast doubt on Reade’s claims that Biden, the former vice president, sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s when he was a senator.
A spotlight was put on their latest anti-Reade piece when Messing shared it to her 635,000-plus followers.
Reade responded to Messing: “This is slander and untrue.”
Journalist Katie Halper, whose podcast has served as a platform for Reade to detail her claims, chimed in, ”This has been debunked and you're quoting people who have been permanently banned from twitter.”
Messing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear when she deleted her tweet.
Others said Messing’s tweet was an example of why women are often afraid to come forward with damning claims against powerful men.
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS? BIDEN'S RESPONSE TO TARA READE ACCUSATIONS LEAVES MANY WANTING MORE ANSWERS
“Gee, I wonder why a woman might be reluctant to come forward with allegations against a powerful male Democratic politician,” journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted “Democrats are good watching liberal sitcom actresses like this dig into her past to try to smear her reputation? This is the standard to use generally?"
Greenwald added, “Who would watch what Democrats are doing to Tara Reade and even think about coming forward with similar allegations ever again? The message being sent could not be clearer. It's like watching a bloodthirsty mob. Way closer to #DemeanWomen than #BelieveWomen.”

Many others bashed Messing for sharing the Medium post:

Messing has used social media frequently to voice her criticism of President Trump and his administration. In  March, she shared a video criticizing Trump’s response to the pandemic and questioned whether or not the president’s supporters will turn on him as the death toll rises.

The 68-year-old actor was struck by a Porsche during a walk with his family in their neighbourhood in Connecticut on Friday.
The Memento star was sent flying several feet backward into a wooden fence by the car, which had skidded across the road after being T-boned by another vehicle, his wife Nancy Sheppard said.
He suffered a gash on his head as well as injuries on his left leg and shoulder.
EMTs arrived quickly and rushed Joe to hospital, where he was given a CT scan, TMZ reported.
Joe – who played Ralph Cifaretto on The Sopranos from 2001 till 2004 – is now recovering back at home.
A family friend posted two photos of him giving the camera a thumbs-up while revealing the wound on his head on his Instagram account on Friday night.
They explained in the caption: ‘Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.
‘He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering. Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming!
‘We’ll reading them to him to help him get better!’
Both drivers in the crash stayed at the scene and police are investigating, accordin to TMZ.
Joe posted a video of a rainbow that was filmed shortly before the accident.
He filmed the rainbow before showing his family walking in front of him and wrote: ‘Look at that rainbow! How do you like that beauty?
‘And all my little rainbows ahead of me.’ 
After shooting to fame in The Sopranos, Joe played Captain Howard in the Bad Boys films and appeared in films like The Matrix and Risky Business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Sopranos' and 'Bad Boys' star Joe Pantoliano struck by a vehicle, rushed to hospital: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No, he wasn't hit by shrapnel.
Actor Joe Pantoliano was struck by a vehicle while out for a stroll on Friday and was taken to a Connecticut hospital, according to a report.
Later Friday evening, Pantoliano’s wife, Nancy, told TMZ that the “Sopranos” cast member was recovering at home after suffering "a severe head injury and some chest trauma."
Photos posted to the site showed the 68-year-old native of Hoboken, N.J., with a nasty, stitched-up cut on the left side of his head but he was smiling and giving the "thumbs up" sign.
Nancy said the popular "Joey Pants" was walking with the family in their neighborhood when a Porsche was allegedly T-boned by another car and sent across the road where Pantoliano was walking, hitting him.
Nancy reportedly told the outlet that Pantoliano, who is also well-recognized as the loud and anxious Captain Howard in the popular “Bad Boys” film franchise -- as well as the creepy mobster Ralph Cifaretto on "The Sopranos," known for hitting Tony Soprano's sister Janice with "shrapnel" when clipping his toenails -- was sent airborne a couple of feet backward where he crashed into an old wooden fence and got a gash to his head, along with injuries to his left leg and shoulder.

According to the outlet, per Nancy, the drivers of both vehicles involved in the accident stayed at the scene while police were investigating.
Pantoliano shared a video to his Instagram account Friday morning of lush greenery with a rainbow backdrop, which family members reportedly said was taken before he left for his walk.

"Hey, kids all around the world, I want to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for voting for me. And I also want to thank and commend the Kids' Choice Awards for using this broadcast to raise really critical awareness for child hunger," said Johnson, 48, over a video chat, per E! News. "So, well done to you guys."
The actor then brought up his "Jumanji: The Next Level" co-star.
"I want you to stay positive; I want you to stay happy; I want you to stay healthy; I want you to go to bed tonight feeling great," Johnson joked. "Because however old you are, around the world, just know that you are still bigger than Kevin Hart."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A video of late Rishi Kapoor, during his last hours from the ICU, was leaked online earlier today. Many Bollywood celebrities took to their social media handles, urging people not to share it if they come across the video. Reportedly, the video shows an intensive care unit staff sneakily recording the actor's struggles.

Many celebs bashed the video and the people who are sharing it. Arjun Kapoor without mentioning about the video wrote, "The choice is not to post something is sometimes as important as to be the first to post something. Images have a lot of power lest we forget. Sometimes humanity and empathy must prevail over being first to embrace use of sly voyeuristic material presented to you."
Actor Karan Wahi said he too came across the video and decided to delete it immediately as he found it disturbing. A report in TOI read Karan as saying, "There's a forward that a ward boy or someone from the hospital has shot of Rishi Kapoor in his hospital just before he passed. I saw it. And think it's a gross violation of his privacy. If you receive it, delete it rather than forward it further."
He added: "Actors are also human beings. Please do not forward or post them just to be the first one. Have some respect."
Mini Mathur took to her twitter page earlier today and urged fans to "stop the insensitivity". In a thread she wrote, "Just came across a disgusting, completely invasive video of Rishi sir on WhatsApp in hospital actually titled "last video of RK" obviously shot by a hospital staff member.I know humanity is at sea at the moment but can we PLEASE STOP THIS INSENSITIVITY and not be party to this?"
She later also asked Mumbai Police to find the offender, "If you see a video like this on any group can you please insist that it's taken down??? Can we stop this vicarious celeb goggling even when they are indisposed and unaware? It should be a legal offence @MumbaiPolice and met with the strictest action,"
On Thursday, only a few hours after his passing, another video of Rishi Kapoor from the hospital had gone viral. The video showed a man singing Rishi Kapoor's hit song Tere dard se dil aabaad raha from Deewana, while standing besides the late actor. Many netizens claimed the video was from the time when the actor was receiving cancer treatment in New York, and not recent.
Rishi Kapoor breathed his last at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai on Thursday, April 30, 2020, after battling cancer for two years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leaked Rishi Kapoor video from ICU enrages Bollywood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A leaked video of late actor Rishi Kapoor during his last hours in the ICU has enraged many Bollywood celebrities.
In the video, ICU staff can be seen sneakily recording as the veteran actor struggles.
Several celebrities including Arjun Kapoor, Karan Wahi and Mini Mathur called out the hospital for staff negligence.
Without mentioning the particular leaked video, Arjun wrote: “The choice is not to post something is sometimes as important as to be the first to post something. Images have a lot of power lest we forget. Sometimes humanity and empathy must prevail over being first to embrace use of sly voyeuristic material presented to you.”
Actor Wahi admitted that he too saw the video and decided to delete it immediately, rather than share it among others as he found it disturbing.
Wahi said: “There’s a forward that a ward boy or someone from the hospital has shot of Rishi Kapoor in his hospital just before he passed. I saw it. And think it’s a gross violation of his privacy. If you receive it, delete it rather than forward it further.”
He added: “Actors are also human beings. Please do not forward or post them just to be the first one. Have some respect.”
Mathur urged people to “stop the insensitivity”.
She tweeted: “Just came across a disgusting, completely invasive video of Rishi sir on WhatsApp in hospital actually titled ‘last video of RK’ obviously shot by a hospital staff member. I know humanity is at sea at the moment but can we PLEASE STOP THIS INSENSITIVITY and not be party to Mathur?”
Mini also tagged Mumbai Police to take strict actions against the offender.
“If you see a video like this on any group can you please insist that it’s taken down??? Can we stop this vicarious celeb goggling even when they are indisposed and unaware? It should be a legal offence @MumbaiPolice and met with the strictest action,” Mini added.
Rishi died at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai on Thursday. He had been battling cancer since 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">John M Chu ‘disgusted’ by casting scam around Crazy Rich Asians sequels</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Filmmaker John M Chu has called out a scam where actors were being asked to audition for the sequels to 2018 hit Crazy Rich Asians.
The filmmaker decided to set things straight after a Twitter user named Alan Baltes, claiming to be a casting associate, announced that the film’s two upcoming sequels were casting for lead roles.
Baltes allegedly asked the budding artiste to pay USD 99 as “submission fee” so as to be considered for the projects.Talking to Variety, Chu, who is currently working on “In The Heights” adaptation, said he is “disgusted” by the fraudulent activity happening on the social media.
“I kept reading it, and when it said 99 dollars, I was like, ‘This is f***ed up. There’s so many scams like that in LA anyway and to actually target, specifically, Asian actors, was very frustrating,” the director said.
He termed the scam as a direct attack on Asian actors who have only now started to get recognised in Hollywood.
“Asian American actors finally get the opportunity or the hope that there are roles and parts out there. People have this light inside of them to pursue this dream that they never thought was possible before, and to take advantage of that and know that you can take USD 99 for a fake audition is just disgusting,” Chu added.
He said such a scam makes things even more difficult for Asian Americans who are facing racial attacks in the wake of coronaviruspandemic, which originated from China.
“To put on top of that this time, when we’re being othered and we’re being attacked on the streets, is even more disgusting,” the 40-year-old director said.
In his response, Baltes said someone sent him the information and “was misrepresenting himself as being with casting”.“The person is no longer in contact with me after I inquired further. They were attempting to get me to send them money for casting calls,” he said, adding that he hasn’t received any money from any actor.
Chu, meanwhile, made it clear that though open casting call might be a possibility for “Crazy Rich Asians” sequels , no location scouting has been conducted nor any pre-production.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Crazy Rich Asians’ sequels casting scam exposed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Director Jon M Chu says he is disgusted by a scammer claiming to be casting for sequels of the hit movie ‘Crazy Rich Asians’.
Chu said while sequels to the hit romantic comedy are in the works, he and producers are not currently casting for “new lead roles” — as stated by some press releases and social media posts. The false communicative pieces have been taken down, reports Variety.
Chu explained that a person named Alan Baltes, who claimed to be an actor and casting associate, shared a notice about the casting.
According to the notice, the makers were casting Asian actors, ages 20s through 40s, for lead roles via “live Zoom auditions” for the supposed ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ sequels — ‘China Rich Girlfriend’ and ‘Rich People Problems’. It also stated that there’s a part for a Caucasian female between ages 25 and 35.
The post said people who were willing to be considered for roles had to pay Baltes a $99 (Dh363.5) “submission fee” virtually.
“I kept reading it, and when it said ‘99 dollars’, I was like, ‘This is [expletive] up,’” Chu told Variety, adding: “There’s so many scams like that in LA anyway and to actually target, specifically, Asian actors, was very frustrating.”
The director shared that he “first alerted about the notice when he was tagged in a tweet, after which he notified Twitter and flagged Warner Bros’ legal department”.
After posting his own reaction, Chu said he was blocked by Baltes on Twitter. Baltes’ account has since been deactivated.
Chu described the scam as a “direct attack”.
“Asian American actors finally get the opportunity or the hope that there are roles and parts out there. People have this light inside of them to pursue this dream that they never thought was possible before, and to take advantage of that and know that you can take $99 for a fake audition is just disgusting,” said Chu.
“To put on top of that this time, when we’re being othered and we’re being attacked on the streets, is even more disgusting,” Chu added.
He once again clarified, saying: “We’re so far from it [casting]. We don’t have a casting director. We have never said, ‘Hey, let’s look at people who are out there.’ We’ve done zero. We don’t even have a script.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebs honour Gianna Bryant on would-be 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Friday, Gianna Bryant would have turned 14, and mum Vanessa Bryant — plus a host of celebrities — took the chance to celebrate in a special way.
Vanessa posted an image to Instagram wearing a red bracelet that holds her daughter’s name and her nickname ‘mambacita’, with a heart in between.
“Gianna loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures. Red means love and life,” explained Vanessa in the caption. “To commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She hashtagged the post #PlayGigisWay, likely a reference to her late daughter’s affinity for basketball. Vanessa also said the bracelets would be available for sale soon, with proceeds going toward the Mamba and Mambacita foundation.
A host of celebrities took to Instagram wearing the bracelet and honouring Gianna, who died alongside her father and basketball icon Kobe Bryant, 41, in a helicopter accident in January.
Lakers star LeBron James led the wishes, posting a video of himself wearing the bracelet to his Instagram story, and writing: “Happy beauty-day niece Gigi!!”
Jennifer Lopez and fiance Alex ‘A-Rod’ Rodriguez took a family photo with their children, while all sporting the red bracelet.
“Happy Birthday, Gigi. We miss you. You are always in our hearts,” wrote the retired baseball player Rodriguez. “Today we wore these red bracelets in honour of you, to symbolise love and life. I think of you, Mambacita, and your dad everyday. We love you.”
Kim Kardashian West and sister Khloe Kardashian also posted tributes to their Instagram stories, wearing the bracelets.
“Happy birthday Gigi!!! We all love you so much!” wrote Khloe. “You always led with kindness and love. Today and everyday, thank you for inspiring us to be better.”
Kelly Clarkson joined in, sharing a personal memory.
“I remember Kobe telling me that Gigi always played with kindness, not just talent! I wear this bracelet to honour her on her birthday and remind everyone to continue her legacy and #PlayGigisWay,” wrote Clarkson, using the hashtag that Vanessa created for the occasion.
Ciara and her husband, football quarterback Russell Wilson, shared an image of their hands overlapping, while they both donned the red wristband.
“Happy Birthday Mambacita Gi Gi,” wrote the ‘1, 2 Step’ singer and dancer. “Today I’m going to do a little dance for you because I know you loved dancing. We love you.”
Actress Zendaya shared a wordless image of her wearing the bracelet, with an extra heart drawn on top.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kim Kardashian and major celebrities celebrate Gigi Bryant’s 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kim Kardashian was among major celebrities who celebrated Gigi Bryant’s 14th birthday on Friday.
It’s been three months since the teenager tragically died alongside her father Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in Calabasas in January.
To mark what would have been Gigi’s 14th birthday on Friday, a host of famous faces wore red bracelets, which were created by her mother Vanessa to support the Mamba and Mamacita Foundation.
Sharing a photo of the bracelet on Instagram, Vanessa told fans: “Gianna loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures. Red means love and life.”
“To commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
Vanessa added: “We are in the process of making this bracelet available for proceeds to benefit our Mamba and Mambacita foundation. I will update you with a post when we have them available for purchase.”
Kim Kardashian shared a selfie of her wearing the bracelet on Instagram, and added the hashtag #playgigisway.
Jennifer Lopez and her fiancé Alex Rodriguez also paid tribute to Gigi by wearing the bracelets.
Posing alongside Jennifer’s kids Max and Emme, and his daughters Natasha and Ella, A-Rod wrote: “Happy birthday Gigi. We miss you. You are always in our hearts.”
“Today we wore these red bracelets in honor of you, to symbolize love and life. I think of you. Mambacita, and your dad everyday. We love you. #PlayGigisWay.”
Khloe Kardashian also shared a selfie of her wearing two red bracelets, and wrote: “Happy birthday Gigi. We all love you so much! #Playgigisway.”
“You always led with kindness and love. Today and everyday, thank you for inspiring us to be better.”
Celebrities got involved by wishing Gigi a happy birthday, after her mother Vanessa posted a heartbreaking tribute on Instagram.
Posting a photo of Gigi just months before her death, Vanessa wrote: “Happy 14th Birthday to my sweet baby girl, Gianna.”
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you. You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me. I miss your smile, your hugs and your giggles.”
“I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi. I LOVE YOU so much!!!!!” she added.
Gigi and Kobe were killed in a helicopter crash on January 26, alongside seven other victims.
They were on their way to the Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks, California for basketball practice when the helicopter encountered thick fog and crashed.
Kobe and Gigi are survived by Vanessa, and Gigi’s siblings Natalie, 17, Bianka, 3, and seven-month-old Capri.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: UK neighbours perform bhangra while maintaining social distance, video goes viral</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Around the world, people are isolating and practising social distancing, but it is not stopping them from having fun and spreading cheer, like a group of neighbours in a UK locality who decided to perform bhangra.
A video is doing rounds across social media platforms and is warming hearts online. While social distancing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the group of people were seen performing basic steps of the Indian folk dance outside their homes.
Bhangra is a type of traditional dance from the Indian subcontinent, originating in the Majha area of Punjab.
Reportedly, the video was first shared by Twitter user Eeshar Singh, @shergillj99, who is part of the clip. News magazine India Today reported that Singh started dancing and others joined in, imitating his poses from a distance.
According to Singh's Facebook bio, it seems that the clip is from Leeds, UK.
The group performed to the Punjabi song, ‘Veervaar’ from the movie 'Sardaar Ji' by the artist Diljit Dosanjh.
“Mum got me dancing for the street,” he wrote online sharing the clip.
Performers were also seen playing the dhol in the clip.
The dancing skills have impressed many online, including singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh the original artist in the film, who retweeted the video online. Many also appreciated that people from different cultural backgrounds joined in and imitated the moves.
Twitter user @lxzettexo wrote: "It warmed my heart seeing other people of other cultures join. Thanks
Tweep @jmanderuk posted: "Love this, wish their was more of this community spirit and cross culture happiness in the world."
User @OneFurrowedBrow could not get enough of the performance: "Why is this only 45 seconds short?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Emerging culture critics announced for the Herald and The Age</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have selected five emerging culture critics after receiving funding from the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas.
The grant will enable up to 100 extra pieces of critical writing across literature, visual arts and theatre in 2020.
The books critics are Bec Kavanagh and Jack Callil, who will write for both mastheads. The visual arts critics are Chloe Wolifson (Sydney) and Tiarney Miekus (Melbourne), while Cassie Tongue will cover theatre for the Herald.
While the present coronavirus-induced shutdown has decimated much of the arts and culture industry and forced theatres and art galleries to close, it provides the writers with an opportunity to produce other critical pieces and highlight areas of innovation during this once-in-a-generation crisis.
Kavanagh is a Melbourne-based writer who has been published in The Australian and Meanjin.
"I'm looking forward to sinking my teeth into some great new stories, and writing into a space that values the contributions of writers and the arts – particularly at this time," she said.
Callil is digital editor at the Australian Book Review and a proofreader at Meanjin.
"Having the opportunity to write about Australia’s vibrant and diverse literary community is an exceptional privilege," he said.
Wolifson has previously written for the Herald and The Guardian and has a monthly column in Art Monthly Australasia.
"It's always my hope that a review I've written encourages readers to go and view the exhibition themselves and engage with the work. I'm excited for this opportunity to start more conversations about Australian contemporary art," she said.
Miekus is a Melbourne-based writer and editor of Art Guide Australia. She has a strong interest in contemporary art and plays in a post-punk band.
"It's both humbling and exciting to be a contributing voice on visual arts, and to have the space, time and support to think intently and purposefully on visual art," she said.
Tongue has had regular theatre reviews published in Time Out and The Guardian.
"I'm looking forward to writing about new Australian performance as it happens: exploring new trends, engaging deeply with what our artists have to say, and giving thoughtful responses to the work of theatre-makers and performers who might otherwise miss out on coverage," she said.
Copyright Agency chief executive Adam Suckling said the five new critics will bring "important new voices to the landscape of arts criticism and review in Australia".
"The current crisis has shown just how fragile and important Australian writing and visual arts practice is," Mr Suckling said.
"While things are very grim for creators at the moment, the new critics will look at ways of covering Australian creativity during this terrible crisis. But they will also be in place for when, and I hope this is very soon, it is safe for Australian audiences to return to physical book launches, plays and shows at galleries."
Matthew Burgess, culture editor at the Herald and The Age, said he was "thrilled" to welcome the five new critics to the mastheads after an impressive number of applications.
"It is an exciting opportunity for our readers to gain fresh perspectives in visual arts, stage and books criticism," he said. "Our thanks to the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute for supporting this important project."

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast – Brits set to enjoy 19C sunshine as rain clears for brighter weekend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SPRING is set to return to the UK this weekend, with bright beautiful weather settling in across the country.
Following a week in lockdown with torrential rain, Brits will wake up to some light relief from the miserable weather this morning.
Through the course of the weekend, the low weather pressure that has been sitting over the UK - and bringing with it miserable weather - will move across to Europe.
According to The Met Office, it will be replaced by building high pressure, which will result in “dry, fine and settled weather” this weekend and particularly next week.
Forecasters predict a warm spring high of 19C will be felt by most of the country on Saturday, although the East Coast may feel a bit more of a chill.
Simon Partridge from the Met Office said while some parts of the country may see some light showers on Saturday, “things are definitely going the right way.”
The North and East of the country will see a day of sunshine and showers on Saturday.
The South and West will be much drier and brighter, with “decent sunny spells.”
A high of 19C is predicted on Saturday, with 16C felt quite widely.
A low of 12C will be felt on the East Coast.
Overnight, mostly dry conditions are expected - although those in the East may see a touch of frost on Sunday morning if they wake early enough.
Further dry, fine and settled weather is expected on Sunday, with potential for very light winds.
The Met Office says there is some risk of a few showers in the North and East of England and Scotland. Most places will enjoy “dry and decent weather.”
The high pressure will remain in charge for most of next week, meaning the warm sunny weather is here to stay for at least a few more days.
The Met Office warns that while the weather change will tempt many across the country to spend their weekend outdoors, the UK must continue to adhere to the coronavirus lockdown.
Simon Partridge encouraged people to enjoy the sunshine from their backyards, balconies and daily hour-long walks - though he did add that UV levels will be reasonably high over the weekend, so people must cover up accordingly.
The high pressure build won’t last forever, and is expected to move on by the following weekend and bring with it more wet and miserable weather.
The Met Office predicts an Atlantic weather system will "bring further bands of rain" in "unsettled" conditions for the first week of May.
Officials warned that a weather cell blowing in from the would cause "power showers"- and the rain would go on into the month.
The Met Office is now predicting settled, warmer weather for the beginning of the month, although we can still expect some showers, and it'll be much cooler than last week.
April's sunshine was caused by a high pressure system from the continent - but recently we've faced the opposite, with low pressure systems bringing in colder weather and lots of rain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Justin Bieber and Jemma Lucy lead most dramatic celebrity tattoo transformations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tattoo culture has emerged firmly into the mainstream within the last few years.
From a long and colourful history, the art of body ink has become a commonplace means of expression that some don't even think twice about.
One in three young people now have at least one tattoo, and this trend is only expected to continue growing.
Among the sky rocketing number of tattoo fans are several celebrities that have gone under the gun.
Whether they inspire their fans or not, their dramatic art transformations have been documented as they add to their ink collections while in the spotlight.
Here you can find some celebrity throwbacks to the time before their tattoos.
Fans have followed Justin's ascent to stardom ever since he shot to fame as a floppy-haired teen.
Ever since he was 16, the Sorry singer has been adding to a growing collection of body ink that has now become two sleeves, his entire torso and even his legs.
Justin even has a tiny cross tattooed on his face to mark his dedication to religion.
According to the tattoo artist who did his delicate facial work: “It was a representation of his faith in Jesus and his journey with finding purpose in God.”
The latest count of Justin's tattoos amounted to 59.
The One Direction heart throb won the hearts of the nation on X Factor before being swept up in the boy band's international stardom.
Since then, however, Zayn has decided to cover his body with a variety of art work.
The musician boasts an extensive collection of body art from a mandala on his head to a cover up on his arm of the former dedication to ex-girlfriend Perrie Edwards.
His artwork stretches across both arms and his body, and he even included a touching dedication of Gigi Hadid's eyes in the middle of his chest.
It is believed that Zayn and Gigi are expecting their first child together later this year.
Reality star Jemma Lucy has undergone a dramatic transformation over the last decade full of surgery and tattoos.
Then by the time she appeared on Ex On The Beach in 2015, the busty star proudly donned neck tattoos and sleeves.
Since finding fame and starring in shows like 100% Hotter, Jemma has also had two boob jobs and four Brazilian butt lifts.
Among her most notable tattoo experiences, last year Jemma decided to cover up a tattoo that was dedicated to Katie Price.
Taking to her social media story, Jemma couldn't wait to get the pin up covered up with the picture of a horse.
At the time she added: ‘Cover the b***h up! Not yet finished but love my coverup on one of my worst tattoos ever. Not it’s a beautiful horsey. By @tommicrazy.’
Actress Angelina Jolie has at least 17 tattoos that are brimming with powerful and sentimental meanings.
Of her most noticeable tattoos, she decided to have the coordinates of where her children were born inked on her arm.
On her lower back she has a huge Bengal tiger that was inked with a traditional Thai needle and meant to symbolise her approved Cambodian citizenship.
Angelina also has an extensive collection of body ink on the top of her back including the phrase "Know Your Rights" which is dedicated to The Clash.
Another inked up celebrity that fans have had their eyes on ever since she appeared in Disney as teenager Hannah Montana, is Miley Cyrus.
The powerful vocalist has had quite a journey from country sweetheart to wrecking ball legend.
From avocados to Vegemite, Miley has collected an impressive display of delicate body art dotted all over her body.
She's also added some larger pieces to her ink collection, such as a huge dream catcher down her ribs and a lengthy quote from Theodore Roosevelt.
The football legend now has over 40 tattoos but he began his famed sporting career with almost no ink.
Since shooting to worldwide fame, David has covered his arms, torso and legs with stunning tattoos.
Among them was a huge dedication to his doting wife Victoria, with her name written in Sanskrit on his arm. Although, it has since been revealed that the translation was a little off and it actually reads 'Vhictoria'.
Posh and Becks have also got matching tattoos in Hebrew that read: 'I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.'
As well as her signature beehive hair and lick of thick black eyeliner, the late legend was renowned for her pinup tattoos and quirky style.
Although she only had 14 pieces of body art, her tattoo journey was in focus as the vocalist shot to fame from a shy North Londoner to Valerie superstar.
The singer passed away in 2011 at the age of 27, and her favourite tattoo artist vowed not to do a pin up on any future clients.
Michael Jackson's daughter Paris has flowered into a bohemian celebrity icon dotted with dramatic and symbolic tattoos.
Back in 2017, the socialite revealed that she had over 50 tattoos and counting.
She has a touching tribute to her late dad tattooed onto her arm alongside her extensive collection.
Paris also has artwork down her sternum and over her legs.
She has also appeared at a number of events bare foot and shown off her stunning foot art.
According to People, the Maroon 5 vocalist had his first tattoo - a dove that symbolised peace - following the 9/11 attacks.
He has since covered his entire body with intricate art work and wording to commemorate important places in his life.
Among the tattoos that the singer boasts is the word 'California' across his stomach and the Sanskrit word for 'Tapas'.
Adam's enormous mermaid angel back piece reportedly took over six months to full complete.
Popular British musician Ed Sheeran is known for his stunning vocals but he also boasts a large and impressive collection of tattoos.
Most of the ballad singer's artwork was created by tattoo artist Kevin Paul - who has also worked with Rihanna in the past.
Ed has over 60 tattoos across his body and has opted for a more colourful canvas of ink unlike the other celebrities on this list.
Among his arm tattoos, which include a gecko and a colourful tree, Ed also has the word 'prince' which symbolises his love for the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air.
He also has an enormous lion inked into his chest and a the Heinz tomato ketchup logo on his upper left arm.
Fashion model and former gang member Jeremy Meeks shot to fame following his arrest in 2014.
Jeremy set pulses racing due to his impressive mug shot and was instantly propelled into fashion stardom.
Known at the 'hot felon' the 35-year-old has since walked the runway for a number of high-end designers.
Although he already had tattoos when he was formerly in a gang, the model has since covered himself with even more ink.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has taken to Instagram to show off his wildly different lockdown hair choices.
In one picture he showed off slick back and styled hairdoo, while in another his silver hair was sticking up and unkempt.
The TV personality wore a smart polo shirt in the black and white pic of his slick look while in the other he grimaced as his mop spiked in all directions.
And fans of the presenter who wrote with his snap: "Lockdown hair options" had mixed opinions about his wacky hair styles.
One wrote: "The second wild look!!."
Another said: "Silver fox, followed by two flame emojis."
A fan wrote: "Wow Phillip! Rocking them hair styles."
Another added: "I like the nutty professor look!"
While other fans were not as impressed with Phillip's lockdown hair choices.
One wrote: "Cut it all offfffffff."
Another said: "How many likes on this comment for you to shave it all off."
The This Morning host also posted his smart hair style on his Instagram stories, captioning it: "If ya can't cut it, slick it."
Philtook to his Instagram earlier this week to share the same snap of is unkempt hair.
In the pic Phil appeared to be sitting in a balcony area on on a plush grey sofa in his new place.
The pic was taken from his new bachelor pad where he moved to after moving out of the home he shared with his wife Steph when he came out as gay earlier this year.
Phillip admitted that he 'misses hugs' after moving out of the £2million family home on Monday's episode of This Morning.
He also this week opened up on how This Morning going ahead amid the coronavirus lockdown allowed him to keep positive mentally.
He said: "It's very good for the head isn't it. I think this has saved my head actually, being able to come in here and keep going."
Later on in the show, Phillip shared important advice as he encouraged one tearful viewer to remain positive during the unusual situation of lockdown.
He said: "You've got to think positive, it's a time where we are all trying to find a silver lining in what is a very dark cloud... we will all get through this."=

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nicola Mclean dishes the dirt on hellish stars during I'm a Celeb stint</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nicola Mclean has told how former I'm A Celeb 2008 camp mate David Van Day wound her up on the show and was an "absolute t***".
The former glamour model, 38, invited fans to take part in a Q & A session on her Instagram stories.
When asked who was her most favourite and least contestant on the eighth series of the show Nicola told how former 80s pop star, 63, infuriated her.
She said: "My least favourite was David Van Day because he was an absolute t***. Literally his sole purpose was to p*** everyone off. it worked good for him but oh my god it was hell to live with."
David Van Day has been approached by Mirror Online for comment.
Nicola invited her fans to ask her questions to 'give her some entertainment during self-isolation'.
She said: "Entertain me guys, ask me some advice, tell me some outrageous stories, ask me a question, anything you want."
When one fan asked how is she coping with lockdown, Nicola said
'she was doing alright now, but took her a while to get used to it'.
Another fan asked if she would ever get a bum job?
Nicola replied: "No I hate them, I hate big bums I want to look straight up and down with big boobs."
Nicola claimed in November 2017 that David, who rose to fame in the duo Dollar, made sexual advances towards her on camera.
Responding to the comments, David Van Day's wife, Sue Moxley, told MailOnline : "This was all a bit of harmless fun for TV. It was before I met David nine years ago. I don't know why this is being brought up now. She hasn't been in the press much recently.
"I though Nicola and I were friends. It would have been nice if she gave me the heads up. We've actually all posed together as a group at a red carpet event since the programme aired and everything was fine and friendly."
Nicola is married to footballer Tom Williams, and the couple have two sons, Rocky and Striker.
Nicola finished sixth I'm A Celebrity... and also appeared in CelebrityBig Brother

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cyntoia Brown love story: Marriage and children plans after 15 years in prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyntoia Brown's nightmare battle for justice has gone global - with a hit Netflix documentary, star backing and follow on book on the way.
But after the Netflix cameras stopped rolling the now justice campaigner Cyntoia, 32, had to begin paving a new life for herself post release with a husband, plans for children and a potential law career.
In fact, even before Cyntoia had left prison she married rapper Jamie Long - who inspired her to believe she would eventually become a free woman.
Long said he first discovered Cyntoia and her plight on a 2011 YouTube video, saying he felt compelled to watch her: "I felt God tell me, stop and write her. I told her basically, 'God told me to tell you you're getting out of prison'."
He sent the letter in 2017 and even burnt the edges to make it stand out from her other fan mail.
"There was just something about him," Cyntoia said and four months latert they met face t o face.
"When I went in to see her, I knew right then she would be my wife. I bought my wife's wedding ring while she was still in prison, and we didn't know if she was getting out," he said, recalling their romance.
They got engaged two years later and married before she was released in 2019.
They plan on starting a family, with her husband saying: "I want to settle down and start a family. I want to live for you and please you. This time I got it right, and I know I got it right."
Since her release, Brown-Long has gone on a national speaking tour and is thinking about law school.
Cyntonia was released on August 7 last year after her life sentence was commuted to 15 years.
She admitted killing Johnny Michael after he solicited her for sex - he was aged 43, she was a very young looking 16.
Since her conviction both Tennessee and American law changed significantly over the sentencing of minors for serious crimes and millions protested about the length of jail time for Cyntoia, an at-risk-child at the mercy of a series of a predatory men.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has proved she still looks hot even when she's sporting a BEARD.
Jesy transformed herself into an electrician named Gary and wore fake facial hear for funny sketch which she shared on Instagram to her 6.7m fans.
The singer, 28, lay on her bed wearing a skimpy crop top and silk pyjama bottoms, alongside her pal Charlotte who was posing as a plumber named Steve.
And the stunner's Insta fans were very impressed with her new look - with many rushing to the comments section to tell her she looked 'hot'.
One wrote: "Still Gorgeous @jesynelson."
Another gushed: "Still would."
A third added: "Now i love you more."
Many of Jesy's followers also praised her for posting the clip and said it had them 'cracking up'.
The pair told how they were called 'Sparky Boiz' while bigging up their handyman services.
Jesy said: "What's Going on everyone, Gary here, just thought I'd do a quick post cos me and my mate Steve are still working in lockdaaan."
Jesy has been keeping her fans entertained Instagram posts during lockdown.
Earlier this week she posted a snap of her in a very scanty outfit as she headed to Sainsbury's.
Her jeans were unzipped when she made her journey to the supermarket giant amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Quickly stopping for a photoshoot before her shop, Jesy worked all her best angles for the camera flash.
The newly-single Little Mix star, 28, donned a skimpy handkerchief top with her ripped jeans as she posed up outside her plush front door.
Jesy Nelson sent a clear message to her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes after their split earlier this month.
The singer, 28, filmed herself dancing around her plush kitchen last week to her band Little Mix's new track Break Up Song in a vido she posted to Instagram.
She passionately sang the lyrics "This is not a second chance, no, no, baby/This is not a new romance, not tonight/This is for all the nights I cried for you, baby."

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Walliams brands Jamie Redknapp's gorgeous mum Sandra, 74, a 'Hot Mama'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV funnyman David Walliams has branded Jamie Redknapp's mum a 'hot mama'.
The Britain's Got Talent Judge, 48, was left mighty impressed when footballer Jamie, 46, took to social media to share a tribute to his 74-year-old mother on her birthday.
Taking to Instagram, Jamie shared images of his toned mum Sandra posing in swimwear and showing off her classic good looks with her high cheekbones.
Clearly ageing like a fine wine, svelte Sandra looks incredible in the photos.
Jamie captioned the post: "Happy birthday to this incredible lady. We adore you mum. Thanks for your wisdom, love and care."
The former husband of Louise Redknapp, with whom he shares two sons, also spoke about being separated from his mother during the lockdown procedures enforced by the government as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
"You have been a rock throughout my life, given me support that I hope I can give my kids throughout their lives too. I miss you and I can’t wait to see you.
"No doubt you will be waiting on dad hand and foot today!
"But make sure he looks after you. See you soon when this is over and love you always. Your boy Jamie."
Many of Jamie's followers were loving the pics, but none more so than Mr Little Britain himself, David Walliams.
David commented on the post: "Hot Mama."
Jamie wasn't the only one who was sharing a tribute to Sandra, as it was also his father and her husband, football legend Harry Redknapp.
"Happy birthday Sandra I love you more now than the day I met you if that’s possible," wrote Harry on his Instagram account.
The couple first met in 1963 on the dancefloor of an East London pub when Sandra was 17.
Harry noted when appearing on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!: "We were only just 17 when we started going out, and we’ve never been apart since. I love her like mad – she’s my life."
He later went on to win the 2018 series of the show and was crowned King of the Jungle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island star launches soft porn career as she flogs X-rated content for £7 a month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Love Island star has launched a soft porn career by flogging topless selfies on her OnlyFans profile.
Edyn 'Mac' Mackney, who starred in the first season of Love Island Australia in 2018, took to Instagram to reveal she has created an account on the X-rated app.
OnlyFans lets its users sell content to their followers which ranges from sexy pictures of themselves in their underwear to hardcore pornography.
Edyn, 24, is charging her fans $14.95 (£7.68) a month to subscribe to view her raunchy content.
On Friday she posted a topless photo of herself on Instagram to plug her account.
In the photo she and a friend covered their bare nipples with nothing but gang signs.
She captioned the post: "Our mood when people are offended by boobs.
"Link in bio if nipples don't offend you."
Since starting her account Edyn has been posting a string of saucy pictures.
She has shared endless bikini snaps and a few artfully posed nude shots where she keeps her body covered with her hands.
Edyn drew controversy for posting a picture of her bare bum a supermarket but defended herself saying the shop was empty at the time.
She made her name on Love Island Australia but previously hit headlines after being declared to be "too large" to be a model at a size six.
Edyn was dumped from the villa on day 38.
The series was won by Grant Crapp and Tayla Damir.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island's Curtis Pritchard poses completely naked as he does gardening in the buff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Curtis Pritchard has been showing a very different side to himself during lockdown.
The former Love Island star, 24, took to Instagram to post a picture of himself completely naked on Saturday.
He decided to strip off to honour Naked Gardening Day 2020 and could be seen wearing a pair of gloves and holding a gardening fork.
In the saucy snap he had his back to the camera and flashed his bare bum as he held up the fork in the air.
He was wearing nothing but a pair of black boots and socks as he posed in his driveway.
"HAPPY INTERNATIONAL NAKED GARDENING DAY!" Curtis captioned the post.
His 1.5million Instagram followers were left in stitches by the cheeky snap.
One commented: "You're welcome to come and do my garden any time."
"Only you Curtis!!!! Love it x," another posted.
A third wrote: "I'm in urgent need of a gardener."
"You can be my gardener any day," a fourth said.
Another posted: "Well that's cheered my Saturday up no end!"
It comes after reports that Curtis' TV show The Greatest Dancer has been axed.
The decision comes comes after producers pulled out all the stops with an all star cast for the 2020 series and big name performers that sadly failed to pull in viewers.
A source told The Sun: "Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they've binned it.
"Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much."

One commented: "You're welcome to come and do my garden any time."
"Only you Curtis!!!! Love it x," another posted.
A third wrote: "I'm in urgent need of a gardener."
"You can be my gardener any day," a fourth said.
Another posted: "Well that's cheered my Saturday up no end!"
It comes after reports that Curtis' TV show The Greatest Dancer has been axed.
The decision comes comes after producers pulled out all the stops with an all star cast for the 2020 series and big name performers that sadly failed to pull in viewers.
A source told The Sun: "Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they've binned it.
"Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner names daughter Stormi her greatest achievement with adorable poolside snap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Kylie Jenner has named what she considers he greatest achievement - her daughter Stormi.
The reality star and makeup mogul shares the two year old with ex and rapper Travis Scott, and paid tribute to her beautiful girl with a cute snap by the pool.
Stormi has a mischievous grin on her face as doting mum Kylie wraps a towel about her head to dry her curls.
"The greatest thing I've ever done," Kylie captioned the snap.
Pals and fans alike were quick to gush over the iconic mother-daughter duo.
Malika Haqq, the best mate of Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian and fellow mum, wrote: "Stop the cuteness!"
Kylie's bestie Anastasia Karanikolaou commented: "sweeeeeeetest baby girl."
Yris Palmer, meanwhile, just shared a string of heart emojis.
Kylie's had a hell of a year already, not least because she was named by Forbes, at the age of 22, as the world's youngest billionaire for the second year running.
She's had fans tongue-wagging recently with a declaration of love for Stormi's dad Travis - the pair aren't together, but a loving Instagram post for his birthday has some hopeful that a reunion might be on the cards.
"DADA," she wrote, "Happy birthday to daddy of the year!
"I'm slowly but surely starting to accept the fact that Storm is a daddy's girl. But whatever. We went half on greatness!
"The most beautiful, smart, funny and loving little baby. The best gift.
"OK I'm crying. Love you forever! @travisscott."
The pair announced they would be taking a break from their relationship late last year - and while no romantic rekindling has been confirmed, they've successfully co-parented Stormi.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BGT fans in disbelief over hopeful's real age as she performs with young daughter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent 2020 viewers were left sharing their disbelief over one hopeful's age on Saturday night, as she took to the stage with her young daughter.
Singing duo Honey and Sammy wowed the judges and fans with their moving rendition of Freya Ridings’ Lost Without You.
They went on to win Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer in emotional scenes, with the judge in tears.
But before they’d even started singing, viewers watching at home were stunned over something mum Sammy said.
Asked by Simon Cowell for her age, after confirming her daughter was 14, Sammy revealed that she was 43 years old.
Stunning Sammy’s youthful looks left viewers in shock though, with many believing she was much younger.
Taking to twitter, they couldn't believe her real age and some even thought the girls were sisters.
One fan commented: "Bloody hell is that really her mum."
Another said: "43? she looks fantastic #BGT #BritainsGotTalent."
A third tweeted: "Omg they look like sisters!!"
The pair were stopped mid performance by Simon Cowell, with him asking for a different song.
A little later the mother and daughter returned, and left the judges speechless with their audition.
Amanda was moved to tears and praised the pair, before hitting her Golden Buzzer.
Sammy and Honey burst into tears, as Amanda joined them on stage.
Britain's Got Talent continues Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Jackson abuse accusers to try and sue firms linked to the late star</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two men who accused Michael Jackson of sex abuse are expected to return to court next month to take action against firms linked to the late star.
Wade Robson, 37 and James Safechuck, 42 - who appeared in the documentary Leaving Neverland last year - are reportedly going to sue MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures.
Both Wade and James claim they were molested as children by the late popstar.
According to The Sun, the men want to prove the allegations were true and reveal that firm bosses were aware, or should have been.
Michael Jackson's estate is still exempt from facing legal proceedings.
“We’re finally back in the courtroom," their attorney Vince Finaldi is reported by the publication to have said.
“We were supposed to have a hearing a couple of weeks ago, but it has been delayed due to the coronavirus – so we have another date set for June.
“It will be the first hearing in the case. It’s a new judge and it will be resolved one way or another. We are preparing for a trial later in the year.”
Both Wade and James previously attempted to sue the companies in 2013 and 2014.
However, their case was thrown out in 2017 after a trial judge said they had waited too long to file the allegations.
At the time Californian law required claimants to file before they turned 26 - but Wade and James were both in their thirties.
This changed at the beginning of 2020, when a new law came into effect that allowed victims of sexual abuse to sue until they are 40 years old.
Both Safechuck and Robson detailed a string of abuse claims in the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland.
Michael Jackson's estate and his family have continued to deny the sex abuse claims.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mystery over Rob Kardashian and stunning British influencer Kenza Boutrif's new friendship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rob Kardashian has just added stunning British model and influencer Kenza Boutrif to his Instagram following, taking the total up to 21.
The 33-year-old reality star set tongues wagging on social media after giving the UK-based model and social media star a follow over the weekend.
Rob's tiny following is usually reserved for his closest family and friends, such as his sisters Kourtney, Khloe and Kim Kardashian.
The reality star's unusual move came less than a week after he made a rare appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians to celebrate his daughter's birthday.
But what do we know about Rob's new social media friend?
Kenza Boutrif is a glamorous social media model that is represented by Wilhelmina Models.
She boasts an impressive following of 634,000 fans on Instagram and only follows 103 back - including Rob.
The well-travelled influencer boasts pictures taken in Dubai, New York and Los Angeles among her incredible collection of jet setting snaps and she was also at London Fashion Week earlier this year.
Among her stellar collection of pictures, she has also received plenty of approval from other popular UK reality stars.
Some of her pictures have been liked by Love Island stars Belle Hassan and Yewande Biala.
Kenza also has her own Depop page where she is selling plenty of designer goods such as Comme Des Garcons and a pair of Alexander McQueen trainers.
In the meantime, Rob is currently embroiled in a bitter fued with his ex-girlfriend and model Blac Chynna.
The former couple dated back in 2016 and their daughter was born just one month before their split was made official.
Since then, the volatile couple have been caught up in an ongoing and complicated custody battle over their Dream.
At the end of February 2020, a judge denied Rob's request to have primary custody over his daughter.
Both Rob and Kenza have been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gogglebox viewers rank the stars with one group taking nearly 40% of the vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gogglebox has become beloved by millions, and everyone has their favourites.
Fans recently took part in a poll that allowed them to put forward which of the 11 groups they reckoned deserved the honour of the top spot.
The poll, conducted by The Liverpool Echo, asked fans to order the stars based on how much they make them laugh - with one even stealing 39% of the vote.
Below are all 11 groups, ranked...
London family the Vens joined the show quite late, during season 11 in 2018.
Marcus, girlfriend Mica, and her two daughters Sachelle and Shuggy have become renowned for their bubbly personalities, fits of laughter, and on point honesty.
Mica provided a priceless fan favourite moment as they sat down to watch Victoria Coren Mitchell's notoriously tricky Only Connect, laughing: "This show isn't for the hood, man."
Dad Andrew, mum Carolyne and son Louis have been Gogglebox fixtures since the show first kicked off.
Their numbers have fluctuated, as twin sisters Alex and Catheryne seem to come and go as well.
The family have become best known for Andrew's uncompromising and often scathing wit, as he kicks back in that enormous armchair.
Brighton hairdresser Stephen first appeared on the show alongside then boyfriend Chris, before the pair went their separate ways.
He's since been joined by husband Daniel, as well as mum Pat for a stint.
Stephen is responsible for one of the most iconic Gogglebox moments.
As he and Chris watched the news, the latter observed: "We all like a bad boy, don't we?"
A stunned Stephen looks around and answers: "Not a f**king terrorist though, Chris!"
Dave and Shirley have been married for a staggering 40 years, filming the show from their home in Wales.
Joining the show in 2015, fans have learned that the pair have a genuine deep love for each other - but that won't stop them having a bicker now and again.
Ellie and Izzi stirred the pot recently when they made their feelings very clear about Boris Johnson.
Still, the Yorkshire sisters are mostly a light hearted pair, most often obsessing over food.
When they first put their names down for the show, they reckoned people wouldn't be interested in what they had to say.
The poll begs to differ...
Bristol besties Mary and Marina are completely unfiltered and they hold nothing back.
Both in their 80s, they film from a retirement home and have won legions of fans as their conversations go off on tangents.
Dad Sid and sons Baasit and Umar are well known for their no nonsense slams and quick wit.
The core three are often joined by other family members, like sister Raza and their mum.
The family of four have carved out a place as firm fan favourites, as have their Rottweilers.
The dogs can be seen having a nose about the place and often trying to swipe a biscuit or two when they think the family won't notice.
In fact, their snack collection has become the stuff of Gogglebox legend, with fans not convinced they ever eat them themselves.
Probably the quirkiest couple on the list, Giles and Mary will always have a place in fans' hearts.
The posh duo's home is instantly memorable, as are their lengthy and eloquent rants about whatever they're watching.
Coming in second place with 23% of the vote, brother and sister Pete and Sophie were string contenders for the top spot despite only arriving on the show in 2018.
The Blackpool pair have become renowned for mocking each other as much as they do the telly, so it's no surprise they've proved a hit with fans.
Taking the top spot are the iconic, the legendary, the one and only Jenny and Lee.
The caravan-based pair from Hull swept up a whopping 39% of the vote, landing them as the firm victors.
They first met when Jenny was a landlady and Lee was a pub regular, and have since struck up the sweetest - and funniest friendship.
Joining in 2014, it's not difficult to see why they've managed to place themselves at the top of the list.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Chase fans in disbelief over contestant's likeness to Emmerdale legend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Viewers tuning into The Chase's family special on Sunday, called The Family Chase, were left stunned by one contestant.
Those watching the ITV gameshow dubbed her a lookalike of a former Emmerdale legend.
Viewers thought contestant Paula looked so much like the character in particular, that they began calling her by said character's name.
Emmerdale fans were quick to spot she looked remarkably like Val Pollard.
Val was married to Eric Pollard in the Dales, before her tragic death in 2015 during the helicopter stunt.
She was played by actress Charlie Hardwick since 2004.
As Paula appeared on The Chase on Sunday, fans spotted the huge resemblance between her and the actress who played Val.
From the hair colour to the matching style, and even the Geordie accent, fans couldn't believe their eyes.
One viewer said: "Seat 2  #TheChase," with an image of Val leading to many others agreeing.
Another fan agreed: "Val up now! #TheChase."
A third said: "Now it's Val from Emmerdale  #Thefamilychase."
Unfortunately, like her sister who went before her, Paula was caught by the Chaser, Paul Sinha, and sent home.
As her departure aired, one fan tweeted: "That was too f***ing easy. Now do one back to the Woolpack, Val."
A second fan hoped she might return for the final chase, and said: "Go low & bring Val back oot!"
Unfortunately, it was just Hannah left to play in the final round and she and the family did not win the cash prize.
The Chase airs weeknights at 5pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gordon Ramsay wears his daughter's dress in hilarious new viral TikTok video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Television chef Gordon Ramsay has posted a hilarious new video on TikTok where he wears his daughter's dress.
The Hell's Kitchen icon, 53, has gotten on board with the social media video hype and has now posted a new clip with daughter Matilda.
The two have been staying in Ramsay's Cornwall home and decided to take part in the Flip The Switch challenge.
The footage sees the pair dance along, with Matilda stirring her saucepan and Gordon holding a pepper grinder.
Gordon is seen in a red jumper while Matilda dons a white dress.
In the middle of the clip, however, a swift edit cuts to the pair having swapped clothes.
Gordon is seen displaying his smooth cleavage with a long v-cut on his daughter's dress, while Matilda comfortably grooves in her dad's jumper.
The hilarious video naturally saw some responses from amused fans who lapped up their pair's antics.
One follower joked in the replies on Twitter : "That’s a hell of a kitchen nightmare."
Another fan tweeted: "You two are so FUNNY."
Elsewhere, a different follower commented: "Ugh I live for wholesome content like this.
"An acutal TikTok god."
"The legend himself has an amazing sense of humor," wrote another admirer.
Finally, one humorous Twitter user noted: "That’s a lot of pepper in the dish Gordon! Gonna be spicy!!"
The funny TikTok post comes after reports of Ramsay being faced with complaints about breaking social-distancing guidelines.
A source at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency told the Daily Mail : " He does not seem to be obeying the rules regarding social distancing, exercise and staying at home."
However, it seems that Gordon has taken the advice very seriously now, according to the report.
"One of our staff spoke to him about the frequency with which he was being seen out and about, and the significant distances.
"After a period of reflection, he seemed to calm himself and took on board what was being conveyed in a most polite manner."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gordon Ramsay dons daughter's dress as he gets on TikTok hype</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gordon Ramsay has got on the TikTok hype once more, during lockdown.
While many of us are getting to the stage that we’re bored of our hourly walks to the fridge, the celebrity chef is clearly having the best time while isolating.
And he was joined by his daughter Matilda as they spent their day attempting the viral Flip The Switch challenge in the kitchen of their swanky Cornwall home.
In the video, shared on his Twitter page, the 53-year-old could be seen bopping along with a pepper grinder as Matilda stirred a saucepan.
After a few seconds of their dancing, they switched clothes in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it transition.
Gordon was left dancing in the youngster’s white day dress, while she rocked his red jumper.
Who knew the dad-of-five would look so good in a dress?
‘I think I did this right…..,’ he captioned the clip, sending fans into total meltdown in the comments.
His followers weren’t quite sure what they had just watched, with one quipping: ‘That’s a hell of a kitchen nightmare.’
‘This is basically every TikTok lmao you genius,’ an impressed follower replied.
‘Omg iconic,’ another said, while a Twitter user penned: ‘You in the dress was hilarious!’
We totally agree.
Gordon is currently isolating at his Cornwall mansion with wife Tana and their five children – Matilda, Oscar, Jack, Megan and Holly.
However, their time together has been marred by claims that angry neighbours are unhappy over the family’s move from London. 
According to reports, residents had taken to social media to tell the family they weren’t ‘wanted’ in the area – despite seeing the property as their main home.
Gordon has yet to address the claims, but heaped praise on a generous neighbour who dropped off some asparagus to the Ramsay household.
Sharing off the gift on the gram, he added: ‘Now that’s what I call love thy neighbour, see? 
‘That’s how you look after each other across these difficult times. There you go.’
We love to see it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande team up, release song to benefit frontline workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: Pop superstars Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande are teaming up for the first time on a duet that will fund scholarships for the children of health and emergency workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.
The duet, called Stuck With U, will be released on May 8, the two singers announced on Friday on Instagram, where they jointly have some 316 million followers.
All net proceeds from streaming and sales of the duet will be donated to the First Responders Children’s Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for the children of those working during the pandemic.
Bieber, 26, and Grande, 26, two of the biggest young singers in the United States with hits like Love Yourself and Thank U, Next, have never recorded a song together.
“We hope we make a big difference with this and we hope it uplifts you and makes you feel happy,” Grande said in a statement.
The single is the first in series from Scooter Braun, who manages both singers, that will benefit charities during the year, Braun said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You could be in the music video for Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's new track</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber are teaming up for a new track, and they want fans to be a part of it.
Grande and Bieber made the announcement Friday, on their respective social media pages. The song, called "Stuck With U," is set to be released on May 8, with proceeds going to the First Responder Children's Foundation, to fund grants and scholarships for children of health care workers, EMTs, paramedics, police officers and firefighters on the frontlines, Grande said.
But wait, there's more.
Bieber and Grande went ahead and posted an instrumental version of the song, instructing their fans to tweet videos of themselves dancing to the track -- in the prom dresses or suits they didn't get to wear, with their dogs or just alone in whatever is comfy.
The fan videos will end up as a part of the music video for the track when it's released.
Grande and Bieber aren't the first artists to release new music during the pandemic, with proceeds going to frontline workers.
Internationally renowned Nigerian singer Davido released his new music video, "Dolce & Gabbana," last month, and announced all proceeds would go to the Dolce & Gabbana and Humanitas Together for Coronavirus Research fund.
U2 singer Bono also wrote a new song back in March, called "Let Your Love Be Known," dedicated to health care workers on the frontlines and anyone struggling.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Katie Price reveals she needs therapy for life after ‘slowly going off the rails for 10 years’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KATIE Price claims she needs therapy for life as she comes to terms with 'going off the reals' in a clip from her new TV show.
The 41-year-old doesn't hold back in the hour-long special of My Crazy Life, telling viewers she's been to "hell and back".
In a teaser clip, she says: "I've been slowly going off the rails for just over 10 years.
"At times I've been a mess. I've been to hell and back, but I'm starting to feel like me again.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intense therapy that will continue for the rest of my life has got me back to being me.
"It just goes to show, if I can do it, anyone can!"
Katie recently revealed to The Sun Online how she burst into tears after being reunited with children Princess and Junior after six weeks apart.
The mum-of-five has suffered a tough time being separated from her kids in lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis.
The family were forced apart after Junior, 14, showed signs of the deadly bug while staying with his dad Peter Andre.
This week she was finally able to see him and 12-year-old Princess again.
Katie told us: “I can't believe how much the kids have grown in six weeks - Pete's had them sleeping in grow bags!
"I welled up, it’s been a tough six weeks not being able to hug them.
"After five minutes together it was back to the usual fun and craziness."
Meanwhile Katie has been staying with pals at a posh pad in Surrey - just ten minutes away from Peter - as she isolates with her eldest son Harvey.
She has been shielding the disabled 17-year-old from danger because he is at high-risk from coronavirus because of his health condition.
Her youngest kids Jett and Bunny have been living with their dad Kieran Hayler and his fiancee Michelle Penticost.
Junior and Princess have spent the last six weeks with Peter and his wife Emily - who is an A&E doctor battling coronavirus on the frontline.
It has meant Katie's kids haven't been able to all be together since lockdown began.
"It’s been hardest on Harvey because he really misses the contact with his siblings," Katie added.
"Fingers crossed we’ll be a complete unit with Jett and Bunny joining us this weekend.
"My children are my perfect pieces of heaven - they have kept me strong through thick and thin.
"Unconditional love is free and means everything to me.”
The 41-year-old reality star posted a cute video last night of Harvey, Princess and Junior clapping the NHS on their doorstep.
"It’s Thursday, so let’s show our appreciation and respect for all the incredible key workers keeping our country going", she told fans.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's Celebrity Juice replacement tipped to be Michelle Keegan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Celebrity Juice fans were devastated on Sunday to learn team captain Holly Willoughby was stepping down from the show after 12 years.
This Morning presenter Holly was one of the originals on the raunchy ITV2 series alongside host Keith Lemon.
Their pal Fearne Cotton quit the role in 2018, with her soon replaced by Paddy McGuinness - while Mel B most recently took over due to filming conflicts.
With other past panellists including Rufus Hound and Gino D'Acampo having been on the show in the past, Holly has outlived them all.
Keith paid tribute to Holly after the announcement, while a replacement is yet to be confirmed by the show.
That said, former Our Girl actress Michelle Keegan is hotly tipped to step in as the new captain.
She's been a hit on the show in the past, while husband Mark Wright has also appeared.
As names are thrown into the mix on who will join the show, Michelle could be the front runner.
Ladbrokes bookmakers are pitting former Coronation Street star Michelle at the top of the list, with odds of 4/1.
She recently left her role on BBC's Our Girl, so her diary may be free!
Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
Following Michelle, the next name at the top is show favourite and former Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt.
She stands at 9/2, while Ladbrokes are also placing bets on a surprise return from former captain Fearne.
Some others potentially in the frame include Emma Bunton, Eamonn Holmes, Kelly Brook and Rylan Clark-Neal.
Also on the list, but less likely according to the bookmakers, are Gemma Collins, Emma Willis, Cat Deeley and Davina McCall.
Celeb Juice airs Thursdays at 10pm on ITV2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebrity Juice: Keith Lemon shares hilarious Holly Willoughby video as This Morning presenter 'quits' series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has reportedly quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The This Morning presenter has been a panellist on the ITV2 series since it began in 2008, but is said to be stepping down to spend more time with her family.
Willoughby follows Fearne Cotton, who quit the show in December 2018. Cotton’s replacement, Paddy McGuinness, left after one series before Spice Girl Mel B took over.
It’s unknown who could replace Willoughby.
A number of episodes recorded in lockdown are expected be her last appearance on the series, which is presented by Keith Lemon.
“Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show – it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years,” a source told The Sun on Sunday.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.”
Ahead of the reports, Lemon shared a video of Willoughby on Instagram, in which he looks shocked as she shouts the word “f***” at the screen.
He captioned it: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman. Super rad! Super nice! My mate! I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Willoughby responded: “Aww... what a lovely thing to say... love you Lemon.”
The Independent has contacted a representative of Willoughby for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore and more break into epic fist fight for lockdown Boss B***h Challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MARVEL star Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Margot Robbie, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and more iconic actors have starred in one epic fist-fight challenge, shared on social media.
The challenge sees them all film a scene individually that has then been edited together so that it looks like one extended fight scene.
"I’m so bored! I just want to play with my friends!" says 41-year-old Zoe, kicking off the video as she reads a book.
“Wait a minute, I can play with my friends!" she exclaims, as she walks towards the camera and punching it - with the edit switching to reveal Lucy, 52, who jumps back from the kick and calls out: "What the heck, Zozo?"
Lucy then delivers a punch and the video continues on - although with child stars including Once Upon A Time In Hollywood's Julia Butters also appearing, there are moments where the stuntwomen choose to tickle or let a dog lick the girls, rather than punch a child in the face.
Julia has no such qualms though, and quickly smashes her elbow toward the camera, while Little Women star Florence joins in the fun by picking up a wine bottle before smartly checking herself putting it down and picking up a dog toy to smash into the camera instead.
Margot was clearly inspired by her DC Comics character Harley Quinn as she picks a baseball bat to aim towards the camera.
Halle Berry, 53, meanwhile, falls into a swimming pool before recovering and delivering a punch worthy of any stuntwomen.
Juliette Lewis, Hamilton star Renee Elise Goldberry and Rosario Dawson all also star, while Scottish singer KT Tunstall - whose song The Healer soundtracks the video - appears at the end and asks to be included next time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hollywood stunt professional Zoe Bell has organized an all-female quarantine fight club, and it’s a star-studded, action-packed affair.
“I’m so bored! I just want to play with my friends!” says Bell, who doubled for Uma Thurman in the “Kill Bill” movies. Tossing aside the book she was reading, she walks up to the camera and declares, “Wait a minute, I can play with my friends!”
With that, she delivers a roundhouse kick aimed at the camera, with Lucy Lawless revealed as the recipient of the blow (Bell was also Lawless’ stunt double for “Xena: Warrior Princess”).
“What the heck, Zo-zo?” asks a ticked-off Lawless as her facial expression shifts from surprise to glee, firing back with a punch assisted by her “Xena” Chakram.
And then more female stars get in on the action. Through the magic of choreographed stunt fighting and clever editing, the end result is a who’s who of Hollywood’s female stars seemingly beating the tar out of each other in what Bell calls the #BossB***hFightChallenge.
Other of the many, many stars involved include Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, Halle Berry, Thandie Netwon and Florence Pugh, who punch, kick and headbutt each other, some gaining assistance fomr an array of props ranging from shovels to sheep.
As the action continues, KT Tunstall’s song “The Healer” plays in the background as the soundtrack to all this mayhem.
“Here it is……! Kicking lockdown boredom with some of the coolest!” wrote Bell to accompany the YouTube video. “Ladies, you are all my heroes.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronation Street’s Peter Barlow will save Yasmeen from jail and expose Geoff’s lies say fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CORRIE fans think Peter Barlow will save Yasmeen Nazir from prison after he notices she’s been showing some worrying behaviour.
It’s been a rollercoaster week on the cobbles as viewers have been left horrified by the abuse Yasmeen has experienced at the hands of her husband Geoff Metcalfe.
Fans watched from behind their cushions as Yasmeen finally snapped after months of terrifying abuse and stabbed Geoff in the neck with a broken wine bottle.
In spoilers for the long-running soap, it’s been revealed Yasmeen, played by Shelley King, will call the police be charged with attempted murder as street residents are left in shock at the news of the attack.
But fans think Peter, played by Chris Gascoyne, will come to her rescue and tell police he’s witnessed several displays of worrying behaviour from her.
One wrote: “…If you look in the last few episodes we had Sally, Eileen and Peter notice something wasn’t right but didn’t act. So maybe these are the people who will stick by Yasmeen.”
And another added: “i really hope peter and eileen are going to be allies to yasmeen in the coming weeks bc they seem to be the only people to have suspicions about geoff”
While a third guessed: “Calling for Peter being Yasmeen’s rescue…”
Earlier in the episode fans were horrified as Yasmeen was dragged out to the pub in a red dress that charmless Geoff had originally bought for a sex worker.
Geoff, played by Ian Bartholomew, took her to the Rovers to see Sally and Tim – before dropping the bombshell that he'd handed over her money to pay for their wedding.
Yasmeen was shocked that he'd handed over a fortune without consulting her, but Geoff barked: "You want to do this now? Get your coat. Shift. Don't you dare turn the waterworks on in here."
As she walked away from the bar the cameras lingered on Peter looking at her with concern, giving fans hope that he will realise something isn't adding up after Yasmeen's arrest
Away from prying eyes at No.6 viewers watched in horror as Geoff grabbed a knife and told Yasmeen: "Maybe I should kill you – do the world a favour. Would anyone really notice if you were gone?"
With that, she picked up a wine bottle and smashed abusive Geoff around the head before plunging the broken glass into his neck.
Peter has been keeping an eye on Yasmeen ever since Geoff told everyone she had a drinking problem earlier this year.
Fans are on the edge of their seats as they wait to see what happens, admitting they were “sucked in” by the plot.
One wrote: “I love when #corrie does episodes like this. They are just so well put together and engaging. Proper sucked in by this storyline of poor Yasmeen and they're going a fantastic job of it.”
Another added: “Lets go Yasmeen Thinking face Take that Geoff f**ker out preferably with a bullet bloody hard to watch #Corrie”
And a third wrote: “It was very disturbing to watch but i am glad that Yasmeen has fought back. However she will not deserve to be sent to prison for this, i hope tim, sally , peter and her friends will understand what has been going on. Think Eileen does. No one shoud go through that. Awful man”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spoilers: Corrie boss reveals all on Yasmeen and Geoff ending</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There have been some difficult decisions to be made throughout the long running storyline arc of Geoff Metcalfe’s (Ian Bartholomew) campaign of coercive abuse against Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King), according to Coronation Street boss Iain Macleod – but one thing he insists is that the recent twist that saw the horrific husband left for dead was planned for the start.
Viewers saw Geoff become more aggressive than ever and leave Yasmeen in terror of her life as he ranted horrific abuse and waved a knife in her face, suggesting it would be better for everyone if he just killed her.
In a relexive move to defend herself, a petrified Yasmeen stabbed Geoff in the neck and will be seen phoning the police to reveal that she has killed her husband.
It has been a deliberately slow paced story – and one that producer Iain admits has been the most debated over in the storyline office out of any plot.
He told Radio Times: ‘It’s been refined month by month in conjunction with our charity and research partners (including Women’s Aid). We’ve known pretty much from the start this incident would be one of the major peaks.
‘It’s been organically told and we’ve agonised over the advancement of how Geoff’s behaviour evolved.
‘It has been discussed in more detail than any other story I’ve worked on, just to make sure we get the nuance right.’
The storyline has come up for almost universal praise, with many in Yasmeen’s position having commended the show for its accurate portrayal of coercive control.
Iain added: ‘We don’t make it for this reason but it is important to have what I call good ‘drama karma’: what you’re putting on screen is karmically making the world little bit of a better place. I really think this story is.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Thornton reveals he shaved his signature beard with help from daughter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At a time when facial hair is growing unabashedly across a shut-down country, one of hockey’s most well-known beards has disappeared.
Sharks center Joe Thornton chopped off his beard for the first time in nearly two years, the team revealed in a video, which showed the before and after, with some help from his daughter, Ayla, who channeled “I Dream of Jeannie” to show the stunning change.
The 40-year-old Thornton started growing his graybeard during the 2015-16 season as he and Sharks defenseman Brent Burns became known for their matching looks, which they dubbed “lifestyle beards.” There was one slight interruption, when Burns shaved Thornton’s beard at a team party just before the 2018 season, but Thornton had spent every day since then growing it back.
“I regretted [shaving] as soon as it started hitting the floor,” Thornton told reporters in 2018. “Hopefully it’ll grow back quickly.”
Thornton’s son was not a fan of him clean-shaven at the time.
“My 5-year-old wasn’t happy this morning when he woke up,” Thornton said. “He didn’t want to see dad, so I’ve got to make it up to him.”
With the NHL’s season on pause because of the coronavirus pandemic, Thornton has some time to start growing his beard back in. He won’t need to worry about growing one for the playoffs, though — if there are playoffs — as the Sharks were in last place in the Western Conference at the time the season was suspended.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Thornton reveals he has shaved his iconic beard</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are a select few NHL players who you can pick out the moment they step on the ice. San Jose Sharks forward Joe Thornton is probably on top of that list, althoughthat might not be the case anymore.
The veteran center revealed in a video Saturday that he had shaved his iconic shaggy facial hair. It marks the first time he has been clean-shaven since the start of the 2018-19 season, when Sharks teammate Brent Burns did the honor of shaving Thornton's beard for him.
The video featured an initially bearded Thornton standing next to his daughter, Ayla. A few seconds in, she nods her head and it snaps to a now-beardless Thornton standing in the same place.
Thornton started growing out his facial hair during the 2015-16 season. His beard gained notoriety during the Sharks' run to the Stanley Cup Final that year when St. Louis Blues forward David Backes grabbed it during a squabble.
The beard was also damaged in early 2018 when Nazem Kadri of the Toronto Maple Leafspulled out a tuft of it during a fight.
While many people are choosing to grow out their facial hair during theircoronavirus quarantine, it seems Thornton has opted for the oppositeapproach. Hopefully, hockey returns before his beard has grown back too much.

“#JeetengeHum is just a small effort in keeping you all entertained and to keep your spirits high. Hope you all like it. Stay tuned for the song tomorrow,” she tweeted on Friday with her video.
In a separate tweet, she also mentioned the song has become really close to her heart.
“I have been working on this song for some time now and it has become really close to my heart. #JeetengeHum releasing tomorrow. Stay tuned,” she wrote.
Earlier, the “Vaaste” singer had donated Rs 50,000 to the Film and Television Producers Guild of India, for daily wage workers whose income has stopped due to the lockdown of the entertainment industry in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Sultry actress and musician, Edith Nelo Okafor, popularly known as Ednaco has defied all odds to release the video of her trending song “Carry on” amid the Coronavirus pandemic. According to her, it was a deliberate move to contribute her own quota to alleviate the gloom of the lockdown by bringing message of hope and love.
“It’s a motivational song I recorded in 2019. I felt this is the right time to drop it online due to what the world is facing today. The song is a reminder for people to keep pushing and hoping that things would get better because there’s no darkness without light and that applies to all of us and to life itself.
A lot of people have given up on all their dreams and ambitions, they stop bothering to make efforts.
They stop trying. Yes, we all know that life is and can be hard, making choices and choosing a path is hard, things can be gone in a heartbeat, setbacks occur, failure arises and losses happen, but we need to keep pushing and striving because at the end of the tunnel there is light. No matter what you are going through, there is light at the end of the tunnel,” she said in a chat with Showtime Bonus.

Ednaco revealed that she started singing in church at the age of six but took it seriously and went professional in 2016. She started as a duo with her brother and they were called Funstarz. They did a couple of songs and performed at shows together until the brother had to go for the National Youth Service Corps.
That broke up the act and broke her heart too. But the passion picked her up again, seeing her releasing her first official single in 2019 titled “Freaky” and the rest, as they say, is history.
“I chose music as a career because is my passion. I cannot escape it. It is a part of who I am. It has strengthened my understanding of people and their emotions. And I have come to realize that music is my calling in life and it must be nurtured correctly to be able to grow and change the world.
“Music has always been able to comfort and calm me in times of trouble, I would consider music to be more than passion. it’s more like a never-failing friend,” she declared.

    <h5 class="mb-1">7 prophesies of Prophet Jeremiah Fufeyin that has come to pass</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is often said that God has placed extraordinary vessels in our midst, and it takes an extraordinary encounter to announce them. Well, the widely venerated man of God, Prophet Jeremiah Fufeyin, is one of such vessels.
The billionaire prophet, 49-year-old Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin, who is also the founder and head prophet of Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry, has been quite popular in the news and on social media, most recently, for a shocking time-based prophecy, about the COVID-19 pandemic, that has found fruition.
On March 21st, the billionaire prophet prophesied that the deadly Coronavirus COVID-19 would meet its end in a month and a week (about 37 days), across the world. He predicted that the virus would gradually disappear across countries, just as it had spread gradually across countries, saying that it would leave ‘batch by batch’. He also stressed that in the stated time, the viral disease would start to go down gradually, with nations recording victories and easing their preventive measures. Note that this prophecy came a full week before Nigerians were addressed by the presidency and over a week before lockdown measures were enacted in Nigeria.

It is indeed a wonder to watch a prophecy unfold. A few days before the stipulated time, nations across the world started to record results, as the pandemic loses its virulent grip on humanity. A few examples of the confirmations of the prophecy were:
Have you heard all these wonderful Don Moen songs?
Amongst many other testimonies across different continents.
Needless to say, the Man of God, Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin is a true prophet of God, speaking as His Father gives him authority.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global Coronavirus pandemic disappearing as prophesied, Prophet Fufeyin declares</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
A Billionaire Prophet, who is the Founder and Head Prophet of Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry Jeremiah Fufeyin, yesterday said the journey to freedom from the global  outbreak of Corona Virus pandemic has started as the virus is disappearing globally exactly as he earlier prophesied.
Fufeyin, a philanthropist, who has donated millions of naira to the Federal Government, members of his church and the general public to assuage the pain caused by the pandemic stated that he had foreseen the current reopening of economies across the world, insisting that the virus would disappear from country to country as it came.
In a sermon and prophesies released earlier in March, Fufeyin had specifically stated that from  end of March till 28th April 2020, the virus would be seen to be gradually disappearing from one nation to another the same way it came as a result of his prayers of mercy and that of believers from around the world.
He stated clearly that between that day and a month and one week later the virus would be seen to be disappearing from the face of the earth in the same manner it started from one country to another while economies would gradually open up.
In a release made available to journalists yesterday by the church, the clergy linked the current easing of lockdown across continents and indeed Africa to the vision he had received from God, raising the hope of freedom for people across the world.
Recall that in Germany, South Africa, Nigeria, China, U.S, Kenya and most countries of the world, governments have announced easing of lockdown as well as a number of cure for the pandemic, which had ravaged the world since late last year.
The 49 year old Billionaire Prophet, described in the release as God’s extraordinary vessels for this generation noted that the viral disease would start to go down gradually, with nations recording victories and easing their preventive measures.
Talking specifically about Nigeria, the release said: “Note that this prophecy came a full week before Nigerians were addressed by the Presidency, and over a week before lockdown measures were enacted in Nigeria.
Drawing up a timeline of victories recorded across world, the church noted on April 21, 2020, Swiss authorities announced plans to ease their lockdown measures after recording positive success in managing the pandemic.
“On April 21, 2020, a West African country, Mauritiana, was declared COVID-19 free, after recording 6 recoveries and one death.
“April 21,2020, Italy, one of the worst hit countries, recorded its lowest number of deaths, since March 19, 2020, and a fall in active cases.
“On April 22, 2020, activities resumed in Hamburg- Germany after a long term lockdown. Return to school had also been announced, and trade is back in full swing.
There was jubilation on the streets of Dubai as authorities eased almost 2 months lockdown measures, after recording zero COVID- 19 cases in some areas.
“Madagascar launched Africa’s first preventive treatment, and effective cure for the COVID-19 disease, “COVID ORGANICS”, and even made it compulsory for school children returning to schools.
“On April 27, 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari announced the imminent easing of strict lockdown restrictions in most states in Nigeria,” the release stated.

As Pitchfork points out, a press release states, “The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Nigerian singer, songwriter and music enthusiast, Ogundayomi Olawale, famously known as Playboycasted, does not only make music for fame or money but to keep the world a better and safer place for everybody.
For somebody whose music career started at the age of 9 as a church chorister, Playboycasted knew what he wanted to make out of life and has remained truthful to himself and craft over the years.
Speaking in an interview during the week, Playboycasted who loves to rap recalled how he released his first rap single: “Shemi” among other freestyles as back as 2013.
He would later bag four awards as a rapper at the SLIC Campus recognition awards, held yearly at the Gateway ICT Polytechnic, where he obtained Ordinary National Diploma (OND) in Mass Communication.
He showed the world a glimpse of what to expect when in 2017, he released series of singles including his official single “Mapamilekun”, a song widely regarded as one in a lifetime inspirational hit. This was followed by a street anthem, “Rollercoaster” and another collaboration with former YBNL star Lyta, in the song entitled “Success”.
With a newly released EP, “Top Boy”, the singer hinted that there was more to come from him as he continues to push his music career to a new level and showing many music lovers what they may have been missing.
Laced with Afro-fusion sounds that appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of African ladies across the continent, the EP has songs like No Yawa, Person, Oremi Ti, Governor, Be There, Shayo, Holla and Enough as the singer attempted to create something unique in his own way.
“I want to give something magical to every music lover and I also want to remind my audience that there is life beyond the current situation they may be grappling with. This is a piece of music and body of work for everybody.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 10-year-old guitarist wowed the judges on Britain’s Got Talent with Chuck Berry’s classic Johnny Be Good.
In an unseen clip from the ITV talent show, we meet little rock star, Joseph Sheppard who had the crowd eating out the palm of his hand.
Before his audition, Simon Cowell complimented his hair while Amanda Holden commented on his ‘great style’.
Donning a leather jacket and his guitar Joseph asked the audience: ‘Are you ready to rock Manchester?’
And it’s safe to say no one expected him to perform the way he did.
Joseph got fantastic feedback from the judges after his audition as Simon said: ‘Let’s go to the rock expert on the panel, David.’
‘You are so cool, such a little dude and you’re very very skilled I mean that is not easy to sing and play the guitar like that,’ David Walliams commented.
‘I think you’re going to be a huge star well done.’
Alesha Dixon added: ‘I was so impressed, your stage performance was fantastic, the way you owned it in front of all these people.’
While Amanda continued: ‘You are the complete package here, that was a brill audition.’
And of course, Simon Cowell had the last word as he said: ‘Very good Joseph that was a great audition, going forward in five years time where do you see yourself?’
Joseph simply replied: ‘Hopefully quite famous.’
Other acts that wowed the judges on Saturday night’s instalment were 96-year-old Nora and a group of dancing turtles.
And not forgetting Amanda Holden’s golden buzzer act, which was Honey and Sammy, a mother a daughter act from Essex.
Britain’s Got Talent returns on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent viewers are in for a treat with a dazzling dance performance from Ezekiel and Carl on tonight's show.
The Filipino dance partners stunned judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon with their high-energy ballroom performance.
In a teaser of the BGT action, the duo donned an incredible feather-laced ball gown and a sequin suit as they spoke to the excited crowd.
"So what made you want to perform on Britain's Got Talent?"  Amanda asked the dancers.
"We really want to perform in front of the British royal family," they explained.
Kicking off their dance routine to Tina Turner's Proud Mary, both Ezekiel and Carl stripped off layers of their outfits before heading into their big exciting reveal.
As the music tempo picks up speed, one of the dancers heads into a mind-bending amount of twirls across the stage.
His purple number dramatically changes into the rainbow pride flag colours as they pull out all the stops for their dancing.
The crowd erupts with applause over the heart-warming and positive performance as the judges clap along to the recognisable tune.
Ezekiel and Carl have not the only impressive dance couple to grace the stage during this year's show.
Last week, the judges were stunned by Birmingham-based contemporary dance performers Chantelle, 12, and Billy, 14.
When quizzed by the judges about what they would do with the prize money, Chantelle explained: "Well I would bring home my family from the Philippines because they've never seen me dance before."
The young duo received a standing ovation for their stunning dance choreography.
Britain's Got Talent continues tonight, 8pm on ITV, followed by Britain's Got Talent Unseen on the ITV Hub.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle Is Reportedly Preparing To Relaunch A Lifestyle Blog</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Anna Harnes
Royal insiders are claiming that Meghan Markle is about to launch a new lifestyle website as part of her life as living as a non-royal. The royal gossip come as the Sussexes have begun their life outside of the royal family after formally leaving on March 31. The two have since moved to Los Angeles with their son, Archie.
According to Page Six, royal expert Myka Meier claimed that she believed that the duchess was soon goinging to revamp her online and social media presence.
“I think Meghan is going to have another Instagram,” Meier said on the Royally Obsessed podcast last week. “I think she’s going to do a Goop, like a new version of The Tig … I really think that’s coming.”
The Tig was Markle’s lifestye blog that she ran for close to three years. The website covered things like food, fashion, and travel. However, Markle decided to end her work on the blog in April 2017, and was seen as one of the surest signs that her relationship with Prince Harry was about to progress into an engagement.
Meier added that she had spoken to a close friend of the duchess who not only confirmed the claims about a new lifestyle blog, but also suggested that Markle had already started working on her project.
“I have a friend with a little bit of insider knowledge, and I think she’s already working on something,” Meier claimed.
“I think we will be seeing something very interesting and creative with masterminds from all over the world coming together to bring something inspiring soon,” she finished.
Though Markle technically closed down The Tig, royal fans have noted that she still maintains the domain name and that it is likely the blog could be revived. Currently, the url directs to a page where the duchess wrote a goodbye note to her fans.
Moreover, her passion for the blog was evident in her farewell note on the website.
“What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity,” she wrote before thanking her fans for “everything.”
The duchess has recently been in the news after pledging to continue her lawsuit against The Mail On Sunday.
As was previously reported by The Inquisitr, Markle is currently suing the paper for publishing parts of a “private and confidential” letter she sent to her father shortly after her wedding to Prince Harry. However, the most recent ruling did not fall in her favor, and the presiding judge in her case struck out a number of her arguments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle 'to bring back lifestyle blog' to rival Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Meghan Markle has got some big plans now she's stepped down as a senior royal and living her old showbiz life in LA, it's claimed.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, is said to be bringing back her successful lifestyle blog The Tig in a bid to be the next Gwyneth Paltrow, who runs the similar website Goop.
Meghan shut her blog down in 2017 a year after she started dating Prince Harry, though it's still live with her goodbye message to her followers.
Royal expert Myka Meier has suggested the former Suits actress is working on bringing back a version of The Tig, which covered food, travel, fashion and beauty.
"I think Meghan is going to have another Instagram," Myka told podcast Royally Obsessed last week.
"I think she’s going to do a goop, like a new version of The Tig.
"I really think that’s coming."
Meg could follow in Gwyn's footsteps after the huge success of Goop, which has a similar theme.
Myka added: "I'm pretty sure there's a goopish thing coming soon, for a few different reasons.
"I have a friend with a little bit of insider knowledge and I think she’s already working on something.
"I think we will be seeing something very interesting and creative with masterminds from all over the world coming together to bring something inspiring soon."
Since stepping down as a senior royal Meghan has already narrated Disney Plus documentary Elephants.
Meanwhile, Prince Harry will be introducing the 75th-anniversary episode of Thomas the Tank Engine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner drives fans wild with '3D booty' pose in strikingly curvy photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner drove fans wild with an end of week photo shoot in her new multimillion dollar mansion as she prepared to embrace the weekend in lockdown.
The 22-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star drew attention to her curves as she threw ambitious shapes while cosied up to a palm tree in her back yard.
Wearing an orange and white skirt and matching strapless, midriff baring top, Kylie won praise, approval and desire from her legions of followers as she posed in a way that drew attention to her derrière.
Taking to Instagram to upload the snaps, Kylie captioned the photographs with the simple statement: “happy Friday,” alongside an orange heart emoji.
Fans were left with their jaws dropping open – with many making comments about her impressive figure in the comments section with one typing: “Bombass” alongside fire emojis.
While many others were drawn to her posterior, with one fan commenting: “Call that a 3D booty cos one can see it from all dimensions.”
Another fan expressed concern about the exerted pose the reality star was pulling, warning: “you’re going to break your back.”
And a further fan expressed sheer disbelief, writing: I don’t even Recognize that girl who is it?”
Kylie was posing in the back garden of her new home which she recently snapped up for £29 million.
The seven bedroom, 14 bathroom, property boasts plenty of outdoor space – with a pool, tennis courts, and palm trees amid the impressive grounds.
Kylie's latest jaw dropping snaps come just days after fans accused her of photoshopping some of her images.
Some followers shared suspicions after an image of Kylie in her swimming pool displayed mismatched tiling - suggesting the image had been manipulated.
One commented: "Had time to screen the pic you now deleted you posted on your IG...what a fail #fail#photoshop#KylieJenner..."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
Canadian model Khloe Terae recently took to her Instagram page and wowed her 2.3 million fans with a very hot post.
In the pic, which was uploaded to the photo0-sharing platform on Friday, May 1, Khloe could be seen rocking a very sparkly gray lingerie set, one that allowed her to show off a glimpse of her cleavage and underboob. That’s not all, but the racy ensemble also enabled her to put her sexy legs on full display. A pair of sparkly gray wings were also added to her attire with the help of a photo-editing tool.
In keeping with her glamorous attire, Khloe sported a full face of makeup. The application included a dewy foundation that gave her skin a flawless finish. She dusted her cheeks with a pink blush, opted for a nude lipstick, nude eyeshadow, heavily lined eyes, and a thick coat of mascara. Khloe finished off her makeup application with well-defined, dark eyebrows and nose contouring. She also had her perfectly-manicured nails painted with a nude polish.
She wore her blond tresses in romantic waves and allowed them to cascade over her shoulders. In terms of jewelry, she opted for a pair of sparkly stud earrings, multiple rings, and two sparkly bracelets, one in each wrist.
To strike a pose, she sat next to a wall and rested her arm against it. She tilted her head, sported a pout, and gazed at the camera.
In the caption, Khloe wrote that May is her favorite month because she was born in the same month. She also tagged her makeup artist Andrew Saint Andrew, photographer Brian B Hayes, and the photo-editing service Edit Collagee for acknowledgment.
Within five hours of going live, the snap garnered more than 7,600 likes. Her fans also took to the comments section and posted more than 270 messages to praise Khloe for her hotness.
“Hopefully, you’ll post a lot of tasteful birthday suit pics then,” one of her fans enthused.
“There aren’t enough words to describe how beautiful you look, always lifting my spirits whenever I’m having a bad day,” another user chimed in.
“You are the supreme Canadian goddess. So beautiful!” a third admirer remarked.
Meanwhile, a fourth follower praised the model’s hot figure.
“Amazing body! You are the absolute example of perfect beauty,” they wrote.
The snap was also liked by many other models and influencers, including Jessica Cribbon, CJ Sparxx, Brooke Evers, Eden Levine, and Kindly Myers.
Khloe posts her sexy pics to tease her legions of followers almost every week. Only a day ago, she shared multiple pics in which she rocked tiny pajamas set with no bra, showing off some major skin.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Casualty episode scrapped by BBC over Covid-19 - but fans want missing episode</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of medical drama Casualty want a missing episode made available on BBC iPlayer.
The episode was due to be shown this weekend but was scrapped by the BBC due to 'inappropriate' content during the current coronavirus pandemic.
An announcement before last night's instalment said: "The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of Covid-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment."
The episode that aired on Saturday night instead included a short catch-up that filled viewers in on scenes from the major storylines that they will have missed due to the transmission of the preceding instalment being skipped.
The announcer continued before it started: "But never fear. everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch up right at the start of the programme."
However, the short recap before this weekend's episode wasn't enough for some fans, who have now taken to social media calling for the BBC to make the missing instalment available on their catch-up service, BBC iPlayer.
One fan wrote on Twitter : "I assumed I’d missed one so checked iPlayer but no. Turns out the BBC decided to cut it!
"Please put it on iPlayer so I can decide whether to watch it!!"
Another disappointed viewer commented: "Can't they just put it on iplayer then? Gives people a choice on whether they want to watch or not! #casualty "
Elsewhere, a third Casualty fan commented: "That missing episode of #Casualty looks great. Bonkers decision not to show it.
"I understand the reasoning but I disagree with it."
Another Twitter user thought the missing episode could have helped give some viewers a realistic look at what we're all currently facing.
They tweeted: "Deemed inappropriate? Maybe show the episode and give people the reality check they need to keep them in the bloody house #casualty."
Finally, one Casualty viewer concluded: "Hope they put the missing episode on iPlayer.
"I get they didn't want to show it and the white suits on the preview suggest a virus situation but I still wanna watch it! We've missed a massive Marty storyline! #Casualty "
Regardless of whether the BBC do eventually make the episode available to fans, Casualty will now be on a break until May 23 when it will return with its next episode.
Casualty returns to BBC One later this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Casualty fans confused as BBC skips an 'inappropriate episode'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Casualty viewers were confused last night when the BBC skipped an episode it called "inappropriate".
Fans had been expecting to watch a gripping episode culminating with a showdown between Ethan and Will - but instead it was replaced by a catch-up and the following week's episode.
The extended preview at the start was designed to fill in the gaps on what fans would've seen in the axed episode.
A voiceover announcer said: "The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of COVID-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment.
"But never fear, everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch-up right at the start of the programme."

However glimpses of the episode from the preview showed characters dressed in full protective gear, suggesting an epidemic style storyline.
Such a plot would too closely mirror real life events with the current pandemic.
But that didn't stop fans being confused about what was going on.
And they were still desperate to see the missing episode.
One said: "Really, really disappointed at the missing episode of #Casualty, especially when it’s so pivotal to current storylines.
"The showdown between Will and Ethan would have been great to see 😢 #Casualty @BBCCasualty"
A second said: "#casualty I would have liked to have seen that episode."
A third said: "I really wanted to see the episode that they skipped #Casualty."
It comes after BBC controller Piers Wenger admitted Casualty is unlikely to resume filming soon.
Speaking at an Edinburgh TV Festival online Q&A, he said: "We do have to abide by the rules and while social distancing is in place it is going to be difficult.

"There are ways of cheating, actors being close enough together to interact in a scene."
He added: "We’re not quite at that point yet.
"But all of those conversation are being had and there is a real determination to get that show back up and running."

    <h5 class="mb-1">12 Movie Stars You Probably Forgot Appeared on “Sex and the City”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The adventures of Carrie Bradshaw and her 3 best friends first premiered on our screens in 1998. Sex and the City quickly found success and featured numerous guest stars, some of which were only starting on their path in Hollywood.
Bright Side looked back at the iconic show and discovered many celebrities we had no idea were on it. We invite you to take a stroll down memory lane with us and perhaps you’ll find a few surprises in the mix.
Appeared in: season 2, episode 4
Cooper played Jake, Carrie Bradshaw’s love interest after a failed photo-shoot brought her self-esteem way down.
Appeared in: season 2, episode 15
Theroux perfectly embodied the awkward writer, Vaughn, who went out with Carrie several times. And all could’ve ended well if she hadn’t hit it off better with his mother than with him.
Appeared in: season 3, episode 2
In an if-you-blink-too-fast-you’ll-miss-it moment, Elizabeth played a helpful party guest who gave a distressed Charlotte some much-needed dating advice.

The charismatic Vaughn was lucky enough to be Carrie’s fun fling while in LA, but she quickly discovered he was actually a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
Appeared in: season 3, episode 15
Dennings portrayed a 13-year-old socialite who made Samantha run around New York trying to throw her a perfect birthday party.
Appeared in: season 1, episode 4
In season 1, Carrie was still torn between dating older men and having fun with twenty-something-year-old guys. Olyphant’s character helped her say goodbye to younger men once and for all.
Appeared in: season 3, episode 13
Gellar made a noticeable cameo when she played Carrie’s loud agent Debbie who tried to get her to sign a movie deal based on her life.
Appeared in: season 6, episode 10
Duchovny appeared as Carrie’s high school boyfriend she kept having second thoughts about. Their reunion brought back old feelings and new discoveries.
Appeared in: season 4, episode 2
Klum played herself as she strutted down the runway alongside Carrie in an empowering fashion show.
Appeared in: season 4, episode 11
Liu also made a cameo as an exaggerated version of herself who contemplated hiring Samantha as her main PR person.
Appeared in: season 6, episode 3
Coolidge gave our 4 main ladies a hard time when she invited them to her party that turned out to be an excuse to sell her unusual purses.
Appeared in: season 3, episode 13
McConaughey had a lot of fun playing a version of himself who wanted to become Mr. Big in a movie adaptation of Carrie’s life.
When was the last time you revisited the show? Do you remember any of these stars who made brief appearances?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who knew Hollyoaks' Nancy Osbourne was in The Worst Witch?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Worst Witch is dropping on BritBox next week, ready to give us a dose of nostalgia during lockdown.
The ITV series aired back in 1998, and followed a group of young witches who attended Miss Cackle’s school for magic. 
Basically Harry Potter in TV show form.
We were so keen to have the OG magic crew on our screens once more that we delved into old episodes – and noticed a very famous face walking around the halls.
Who knew, years before Nancy popped up in Hollyoaks, she was causing chaos in a witch academy?
Actress Jessica Fox starred as Mildred Hubble’s (Georgina Sherrington) best pal Enid Nightshade, who played all kinds of practical jokes on the gang in the hopes of fitting in.
Basically, she was the fun one of the group.
Chatting to Metro.co.uk, Jessica recalled some of her favourite moments from the show – which aired until 2001.
‘It was a really, really fun thing to film. We had such a good time doing it,’ she told us. ‘There was always something mad happening.
‘I loved it when anything got blown up, I found that really exciting. Enid was very naughty, she was always getting into trouble and doing naughty things.
‘I think she blew something up, or she signed off-key on purpose and smashed bottles. And I just remember they had little explosives, and they were made out of a special glass that shatters if you just touch it.
‘Everything was just exploding around me, I remember thinking that was really, really cool.’
It sounds like her time on set for the Worst Witch really set Jessica up well for Hollyoaks – especially with everything blowing up around her.
And, as the 36-year-old faces a major milestone in Chester, she’s thrilled to have another career high to look back on with the ITV series appearing on BritBox.
‘It’s actually really nice,’ she continued. ‘Obviously I’m on Hollyoaks and it will be 15 years this year, it feels like there’s lots of looking back for me at the moment, because there’s quite a lot of milestones happening.
‘It’s nice to revisit and remember all the things that you’ve done. 
‘I was really lucky I started working when I was really little, about seven or eight. It’s nice to look at your back catalogue, and think, “Gosh, didn’t I do a lot?”.’
‘I know that from when people speak to me, their eyes always light up and they go, “I loved the Worst Witch!”,’ she added.
‘It’ll be really nice to hear that again, really. It’s always nice to be told that the programmes you were in were loved.’
The Worst Witch is available on BritBox from 7th May. Visit www.britbox.co.uk to sign up for a 30 day free trial.
