    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Bloomberg expands influence network within Democratic party</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spent almost a billion dollars to try to win the Democratic nomination but his audacious bid ended with victory only in tiny American Samoa.
That embarrassing defeat was held up by some critics as proof it is still hard to use spending power alone to win a US election. But Bloomberg’s enormous wealth and influence is still strong in the party via a growing network of groups, former associates and allies sprinkled across the Democratic party universe.
Even before Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race in May the media mogul billionaire vowed he would work to defeat Donald Trump even if he didn’t get the nomination.
That’s precisely what he is doing.
“He was one of the biggest contributors to Democratic causes before he ran and he still is after,” Abe Rakov, a veteran Democratic campaign manager, said of Bloomberg. “There are a lot of organizations and programs across the country that would be in really bad shape if he decided to disengage after he ran.”
The initial plan was to continue to fuel the massive field operation Bloomberg’s campaign built. The former mayor changed his mind and instead transferred $18m to the Democratic National Committee, the main organization charged with boosting the party’s presidential nominee.
It’s possible Bloomberg could move more money as well. The Bloomberg campaign also transferred leases for over a dozen of its field offices to the DNC, adding to the DNC’s campaign spaces around the country.
Bloomberg himself is staying visible, working with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, to launch a testing and tracing program. He spoke via video conference call during Cuomo’s press briefing on Thursday. The governor, currently one of the most prominent Democrats in the country, said in late April that Bloomberg was working with him.
A network of operatives and Bloomberg-connected political organizations is also active in Democratic presidential circles. Bill Knapp, a longtime Bloomberg adviser, recently joined Priorities USA, the Super Pac the Joe Biden campaign has signaled is its outside organization of choice for the general election.
During Bloomberg’s campaign, he poured almost $67m into a new digital and technology firm called Hawkfish. Hawkfish has stayed active since Bloomberg dropped out. The firm is reportedly in talks to work for Biden’s presidential campaign although nothing is finalized.
Hawkfish also got into negotiations to buy another Democratic analytics firm, Blue Labs Analytics, according to four Democrats with knowledge of those talks, but negotiations fell through. Hawkfish and Blue Labs still have ties.
In Washington Democratic analytics circles Hawkfish has become a hot topic as a firm trying to elbow its way into the group of top-tier data analytics firms.
The business discussions between Hawkfish and various campaigns and outlets within the Democratic campaign universe underscores how Bloomberg-connected operatives and groups continue to set down deep roots within the party.
Some former digital and data staffers for the Bloomberg campaign have talked with Biden campaign officials about joining the campaign, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those talks.
The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.
“I think Mayor Bloomberg has made it very plain, through his actions and his investments, his commitment to defeating Donald Trump and helping to elect Democrats across the country,” said the former Michigan congressman Mark Schauer, who supported Bloomberg during the mayor’s short-lived presidential campaign. “I think those contributions are valuable, they’re significant, and they’ll have an impact this November.”
The end goal for Bloomberg, 78, is still somewhat murky.
The former mayor has repeatedly said he would use his considerable resources to oust Trump from office. But the rapid expansion of Bloomberg-connected groups and operatives around Washington also suggests Bloomberg intends to hold a seat at the table among the most influential Democratic party leaders, albeit one outside of elected office.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mum defends smoking weed around her kids as it makes her have 'stress-free days'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mother-of-two has defended smoking cannabis while looking after her children.
Caitlin Fladagar is a regular smoker of weed at her home in Vancouver, Canada, where recreational use is legal.
The 26-year-old is so taken by smoking herbal cigarettes that she has a jumper professing her enthusiasm for the pursuit.
It reads: "First I smoke weed then I do things."
Caitlin was wearing the garment out to a supermarket when a cashier took issue with her lifestyle choice.
She later took to Facebook to defend her baking habit.
“Yes, I have smoked before when my kids are awake. No, that doesn’t make me a bad parent," she wrote.
“I remember the first time I wore this sweater out in public. I was at the mall, surrounded by tank tops that said ‘I’m a wine mom’ and ‘nothing gets done until my wine glass is empty’.
“But my sweater, was definitely the one of the most looked at things, probably because I had my two young kids with me.
“I had one cashier say to me ‘do you think it’s safe to get high with your kids?’
“It took me by surprise. It made me wonder. Why every time someone thinks of weed, they must be getting high and not being able to function.
“When I smoke while my kids are up, which is rare, but it has happened, it is to calm myself. Not to get high, or to lay on the couch all day.”
Caitlin believes that the drug has helped her become a better mother.
She continued: “Marijuana has so many other benefits besides the ones you see in the movies.
“It has helped me immensely with being a more patient mother, it has helped me gain the weight I needed to, and it has helped my insomniac self, get some well needed sleep at night.
“Smoking while your kids are awake doesn’t make you a bad parent.
“Some people don’t smoke just to get high. You don’t have to smoke a ton every time.
“It doesn’t make you lay on the couch all day, and ignore you kids.
“So, yeah, I’m a mom of two, and I have smoked while my kids are awake, and you know what? Those are the most relaxed, stress free days my kids and I have.
“Sincerely, a pretty kick ass mom who smokes a lot of weed.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennis takes a swing at making players’ earnings fairer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andrea Gaudenzi knows the glories and struggles of professional tennis. The Italian player scored victories against Roger Federer and Pete Sampras, two of the game’s greatest champions, before retiring in 2003. The financial gains were not as good as those career-defining wins, though.
“It is a bit of an elite sport,” he said. “I was mad when I was playing because you look at soccer players in the second league in Italy. They were making more and I was in the top 20 in the world.”
Mr Gaudenzi is now in a position to alter that balance. Last year, he was appointed new chair of ATP, the body in charge of men’s tennis. Alongside other tennis organisations, it is preparing a multimillion-dollar relief fund to prop up hundreds of players suffering a steep loss of income as tournaments have been shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Even before the Covid-19 outbreak halted matches, many tennis players were struggling financially.
Big sponsorship deals for stars such as Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams place them among the world’s highest-earning athletes. However, the vast majority of professional players below them rely on prize money won from a gruelling and expensive tour of tournaments worldwide. 
Of the top 500 male and female players, the elite group of tennis players in the world, the annual median income for men is $124,000 and $80,000 for women. But the sport’s wealth flows towards those at the top. 
About a quarter of professional female players make less than $25,000, below the median salaries of workers in Latvia, Greece and Chile, according to the OECD. 
Meanwhile, a quarter of professional male players make less than $40,000 a year from prize money, roughly equivalent to the wages of a secretary or a truck driver in the US, according to the US Bureau of Labor statistics. 
These earnings do not factor in costs, such as paying for coaching, equipment and year-round travel expenses. An injury that takes a player out of the game for months can be a devastating financial hit.
Reaching one of the sport’s four annual Grand Slams — the most prestigious and lucrative tournaments — is crucial to a player’s prospects in continuing on the tour. In 2019, the 128 men and women who lost in the first round of Wimbledon each earned £45,000. Last year’s men’s singles winner, Novak Djokovic and ladies’ champion Simona Halep, took away £2.35m each.
The ATP and Grand Slam organisers have responded, steadily increasing the amount of prize money available to players over recent years. There have been larger percentage increases for those knocked out in the early stages of tournaments.
Mr Gaudenzi insists that tennis should be a meritocracy; the better a player is, the more they earn. But he says the coronavirus-induced crisis is resulting in a larger rethink of the sport’s financial inequalities. 
“The winner of the tournament needs to earn more than the first round loser,” he said, but added: “You can redistribute the pie more evenly.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Simon Cowell's golden buzzer Fayth reveals 'struggles' with negative comment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent singer Fayth Ifel has opened up about her struggles with ‘negative comments’ in the past.
The 12-year-old mesmerised everyone as she took to the BGT stage with a spirited rendition of the Tina Turner classic Proud Mary.
And Simon Cowell was equally stunned as he pressed his golden buzzer for Fayth sending her straight to the semi-finals.
The student, who has performed on the West End stage before shared with the judges that her confidence had been by knocked by ‘negative energy’ in the past.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk about it, Fayth explained: ‘I’ve struggled in the past and received negative comments. I’ve learnt how to overcome this negativity and it has made me a stronger person.
‘I have the support of my parents and use my music to try and empower myself and others around me.’
After Fayth’s performance, Simon also shared his own experience of negativity growing up.
Referring to her struggle to fit in, he told her: ‘Enjoy every moment. I asked the question if you’ve ever had any negativity because when I grew up I had that as well. The most important thing is they never get to you.’
‘I had that as well,’ Simon shared. ‘And the most important thing is when you’re good as you are – you win.
‘If anyone ever says anything negative…remember this moment.’
And ahead of her stunning audition, Fayth admitted that she was hoping to impress the music-mogul the most.
‘He is the most honest person ever and an absolute legend,’ she continued.
‘It was such a surreal moment I never ever thought he would press his golden buzzer.’
Fayth has become the third Golden Buzzer so far for the series.
Joining her in the live semi-finals will be children’s choir Sign With Us and comedian Jon Courtenay.
With Simon, David Walliams and Ant and Dec choosing their acts, only Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden are left to choose.
Britain’s Got Talent continues next Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">LONG READ: How Dundee United’s class of 1990 came good – both on and off the pitch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jim McLean speaking to the Evening Telegraph in the wake of the club’s maiden BP Scottish Youth Cup win, 30 years ago this week.
The team from 1990 McLean was critiquing starred Christian Dailly, Duncan Ferguson, Andy McLaren and Gary Bollan.
The legendary United boss saw their talents and knew he could go in heavy on them. For those in possession of less star quality, it was a desire to be proven wrong that motivated McLean’s strong words.
His vexing of them was perhaps born from having watched them lose in the final of the same tournament to Celtic the year before, in 1989.
Paul Sturrock’s young side would win through in the new decade, however, and even repeated the feat in 1991. Despite what McLean’s comments may indicate, that was much to his delight.
The Class of 1990 were Stuart Garden, Tom McMillan, Eddie Conville, Pat Clark, Stephen McInulty, McLaren, John Lindsay, Gary Mearns, Bollan, Ferguson, Dailly, Gordon Parks and Grant Johnson.
They were a talented bunch, each with a different, more interesting story to tell than the last, and all of them were, at that time, in McLean’s thoughts and plans.
Ferguson, Garden, McMillan, Mearns and McInulty would miss out on repeat Youth Cup glory in 1991 but David Hannah, Gary Arbuckle, Graeme McCheyne, Peter Prior and Gregor Benvie stepped in to form another winning team.
Hibs were their victims in both finals – first a 4-2 win on penalties after a stalemate at Easter Road, with Bollan, Clark, Dailly and Johnson netting from the spot. A 2-0 victory at Tannadice followed in 1991 thanks to goals from Lindsay and Bollan.
Of McLean’s Babes, Dailly, McLaren, Bollan and Hannah were all part of one of United’s greatest-ever days – their first Scottish Cup win, clinched thanks to a 1-0 defeat of Rangers at Hampden on May 21, 1994.
The careers enjoyed by the stars of his young side speak for themselves, but the truth is that wee Jim believed in each of that crop.
The frustration felt in his words at the beginning of this piece was not just with hot prospects like Dailly or Bollan but also the likes of injury-stricken right-back, McMillan, and talented midfielder, Lindsay.
They may not have ‘made it’ in the game or enjoyed the fame of a ‘Christian’ or a ‘Big Dunc’ but theirs were careers and lives which found success elsewhere – in part down to McLean’s ethos.
The Tangerines’ 1983 league-winning manager was ahead of the curve in many ways, not least in terms of youth development and creating a pathway into the top team.
He employed Kenny Cameron to scour the east coast for the best young talent and Graeme Liveston similarly in the west. The latter enjoyed 25 years with the Terrors from 1984 to 2009 and he remembers the Class of 90 as the best he worked with.
“It definitely was,” the 72-year-old asserts.
“At that time, the main clubs for developing players and getting them through to that level were Dundee United and Aberdeen, not Rangers and Celtic.
“We were miles ahead of them, just like the first teams were in the 1980s.
“In terms of youth development we were the best and I was competing with Aberdeen for players in the west of Scotland.
“We had a good reputation and always got loads of players to come up. Kenny Cameron always made sure we got the best players from the Dundee area like Gary Bollan and John Lindsay.
“We had to compete to get players in the west like Andy McLaren and Tom McMillan. Big Dunc and Christian Dailly were pretty much straight into Jim’s first team. It was like a conveyor belt.
“Christian was excellent but Gary was a top player, too, and he and Andy quickly followed him into the first team at a very young age.They all played quite a lot of games and were very well thought of players at that time.
“Grant Johnson, too. That shows the level of our team that we had him on the bench for the 1990 final.”
In fact, Liveston believes McLean’s reach wasn’t limited to Dundee United and he may have had unknowing input into the more famous Manchester United Class of 92.
The likes of David Beckham, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, bred by former Dons boss Sir Alex Ferguson, became European champions and even had a hit documentary made about them.
That’s a far cry from the trajectory of McLean’s kids, but some parallels between the two bosses’ approaches are clear.
“Jim and Fergie were ahead of the curve. They knew they needed to get young players into the first team,” Liveston continued.
“They were the first ones to really do it. The credit goes to Jim for our success, there’s no question about that.
“Walter Smith, who was the assistant for some of his time, was very much involved in some young talent being developed, too. Wee Jim was the man, though. If he wasn’t there we wouldn’t have been in that situation.
“You look at Fergie’s famous Class of 92 at Manchester United. He applied the same principles down there.
“He realised, just like wee Jim did, that getting young players into your team was the way forward. Apparently when they went on their first coaching course at Largs together, Jim and Fergie shared a room.
“They were great pals and rivals, too, and I think part of that was down to having similar views on developing talent.
“Who knows what was said or went on in those two weeks but there was a great mutual respect there, for sure.”
Despite Dailly going on to star for West Ham and win 67 Scotland caps and Ferguson achieving legend status at Everton, Liveston fondly remembers right-back ‘Tommy’ McMillan.
McMillan, alongside Bollan, McLaren, Conville and Lindsay, were selected for Scotland’s 1989 U/16 World Cup squad who, led by Craig Brown, lost the final to an infamous Saudi Arabia ‘youth’ side in front of 50,000 at Hampden.
Lindsay, who later went on to Arbroath, would score twice in that tournament but it was always McMillan who stood out for Liveston.
“Tommy was definitely one of the best but it was an injury which did him in,” he added.
“He, like most of them, went full-time but got a bad knee injury. He was one of my boys, from Falkirk. In fact, he comes from California, a village outside Falkirk.
“That one always looked good on the teamsheet but California was just a wee mining village!
“He would’ve made it but was just so unfortunate. You sign a lot of players so for them to even get to that level was good, even with wee Jim in charge.
“He was good at promoting players. There was no doubt about that, some managers were different, but for Jim it didn’t matter what age they were.
“Players, eventually, reach the level they can play at. They may be brilliant at 18 but they’re not good enough to play in your first team or good Premiership players but can’t make it for Scotland.
“There’s always a limit, a point where players can’t get beyond.
“Gary Mearns was a Dundee boy, didn’t maybe ‘make it’ but had a good career at Forfar and Brechin.
“Stephen McInulty had a great junior career for a long time at a good level, it wasn’t Mickey Mouse level these boys ended up at.
“In fact, when I was at Alloa’s academy, Tommy’s nephew was there and Tam used to bring him along. He’s a millionaire now, apparently! That’s what people say. Catering has been good to him then!”
Bollan, now manager at Cowdenebath, fondly recalls his youth days at United and the obvious quality of Dailly, Ferguson et al.
However, he believes businessman, McMillan, sports writer, Parks, and NHS front-line worker, Conville, prove their side went on to be special off the pitch, too.
“Duncan and Christian ended up down south of course but David Hannah and Andy McLaren were magnificent,” the 47-year-old former defender said.
“Big Dunc didn’t feature as much before the Youth Cup but managed to go on and flourish in his later teens.
“That was about the time when Dunc was making his mark which goes to show you can develop at a later stage.
“There were a few others in there who went on to do good things as well like Grant Johnson. It was a great youth set-up with some real good players coming through at that time.
“There were other youth internationalists at the time like Tommy, Eddie and John who were all at the U/16 World Cup in 1989 with Andy and I.
“Those guys had real bad injuries at an early age but have all gone on to do well in what they’re doing. Tommy runs his own business and Eddie is working on the frontline with the NHS at the minute.
“Our paths still cross and most of us still speak to each other. Parksy still speaks nonsense!
“At that time we had a real good team split between two age groups. We were going anywhere and winning everything that was on the go.
“I can recall going across to Ireland and winning the Milk Cup in 1986, we won Celtic’s centenary tournament in 1988 and we moved on to win the Youth Cup two years on the trot.
“It was virtually the same lads moving through the whole system at the time, which was unbelievable for us.
“Other clubs used to fear us, every tournament we entered we won. For Dundee United at that time it was a real achievement and a triumph to get to three finals on the trot.”
Bollan was an unused sub in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final and spoke of his pride at seeing so many youth products involved in their success, particularly after the pain of many defeats as a fan.
“To a certain extent, what we did laid the foundations for that. About half of that team had a role to play in the lead up to the final, with some playing in the game and others not,” he commented.
“We had to look after ourselves. Rangers were enormous favourites going into that day, they were going for the treble, but we managed to win the cup for the first time in the club’s history.
“That was another great achievement for Dundee United.
“I have many memories as a kid coming home from Hampden with tears running down my face so it was good to be on the other side of that.
“I was at all the League Cup Finals. The only one I wasn’t at was 1991 when we lost Motherwell, I was at a tournament in Holland at the time. We actually won, beating Slovan Bratislava in the final.
“But growing up as a United fan and standing on the terraces, week-in, week-out to then come through the youth ranks like we did, it was great.”
Liveston echoes Bollan’s thoughts, believing McLean’s foresight with young players made their Hampden day in the sun possible.
“I sometimes forget big Dunc was on the other side that day,” he recalled.
“It was some turnaround for the young players to go from team-mates to playing each other in a big game.
“That youth team played a big part in United winning that day, a Scottish Cup for the first time.
“It’s not the whole story, of course, because there were other players who’d come in and they’d made decent signings.
“But, yes, I think if wee Jim’s youth set-up hadn’t have been there, we wouldn’t have won the cup.
“Similarly, if we’d relied on the players that were brought in we wouldn’t have won it either. It had to be an amalgamation of the best of what we had.”
That until-then-elusive Scottish Cup success will have pleased McLean, by that point retired, as Ivan Golac lapped up the praise in the dugout.
Although, would the legendary United gaffer have preferred Ferguson, who appeared off the bench for Rangers that day, to score United’s winner rather than Craig Brewster?
Would McLean have liked 1990 shootout hero and current United academy coach Garden between the sticks rather than Guido Van De Kamp, or Conville in place of Gordan Petric?
It is hard to say.
Some did it on the pitch, others off it, but Dundee United’s now-famous Class of 1990 would go on to prove the great Jim McLean both wrong and right at the same time.
In a strange way, perhaps that is what he wanted all along.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boris Johnson's dad Stanley has lashed out at Meghan Markle, saying she was the driving force behind the couple leaving the UK for the United States and claiming she would have failed to settle in Britain.
“I can't help thinking that Meghan, as we must now call her, played a leading role here", he went on, explaining the move by “a basic cultural difference between British women and their transatlantic counterparts.”
To illustrate the point, Stanly drew a line between the Sussexes and his own parents, Wilfred and Irene.
"You and your spouse can't both be in the driving seat", he said going on recall what Princess Diana once said - that “there's not always room for two people in a marriage".
After announcing their historic move to quit senior royal duties for greater personal and financial independence, Meghan and Harry lived for some in a rented Vancouver apartment. However, after it became clear the authorities would close the borders due to the spread of the coronavirus, the couple and their baby son crossed into the US, to Meghan’s home city Los Angeles, purportedly to be closer to her mother Doria Ragland.
The ex-royals, who the other day officially wound down their previously operating UK charity foundations and Buckingham Palace office, are understood to be now working on a new venture, a well-being and counselling empire called Archewell, in a nod to their almost year-old son.
On Friday, it was announced that the Sussexes had lost the first round of their legal fight with Associated Newspapers over an alleged breached of privacy after the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online published excerpts from private correspondence between her and her estranged father, Thomas Markle. The couple has voiced concerns more than once over the press interfering in their private life when citing reasons why they chose to leave the Royal Family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Queen releases ‘You Are The Champions’ for healthcare workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rock band Queen and singer Adam Lambert are raising money for health workers fighting COVID-19 with new single You Are The Champions, an updated version of classic hit We Are The Champions recorded on mobile phones under lockdown.
The track is for “all those in the frontline, all around the world… the people who are risking their lives to save us and save our families,” guitarist Brian May told Reuters in a video conference call interview from his home in London.
The single came to life when May posted a video online of himself playing his part, inviting the public to jam. He then urged drummer Roger Taylor and Lambert, who tours with the band in the place of late singer Freddie Mercury, to join in.
The band discussed whether to update the lyrics. In the end, Lambert swapped in “you” for “we” in the final verse, and left the rest of the words unchanged. It was an unusual move for Queen to alter even a single word of a classic song written by Mercury more than 40 years ago.
“But I think this is the type of event that warranted such a change. And it really, because it’s such a well-known title, changing that one word makes a huge impact,” Lambert told Reuters from his home in Los Angeles.
The lyrics still stand as the ideal anthem for the fight against coronavirus, he added: “It’s really a song about overcoming obstacles. It’s a song about, you know, defying the odds. And I think that’s what we’re doing right now.”
Taylor’s wife filmed him adding drums from his home in the English county of Cornwall. He listened to May’s track on headphones and played along while watching on a computer.
“It was quite tricky because Brian was just playing without a metronome or anything,” Taylor confided to Reuters.
The musicians and Mercury’s estate are donating their proceeds to a World Health Organization fund for health workers. The music video shows footage of frontline workers around the world, including Taylor’s daughter, Dr Rory Taylor, a family doctor in West London.
“People feel it in themselves,” May said of Mercury’s song. “They feel this challenge. They want to be the best. They want to win. And the song just has it. So it’s become a wonderful way of expressing triumph and determination in the face of something very difficult.”
The band was meant to be on the road now but had to postpone a 27-date UK and European tour. May said it was “heartbreaking” to call off shows after fans bought 400,000 tickets, and the band hopes to reschedule for next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Bloomberg expands influence network within Democratic party</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg spent almost a billion dollars to try to win the Democratic nomination but his audacious bid ended with victory only in tiny American Samoa.
Related: How Elizabeth Warren destroyed Mike Bloomberg's campaign in 60 seconds
That embarrassing defeat was held up by some critics as proof it is still hard to use spending power alone to win a US election. But Bloomberg’s enormous wealth and influence is still strong in the party via a growing network of groups, former associates and allies sprinkled across the Democratic party universe.
Even before Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race in May the media mogul billionaire vowed he would work to defeat Donald Trump even if he didn’t get the nomination.
That’s precisely what he is doing.
“He was one of the biggest contributors to Democratic causes before he ran and he still is after,” Abe Rakov, a veteran Democratic campaign manager, said of Bloomberg. “There are a lot of organizations and programs across the country that would be in really bad shape if he decided to disengage after he ran.”
The initial plan was to continue to fuel the massive field operation Bloomberg’s campaign built. The former mayor changed his mind and instead transferred $18m to the Democratic National Committee, the main organization charged with boosting the party’s presidential nominee.
It’s possible Bloomberg could move more money as well. The Bloomberg campaign also transferred leases for over a dozen of its field offices to the DNC, adding to the DNC’s campaign spaces around the country.
Bloomberg himself is staying visible, working with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, to launch a testing and tracing program. He spoke via video conference call during Cuomo’s press briefing on Thursday. The governor, currently one of the most prominent Democrats in the country, said in late April that Bloomberg was working with him.
A network of operatives and Bloomberg-connected political organizations is also active in Democratic presidential circles. Bill Knapp, a longtime Bloomberg adviser, recently joined Priorities USA, the Super Pac the Joe Biden campaign has signaled is its outside organization of choice for the general election.
During Bloomberg’s campaign, he poured almost $67m into a new digital and technology firm called Hawkfish. Hawkfish has stayed active since Bloomberg dropped out. The firm is reportedly in talks to work for Biden’s presidential campaign although nothing is finalized.
Hawkfish also got into negotiations to buy another Democratic analytics firm, Blue Labs Analytics, according to four Democrats with knowledge of those talks, but negotiations fell through. Hawkfish and Blue Labs still have ties.
In Washington Democratic analytics circles Hawkfish has become a hot topic as a firm trying to elbow its way into the group of top-tier data analytics firms.
The business discussions between Hawkfish and various campaigns and outlets within the Democratic campaign universe underscores how Bloomberg-connected operatives and groups continue to set down deep roots within the party.
Some former digital and data staffers for the Bloomberg campaign have talked with Biden campaign officials about joining the campaign, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those talks.
The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.
“I think Mayor Bloomberg has made it very plain, through his actions and his investments, his commitment to defeating Donald Trump and helping to elect Democrats across the country,” said the former Michigan congressman Mark Schauer, who supported Bloomberg during the mayor’s short-lived presidential campaign. “I think those contributions are valuable, they’re significant, and they’ll have an impact this November.”
The end goal for Bloomberg, 78, is still somewhat murky.
The former mayor has repeatedly said he would use his considerable resources to oust Trump from office. But the rapid expansion of Bloomberg-connected groups and operatives around Washington also suggests Bloomberg intends to hold a seat at the table among the most influential Democratic party leaders, albeit one outside of elected office.

    <h5 class="mb-1">John Nelms on Dundee's NINE different budgets for next season as Dens Park chief gives new stadium update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">John Nelms insists Dundee ’s American owners are in it for the long haul and won’t bail out on the back of the coronavirus crisis.
US-based Football Partners Scotland have invested around £8million in seven years on Tayside but are facing a colossal economic fallout from the COVID-19 shutdown.
Nelms also got caught in the crossfire amid the SPFL ballot shambles earlier this month when he flipped his vote and agreed to end the season in the lower leagues.
The American – who invests along with fellow Texan Tim Keyes – insisted they will continue to back the club and won’t give up on their new stadium dream.
He said: “We are committed and we want to do the best for Dundee FC that we can. We will always do that and we’re not going anywhere for the foreseeable future.
“Honestly, I’m not sure if the fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always.
“Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.
“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short term but overall in the long term it will benefit the club.
“That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. We will try to take care of players no matter what, staff no matter what.
“If it comes to a point where we can’t take care of it then that will be very painful for us.
“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the government is treating it we are in a stable position and able to do those things.
“We will always do what is right for the football club. I’ll take the heat for it, that comes with the territory.”
Nelms insists Dundee are in strong shape to deal with the crisis – but he’s already working on several different budgets for whatever next season brings in the Championship.
He said: “It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.
“We are still trying to entertain in whatever small way we can with people are stuck at home.
“Parts of our business are still running as normal but the reality is nothing is running as normal.
“We don’t know what’s going to happen.
“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen. We have nine different budgets for next year.
“There is a high chance it will be a hybrid of a couple of those options because we don’t know what we will end up with, we don’t know how many games we will have or if matches might be compressed into playing all the time.
“We don’t know when we are going to start and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”
Nelms is fire fighting right now but has told Dundee’s fans the new stadium plans won’t be shelved.
He said: “The stadium is ticking along. Architects and all the group are working on things but we’re not allowed to go out and do the updated studies we need to do.
“There’s positioning in these deals and we’re doing those type of things, making sure everybody is geared up and ready to go.
“With the city dealing with the coronavirus the way they are and the way other staff are dealing with it, things have slowed down to a crawl.
“But we are doing things. As opposed to every day something happening, every week we’re getting updates of things happening.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holy Shit, It’s Been 10 Years Since Kate’s Birthday Party In Adelaide Copped 72K RSVPs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remember when we could *checks notes* leave the house and see other people? Yeah, me neither. But today, I was reminded that this weekend marks the 10th anniversary of quite possibly the most iconic party of all time: Kate’s Birthday Party in Adelaide.
Although we’d all love to throw a party this weekend, I can’t help but shed a tear for poor ol’ Kate Miller, who should be celebrating her birthday by throwing another quiet shindig with 72,000 attendees.
So, in lieu of the party our queen Kate deserves, I thought we could all take a little stroll down memory lane at the event that changed Facebook forever.
Facebook events are, and always have been, a great way to tell all of your mates about your upcoming gathering. But as we all know, you’ve gotta make that shit private or you’ll end up with a Kate’s Birthday Party saga on your hands.
It was Saturday May 1, 2010 in the city of churches and *really* big silver balls. What started out as a small gathering of friends turned into the hottest party in town at “Our Apartment,” or so it seemed.
The event was created on April 24, 2010 by serial online prank king David Thorne (under the alias of our queen, Kate Miller). According to SMH, the event amassed a whopping 5,000 attendees within 10 minutes, growing to 60,000 within 24 hours.
By the time Thorne unveiled the event as his latest hoax, a staggering 72,000 people had clicked “attending” to the local Adelaide shindig. The huge virtual crowd even prompted IRL police officers to stand by on Adelaide’s North St in preparation for a riot-sized group, the Adelaide Advertiser reported at the time.
But despite the hefty guest list, only a handful of people actually tried to attend Kate’s Birthday Party, which hits painfully close to home for many of us who have tried to throw a party.
But it turns out the whole thing was David Thorne’s way of teaching us all that you’ve got precisely fuck all privacy on social media.
Before the days of Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All Of Us, there was Kate’s Birthday Party, the original meme Facebook event.  Ahh, if only David knew that we’d still be “attending” dumb meme events like the Area 51 Raid and Wall Of Death When The Veronicas Play Untouched At Good Things (which turned out to be a real thing) a full decade later.
Kate’s Birthday Party will go down in history. One day, your grandkids will sit down in front of your rocking chair and ask you to recite the story of where YOU were on the eve of the infamous Kate’s Birthday Party.
Happy Birthday Kate (David Thorne), here’s hoping you can knock back a few cold ones on Hindley Street soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Check If Your Tweets Have Been Quoted In The Media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As one who is never very witty on Twitter, I have almost no concern that anything I type is going to get highlighted on a website or in a news story somewhere—not unless someone really cares about my thoughts on cats and Animal Crossing. However, there’s a quick and easy way to see for yourself if your Twitter wit has ever been picked up elsewhere. (And you might be surprised!)
Said tip comes from Twitter directly:
When I tried, this, my results were all boring. I blame this on my enthusiasm for dropping my Twitter handle in every story I write ever, in a semi-delusional attempt at making myself popular through brute force. (It still hasn’t worked; maybe I need to work on tweeting more dad jokes.)
Others had more far more fulfilling (and surprising) results:
And, of course, the Twitter users quoted above will see that they were quoted in this article next time they run a search on themselves; the great circle of life continues.
This is also a great reminder that if you’re looking to back down on your Twitter fame at any point, looking up what you’ve been quoted saying and then deleting that tweet can help you reclaim a sliver of anonymity. (That’s assuming the media entity in question didn’t screenshot your tweet and embed that, instead of embedding the tweet itself.)
It’s also not the worst habit to set up some kind of auto-deletion mechanism for your older tweets. Sure, they won’t be there to pad your engagement stats—for the few of you that care about that sort of thing—but it never hurts to make sure that a snarky tweet you published years ago doesn’t come back to haunt you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk's bizarre tweet wipes $14 billion off Tesla market value in hours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk may lose his job as Tesla chief execuive as the carmaker's board, as well as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have taken into account his bizarre tweet that brought Tesla's market value down by $14 billion in hours.
The tweet saying that Tesla stock was "too high" also knocked $3 billion off Musk's own stake in the electric carmaker.
His earlier notorious tweet in August 2018 — when he posted about Tesla "going private, funding secured" at $420 a share — cost him his role as chairman.

The August 2018 tweet resulted in Musk and Tesla reaching a settlement of fraud charges with the SEC. The settlement included $40 million in penalties, split equally between the company and Musk, and the removal of Musk as chairman of the Tesla board.
"As a result of the settlement, Elon Musk will no longer be Chairman of Tesla, Tesla's board will adopt important reforms -- including an obligation to oversee Musk's communications with investors -- and both will pay financial penalties," Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said in a statement.
According to the SEC's complaint, Musk's misleading tweets caused Tesla's stock price to jump by over six percent on August 7, and led to significant market disruption.

Tesla's market valuation was worth around $141 billion before the first tweet and it nosedived to nearly $127 billion. One user replied to Musk: "Are you doing it because you need the cash or is this to protest the world burning down?"
Musk replied: "Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down".
Musk is supposed to seek pre-approval if his tweets include anything regarding the company's securities, including his acquisition or disposition of shares, nonpublic legal or regulatory findings or decisions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Queen and Adam Lambert honor global COVID-19 ‘Champions’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queen and singer Adam Lambert have a message for workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 fight: “You Are the Champions.” Brian May, Roger Taylor and Lambert recently gathered virtually to record a new version of the Queen classic, “We Are the Champions.”
“You Are the Champions” was released early Friday on all streaming and download services, with proceeds going to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.
“I thought, this is a great way to use the legacy that we have to do some good in the world,” May said. “You know, we don’t really need to make money anymore. We don’t need to be any more famous. We need to use what we have in the best possible way.”
For May the release comes at a time of great sadness. The guitarist earlier this week lost a friend who he likened was like a brother to him, to the virus.
“That’s the closest it’s come to me physically,” he said, adding it’s given real meaning to the death tolls broadcast daily on television.
“Each one of those is a family tragedy,” May said. “Each one of those people lose a loved one. “I think psychologically the human race is going to be very damaged.”
For Taylor, the song also has personal significance as his daughter Rory Eleanor Taylor works as a doctor in a London hospital.
“She’s actually in the video with her little cards, displaying advice about isolating, etc.”
The music video shows caregivers and frontline workers from across the world as well as empty city scenes and the band performing in their homes.
For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe or fatal illnesses, including pneumonia.
Lambert, who joined the track from his Los Angeles home, thinks the song really hits a positive note that everyone is in this together.
“There’s a sense of unity that’s happening around the world, even though it’s, you know, in a negative, scary time,” Lambert said. “I think that we’re all understanding each other a little bit more right now. And it’s sort of leveling everything out a bit.”
“It’s only through our connection and our love for each other are we going to get through it together,” he said.The band hopes the charity single will provide some consolation after the pandemic forced them to cancel the 27-show UK and European leg of their biggest ever tour.
“It was pretty heartbreaking to have to let it go. We have rescheduled for next year and we’re all crossing our fingers. We don’t know do we? We don’t know if it’s going to be appropriate to get thousands of people in one room, even in 12 months from now,” May said.
Taylor remains optimistic that live music will survive.
“I can’t believe that festivals and live music won’t come back. It’s part of our … DNA really now.”In the meantime, Taylor and May remain in lockdown in their respective homes in the UK. Like many, May is struggling with the loss of freedom.
“It doesn’t get any easier as time gets on. It’s getting worse if anything. I feel like everything that I worked for in my life has been kind of taken away and put somewhere where I can’t reach it,” he said.
It’s not all bad, as Taylor noted.
“I think people have found lots of good things to do,” he said. “I think there’s been a lot more contact within families and friends.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">England-born defender keen on Harambee Stars call-up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David Sesay is at pains to explain why he was unable to honour a call-up to the Kenya national football team ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Egypt.
"People say I rejected the chance to play for Kenya but that is not true," he told Nation Sport in a video interview from his base in England.
"I don't have a Kenyan passport. That was the main factor at the time when the Kenya FA (Football Kenya Federation) officials approached me," explains the youngster.
"I had also just changed clubs at the time and I had to settle down. Now I am 100 percent ready to play for Kenya."
Sesay was born in England 21 years ago to a Kenyan mother. His father, Deen Sesay also turned out for Sierra Leonean national football team. His mother was born in Ndenderu in Kiambu County but relocated to the UK.
His younger sister also resides in the UK but the player also mentions 'an extended family in Kenya' which he keeps close contact with. Under the current football laws, the Crawley Town defender is eligible to represent either England, Sierra Leone and Kenya. Strictly speaking, he can only choose one.
If he opts for Kenya, he would first need to apply for a Kenyan passport. Kenyan laws allow for dual citizenship. "Kenya is the best option," he stresses.
Harambee Stars coach Francis Kimanzi, in an exclusive interview with Nation Sport, confirmed he was keen to work with the youngster.
"He is a young right back and winger. We also have Phillip (Mweene) in Germany and Daniel (Anyembe) in Denmark who have Kenyan roots and can play on the right side of defence. My experience with these players (of Kenyan descent) is that normally they confirm their availability for national team duty in the media but when we call them up, they do not respond. If Sesay is now available, we will give him a chance," said Kimanzi.
Sesay says he followed Kenya's performances at the Nations Cup keenly. Harambee Stars failed to overcome the first hurdle at the continental championship after losing to eventual finalists Senegal and Algeria, and beating Tanzania in her Group 'C' engagements.
POSITIVE SIGNS
"It (the Nations Cup) is a big tournament in Kenya and all over TV here in England. I followed Kenya's games. We were in a tough group, but the team showed positive signs and the players really expressed themselves. There is another tournament in two years and it would be an honour to be part of the set-up."
Sesay started playing football at the age of six. He spent time at Chelsea's academy.
"I started playing while in school and my family supported me. I briefly trained at Chelsea before moving to (English Premier League side) Watford where I stayed for 10 years and enjoyed the best experience of my career so far,” he says.
At Watford, he trained alongside other England starlets, including Borrusia Dortmund starlet Jadon Sancho who is now attached to Borussia Dortmund in Germany and regarded as the best England youngster of his generation.
"He is a good friend and we are always in touch," says Sesay.
Sesay's stay at Watford came to an end when he was released by the club. Soon after, he joined League Two side Crawley Town in the fourth-tier of England’s football system. "I was inspired by making the step up from playing reserve football to competitive and first team football," he points out.
"It has been a good experience. I was named the young player of the season."
EFFICIENT DRIBBLER
Tall and strong, Sesay is predominantly a right back. "My main job on the pitch is to ensure I put a lot of crosses in the opponents box, and also ensure I prevent crosses from getting into my box."
He can also play at left back and on side of midfield, a position referred to in football as winger. Videos on YouTube suggest he is an efficient dribbler who uses a bit of skill and pace to get away from his markers. He also has an eye for goal.
It is these attributes that have, perhaps attract the interest of West Brom, with the Championship side reported to be preparing an estimated Sh100 million bid for his services.
"It is a good thing to read, but I let my agent concentrate on that as I play my football."
Sesay says he has been a regular visitor to Kenya. Time permitting, he visits at least once every year. "I understand a bit of Kikuyu language. I am learning Swahili. I love Kenya. Everything over there is natural. I have a family in Malindi and I have also been to the national parks."
"I attended one Kenyan Premier League match at Kasarani betwen Gor Mahia against Leopards. I was excited by the energy of the fans and some of the talent on parade."
Just like many other athletes, Sesay has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic which has led to the cancellation of several sporting events. His hope however is that normalcy will soon resume.
"I didn't think it will be this serious. Games and training has stopped. All games and training has stopped here. I am reading of 1,000 deaths a day. We have to follow government guidelines and hope the situation improves. I exercise once a day to maintain my fitness levels."
Most naturalised Kenyans who have sought to turn out for Harambee Stars in the past have not been successful. They include Christopher Mbamba and Taiwo Atieno.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Corden will pay the salaries of around 60 “Late Late Show” staffers who are being furloughed beginning next week.
Corden returned to producing new episodes of “The Late Late Show” on April 14. Following the shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March, CBS had covered eight weeks of salary for staffers who were unable to fulfill their duties. Corden informed his staff last week that some would be furloughed beginning on Monday.
The news was first reported by Variety.
Earlier this month, CBS parent company ViacomCBS set up a relief fund for workers impacted by the Hollywood shutdown and committed $100 million.
The “Late Late Show” is filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Earlier this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom detailed the state’s plans for reopening the economy after more than a month under a state-wide “stay at home” order.
The state is likely “weeks” away from reopening some nonessential businesses, Newsom said, while the reopening of movie theaters and other entertainment venues will likely be “months” away. The relaxations of the statewide “stay at home” order come as part of a four-stage framework for reopening the economy that Newsom and Director of the Department of Public Health Sonia Angell outlined at a Tuesday press conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Good Omens Celebrates 30 Years With Some Crowley And Aziraphale Lockdown Fic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AmazonTerry Pratchett’s Good Omens novel is celebrating 30 years—during a time when celebrations are pretty much off the menu. To commemorate their Pearl Anniversary, the Arizaphale and Crowley of Amazon’s adaptation have returned to swap stories of social distancing during an actual apocalypse.
Releaed on the dearly missed Terry Pratchett’s YouTube and penned by his fellow Good Omens scribe Neil Gaiman the new short is aptly titled “Good Omens: Lockdown”, and has Michael Sheen and David Tennant returning to their roles as the angel and demon who would stop at nothing to stay in each other’s lives. But, it seems that not even the rise of the Antichrist could prepare them for having to spent a few months apart.
The video takes place largely in voiceover, with some gorgeous footage of cakes, books, and portraits of Arizaphale and Crowley underneath. The divine duo chat over the phone about how their lives have been since social distancing started—Arizaphale has been making cakes for burglars, while Crowley just wants to put himself to sleep for several months until (hopefully) it’s all over. That is, unless Arizaphale would be cool with him coming over for a while... naughty demon.
The Good Omens novel is available as a digital book from many retailers, be sure to check out Harper Collins for options. The series is available to watch on Amazon Prime; if you haven’t checked it out yet, now’s a better time than ever. Just... maybe don’t buy anything from Amazon today—it is May Day, after all.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake O'Kane: My mother had a quick and painless death at a great age but it could have been so different</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AS SOON as I noticed two messages last Thursday on my phone from my brothers, within minutes of each other, I knew what had happened, and I was right. My mother had just died. Death in a time of pandemic adds a level of surrealism to the experience of grief.
I take comfort from the fact that my mother died of natural causes. At 89 years old, her heart simply gave out; sitting at her kitchen table, she never got to finish her cup of coffee. My Aunt Monica put it best when she stated, "Sure, didn’t she get away nicely?"
And in the middle of this coronavirus pandemic, a quick and painless death at a great age is indeed an example of ‘getting away nicely’, for it could have been so different. My mother could have been one of the thousands of elderly in our nursing homes, trapped in their rooms, as Covid-19 stalks the corridors, as all the while brave and tenacious staff put their own health at risk to care for their charges with lamentably little personal protection equipment available to them.
My mother, on a few occasions, spent weeks in such homes, convalescing after visits to hospital, but she was adamant she would return to her own home, and what Mother wanted, Mother got. This was only possible due to the indefatigable efforts of a small but attentive army of NHS and private carers, and family members, organised by my brother Conor.
I’ve written in the past about how I believe the Irish way of death, rooted in the fabric of our culture, is of great psychological benefit in the grieving process. The Irish wake, an ancient rite of passage where the living comfort each other, while parting with the deceased, is sadly no longer possible.
Due to the essential social distancing presently needed, only immediate family were in attendance at the wake house. Cruellest of all was the fact my brother Damien – Mother’s youngest child and always her favourite – was unable to attend her funeral. Finding himself trapped on the wrong side of the Irish Sea in Edinburgh, he at least was able to watch the funeral service streamed live on the internet.
With only a dozen in attendance, the service could have been cold and impersonal but for the sensitivity of Fr Peter Madden, who ensured a warm and nurturing celebration of my mother’s life.
The drive from Draperstown to her burial in Dungiven took us through Moneyneena and on through the Sperrins on what had to be one of the most glorious days of the year. With hillsides ablaze with flowering gorse, at the end of lanes and in front of houses, family after family stood and blessed themselves as the cortege passed. Forced into isolation, yet unbowed by the virus, friends and neighbours had found a way to show their respects.
And this is what I will remember, not the limitations imposed by the pandemic but how everyone we met – from undertaker to local doctor to priests – ensured the Irish way of death was not only maintained but that we, as a family, were supported in every way possible.
Who my mother was is captured in this story. Not long after they became available, my father invested in a new colour television for the bar he and my mother ran in north Belfast. Frequented mainly by dockers and labourers, the bar was small but had a loyal clientele.
Not long after buying his new television, a stranger walked into the bar. The story goes the man was a giant – but considering the average height of men in north Belfast in the 60s, a giant would have been 5ft 10.
The stranger plonked himself at the end of the bar and proceeded to morosely consume a bottle of whisky. On draining his last glass, he calmly, and without warning, turned and launched it into the screen of the new colour television.
Locals dived for cover as it exploded, showering them with glass. The culprit arrogantly stepped off his bar stool and glared around, daring anyone to admonish him. His gaze finally settling on my father behind the bar.
All eyes turned to my father, expectantly awaiting his reaction. Father calmly, and with no embarrassment, turned to my mother and said, "Josie, put him out."
And that’s exactly what happened. Josie reached up, grabbed the malcontent by his collar and marched him out like a lamb.
Josie, b1931, d 2020. RIP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Now Streaming Free: The New Breed, A Groundbreaking Documentary About Social Entrepreneurs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE NEW BREED is a new feature documentary about the social enterprise movement. The film follows three social entrepreneurs over a two year period, roughly from business plan to impact delivery and also includes some short sketches about the global forces that have triggered this movement in simple, fun and easy-to-understand ways. You can watch the film for free for one week at www.newbreed.tv, and will be available to rent for $5 afterwards.
I caught up with filmmaker Pete Williams to find out more about his journey.
Afdhel Aziz: Pete, welcome. Please tell us a little bit about the film and what lead you to exploring this topic?
Pete Williams: I first came across the concept of ‘The Social Entrepreneur’ while filming a TV series called MAKERS in the Sahara desert back in 2013-14. We were shooting three young Tunisian guys who had a wooden eyewear company called VAKAY and they were using proceeds from their business to help rebuild the Tunisian tourism industry, which had been devastated by the recent Arab Spring revolution. They committed 10% of all net revenue from their eyewear sales to help rescue a famous Star Wars film set called MOS ESPA, which had been engulfed in desert sands over the years.
I saw first hand the impact this was having on the local community when tourists started coming back. Local businesses started thriving, local people were lifted out of poverty and started living with hope again. It was the first time in my life I started to think that business could be reengineered to be the solution to some of the world’s social and environmental problems and that’s what started me on this long journey.
Aziz: Very cool. Which entrepreneurs does the film cover and how did you find them?
Williams: I met with around 100 social entrepreneurs during the development phase of the project and in the end selected three businesses to feature. Each of the featured businesses represented a very different social enterprise business model and they are each at very different stages in their business life-cycle. But probably the most important aspect from a filmmaking perspective is that each business is headed by a really compelling individual or individuals, who I knew audiences would be happy to hang out with for 80 minutes or so.
KNOWN SUPPLY is an apparel company based in Costa Mesa, California, which empowers women to rise out of poverty in Uganda and Peru through education, mentorship and a steady income. BONFOLK is a one-for-one sock company based in New Orleans, Louisiana, which donates a pair of socks to someone in need with every pair of socks sold and BUREO is a plastic recycling company based in Ventura, California, who collect discarded fishing nets off the coast of Chile and transform them into functional new products like skateboards, surf fins and eyewear.
Aziz: Thanks for sharing that. What were some of the insights you discovered along the way?
Williams: Firstly, I never dreamed that the film would take four years to make. My experience is in commercials and TV and you can knock them out in a month or so. I found this is true for the start-up world too. Everything takes longer than you think, especially when you’re innovating and creating something original, there’s always unexpected road bumps that are gonna throw you off course and stop you reaching your goal.
I guess that’s what makes every start-up story so engaging. Every business has their own antagonists and they each have to find innovative ways too overcome them with limited resources and no blueprint for success.
Aziz: What is the plan for the future distribution of the film?
Williams: THE NEW BREED is a very independent, grass-roots, people-first production so we’re going to release it that way too. We’re streaming it for free on the films website NEWBREED.TV for the first week of release (MAY 01) and then it will be available to rent for $5 on Vimeo-On-Demand.
As we speak my distribution partner in Los Angeles is shopping it around to the streaming services, so hopefully we find the right streaming partner soon, which will open up an even wider audience for the film globally.
It feels like the perfect time to release the film. Lots of people have more time than normal to watch documentaries and a lot of people are looking for alternatives to ‘business as usual’ but in all honesty we have very limited resources for marketing and outreach. What I’m hoping is that the first batch of people who see the film love it and positive word-of- mouth turns into organic spread. Fingers crossed.
Aziz: I’m crossing my fingers for you! Finally, are you hopeful for the future of social entrepreneurship?
Williams: I’ve seen this movement grow so much over the past five years. What was once niche, only a few years back, is definitely moving toward mainstream now. Almost every product and service category has more that one social enterprise participant and these brands are growing and evolving all the time. I think there’s also a growing consumer demand for ethical business practices, with a new generation asking more questions of the brands they support and that’s really encouraging.
But we’re all on our own journey to ‘wokeness’ as individuals and businesses. I mean, I was still using plastic straws until the Bureo boys scolded me for it last year! The goal of THE NEW BREED is to push every viewer down the line of consciousness a little bit. To add a little insight and hopefully make all of us more aware of how our behaviour affects people and the planet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rising Star Charles Lott Jr.: “Actors shouldn’t be afraid to stand up! If you see something wrong with our industry say something; cause awareness”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I had the pleasure to interview Charles Lott Jr. Charles is best known for his upcoming role in the feature film THE WAY BACK alongside Hollywood-veteran Ben Affleck. THE WAY BACK is set to premiere March 6, 2020. From early on, Charles Lott Jr. has been successful from his scene work, monologue performances, and modeling on the runway. In addition to national commercials and campaigns with Vitamin Water, Charles has booked roles in “Modern Family,” “68 Whiskey,” FORGIVENESS, and EXTRA CREDIT (2020).
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?
For the most part pretty good. I was raised in a two-parent household with all of my siblings. Of course, I’ve had some tough times in my life, but overall I eat every day, I have clothes on my back, and I have people around me that love me. If I have those things I feel as if I have nothing to complain about because there are so many people on this earth that will kill to have a life that I have.
Can you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?
It’s so crazy because I never tried to be an actor. My whole life I tried to make it in professional sports. I wanted to be a football player, I wanted to go to the NFL and be a first-round draft pick like most other boys that play the sport. I got signed to an agent and manager for a talent competition I won on accident and I still didn’t want to act. People have always told me that I should get into acting and that I was always a character. I always had a big personality and I should display that to the world but I wasn’t thinking big enough when my senior year started. I got a lot of injuries so college coaches stopped calling, and I didn’t know what to do. I called my dad and asked him what does he think if I got into acting again and he supported the whole way through. I never hated acting, I was just so caught up into the “football is life” thing and once my run was over I got more realistic, and I just wanted to be a kid. The acting was the better choice and the best choice I’ve ever made because I fell in love with it. I’m still mad to this day that I didn’t get into it earlier.
Can you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?
It was a few weeks before Christmas. While we were shooting the movie, and Al Madrigal who is in the movie with me invited me to a Christmas party at his house. He told me out of all the kids in the group that he only invited me and don’t tell any of the other kids, so I didn’t. He also invited some of the older guys from the set. I got a ride with my co-star Jeremy Radin and we went into the house together. Madrigal’s house was extremely huge and elegant. I noticed very quickly I was the only black person in the party. Jeremy and I walked out into Al’s big and ginormous backyard, and I told him, “Man I’m the only black dude in an all-white party this feels like I’m in the movie Get Out” and literally three seconds later there was a knock on the door. Al walked and opened it and guess who it is, Jordan Peele! I completely freaked out! I still can’t believe I called it, Bill Burr was there I freaked, Dave Holstein was there and I almost had a seizure, he created one of my favorite shows “Kidding” with Jim Carrey. That might’ve easily been the best party I’ve been to.
Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?
This will be my answer till the day I die, getting Ben Affleck to “adopt me.” It was our first scene together with him and the other guys on the team. The scene where they introduce him to the team, and the first time we ran it through I got ready to say my line and he cut mine and started his right away. I didn’t know if he did it on purpose or not (probably not) so I didn’t say anything. After a few tapes of me not being able to get my line out, I got angry. The first words that came out of my mouth were “Oh hell Nah” so I walked over where he was sitting while he was on his phone. I tapped his shoulder and told him don’t step on my lines again. He looked up at me like “who is this kid” he frowned a bit. And once I realized how big and statuesque he was. I had got very frightened and put the script in his face and tried to show him what his lines were. And I forget I was mic’d up, so the guys in the back heard me, everyone gave me hell for days and said, “you don’t talk to Ben Affleck like that!” And when our next scene came around again days later, he told me how he respected me for telling him not to step on his lines. We became best friends I would ask him 100–200 questions a day from that point on. Al Madrigal told him “Since you love him so much you might as well adopt him” and he did. Now he calls me his “son” and I call him “dad.” The best story ever am I right!? Batman is my father.
What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?
I have two screenplays that I am working on. I am finished with one and currently editing the other. The second one I am 60 pages in and they’re both comedies!
I’m very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?
1. It will help the younger generations. Two years ago I saw a movie called Black Panther and I was mesmerized seeing a black superhero. He looked like me, he sounded like me, he acted like me. He was so relatable to the black community. He was strong and fierce, it was an exhilarating experience. Growing up most superheros I saw were white. Seeing white men as powerful and strong did not have the same effect as Black Panther. I was 17 when I saw the film and imagined the hope and inspiration for young black boys and girls felt. Superheroes aren’t real and they do the impossible, but seeing a person like you doing the impossible makes you feel like you can do anything. A lot of white people might not understand it because everyone they watch on TV, for the most part, looks like them. They don’t know what it feels like to have a lack of representation. But growing up seeing that could potentially move mountains, and I commend Hollywood for making a push for more diverse characters.
2. They can start helping minorities and people of color be exposed to more roles. If you look 30–40 years ago people of color would only be cast for stereotypical roles. But now we see minorities being able to play anything and it gives the audience and the industry a chance to see more talent come in from all races. Let me tell you it’s been a pleasure to watch. So many new talented black, white, Mexican, Asian, etc. actors and actresses come out.
3. Having diversity would be normalized years from now if we continue to push for more diverse roles and representation. We won’t be mad or shocked if we see Idris Elba playing “007.” The people won’t be mad if Halle Bailey is cast to play Ariel in The Little Mermaid. We will only be going by the actor’s talent, not what color their skin is. Period pieces would have to be accurate, but having diversity in films is so important to me. I’m so happy to see Hollywood making an effort for change. Things don’t happen overnight, it takes time.
From your personal experience, can you recommend three things the community/society/the industry can do help address some of the diversity issues in the entertainment business?
There are so many things that need to be done but it’s hard to just narrow it down to three. But, I would say the community and society need to be more open-minded. Don’t judge a book by its cover, there have been a lot of people cast for roles that society didn’t like and they absolutely killed their roles.
Heath Ledger for example, when he got cast for The Dark Knight people were screaming, “they cast the 10 Things I Hate About You guy!?” And look, he’s easy, at least in my eyes, the greatest Joker ever. They’re getting a lot better but, Hollywood needs to be more open-minded.
The last one for me is the actors shouldn’t be afraid to stand up! If you see something wrong with our industry say something, cause awareness. Don’t feel scared to be the first, actors and actresses to take responsibility too. It’s our industry, we can’t sit around and hope someone creates diversity for us.
What are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why. Please share a story or example for each.
I don’t have any I wish someone told me moments. I’m fairly new at this. I do not regret any decision I have made. It made me who I am today sometimes it doesn’t seem good to make decisions that don’t pan out but it’s actually a good thing, it builds character!
Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”?
This is a heartbreak profession when you sign up to be an actor or actress. You have to know that most times when you get an audition. Statistically, you are most likely to not get the part than to book it. But acting is like baseball your swing and a strikeout, and strikeout, and strikeout, then BOOM! you hit a home run. You have to be ready to grind and be persistent and resilient. If not you will quit immediately. You have to be used to being told no more than yes.
You are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. 🙂
Oh my gosh, where do I start? Black Lives Matter, Slow Food Movement, Children, and Nature movement, One Million Women movement, Keep the Oil In The Ground movement, Idle No More movement, Save the Turtles, Save the Rhinoceros, I can keep going on!
None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?
Right now, my dad. He has been there 100% through my mission of becoming an actor. He has supported me. A few weeks ago I told him I needed a laptop for my screenplay the next day he bought me one. It’s great to see him do everything he can to help me accomplish my dreams and will do whatever it takes for me to succeed.
Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?
It’s not really a quote but a story. You have two gold miners under the ground digging for gold. You have one guy that kept digging, kept digging, and kept digging and one day he just had enough of it. He decided to quit because he’s put all his effort into one thing and has gotten zero results, and he was ONE more big hit away from finding the gold. The other guy stayed persistent, kept digging, kept grinding, and next thing you know all of the gold he was looking for was found AND some. The moral of the story is never quit what you’re doing because you never know how close you really are to achieving your dream!
Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them 🙂
This is so hard to narrow it down to one person but if I had to pick one it would be Will Smith. I’ve loved that man since I was a kid. If I could have anyone’s career it would be his. Another would be Jordan Peele. He’s an amazing director I would love to work with him in the near future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love in the Age of Covid19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In March of 2020, my friend Miguel and I were on the phone trying to stay calm but somewhat alarmed at the uncertainty of what might come as the world was experiencing the start of a pandemic due to the new corona virus, Covid 19. He was heading back from the office and I was on my back from a yoga class. In NYC, we were at the start of the Covid 19 pandemic which, little to our knowledge, would the way humans do things for some time to come. He was disappointed because his concert was cancelled, although he had the option to live stream it. I shared with him that although we were at the start of a crisis, New Yorkers appeared to be reacting as if nothing out of the ordinary was occurring. The restaurants were filled to capacity and as usual for a Thursday night, the bars were full of patrons inside and out, I could catch glimpses of peoples’ conversations outside the bars, smoking their cigarettes or carrying on as usual. I was surprised that life appeared to be carrying on this way. Several months before China and many countries in Europe were in complete lockdown. Schools, universities, workplaces and mass transit was shut down. In Italy people were not allowed to be out on the streets other than to go to the grocery store. Yet, in NYC my live yoga class continued and when I walked out it was “business as usual.” Miguel was surprised. “How do they decide what gets shut down?” he asked because Mayor DeBlasio had decided to close down concerts and sporting events yet people were still gathering at bars, pubs, and restaurants. Are we less contagious if we’re at a bar than a concert? I had no clue how these things are determined so I answered, “That’s a good question, I’ll look it up.”
Miguel and I are both singles in NYC. We live alone, go to work, figure out dinner, pleasure, and keep ourselves entertained. For people like us, it’s hard to imagine what life is like when our activities get shout down. No concerts, no sporting events, no yoga, no shopping, no bars. How would people meet their live or on-line dates? I suppose it’s a good time to connect with people on-line because how else could we possibly meet people. Nothing is open. New York City is a ghost town. But taking the next step? Do singles wear their face masks out? Should you ask the person you are on a date with whether they are feeling well and then gingerly remain 6 feet away from them? Never mind sex or one-night stands. There is a lot of information out there now about these types of things. Also, people’s physiological, emotional, mental and spiritual response to the pandemic varies greatly.
I told Miguel that this Covid19 situation might be a blessing in disguise. I said, “It would be a nice change for people to be hunkered down with their families, to have a forced respite from the chaos, and like in many religious and spiritual traditions to have time to reflect, atone, or at minimum to hit the “reset” button.” He predicted that there would be a baby boom in approximately 9-months. Interestingly, later that evening, I was reading the New Yorker and sent him the an article reporting that divorce rates in Wuhan, China (the city where the pandemic is thought to have started) had spiked when people were allowed to return to their normal lives after being quarantined. Some psychoanalysts predicted that being quarantined with someone where problems already existed could be the tipping point for some couples. Other couples might find it hard to engage in sex when stressed. Its normal, even animals have a hard time mating in captivity.
Other stories emerged of couples that were quarantined together on a cruise ship after testing positive for Covid19. For these couples, having the forced time to together seemed to rekindle the flames of intimacy. Perhaps these pivotal moments force us to make hard decisions one way or another. They make us realize that life is short, fragile, and that time is of the essence. And surely, the ramifications of Covid19 likely test the basic tenets of many marital vows: “I, take thee to be my wedded husband/wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part." Those are pretty strong words that are surely get put to the test in times of crisis.
Therefore, it is not surprising that during these extreme moments people will make tough decisions. Whether it is to divorce, marry, have a child, or change their career. Some may take this time as an opportunity to simplify, go inward, reset, and realize what is really important. The other positive side effect of the changes emerging from the Covid19 quarantines is that the world may need to realize overnight that we may have to start doing things a different way. The streets of London, New York City, Milan, and Los Angeles are empty. There are less people on the roads, mass transit and industry has been reduced drastically, and people are urged to consume responsibly. Therefore, pollution has also decreased drastically. Perhaps this may also help further convince global economies to consider a different way of doing things—local, simple, and needed. A change that some have slowly been trying to towards. If the world’s economy is not running on mass consumerism then what will it be running on? There are lots of ideas floating around and while it’s important to strive and know the truth, it is also important to stay positive in times like these. Some things will always be needed: care, human services, and creating functionalities that will allow us to have a sustainable existence on Earth or elsewhere.
Our species is tribal and before we designed complicated infrastructures we relied on each other. We are hard-wired for love, attachment, and cooperation. Our social connections are central to our well-being and existence. We stay connected through our cell phones, Face time, Facebook, Instagram and other apps. This hunkering down because of the virus has also forced many of us to be with our families because much of our work force was asked to stay home and schools are closed. Therefore, families are together, singles must rely of their friends and families, and ultimately we must all rely on each other. Kindness goes a long way. With that being said, love in the Age of Covid19 is more important than ever because like in prehistoric times, it is and was what ultimately helps our species thrive and survive.
Here are some helpful tips that can help to cope with these challenging times:
· Try to stick with a routine: (wake, sleep, and meals)
· Stay connected with friends and families
· Be grateful and positive
· Start or continue an exercise and yoga/meditation routine
· Develop a new and healthy hobby: take up a new language, learn how to play an instrument, learn how to play cards, learn about your relationship (check out my "LoveSmart" app)
· Eat healthy
· Stay hydrated
· Get sun (at non-peak sun times)
Be well, be happy, be safe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WhatsApp Suddenly Gets Powerful New Security Boost: Here’s Why It Affects You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The global coronavirus pandemic has distracted everyone, everywhere, but it has not deferred the emotive debate between lawmakers and the technology industry over the future of end-to-end encryption. Governments led by the U.S., U.K. and Australia are battling the industry to open up “warrant-proof” encryption to law enforcement agencies. The industry argues this will weaken security for all users around the world. The debate has polarized opinion and is intensifying.
WhatsApp has proven the most willing, alongside parent Facebook, to fight for encryption in the courts. And so the platform will be massively buoyed by two surprise boosts this week. And that is equally important for the 2 billion users who rely on the platform to secure their messaging. On the assumption you’re among that number, this should really matter to you.
While this debate has been raging for a year, the current “EARN-IT’ bill working its way through the U.S. legislative process is the biggest test yet for the survival of end-to-end encryption in its current form. In short, this would enforce best practices on the industry to “prevent, reduce and respond to” illicit material. There is no way they can do that without breaking their own encryption. QED.
Once the platforms introduce backdoors, those arguing against such a move say, bad guys will inevitably steal the keys. Lawmakers have been clever. No mention of backdoors at all in the proposed legislation or the need to break encryption. If you transmit illegal or dangerous content, they argue, you will be held responsible. You decide how to do that. Clearly there are no options to some form of backdoor.
EFF describes this as “a major threat,” warning that “the privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law enforcement achieves its dream of breaking encryption.” And while all major tech platforms deploying end-to-end encryption argue against weakening their security, Facebook has become the champion-in-chief fighting against government moves, supported by Apple and others.
Most Facebook content is not actually end-to-end encrypted, but it owns WhatsApp which is and has been for many years. WhatsApp popularized this level of security, and now carries more end-to-end encrypted messages than anyone else. The platform confirmed this week that it will continue to fight government attempts to change its security in the courts, ensuring that user security is protected.
That confirmation came as parent Facebook took to the courts in its fight against Israel’s NSO, which it alleges hacked its users, planting spyware on the devices of select targets through WhatsApp. The irony here, of course, is that the security of those users was breached despite end-to-end encryption being in place. WhatsApp has patched several security vulnerabilities in recent months. This was one.
The first surprise for WhatsApp came during the release of documents as part of those court proceedings. It transpires that FBI Director Christopher Wray once argued in favour of WhatsApp’s security when, as a partner with the firm King & Spalding, he “was hired to ‘analyze and protect’ WhatsApp’s software from a Justice Department effort to weaken its encryption in order to conduct wiretap.” The case was unrelated to this current one, but Wray’s name came up when Facebook was arguing for a conflict as regards King & Spalding’s involvement.
The FBI has pointed out that as a lawyer, Wray was hired to advocate for his clients, not to proffer his own opinions. But, even so, the optics are awkward, given that Wray is now a strong advocate of mandated government backdoors. And in that same vein, there has been another surprising twist in favour of end-to-end encryption in the last few days from an unlikely source.
On April 24, the U.S. National Security Agency published an advisory document on the security of popular messaging and video conferencing platforms. The NSA document “provides a snapshot of best practices,” it says, “coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security.” The NSA goes on to say that it “provides simple, actionable, considerations for individual government users—allowing its workforce to operate remotely using personal devices when deemed to be in the best interests of the health and welfare of its workforce and the nation.”
Again somewhat awkwardly, the NSA awarded top marks to WhatsApp, Wickr and Signal, the three platforms that are the strongest advocates of end-to-end message encryption. Just to emphasize the point, the first criteria against which NSA marked the various platforms was, you guessed it, end-to-end encryption.
“End-to-end encryption,” NSA says, “is encrypted all the way from sender to recipient(s) without being intelligible to servers or other services along the way... Only the originator of the message and the intended recipients should be able to see the unencrypted content. Strong end-to-end encryption is dependent on keys being distributed carefully.” So, no backdoors then.
NSA also warns that “no collaboration service can defend against a compromised device—resulting malware infections can access files, keystrokes, contacts, call histories, GPS locations, room audio or camera video (even when not on a call), and most any other information the device observes. Even the most secure collaboration service provides no protection against a compromised device.”
The industry argues that encryption backdoors will result in a weakening of end device security, making it more likely they will be compromised. They also argue that it cannot fall to them to determine good actors from bad—not all governments are forces for good, and who decides how each one should be treated. Messaging platforms are either secure or they’re not. NSA, it would seem, tends to agree.
As uber-secure messaging platform Signal has warned, “Signal is recommended by the United States military. It is routinely used by senators and their staff. American allies in the EU Commission are Signal users too. End-to-end encryption is fundamental to the safety, security, and privacy of conversations worldwide.”
Despite the surprising support WhatsApp—and by default the rest of the industry—has received this week, they remain on the back foot. It is likely that some changes will be legislated and the industry will be forced to compromise. Not good news for those who value their security, especially in these times of increased cyber risk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Knicks can’t show Mike Miller the same Scott Perry courtesy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leon Rose opted for a slice of status quo earlier this week when he decided to pick up Scott Perry’s option and bring him back for another year as the Knicks’ general manager. It is easy to shake your head and grumble at that, given what “status quo” means around the Knicks right now, and what it’s meant during Perry’s three-year run at the Garden.
The numbers are ugly — 67-163 — and would be even uglier if the Knicks had been able to play the final 16 games of this year’s schedule and keep losing 68 percent of them, which was the clip they were maintaining when NBA business was stilled. But you can make a case that Rose did the right thing here, for two very fair reasons.
First, Perry has a long enough track record in the NBA that he deserves to be judged independently and not in tandem with Steve Mills, with whom he shared decision-making duties. Also: Rose will have final say and thus will have oversight if oversight is necessary. Mills’ own record is enough of a train wreck that it shouldn’t spill onto Perry.
The same hold-the-line philosophy shouldn’t be extended to Mike Miller, who did a fine job under trying circumstances in his 44-game tryout as interim coach. Miller can certainly be in the mix to keep the job permanently, and should absolutely be given the opportunity to sell himself when Rose and Perry begin to look in earnest to make that move.
But it would be foolish not to acknowledge there are at least three formidable candidates who would surely, at the least, listen if approached.
I’ve already written that if I were Rose, I would make a big push to bring Jeff Van Gundy back. He is still young enough (58) to retain his old coaching energy and has kept sharp coaching international Team USA clubs the past few years. It isn’t a perfect hire: he hasn’t coached an NBA game in 13 years, and he has a terrific TV job now.
Tom Thibodeau, Van Gundy’s old lieutenant during the most recent Knicks glory run, does seem interested and this is a necessary path to pursue as well, because of his own record as a coach and the kind of credibility and gravitas he would bring to the job. And if the Knicks could use extra helpings of anything right now it is credibility and gravitas.
But the wisest choice of all may be right under their noses. Kenny Atkinson has worked for the Knicks as an assistant and he was doing superb work across the East River with the Nets before his surprising dismissal on March 7. There is still an air of uncertainty as to the details about that transaction but none of that should worry the Knicks because none of the elements of uneasiness in Brooklyn exist in Manhattan.
The Knicks need a worker, and they need a grinder, and Atkinson is the home office for both. He was handed mostly impossible rosters with the Nets and maximized every one of them, coaxing and cajoling them to both an unexpected playoff berth last year and a feisty first-round playoff tangle with the better, deeper, more talented 76ers.
The reward for that was supposed to be the talent windfall that arrived last summer: Kevin Durant on the layaway plan and Kyrie Irving immediately. From the start that seemed like a less-than-comfortable fit and something cracked — either the players hinted (or more) their reticence about the coach or the coach expressed an unwillingness to bend to their will.
Likely, it all falls somewhere in the middle.
And none of that is an issue with the Knicks. The Knicks have talented pieces, and intriguing young players, and on most nights this year that wasn’t nearly enough, and on some nights it was downright unsettling how noncompetitive they looked. That would end immediately on Atkinson’s watch. Anyone who saw his work at Barclays Center understands that.
“The secret I learned a long time ago is, you just can’t be afraid of hard work,” Atkinson said during a long conversation just before the start of last season. “You can’t worry about long hours. You can’t worry about how hard it all might seem. Put in the time, put in the effort, put in the sweat equity and there will be a payoff. There will absolutely be a payoff.”
Knicks fans are yearning for someone to give them a reason, any reason, to care again, to invest again, to live and die with the basketball team again. Yes, more skill must arrive. But it starts with the man who will coach that talent. Mike Miller is a good man. He’s done a good job. He would be a hell of a top assistant. And not a terrible Robin to a Batman like Kenny Atkinson.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pop star Kesha has cancelled her upcoming tour due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The singer had originally been set to embark on her High Road Tour in April, but postponed it amid the outbreak.
On Friday, she announced it had been cancelled, saying it is “no longer feasible” to aim for a 2020 tour and would aim to tour next year.
Writing on Instagram, she said: “This is heartbreaking, but the safety of my fans & crew is my number 1 priority.
“Because of the current situation, doing this tour in 2020 is no longer feasible. But that doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate and express ourselves together in spirit and online. I will do my best to bring you all as much art and music as I can, as we get through this all together.”
All purchased tickets will be refunded, Kesha said.
The star, whose hits include Tik Tok and Die Young, added: “I truly can’t wait to get back on the road again and play songs from High Road for you. Thank you for being here, and for your understanding. Please stay tuned for more info about new tour dates in 2021.
“I’m going to boogie with you SO hard next year. Stay well and stay strong, wishing all of you health!  XOXO. at the end of a storm comes a rainbow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brexit re-emerges from the shadow of Covid-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week’s sharp exchanges between London and Dublin over post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland were a reminder that the issue that dominated politics for three years before coronavirus remains urgent and unresolved.
The immediate dispute is about the lack of British preparations to implement the Northern Ireland protocol and the European Commission’s request to open an office in Belfast. But it reflects the mutual suspicion and pessimism surrounding the wider negotiations about Britain’s future relationship with the European Union.
Officials from both sides met in a video conference on Thursday to discuss the workings of the protocol, under which Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU rules on customs and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards after the end of the post-Brexit transition period on December 31st.
Before the meeting, which included officials from Ireland and a number of other member states, the European Commission circulated a seven-page document updating the 27 member states on its concerns.
“The commission expects the United Kingdom to provide the requested details, and detailed timelines, on the implementation measures it intends to take as a matter of urgency. The commission also expects the United Kingdom to enter into technical implementation discussions with the relevant commission services immediately,” it said, adding that work on IT systems and customs databases need to be ready by June 1st.
The meeting was described by both sides as constructive but when the commission published its note to member states later on Thursday evening, British sources complained that the document did not include a single mention of the Belfast Agreement or the peace process. London described the EU’s request to open an office in Belfast as a new demand that is not required under the protocol.
British negotiators have told their European counterparts that every step in implementing the protocol must have cross-community support in the North, although they promise that they will fulfil their legal obligations. The Europeans suspect that the British are dragging their feet on the protocol, hoping to play it into the main negotiations in an attempt to secure a better trade deal.

During last month’s negotiating round on the future relationship, Britain made clear it wanted to lighten the burden of customs declarations and procedures in a trade deal with the EU. A light-touch customs regime between Great Britain and Northern Ireland could serve as a model that would suit Britain’s purposes but the presence of France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Greece at Thursday’s meeting on the protocol suggests that they are alert to the risks.
Neither side now expects the transition period to be extended beyond December. Britain has said it will not request an extension before the July deadline and would not accept one if it was offered – and it will not be. But neither side expects much progress in the next two rounds of negotiations starting on May 11th and June 1st.
Some opposition politicians in Britain have suggested that coronavirus makes a delay essential, not least because the economic consequences of the pandemic are not yet clear. But for Boris Johnson’s government, that uncertainty adds to the urgency of severing ties with the EU.
“At the end of this year, the EU will have a new financial settlement and they will no doubt want to take all kinds of measures, just like we will, to deal with the consequences of this crisis and the aftermath. And, you know, this is such a huge crisis that we don’t know what they’re going to be but they’re going to be pretty significant. And when they do, they will be designing those laws for the 27, not 28,” a source close to the negotiations said.
“We will have no say in them. We don’t know what they’re going to be. We don’t know how much they’re going to cost. We don’t know whether they’ll see our conditions. And it does not seem sensible for us to continue to be bound into such an unpredictable situation. So it’s a version of the original case for Brexit, which is that we set our own laws for our own conditions.”
Downing Street celebrates last October’s deal to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with a front-stop – viewed universally in Europe as a comprehensive capitulation by Johnson – as a famous victory for British diplomacy. British negotiators believe a Canada-style free trade agreement is within reach if the EU abandons the demand for level playing field conditions on environmental and labour standards, state aid and competition.
“We’re not going to subordinate our laws to theirs in any areas. We’re not going to accept the European Court’s involvement in settling disputes, treaties,” the source said.
The EU insists that it cannot allow a country as big and as close to Europe as Britain to certify products for circulation in the single market in the way a country like Canada or Japan can. Germany assumes the EU’s six-month, rotating presidency on June 1st and Angela Merkel has made clear privately to colleagues that she remains determined that Brexit cannot be cost-free for Britain.
The coronavirus pandemic has exposed divisions within the EU over fundamental issues but British negotiators would be unwise to draw too much comfort from Europe’s internal rancour. The economic fallout is likely to make protecting the single market more important than ever to EU member-states, encouraging them to maintain a strong line in the negotiations.
The smart money in London and Brussels remains on a deal being agreed this year, although both sides expect it to come later rather than sooner. But the deal is likely to be a bare-bones agreement that will put British trade with the EU on a significantly less favourable basis than today.
Brinkmanship on the Northern Ireland protocol is undermining confidence in the good faith Britain brings to the negotiations and putting even a rudimentary agreement at risk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Is When IVF Clinics Will Begin To Reopen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Women whose IVF was cancelled due to coronavirus will soon be able to resume fertility treatment, the government has confirmed.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates fertility treatment in the UK, has announced that IVF clinics will be able to apply to reopen from 11th May.
Before they're allowed to welcome patients again, clinics will have to "show they're meeting conditions to provide safe and effective treatment during the [coronavirus] outbreak," the government has stipulated.
The HFEA officially halted all fertility treatments on 15th April, but many clinics had closed much earlier, when the Prime Minister placed the UK into lockdown on 23rd March.
Sally Cheshire, Chair of the HFEA, acknowledged that "the closure of clinics has been extremely distressing for patients" and said the reopening announcement "will be good news for those wanting to resume treatment and have the opportunity to try for their much longed-for family".
In April an anonymous frontline healthcare worker told Refinery29 she was "devastated" her IVF treatment had been cancelled, explaining that the journey to get to a position where treatment was even possible had been a long and complicated one.
"We knew that it was going to be challenging but we've done everything we can: changing our diet, changing our lifestyle, having regular counselling, being in touch with the clinic, getting all our financial affairs sorted, reorganising my work schedule," she said. "It feels completely ridiculous that it's just gone."
The government said it expects that "many private clinics may be able to demonstrate their readiness to restart services relatively quickly" after the 11th May embargo.
However, it also noted that "NHS clinics may require longer to achieve the necessary conditions", especially if their usual staff have been redeployed in frontline healthcare roles.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he'll be writing to local clinical commissioning groups this week to confirm they're in a position to resume treatment in their area from 11th May.
"People who are relying on fertility treatment have been worried during these unprecedented times not knowing when they could continue their journey to start a family," he said. "We wanted to open these clinics as soon as it was safe to do so, and our strict guidelines will ensure staff and patients remain safe as we continue to tackle this virus."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will African governments invest more in healthcare after</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The fact that the global pandemic, Covid-19, has exposed the deplorable state of health systems in Africa is not surprising at all. Will these systems examine their worth when the emergency has passed? Perhaps in view of the ongoing struggles to contain the virus, this question may not be a priority at this point. But it is an important one nevertheless. With all due recognition of the efforts that African scientists, physicians and other healthcare workers are putting into the fight against Covid-19 and into caring for the victims of the disease, all under hard working conditions, the obvious question has been whether or not they have a health system that gives them the tools, the weapons and the robust backing that an army at war needs to have. The answer is “no”. What they got is political and bureaucratic bluster. The exceptions to this reality are few and far between.
What Africa’s healthcare workers get are politicised emergency response announcements, lip service to the disease control measures, physical isolation orders that have proven draconian as to be counter-productive, and politicians who speak about the need for patriotism in this combat but then go about their own lives in violation of the very measures they want the rest of their populations to abide by. What the healthcare workers need most and are not getting are honest political decisions. They also need money, along with transparent systems for the public to know how these huge sums are disbursed. Right now, emergency funds have been announced left and right, but there have been no accountability measures to go with these funds.
All across the continent, national budgets show such paltry allocations to healthcare, often justified on the basis of resource dearth. This has meant that much of the financing and staffing of health systems has fallen on the shoulders of donor countries, the United Nations and International non-governmental Organisations; or on private clinics for the few who can afford.
In South Sudan, for example, more than 80 per cent of the country’s health services are covered by these foreign entities. The result is that these services are insufficient, uncoordinated and are not thought out well enough to respond to the country’s healthcare priorities. Instead, the foreign health interventions largely address the problems the NGOs and their donor countries deem as priority. Because the country’s healthcare system is run by foreign organisations, it does not include the development of the country’s healthcare cadres to any meaningful length and standards, beyond the rudimentary “nursing” or “midwifery” skills that are offered on the job. Biomedical research remains singularly in the hands of medical colleges that are housed in woefully underfunded universities, producing far fewer and ill-prepared medical officers than the country requires.
In Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, the trend is towards privatisation of the health systems. The big public hospitals, from Kenyatta National to Mulago to Muhimbili, these countries’ major referral hospitals and the training grounds for the best healthcare cadres, are left gasping for breath, as they struggle to retain the best physicians, pay their staff decent wages, obtain and maintain medical equipment and other supplies, provide quality care that is affordable for the vast low income populations that need their services.
Sadly, there have been no signs that governments of these countries would ever prioritise the health sector, to inject new investments into it or increase its budget by directing some cash away from, say, defence to revamp public hospitals, public health surveillance, sponsor research and stand ready to combat any health emergencies.
The challenge facing healthcare systems in East Africa does not stop at the decay of facilities but extends most importantly to staff morale as they struggle unsupported, unequipped and unclear about the processes of procurement and distribution of medical supplies. This has forced some of the best biomedical minds to seek work in private practices, where wages and working conditions are far better, but where they end up only catering for the small segment of population who can pay. Such private outfits, uncoordinated by any national body, cannot respond meaningfully to a public health emergency. This came to a head when the novel coronavirus showed up in Africa in late February.
This goes beyond the usual claim that attributes this poor investment into healthcare to the weak economies and lack of resources. It is primarily caused by corruption, where even the minimum funding allocated to health is diverted or wasted through mismanagement, much of which is hardly ever accounted for, as oversight institutions, parliaments and ethics commissions are toothless due to their subjugation by and submission to the presidency.
Lack of investment in health can also be attributed to a political leadership that lacks the will to act decisively, with the politicians of most African countries becoming the butts of all jokes, that they do not care about the well-being of their populations, that they abandon the national healthcare systems in preference for seeking their own individual and family medical care in foreign countries at the expense of the public.
In South Sudan, health budget stands at four per cent of the national expenditure in good years, a level of investment that has left physicians in public hospitals unpaid for months on end, forcing them to either flee the public system or reduce themselves to consultants for the NGOs and the United Nations. Meanwhile, 400 members of South Sudan’s parliament were offered cash of $40,000 (Sh4 million) each as car loans in 2019 and $25,000 (Sh2.5 million) as health insurance in 2020. They were also given additional monies outside their salaries, all as a way to buy their loyalty to the executive office. The entire illegitimate expenditure on the lawmakers amounted to a total of $28.1 million (Sh2.81 billion), a sum that could have equipped all the three major teaching hospitals, provide them with constant supply of water and electricity, hire their consultants, provide medications and then have more left to replicate those upgrades in seven other state referral hospitals throughout the country.
Similar echoes can be heard about big medical research institutes in East Africa, which have been drowning in under-funding, chronic maladministration, graft and nepotism. These conditions have rendered them unable to be at the forefront of the fight against outbreaks. Covid-19 pandemic has called their bluff.
The strategy adopted by most of the world’s governments is to “protect the health system” by “flattening the curve” and reserving resources for coronavirus cases. Africans seem to follow suit. But this approach not only has negligible benefits for Africa because there is really no health system to protect, the designers of physical isolation measures have also forgotten that it is near-impossible to achieve the level of isolation necessary to slow down or prevent infections when dealing with populations that are desperately poor, who just can’t stay home without their usual hand-to-mouth livelihood activities. At least not for much longer than this. On the contrary, spending the meagre resources on beating people into isolation diverts these resources from tackling the leading killers of Africans, malaria, complications in childbirth, Hepatitis B, child malnutrition, food insecurity and push back on violence as a public health scourge. How was it that the continent’s research centres could not see this and recommend a more suitable course of action is testament to the quality of health system they undergird?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dr Disrespect's Shtick Takes A Dangerous Turn Into Spreading Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a stream today, Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm, whose 4 million followers make him one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, shared two pieces of widely debunked coronavirus-related media with his viewers. Many viewers reacted with shock and disappointment. Others cheered him on. He never dropped his facade – never removed his trademark wig or sunglasses – but he seemed quite serious.
Dr Disrespect, who I’m beginning to suspect might not be a licensed medical professional after all, decided to voice his thoughts and feelings about the virus that has so far taken over 65,000 lives in the U.S. alone. He did this as an expression of solidarity with Elon Musk, who has spent the past week e-cosplaying as the wrong character from Deus Ex while arguing for an end to self-isolation and propping up the views of known conspiracy hucksters. But Doc ended up going much further than the billionaire.
First, Dr Disrespect read an article from The Hill, which Musk had retweeted, titled “The data is in – stop the panic and end total isolation.” This article, published to the site’s opinion section, draws many of its conclusions from a Stanford University study that suggested a much lower death rate than what is widely believed, but that came under immediate fire from scientists for failing to account for false positives in testing and questionable patient recruitment methods.
The piece also leans heavily into the idea of “herd immunity,” neglecting to mention the fact that scientists do not know for sure if prior covid-19 infection confers immunity nor how long that immunity would last. Generally, herd immunity requires a vaccine to be a truly definitive solution; otherwise there remains a risk of widespread reinfection. A vaccine is something we do not yet have and are potentially a long ways off from having. Despite all of this, people have argued that the author of the Hill opinion piece, Dr. Scott Atlas, is an authoritative source because he is a doctor. However, his background is in neuroradiology—not virology or epidemiology—and he’s a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institute, a conservative think tank that’s previously pushed sketchy coronavirus pseudoscience and characterised shutdown and isolation measures as an “overreaction.”
Nonetheless, Dr Disrespect reached the end of the piece and gave it his seal of approval. “Agreed,” he said. “Facts matter. Thank you, Scott.”
While reading through this article, he also highlighted a graph suggesting that some hospitals aren’t actually suffering from overcrowding. This drew quite a response from his chat, with viewers frantically typing that some hospitals only have capacity because social-distancing efforts are working. In general, chat was animated throughout. Many were incredulous at what Doc was implicitly endorsing.
“My grandpa died of this shit. Do you have a degree in virology? Speak what you know,” said one viewer. Others implored Doc to Google the Stanford study and read about how scientists had largely debunked it. But others cheered him on, praising him for pushing back against “the liberal establishment.”
Then Doc moved on to an even less credible piece of media: a viral video in which a doctor named Thomas Cowan, who is on disciplinary probation enforced by the Medical Board of California, makes the widely debunked claim that 5G cellular technology causes covid-19. Doc did not openly agree with the video, instead saying, “I’m gonna show something that is not directly related to what I just talked about. Something else, this what I’m about to show you, along with what I just read, combining the two together – that’s what gets me upset.”
There’s no need to take a point-by-point approach to that video’s many falsehoods. Cowan iterates on long-running conspiracy theories about electricity and viral illnesses that stand up to scientific scrutiny like a paper bag in a wind turbine. For example, he suggests that radio waves caused the 1918 Spanish flu, when the first commercial radio station began broadcasting in 1920. Things only go downhill from there. Despite the absurdity of it all, many people now believe that 5G causes illness, an idea that’s existed among anti-vaxxers and Alex Jones types since before the covid-19 crisis.
The ridiculous conspiracy video left Doc’s viewers even more dumbfounded than before, and they largely pushed back in chat. Some, however, voiced support, with a few name-dropping figures like Donald Trump and the eponymous Q of QAnon conspiracy theory infamy. Dr Disrespect did little to dissuade these people, chalking up elements of the lockdown to vague “agendas” that “we’ll just never be able to know or understand or get the true information from.” One viewer donated $3, prompting Doc to read their message aloud; the viewer said they were disappointed in the streamer and cited the virus’ United States death toll of over 60,000. “I’m aware, but thank you for the $3 donation,” Doc replied. Another donated $15 and praised him for the “balls” it took to say what he did about coronavirus.
Dr Disrespect ended the segment by imploring viewers to consider what he’d shown them.
“All’s I’m saying is that, me being about to talk about that, read that stuff, let’s just not be robots and say, ‘Yes sir, we will do everything you tell us to do, government, sir.’ Let’s listen to the experts and... I don’t know. Again, I gotta bite my tongue,” he said, later adding that his intention was to “get the brain kinda going.” He also clarified that he wants people to resume working because he keeps receiving donations from viewers who say they’ve lost their jobs. “It sucks, you know,” he said.
Perhaps Dr Disrespect was just trying to get people to think, but he used two very specific, conspiracy-minded examples and zero others. He’d also just stated that he agreed with Musk and would like to see America “open the gates back up.” In other words, he made his leanings clear. Moreover, he did this seemingly without vetting his sources of information, eliciting protest from many of his viewers. If we’re reading this whole moment as charitably as possible, it was, at the very least, hugely irresponsible on Doc’s part.
But it’s not surprising that he chose to do it. Time and time again, he’s acted with reckless irresponsibility while streaming, only to briefly lose his platform or not lose it at all, then reach even greater heights of success. He cheated on his wife and returned to a viewership record. He’s used racist accents on stream and faced no consequences at all. He streamed from a public bathroom during E3 and got booted from the convention, only to get his channel reinstated after just a couple weeks. He constantly walks a line between comedy and outright toxicity, never very carefully. Despite all this, he remains one of Twitch’s most-promoted faces, with numerous brand deals under his belt. At the end of last year, he even signed a TV development deal with Skybound Entertainment, the production company headed up by The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman.
In large part, this is all possible because of Dr Disrespect’s shtick. He’s almost always in character, and his character is rude and loud – a toxic gamer stereotype turned up to 11. It’s all just one big meme, y’all, so calm down. He doesn’t actually mean any of this stuff, except when he does, but he retroactively gets to decide when he does and when he doesn’t. As a consequence of this, the rules never fully apply to him, and when they do, who cares? Being shameless is part of his brand. It’s no wonder, then, that he decided to casually trot out a procession of coronavirus conspiracy theories. If history is anything to go on, he probably won’t face consequences (Kotaku reached out to Twitch and Dr Disrespect, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing). If he does, he can say he was just messing around, apologise on behalf of The Dr Disrespect Brand, and be on his merry way.
But there’s a nasty side effect to that approach: After a certain point, nobody can tell if you’re actually kidding or not. Already, some on Twitter are suggesting that Doc was just having a laugh today, despite the fact that he never said or implied anything to that effect. That makes his excursion into Infowars-lite territory doubly troubling. Many can tune into a broadcast like that, think, “that’s just Doc being a wacky edgelord again,” and then tune out. But others don’t know him that well, or they aren’t equipped with the same critical faculties. At no point did Dr Disrespect say he was kidding or otherwise signal that he was not 100 per cent serious. It stands to reason, then, that some people might come away from such a broadcast thinking “This person I admire seems to believe these things. Maybe I should, too.” Or maybe they’re already on the fence, and they just needed a beloved public figure to push them over.
To wit, before his guided field trip down conspiracy alley, Dr Disrespect himself said that he was already most of the way there when it came to believing that it’s time to reopen America, but Elon Musk emboldened him.
“I don’t need Elon to convince me,” he said just before he decided to take everybody down the rabbit hole. “But to have someone of his magnitude and his expertise – it’s pretty clear that he gets it in terms of humanity and where we’re trying to go... I’m on board with his type of thinking.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lord Henry column: We can't change Leo Varadkar for Micheal Martin at this critical juncture</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At this time, when we are struggling with the ramifications of the vile and deadly virus that is Covid-19, I take comfort from two facts.
The first and most immediate is that we have the good fortune to have as our Taoiseach a medical doctor who clearly understands the science.
Leo Varadkar comes from a medical family and his partner is a doctor. The last time I talked to the Taoiseach was, ironically, at an event held at the Castle for the World Health Organisation.
It was before the last election and I told him to be more empathetic. I think his recent direct re-engagement with the health service on a regular basis has been really positive in this respect.
Fair play to him. At an incredibly difficult time in our nation’s history we have him at the helm.
It is well to pose the question – whether it is appropriate to replace him with Micheal Martin at this critical juncture ?
The Taoiseach holds the confidence of the majority of the electorate, which is essential in maintaining the lockdown and whatever modifications he thinks are safe.
By all means continue with forming a government but please don’t change the captain when the boat is sailing safely.
However, don’t think I am losing my critical facilities. Without contact tracing, comprehensive testing and controlling our borders, all this collective effort will be to no avail.
Controlling our borders is really important. Remember cancelling the Italian match and yet letting all those Italian tourists in?
As a result how many contacts were made by that, in Malahide, Howth, Dalkey and the centre of Dublin. Let’s hope this caretaker government and its successor will have learnt a lesson.
We should look at South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand. They have controlled their borders, and the virus.
I am optimistic by nature and I have been praying for a solution to this vile epidemic and the economic pandemonium it brings in its wake. It now transpires that a group of scientists at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute have stated that if they get emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be ready by September. This is starting to look highly credible if it works. This could be transformative.
If true I can start planning Slane 2021 – our 40th anniversary.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Indonesian Liverpool fan has shared a series of photographs on Twitter that has touched the hearts of supporters in the online community.
@LFC_Erik is a medical health worker in his home country, and has Tweeted a few images which have grabbed our attention.
In one photograph, Erik can be seen holding a sheet of paper reading ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ and in another he’s saying he misses watching the Reds.
Hopefully someone at the club sees these Tweets and sorts something out for one of the many brave people working to combat COVID-19 around the world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pressure mounts on India to call out China for Covid as it readies to take lead role at WHO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: India is believed to have already come under pressure from some of its strategic allies and “like-minded democracies” such as Australia and the US to take a “firm stand” against China as it gears up to assume a decisive role at the World Health Organisation (WHO) later this month.
India will be assuming charge of the Geneva-based WHO’s executive board (EB) by May-end. The 34-member executive board, which is elected for a three-year term, will take the final call on India’s nomination at its 147th session, which will be held via video conference on 22 May, a WHO spokesperson told ThePrint.
The main functions of the board are to implement the decisions and policies of the World Health Assembly (WHA), which is the main decision-making body of the WHO, advise it on various matters and generally help facilitate its work.
However, with China coming under the scanner for its alleged role in the spread of the novel coronavirus, it will not be all rosy for New Delhi.
India is being nudged by some of its strategic allies such as the US, Australia, Japan and others to speak against China when it comes at the helm of affairs at the WHO, diplomatic sources told ThePrint.
In a recent phone-call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison, Australia is believed to have urged India that as a “natural partner and like-minded democracy”, Canberra expects New Delhi to stand with it as it prepares to launch a full-fledged inquiry against China and the origin of novel coronavirus from Wuhan. 
The public spat between Canberra and Beijing is an indication of deteriorating diplomatic ties between both the countries, which was brewing for quite some time now.
Sources also said Canberra will directly take up the issue with New Delhi when both Modi and Morrison hold a virtual summit meeting in May-June.
This meeting between the two leaders was expected to take place in January, but got cancelled due to the bushfire crisis.
Sources said Australia wants this to be a larger part of the discourse to be held under the framework of the Indo-Pacific, in which Japan is also a key partner.
“If the pandemic is to have any influence on Australia’s strategy, it will be to accelerate the very trends that brought Australia and India so close together… I believe this crisis will bring Australia and India even closer together as two Indian Ocean democracies with complementary values,” said Barry O’Farrell, High Commissioner-Designate of Australia to India during a speech at the National Defence College on 22 April.
The US, meanwhile, has also activated its diplomatic channels to push India to “come down heavily on China”, according to a top diplomatic source.
The source said Washington wants New Delhi to push for greater reforms and find alternate ways to bring in more transparency, while also urging China to “come up clean” regarding the origin and spread of the virus.
While Trump and Modi had a telephonic conversation in March, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar have spoken several times in the past weeks.
Sources said the issue of India assuming a larger role at the WHO figured several times during the discussions between the two countries.
The Trump administration has called coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” many times to target Beijing even as the relationship between the two nations was worsening with a raging trade war much before the outbreak took place.
On Thursday, Trump said his administration has launched a probe into the role of the WHO with regard to the coronavirus pandemic.
“I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they are like the public relations agency for China,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
He also said the US pays the WHO almost $500 million a year and China pays them $38 million a year.
“Whether it’s a lot more, it doesn’t matter. They shouldn’t be making excuses when people make horrible mistakes, especially mistakes that are causing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to die,” Trump said.
Earlier this month, during a teleconference with south and central Asian journalists, Pompeo had said the WHO has been “unable” to hold China accountable for the pandemic and called for sharing of “information, data and facts” from China. 
Without targeting Beijing directly, Prime Minister Modi had stressed on the need to “strengthen and reform” the WHO during the Extraordinary Virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit held on 26 March. 
During the summit, Modi had also said that since initially the WHO did not have the mandate to deal with a pandemic of this scale, therefore, it is critical to empower the organisation, “be it in terms of its capacity of early warning or development of effective vaccines, or capacity-building.”
Experts said India needed to be cautious on how it pressed the WHO leadership with regard to dealing with China and it should avoid a direct confrontation with Beijing.
“India’s new lead role in the WHO will give it an opportunity to wield more influence within a preeminent organisation perceived to be openly siding with China during the recent pandemic. India will need to be cautious in terms of how it presses the WHO leadership on China, given the importance of China’s role in the global response, problematic though it may be and given New Delhi’s own complex relationship with Beijing,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programme at the Wilson Center in Washington.
“This all flows into the broader question for India of what role it should play in the growing global consensus to take a harder line on China,” he added.
According to former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, it will not be conducive for India to “directly confront” China at a time when Beijing is important to fight the pandemic.
“This is more an election rhetoric by the US. So India should avoid a direct confrontation of any kind with the Chinese. Yes, this is a good opportunity for India to bring about change at the WHO in whichever way it can. We need to work within the organisation to change it and see how it can deal with or prevent future pandemics,” said Sibal.
Sibal also said India should “continue to emphasise on transparency much on the lines that the US has been speaking” without directly naming China.
Besides, Sibal also highlighted that when the powerful G-7 countries had shied away from making a statement against China during a summit meeting held on Covid-19 in March, then India should also act cautiously.
The G-7 nations are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘The Young And The Restless’ Actor Teases Impending Drama For Theo & Kyle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Rachel Dillin
The Young and the Restless recently ran out of new material amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the storyline for Kyle and Theo ended with Theo losing his job at Jabot and Kyle retaking the CEO position after wowing Jack.
Kyle (Michael Mealor) and Summer (Hunter King) tricked Theo (Tyler Johnson) into stealing what he thought was Kyle’s plan to present to Jack (Peter Bergman). When it came time to pitch a new direction for Jabot, Theo ended up giving Jack a presentation that Jack himself had given 15 years before, which left him infuriated at his nephew. Ultimately, Jack gave Kyle the option for how to handle the situation, and although Theo apologized and promised it wouldn’t happen again, Kyle ended up firing his cousin.
Recently, Theo actor Tyler Johnson dished some insight into his on-screen alter ego’s thoughts to Soap Opera Digest. Johnson teased that the tumultuous relationship between Theo and Kyle isn’t over by a long shot.
“I don’t think Theo is done with Kyle. Or Jack. He has, even more, to prove at this point. This lit a fire under him and raises the stakes; this is about family, honor, and accomplishment, and Theo’s setback only hardens his resolve,” said Johnson.
Unfortunately, Theo lost Jack’s respect by failing to come up with something original when it came time to help determine a new course for the Abbott family cosmetics company. Johnson noted that Jack had been both a mentor and father figure to Theo, so it hit him hard to suddenly find himself so at odds with his newly found uncle. The young man is determined to save face and make things right with Jack before its all said and done.
“Theo will find a way to make his frazzle and his dazzle work for him,” the actor predicted. “Theo is theatric by nature, and I don’t see him tonight down anytime soon; now that his back is against the wall, II can only imagine more. He knows how to make something out of nothing, and he’s been in this position before!”
The main reason why Theo ended up choking and stealing the work he thought was Kyle’s is that he’d grown attached to Lola (Sasha Calle). Right before Theo’s big presentation, Lola had to leave to put out fires at her restaurant in Miami, and the wind went out of Theo’s sails. He allowed his self doubt to sabotage him, and he ended up trying to take the easy way out, which bit him in the backside.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Speaks (Finally)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett has been silent during the pandemic.
Could this mean he’s uncharacteristically pessimistic about America’s chances this time—unlike his proclamation to “Buy American. I Am” during the Great Recession of 2008? Or could he be putting over $137 billion of cash to work behind the scenes—with no desire to tip his hand?
At today’s Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) meeting, livestreamed from an arena with over 17,000 empty seats, the Oracle of Omaha finally spoke.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway booked a nearly $50 billion loss in the first quarter, the company’s largest loss ever, and one that reflects the profound effect of COVID and lockdowns on the stock portfolio, but one that also reflects the recent accounting rule changes that require unrealized equity losses to flow through to earnings. And this obscures the fact that operating earnings, the profits from the wholly-owned businesses—everything from Dairy Queen to Duracell—rose 6% in the quarter to a healthy $5.9 billion. No doubt, Buffett has to keep significant amounts of cash on hand to ensure his businesses have enough liquidity. The unprecedented nature of lockdowns when owning so many consumer-oriented companies necessitates a cautious approach.
Buffett deployed a relatively small amount of cash to stocks during the quarter, spending just $1.8 billion. Some people are taking this as a sign that he didn’t see enormous value during the S&P 500’s 36% plunge in March—and may have missed the 30% rise that followed. But when you own as many operating businesses as Buffett, many of which are frozen like the rest of the economy, you certainly need to keep ample cash on hand to support them. After all, while Buffett is known for his equity investing, he’s also known for his prudence: he eschews leverage and maintains a fortress-like balance sheet.
But with $137 billion still on the sidelines, what Buffett actually says is most important.
He began by saying Charlie Munger is in fine shape and has mastered Zoom. He also thanked Dr. Fauci.
As to the pandemic situation and its effects, Buffett said, “it’s been a flip of the switch in a huge way.” But he pointed out that the range of possibilities with regard to health has contracted, with the virus neither resulting in the worst-case or best scenarios, given that the coronavirus is more widespread but less lethal than originally thought.
As to economic outcomes, Buffett said the range is unfortunately still enormous but that this is not the greatest challenge America has faced and that “the American magic has always prevailed and always will.”
Buffett stated that regardless of the current crisis, equities will certainly outperform Treasury bills over the long term and will easily “outperform that money under your mattress.”
He punctuated his speech with one particularly compelling slide: “Never bet against America.”
And with that Warren Buffett has spoken (finally).
Disclosure: I own Berkshire Hathaway stock in both my own and client accounts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rising Star Andrew Dunn: “Why it pays to admit ignorance”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a part of our series about stars who are making an important social impact, I had the distinct pleasure of interviewing Andrew Dunn.
Andrew Dunn (set designer) received his BA in Theater and Speech Communication from Siena Heights University in 2009 and his MFA in Acting from the Actors Studio Drama School in 2012. He has recently designed and built the sets for Displeyst at Under St. Marks, Beyond the Etchings at the DC and NYC Vietnam veterans memorials, and In Their Footsteps (Off-Broadway and international tour). Andrew also co-hosts The Media Lunch Break podcast and is an actor based in NYC. Visit http://www.Wildrence.com for tickets to his latest show: Nellie and the Women of Blackwell.
Thank you so much for joining us Andrew! Can you share with us the “backstory” that led you to this career path?
Asis usually the case, I fell into it head-first. The short version of the story is that I went to college to study acting, but my department was extremely adamant about releasing well-rounded theater folk into the world. Therefore, every theater major was required to study acting, directing, voice, speech, music, as well as set design, lighting design, sound design, stage management, and board operations. Rural Michigan (where I was at the time) had an overflow of actors, but not many tech people. I quickly got a job as a carpenter, was promoted to Head Carpenter, then to Technical Director, then I moved to NYC and started designing. I like building things. I equate it to playing with really big Legos.
Can you share the funniest or most interesting story that occurred to you in the course of your career? What was the lesson or takeaway that you took out of that story?
Back when I was still a young carpenter I was working on a production of the musical The Full Monty, which includes a scene where one character is in a car. We could have put four chairs on the stage and had the actor pretend to hold an invisible steering wheel, but instead, the designer went to the junkyard and had the cheapest car he could find towed to the back door of the theater. You have not seen ineptitude until you have watched five techies try to fit a sedan onto a stage by flipping it on its side.
The lesson? Work smarter, not harder; troubleshoot differently than everyone else; and — this last one is a direct quote from the Technical Director on that show — “Look out for that f***er Murphy,” because if something can go wrong, it will.
What would you advise a young person who wants to emulate your success?
Be honest. As honest as possible. If someone asks you to do something you don’t know how to do, tell them you don’t know how to do it. If you’re just starting out, there’s a good chance you’re working for someone who can teach you. Let them teach you. Ask a ton of questions. Ask questions you already know the answers to. Even if people get mad at you for asking the same questions over and over, they’ll be angrier if you put yourself or someone else in danger because you don’t know what you’re doing. If they don’t know how to do it, help them troubleshoot the problem. Be proactive. Be a people-pleaser. Do whatever you can to get the job done quickly, professionally, and safely. Even if that means admitting ignorance.
Is there a person that made a profound impact on your life? Can you share a story?
My mom was the strongest, kindest person I’ve ever met. I didn’t understand as a child, but we constantly had guests who would stay for days, weeks, or sometimes months. I thought it was just for fun (like a slumber party), but as an adult, I realized it was because they were people who needed help: Women who couldn’t take their kids back to an abusive husband; addicts who’d lost their jobs, homes, and families. One time she ran out of the house barefoot in the rain with an umbrella because she saw a woman crying out on the street. She gave the woman the umbrella and led her into our home, cooked her dinner, called the police, and got her to a shelter. Before I make any decision, I ask myself what my mom would do.
How are you using your success to bring goodness to the world? Can you share with us the meaningful or exciting causes you are working on right now?
I try my best to stick with organizations that work to maximize the accessibility of the same core values that I have. Diversity, equality, and economic justice are some of my strongest values. Over the summer I worked with a theater company that specializes in telling Shakespearean stories from a feminine perspective.
Currently going up in NYC, Nellie and the Women of Blackwell is an immersive telling of Nellie Bly — the real-life stunt reporter who had herself committed to an insane asylum in NYC in order to expose the terrible treatment of the patients. These were women who were not “insane”. Many of them were committed to simply not speaking English. It’s a terrifying, but necessary peek into America’s past of misogyny, racism, classism, and nationalism.
And it’s important to see the trajectory: This play only takes place about 100 years ago. Justice and equality move slow. And it’s important to keep moving forward and not stay stagnant. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect.
Can you share with us the story behind why you chose to take up this particular cause?
I assume it’s because of my upbringing. We moved around the US a lot, so I got to see many different kinds of inequality. And I got to see my mom constantly fight for justice.
I was also raised entirely by women. With my mom, my grandmother, my sister, my two aunts, three female cousins, and now a niece, I think I absorbed a lot of sensitivity in my developmental years.
Can you share with us a story about a person who was impacted by your cause?
Infinite Variety Productions — the production company putting on Nellie and the Women of Blackwell — is doing SO MUCH to help spread the true stories of important (and usually overlooked) women from American history. They currently have two shows in preproduction at the same time with a lot of overlap in the cast and crew. No one in the production company has any free time. I’d say we constantly pull double-shifts, but we can’t because there are no shifts. We’re all on the clock, consistently. And it’s entirely so we can help tell these stories with the goal of expanding knowledge and acceptance about women from the past and present.
Two years ago we were fortunate enough to perform a show about women in the Vietnam war at the Vietnam Women’s Memorial in DC. It was an incredible honor. And I’ll be surprised if I ever again feel as humbled as I was to be in that space, sharing those important stories.
Are there three things that individuals, society or the government can do to support you in this effort?
Oh boy, are there EVER!
What are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why. Please share a story or an example for each.
You are a person of enormous influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. 🙂
Hopefully, Greta Thunberg is already doing that. A young, non-American woman, spreading facts about Climate Change? Hopefully, this helps tackle some classism, nationalism, sexism, and ecological apathy.
If I can find any way to help that’s better than what I’m currently doing, I will.
Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you explain how that was relevant in your life?
“Every time you’re planning to say something, ask yourself three quick questions first:
I believe Craig Ferguson first coined this list. I heard it as a young man, and it has helped me a lot. Any director worth their salt will tell you that the things you say aren’t as important as the things you DON’T say. If there’s a scene with ten people screaming and one person quietly sitting, you’ll be fixated on the person sitting. Silence can be loud. And it’s important to be able to read the room to see how you can be most helpful. If it doesn’t need to be said, don’t say it. That being said, a good laugh can help ease tension. So feel free to let some jokes fly. Just ask yourself if it’s needed first.
As a young man, I used to be wild, hyper, and vibrant. You’d never guess that by talking with me now. I made a huge shift when I realized it wasn’t getting the results I was hoping for. Now I think about every sentence before I voice it.
It’s also worth noting that if you’re just talking to sound impressive, there’s a good chance that someone with an actual solution to the problem is waiting for you to shut up. And the best idea in the room always wins, so do what you can to promote the best ideas from everyone.
We are blessed that some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Politics, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them 🙂
I’m a simple man, and honestly, there’s no one I’d rather have a conversation with than my fiancé Melinda. She’s the best. Super supportive, always carefree, and never selfish. I’ll get lunch with her any day.
Thank you so much for these amazing insights. This was so inspiring, and we wish you continued success!
Thank you so much. It’s been a complete pleasure.

    <h5 class="mb-1">One big change you can expect when buying a new house post-Covid-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This past month has been a tough for all, says Bryan Biehler, managing director of Huizemark. Not only were we required to make drastic changes to our daily lives, but we have had to push through the worst-case scenario on the business front.
As the property market continues to remain in a static position, agents will need to adapt to a new way of working, Biehler said. “Everything is going to change, and in ways we don’t even know yet.”
“Although technology and digital transformation has been something Huizemark has kept as a priority during its growth, we’ve never lost sight of the value of the relationship we have – not only with our clients but with our Agents and Franchisees too,” said Biehler.
He said that even during the lockdown period, franchisees and agents were still making up to 30 calls per day. “We have always focussed on providing a property solution, not simply selling a house.”
Biehler believes that buyers will soon need to be financially ‘pre-qualified’.
“In a negative economic environment, sellers are going to want to know what the financial position of potential buyers is if they’re going to agree to access due to the potential risks involved,” he said.
Huizemark already saw this trend taking shape based on the stats the team pulled three weeks into lockdown. 52 virtual Showhouses have already taken place since lockdown, with 101 listings, 36 bond applications, 127 appointments with clients after Lock-down and 45 sales.
Franchisees have been urged to expand their digital boundaries to make sure they’re influencing and engaging within their networks in not only a verbal way, but a digital way too.
“Estate agents will need to up their game as far as their skillset is concerned and will need to be prudent with how they evaluate the properties they’re trying to sell,” Biehler said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says the coronavirus cannot stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(This May 2 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of "towel" in second paragraph)
By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States' capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (N:BRKa), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year's bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic "quite an experiment" that had an "extraordinarily wide" range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American "magic" prevailed before and would do again, he said.
"Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it," Buffett said. "I will bet on America the rest of my life."
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINES
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be "considerably less" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire's cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said "we're willing to do something very big," perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won't be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its "entire positions" in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL).
Buffett said he "made a mistake" investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed "in a very major way" with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
"It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls "Woodstock for Capitalists."
ABEL SHARES THE STAGE
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in "fine shape" and "good health," and looked forward to attending Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett's eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors "I don't see the culture of Berkshire changing" after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn't be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, "we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today."
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co (N:AXP), to Berkshire's board, making him the company's first African American director.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South’s two no trump bid, in competition, showed the same range as a jump to two no trump would have shown without the two- spade overcall — 18-19. North bid aggressively after that to an excellent slam. 12 tricks would have been easy with a 3-2 split in either red suit.
East won the ace of spades at trick one and continued with the queen of spades to South’s king. If anyone had four diamonds to the jack, surely it would be West, so declarer led a diamond to dummy’s king and a diamond back to his ace. East having four diamonds was a surprise, not to mention a disappointment, but it did help South to get a count on the hand.
East was known to have a six- card spade suit and was now known to have started with four diamonds. Three high clubs showed that East had started with two clubs and a singleton heart.
Was the singleton heart the jack? That was against the odds, as there were four little hearts missing also. The chance that East’s singleton heart was the jack was four to one against.
South backed his judgment by leading the 10 of hearts from his hand, intending to run it if West played low. West chose to cover with the jack, although it didn’t matter. South captured this with dummy’s ace. He returned to his hand with the king of hearts and led a low heart to dummy for the proven finesse against West’s nine of hearts. Very well played!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mom and Pop Brush Off Wall Street’s USO Warnings After 80% Drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warnings are blaring everywhere about the dangers of owning the U.S. Oil Fund, the star-crossed security for tracking crude. On Main Street, investors say they understand the risks and aren’t deterred by them.
The $3.5 billion exchange-traded fund has been a hot spot for retail investors, who piled in as oil prices plunged amid an unprecedented supply glut. The ETF’s popularity with mom and pop fanned concern that individuals don’t understand the structure of USO, which tracks futures rather than just the price of oil. United States Commodity Funds LLC, the fund’s owner, was forced into a series of unusual actions as the crude market seized.
But 48-year-old Vaibhav Shukla says he knew exactly what he was getting into when he bought shares of USO last week after the price of May futures plunged to negative $40 a barrel. Given that the ETF no longer invests in the front-month contract, Shukla used it to wager that demand for oil will snap back.
Another snag in the security’s wiring, its halting of share issuance, has caused the ETF to trade at a premium to its underlying value. That adds to the appeal of a long position, at least temporarily, Shukla said.
“Right now, USO, as well as crude, is dislocated. When it’s dislocated, there is an opportunity,” said London-based Shukla, whose main source of income comes from owning several technology companies. “Once it comes to normal, I might move to trading my futures rather than USO.”
Shulka, who spends three or four hours a day trading from his at-home battle station, is among the thousands of individuals who have poured money into the ETF in recent weeks. The number of investors at retail trading platform Robinhood holding it spiked above 220,000 this week, according to Robintrack, a website unaffiliated with the site that uses its data to show trends in positioning. That compares to 32,000 at the beginning of April.
USO has morphed into a much different product over that stretch. After years of tracking the front-month oil contract, the ETF rolled forward its holdings several times last week to longer-dated futures and warned it may see “significant tracking deviations” to its benchmark. On Monday, the issuer said it’s unclear if USO will ever be able to return to tracking the front-month contract.
Daniel Fernandez, a 30-year-old data scientist who lives in Pittsburgh, was among Robinhood’s newly minted USO holders. After watching the price of crude plummet, Fernandez searched for oil ETFs to express his view that May’s planned production cuts would fuel a rebound in the commodity. Last Thursday, he decided to buy shares of USO through his Robinhood account. However, he ended up selling those shares a few days later.
“I looked for an ETF with exposure to oil and this was the first that I found and it was the biggest one, so I thought it was a good one,” Fernandez said. “Then I kept researching and found this contango thing.”
After reading a Seeking Alpha article that described the perils of the futures roll when longer-dated contracts are more expensive than near-term ones, Fernandez decided he wanted exposure to futures that don’t expire anytime soon. He’s since bought shares of the United States 12 Month Oil Fund LP (USL), which contains further-out contracts. He’s also considering investing in the Invesco DB Oil Fund (DBO).
USO’s name recognition will continue to give it a leg-up in attracting flows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The ETF has pulled in nearly $6 billion this year, and hasn’t posted an outflow since April 7.
“I think most people just associate USO with oil,” said James Seyffart, a BI analyst. “It’s by far the largest and most-traded. I bet most people have no idea what USL or DBO are.”
USO climbed more than 12% Wednesday and Thursday after executing its reverse split and as oil prices recover. It stumbled Friday, and even after the rally, the ETF still lost 8.2% in the week, and has lost over three-fourths of its value this year.
Still, that’s good news for 22-year old William Morton, who bought shares of USO at 3:58 p.m. on Monday for his personal portfolio. Morton -- who qualifies as neither mom nor pop, given his job as an analyst at Citigroup -- figured USO would make a good hedge for his holdings in oil tanker stocks such as Nordic American Tankers Ltd. And the issuer’s scramble to shore up the fund -- which included repeatedly reshuffling its futures lineup and a 1-for-8 stock reverse share split -- gave Morton confidence that USO wouldn’t go bust.
Also, the ETF had just plunged 15%. Sensing a bottom, Morton clicked “buy” on his Schwab account.
“Some people are saying liquidation, but seeing they’re doing the reverse stock split and management’s doing everything they can to keep it alive, I didn’t think that was a possibility,” said San Francisco-based Morton, who’s currently sheltering-in-place in Philadelphia. “I probably wouldn’t have bought if I didn’t see that they’re in survival mode right now and doing everything they can to keep the ETF afloat.”
Shukla in London says USCF was prescient in moving USO’s portfolio away from the front-month contracts. S&P Dow Jones followed with a similar move on Monday, when it said it will roll all of its oil contracts for June into July. The index giant cited the risk that the nearer contract will go negative.
“People are beating them down for it, but what they did was they started detaching themselves from the front-month future much ahead of everybody else,” Shukla said. “Why would you want to track the front-month when it’s down 20% and the rest of the curve is not?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">RuPaul's Drag Race season 12 queens ranked after Superfan Makeover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Happy Makeover week, RuPaul’s Drag Race fans!
It’s another one of the firm favourites of every season, and this year they brought in the superfans for a surprise glossy transformation – and it was every bit as wholesome as we would’ve hoped.
Given six excited an eager cisgender women to slap a mug on, there were a lot of happy and sad tears as the series heads towards its final stages.
The fans brought a new lease of lives to the queens and gave them a much needed reminder of just how fun this show can be – which is nice, considering some of the frontrunners have fallen under the pressure of the competition.
Now they’ve taken some drag babies under their win and gave them the opportunity of a lifetime – complete with a lipsync extravaganza.
Throw in Star Wars starlet Daisy Ridley, clearly as much as a superfan as the rest of them as she sat on the judges panel (seriously, this series’ celeb guests have been almost complete perfection), this latest instalment was just pure joy.
Due to events after the episode was filmed, Sherry Pie will not be in our rankings.
She might not have won this week, but Crystal bringing a glam Bert and Ernie to the runway? We have no choice but to stan.
Crystal and her partner Opal Methyd was the driving force of pure fun this week, and they seemed to be loving every second of getting to know each other.
Over accessorised clown realness by way of the late 80s is this year’s look and we’re buying it.
Every moment of the queen and the kindergarten teacher bringing everything they had on and off the runway made us beam.
She was our winner this episode, and we love it.
Jaida absolutely killed the couple ups this week, and she earned her spot at the top of the leaderboard, landing her third win.
Her new drag daughter Jazz Essence Hall was definitely struggling a little bit on the runway in those heels, but mama knows best and she definitely showed that with her pep talks.
Stunning as always with curves and swerves to die for, Jaida is now one of the frontrunners for the crown with good reason.
This week was almost made for Gigi, whose costume design background and high fashion eye is well established in this competition.
But yet again, she seemed safe as the others started taking bolder risks in order to stand out and rise up.
Bebe Badde definitely looked stunning and the pair earned their place as safe, but we’re going to need you to step up your game, girl, you’re in the semi-finals!
Heidi N Closet is a great name and it is a CRIME that they keep trying to make her change it – but saying that Heidi Afrodite has a little bit of a ring to it.
Nicole/Honey Almighty definitely had a bit of trouble with her self-esteem, but if anyone can rise her spirits in this competition, then it’s Heidi.
But we already done knew that make-up and design wasn’t necessarily Heidi’s strong suit, and she missed some valuable opportunities to make them look more like family members.
Like Ru and Michelle pointed out, it was the little things, like painting on a gap, or using the same material for both their outfits, that would’ve made all the difference.
Landing in the bottom two for the third time, Heidi is now treading on thin ice to keep herself in the competition, and we all know ‘if they have to lip sync for their life every week they will’ never gets anyone to the final.
Let’s just hope she manages to keep herself in the game enough to make it to the final.
Jackie Cox and Tiffany (like the jewellery) were definitely not bad this week – which makes this lowest position so frustrating because, as the judges consistently say, it’s ‘splitting hairs at this point.’
They just weren’t as strong as their competitors for some reason, with Ru and Michelle rightly saying there was something in their chemistry that just didn’t gel as much as the others
They both looked bleedin’ fabulous though, and new drag daughter Lil Snacky Cox fully brought it on the runway as a lifelong Drag Race fan.
We’re glad that Jackie managed to bring it for another day because our heart broke at the idea of our two faves going head-to-head, but we’re need to keep our fingers crossed that she’ll up her game next episode.
RuPaul’s Drag Race continues Fridays on VH1 in the US and Saturdays on Netflix in the UK.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Surviving COVID-19: How a Fil-Am nurse and his family fought coronavirus at home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ARIZONA, United States – Drawing from their shared frontline experience, a Filipino-American nurse and his wife helped their family survive the deadly coronavirus disease in the comfort of their own home.
Dennis Cabangbang, 43, works in the orthopedic and neurological care unit of a public hospital in Connecticut – a state that borders New York, the center of the coronavirus crisis in the US. Prior to this, he worked for more than a decade as a respiratory nurse – an expertise that would later prove useful for him.
Dennis took care of coronavirus patients. Like most US and global hospitals, his workplace has a huge shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). (READ: Working with fear and anxiety: Filipino nurses as UK frontliners vs coronavirus)
By the end of March, he started feeling mild symptoms of back pain, abdominal pain, and fatigue. He later developed a fever while his body pains got worse.
He got tested and the results hardly surprised him. Dennis – a nurse for more than two decades – already knew he had contracted the disease.
“I already expected that I would test positive because a lot of our patients in the unit have the virus. Unlike other countries, we don't have reliable PPE. We’re not actually ready to handle this kind of situation. I handle at least 5 patients every day but it can go as high to at least 7 during night shift,” Dennis told Rappler in an interview.
A few days after, his symptoms worsened. By the second week of April, his fever hit 41 degrees Celsius and he started having difficulty breathing.
Despite this, Dennis and his wife Gerarda, an emergency nurse who also deals with COVID-19 patients, decided that he should just stay at home.
'Worst pain I ever had'
The couple said they don’t give the same advice to patients. It was different for them, they said, because they both have experience treating COVID-19 patients. Dennis also has a background in respiratory care.
“We don’t recommend it. But we are in the medical field. We know when to send patients out. I know that if he gets worse, he would have to be intubated…. Basically we’re closely watching his progress…. The coaching and knowledge we have helped a lot,” said Gerarda, who worked in the Philippines during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s.
“Since we are both nurses, we decided it would be best for me to stay home because I would be able to move more in the house and I would have more food options. I will be closely taken care of here. We would just call our primary physician,” Dennis said.
At one point, his oxygen level went down to 88%, a cause of concern for otherwise healthy individuals. A movement as simple as walking to the bathroom felt like climbing a mountain.
“Later on, I developed shortness of breath, cough, and more intense fatigue. I was catching my breath even just going to the bathroom. My body joints hurt a lot. It was the worst pain I ever had. I could not even finish my sentences," he said.
“So what I did was do prone positioning (lying face down) just so I could catch my breath. I also did the knee-to-chest position," he added.
One of the doctors in his wife’s hospital gave him the antibiotic azithromycin, usually used alongside hydroxychloroquine, a known malaria drug, to treat coronavirus. Dennis said he did not take the latter, as it could only be accessed in a hospital.
On top of this, he regularly took cough syrup and acetaminophen – more commonly known as paracetamol in the Philippines – every 6 hours to ease his fever.
No place he’d rather be
Dennis also resorted to other non-medical tools and relief in his fight against the virus: a leg compression or massaging device to avoid clotting of the blood, menthol candies, and hot ginger tea.
He also did the Trendelenburg position, wherein the extremities were positioned higher than the torso "so I could release secretions and so that they would not end up in my lungs."
"I had very sticky secretion in my chest," Dennis said.
Despite being isolated in his own home, there’s still no place he’d rather be. He attributed his recovery to the warmth of their home. He lives with 6 other family members: his wife, 3 children, a sister, and his mother-in-law.
“Here, I can move around. I can eat what I want – more on soup and tea. In the hospital, there are only a few options. My thought then was that I would gain energy faster at home than in the hospital. I said I would go to the hospital if all our applied knowledge won't work," he said.
When he exhibited symptoms, Dennis isolated himself, first, in their basement, then later in their recreational vehicle (RV).
After 3 weeks, his symptoms were gone. But he couldn't be retested due to the lack of testing kits. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention return-to-work criteria for healthcare professionals include a symptom-based strategy, wherein staff are allowed to return 3 days after recovery (defined as resolution of fever without medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms); or at least 10 days since symptoms first appeared.
Virus spread, family torment
Despite his isolation efforts, the couple’s eldest son was not spared from the disease. Fortunately, this time they were able to quickly address the symptoms.
“Our son's first symptoms were sore throat and a little body ache, so we told him to get himself tested immediately.... Of course, I felt guilty because he got it from me," Dennis said.
After testing positive, their son started taking the same antibiotic, azithromycin. Unlike Dennis, his son did not experience shortness of breath – just fever and body pains.
"We are thankful we were able to nip it in the bud," he said.
Now his son remains isolated in their basement while recovering, while he remains in the RV.
As for Gerarda, she continues to work in the emergency room. So far, she said, she had no symptoms. But whether or not she contracted the disease was still unknown. After all, nurses in the US could only get tested if they show signs of the disease.
With almost everyone in their family serving at the front lines, the past few weeks were nothing but tormenting for her.
Their daughter, 19, works as a secretary in a nursing home. Their younger son and her 65-year-old mother work in a dairy store, a considered an essential business in the state. All, except Gerarda, stopped going to work to do self-quarantine.
“It’s been a rough 3 weeks for us…. We are 7 in the family. It is difficult knowing it’s gonna be you next…. Social distancing at home is very hard. It's torture to think they might have it," Gerarda said.
“This is the longest time my husband I have been apart. It's difficult running a 7-person household alone. I felt I was by myself taking care of the whole family," she added.
Now that Dennis has recovered, life goes on for him. On Monday, April 27, Dennis went back to the hospital after being cleared by a physician.
The couple are more than thankful that their family conquered the virus. The battle, however, does not end there. As with other healthcare workers, the family remains on guard.
“The fear is always there. This is a horrible disease. I've never seen this much death,” Gerarda said. – Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marni Jameson, All for Art’s Sake – Couple Donates Everything They Own to Museum</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not having kids is a good way to save a bunch of money. Not that I would know. Besides, I wouldn’t trade my kids for a bigger bank account — on most days.
Being childless can also be really good for the arts. Ask Virginia and Ed Fultz, of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fifteen years ago, the married art lovers decided to leave their entire estate to their local museum. That is everything — their house, car, investment portfolio, and their considerable art collection — altogether worth a few million, give or take.
“If we’d had children, they would have been our priority,” Virginia told me last week, when I called her and Ed to talk about their gift. “But that didn’t happen, so we went in a different direction.”
They put their money where their hearts are.
Ed and Virginia met as teenagers while attending West Texas State College. They married during their junior year, 55 years ago. After college, they taught high school in El Paso for 10 years, and made the most of their summers off by traveling.
“We didn’t grow up in homes with art,” Virginia said. “What we knew of art, we’d learned from books.”
However, during the summer of 1968, that changed. Over three months they visited every country in Western Europe. “We did the Europe-on-$5-a-day plan because it fit our teacher budget,” she said. They hit every major museum.
"That first trip to Europe was so eye opening,” Ed said.
“It was like this grand feast,” Virginia added.
Indeed, on their first visit to the Louvre, in Paris, she recalled, “We could barely afford lunch there. Then the waiter brought this lovely hors d’oeuvres tray and two glasses of wine that we couldn’t afford. We saw this nicely dressed gentleman sitting nearby and knew it was from him.”
Art patrons are a generous bunch. Virginia and Ed are paying those moments forward.
Ed left teaching and took a management job with a trucking company, and in 1981 was transferred to Albuquerque, a city he and his wife loved for its art and culture. Because no teaching positions were available, Virginia began selling real estate.
They continued to travel and buy art. Today their large (and growing) collection includes pieces from other countries, and many from their native Southwest.
“We don’t buy what someone else likes,” Ed said. “We buy what we love. It doesn’t have to have value, nor do we need to think it will become valuable,” although some of their pieces are by artists who have become known.
As for whether any of it will wind up in the museum, the Fultzes have no expectations. Though the Albuquerque Museum has first dibs, “if they say they don’t want anything, we will not be offended,” Virginia said. “We’ve gotten our enjoyment.”
Meanwhile, they continue to appreciate their local museum’s collection.
“We often go and spend a couple hours there, have lunch and a glass of wine at the café and talk about art,” Virginia said. “Every time I go, it thrills me to know they will benefit from us someday. They’ve given us so much more than we’ll ever give them.”
To prepare their art collection for the ultimate handoff, when items will either go to a museum or be sold for cash, the Fultzes have an art file. Each piece has a folder with information about the artist and the artwork, and the story behind how they got it.
“The problem is we have to quit collecting,” Virginia said.
“That’s not going to happen,” Ed said.
“We are so behind on our files," she said.
“If you saw our walls, you would laugh," he said.
“Truly, we are not allowed to go to an art show for a year,” she said.
“We’re going to one next week,” he said.
Deciding to leave your estate to a cause you love is step one. The next challenge, the Fultzes found, becomes how. Here’s what they learned:
• Name the right entity.
In 2005, the Fultzes named the Albuquerque Museum as their beneficiary, but last year, they met Emily Blaugrund Fox, executive director for the museum foundation, and learned they should name the Albuquerque Museum Foundation as beneficiary. The city owns the museum and so controls donations to it.
“We didn’t want some city mayor to use the money for another project,” said Ed, who updated his will accordingly. The foundation is set up solely to support the museum.
• Don’t do it alone.
Work with an attorney to make sure your will conveys what you intend, and is valid under your state’s law. An attorney can also make sure your will spells out exactly what you want to leave and to whom, lists all assets, and names the executor.
• Be specific.
Make clear how you want your gift to be used. The Fultzes earmarked their donation for art acquisitions.
“Others may designate funds to support exhibitions, capital improvement or education,” Fox said, “but don’t restrict the gift too much.”
• Find a trustworthy representative.
Naming your executor, or personal representative as they’re called in some states, is a pivotal choice.
“We did not want a relative to do this,” Ed said. “We did not want to inconvenience our nieces and nephews or cause any infighting.”
Initially, they’d asked a younger friend to handle their estate. After that relationship changed, they asked Fox if she would do the honors, so all the money could go to the museum. That posed a conflict, so Fox declined.
“We need the separation in case the family has questions later. We can’t open the museum to liability,” she said. Finally, the Fultzes hired a trust company. For a percentage of the estate, the company will handle the sale of the art and other assets, and disburse the proceeds.
• Tell the recipient. Do let whomever you’re leaving an asset to know you’ve named them in your will, Fox said. Be sure they want it.
“We may not want grandma’s hanky collection, cherished as it is.”

As we transition from April into May (yes it's May already), it's been a bumper week of news for Apple. Straight from the horse's mouth, we had Apple's Q2 earnings call, the first official indication of performance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw a first look at the Beta for iOS 13.5, which contains provisions for Apple's new contact tracing technology, created in partnership with Google. Tim Cook even announced that Apple Stores in Austria and Australia will reopen next week! Fresh from the rumor mill, we also got a sneak peek at the prices for Apple's upcoming iPhone 12!

After enduring plenty of questions about the price of the iPhone 12, Jon Prosser just decided to go ahead and tell us. Turns out, the cheapest iPhone 12 might cost just $649, with the most expensive one starting at $1,099. All of these phones are rumored to feature 5G and an updated design featuring square edges.

The first beta of iOS 13.5 was released earlier this week, and the headlines are all pandemic-related. Firstly, Apple is going to make it easier to unlock your phone if you're wearing a mask, skipping straight past Face ID, and going to your passcode instead. The beta also includes a first look at Apple and Google's contact tracing solution.

A rumor earlier this week stated that store employees had been told that Apple expects to begin reopening stores in May. Sure enough, just a couple of days later Tim Cook told us that Apple's stores in Australia and Austria would reopen as soon as next week!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Metallica play ...And Justice For All classic Blackened under lockdown conditions
Metallica have released a video of them playing Blackened under lockdown. 
The footage appeared on the band's social media channels accompanied by the message, "Here’s a little something we cooked up over the last few days. Hope you’re all safe & sound. Have a great weekend." 
Blackened, a song about the destruction of the environment, originally featured on the band's 1988 album ...And Justice For All. Itwasthe only track from the album to feature a writing credit for then-new bassist Jason Newsted.
Earlier this week, Lars Ulrich revealed that the band could possibly record an album this year, telling Salesforce,  "All four of us are in four different locations in four different states right now. But one topic of conversation on these weekly sessions is what does it look like going forward? What will the next couple of months look like? What will the rest of the year look like? 
"And what will the next decade look like in terms of how do we create, how do we write music, how do we record music, how do we share music, and how is it all going to look with the uncertainties ahead of us.”
He adds: “As we sit here, we go, ‘Maybe in a month or two from now, is there a chance that the four of us can be together maybe at our studio here in northern California, if the quarantine and stay-at-home orders subside?’"
Metallica are currently sharing live shows from their archive every Monday, the most recent being an epic Black Album performance filmed in Muskegon, Michigan, in 1991.
Earlier this week, Classic Rock published the Metallica Doodle Map, an interactive map featuring videos of all Kirk Hammett and Rob Trujillo's local doodles from Metallica's WorldWired tour.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written by local author Penny Byrne, What’s in your pocket, Peg? tells the story of Peggy, who arrives in Jersey to stay with her aunt and cousins.
The story follows Peggy’s time in Jersey with snippets of what life was like under German rule. On each page readers are able to guess what is in Peg’s pocket. It also features Jèrriais throughout.
The Channel Islands Co-operative Society’s Grand Marché stores in St Helier and St Peter are among those stocking the book, which is raising money for Age Concern Jersey, the British Red Cross (Jersey), Holidays for Heroes Jersey and the Royal British Legion Jersey branch.
A total of 2,000 books have been printed which, if they all sell, will raise more than £18,000.
A number of Islanders have worked together to bring the project to life including Aaron Labey, managing director at Labey Limited, sponsors Margaret Thompson of Thompson Estates and Islander Kate Taylor, and illustrator Lauren Radley.
Mark Cox, Co-op acting chief executive, said: ‘It’s important that our younger generation learn about Jersey’s history and the stories of those who lived through the Occupation are remembered. This children’s storybook is a perfect way for our young Islanders to learn that history.’
Ms Byrne, who has also written Seymour’s Seaside Picnic, which raised money for the Jersey Child Care Trust, said: ‘I’ve always wanted to write a children’s book about the Occupation, and the Liberation 75 celebrations seemed the perfect time to do it. The book is designed to work on a number of levels – to appeal to younger readers who might enjoy guessing what is in Peg’s pocket, as well as to older children who want to discover what life was like under German rule.
‘There is plenty of other information for teachers and adults as well. Thanks to our very generous sponsors and the Co-op, all proceeds from the sales of the book will be shared equally between four local charities.’
Mr Labey added: ‘I’m delighted to see this project come to fruition. Penny and the team have worked tirelessly to get this book off the ground and I feel privileged, on behalf of Labey Limited, to have played a part in making it happen. I feel very proud to be from Jersey and mark this huge day in our calendar.’
The book, which costs £9.99, is also on sale at Waitrose stores, Marks & Spencer King Street and the post offices at Rue des Prés and Broad Street.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Change in the Pound over the years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Our 1930s Picture From The Archive the other day featuring the Pound Inn at Leebotwood sent Alan Bason of Shrewsbury dipping into a 50-year-old book to contrast and compare.
Called Historic & New Inns of Interest, the book was sponsored by the Shropshire Star and cost 3/6d, which is about 18p today.
Alan has been studying the picture of the Pound Inn which was used in that book, which obviously dates from pre-decimal days – so before 1971.
"The main differences are the gable ends, lamp, plaques, and sign. It would seem that the hedge had gone by 1968, and I've no idea what is the thing at the bottom of the roof above the car in the original," he says.
"I don't think telephoning Leebotwood 255 will be much use either," he adds – that is the pub's phone number carried in the book.
The old book says it is a Bass Charrington establishment and describes the Pound as "a lovely, picturesque old building, with a splendid thatched roof – not very common these days – and a rambling, old-world structure.
"Built in 1650, and most certainly a renowned coaching house in days of yore, the Pound is well known today for the excellence of its refreshment."
The speciality of the house, it adds, is the "Pound Mixed Grill."
"But be warned – this meal is for people with a hearty appetite."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trains for migrants: ‘Officials told us at 11 pm, we packed clothes, rushed’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vasudev Singh was sleeping when the announcement came. Officials came to the makeshift labour colony at Sangareddy, some 40 km from Hyderabad, around 11 pm Thursday and told them to pack their bags; they were going home. “We packed a few clothes and rushed. We were screened, given token numbers, asked to show our Aadhaar cards, and then told to board buses. Around 2 am we left for the train station,” says the 45-year-old construction worker from Garhwa in Jharkhand.
Three hours later, Singh was among the 1,200 migrant labourers who left for Hatia, Jharkhand, from Lingampalli Railway Station in Hyderabad on board a special train — the first such to run since the start of the national lockdown on March 25. The 22-coach train was arranged by South Central Railways after the Telangana government made a request to the Railway Ministry.
The workers who were sent back Thursday were employed at a construction site for IIT Hyderabad Phase 2 buildings, work on which is at a halt. Many of the labourers said they hadn’t been paid their dues.
“We have been living crammed in shanties at the camp, surviving on bare minimum food and bad facilities. I hope to finally see my family,” said an emotional Sanjiv Kumar, from Kurgi in Jharkhand, as the train set off.
However, while Kumar hoped this would happen as early as Saturday morning, the Jharkhand government will screen them and may keep them in quarantine on a case-by-case basis.
The decision to send the labourers home followed two incidents of violence at Sangareddy between the men seeking wages and their supervisors. They also clashed with police. Later, the workers petitioned Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who placed a request with the Centre to get the workers back. Jharkhand had earlier said it could not get back an estimated nine lakh people stranded outside the state on its own.
Jharkhand Principal Secretary Amrendra Pratap Singh, head of the coordinating team for bringing the labourers back, said the state was informed on Thursday night, and Telangana decided the passenger list.
Secretary Rahul Sharma, coordinating with officials in Telangana, said, “We had sent them a list of 16,000 people stranded in various parts of the state. Initially the Centre said people would be moved by road, but yesterday evening we were informed they were sending a special train.”
Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimat Ray said, “Upon arrival in Hatia, each migrant worker will be welcomed with a mask and a flower. Thermal screening will be conducted along with videography of the entire process. Sixty sanitised buses have been prepared for their onward movement to respective districts.” Ray said they would put the passengers in home or institutional quarantine in their districts, based on medical screening.

A South Central Railway official said the labourers were screened for symptoms before being allowed on the train. “To ensure social distancing, we removed the middle berth so that instead of 72 passengers per coach there were only 54. It is a non-stop train so the Telangana government arranged food and water.”
Sangareddy Divisional Revenue Officer M Nagesh said they had ensured an adequate number of food packets, including breakfast, lunch and dinner. “They were given eight bottles of water per head and we counselled them on the precautions to take,” Nagesh said.

A Telangana official said they would make arrangements for the remaining labourers in the state too in the coming days, though this may take time now with the extension of the lockdown. About a thousand workers from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal continue to be stuck at the Sangareddy construction site.
Saying they were mistreated by their supervisors, one of the labourers, Devendra Mandal, said, “When we tried to tell them we wanted to go home and demanded our money, they scolded us. They kept saying we would be paid next month. Our families cannot survive if we don’t send money home.”
Speaking about last week’s incident, Sangareddy SP Chandrashekar Reddy said, “The workers said they had not been paid since February and complained of lack of proper food and accommodation.”
District Collector M Hanumanth Rao said he had issued a notice to the construction firm employing them to pay their wages.
However, as several labourers left saying they had been told they would be paid later, Rajesh Singh, 38, from Ranchi was among the lucky ones. Going home with Rs 19,000, his dues since January, he said, “I don’t know when I will return but till that time this money will be useful.”

Among those who said he was owed money was Khusbir Singh, a labour contractor. “The company has to give me around Rs 3 lakh. It paid only a portion of it.”
Speaking to The Indian Express from onboard the train, Vasudev Singh said, “As soon as the train started, we made videos, clicked photos and sent them to our family members.”
Hamid Raja, returning home with Rs 400, said his family in Garhwa started crying when they heard the news. “After a month of uncertainty, this feels like heaven.”
At 11.15 pm on Friday, the train arrived at Hatia. Waiting for the labourers were welcome hoardings, roses, food, masks, doctors ready to screen them, 200 policemen on the ground and drones in the sky, plus buses labelled Samman Rath (Dignity Chariots).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Rachel Dillin
The Young and the Restless preview for Monday, May 4 teases a classic episode from October 31, 1981, which is when Nikki, who was a stripper at The Bayou, first visited the Ranch. The Mustache learned that there really was something to be found on the other side of town. The second week of Y&R‘s classic flashback themes focuses on Victor and Nikki’s lifetime of love.
Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) visits Victor’s (Eric Braeden) Ranch for the first time, and Victor tests their chemistry with help from his friend, Colonel Douglas Austin (Michael Evans), according to SheKnows Soaps. The moment comes not long after Douglas and Victor visited The Bayou and watched as Nikki had the men in the room, cheering wildly and eating out of her hand. From nearly the very beginning, Victor found himself smitten with the sexy showgirl. Just a few weeks after Victor first laid eyes on the future Mrs. Newman, he arranges for a time for her to visit his domain.
However, The Mustache has a test for Nikki to pass first because Victor certainly needs to protect his vast wealth from anybody who might have ill intentions or wrong reasons for being in a relationship with him. It seems he’s concerned that the exotic dancer may be a gold digger, so he comes up with a test for her, and Colonel Douglas Austin helps him out. Instead of the lord of the manor, Victor poses as the butler, making the Colonel act as the owner of the vast estate. Throughout Nikki’s time visiting the mansion, Victor is stuck catering to the whims of the Colonel. Ultimately, they set up a choice for Nikki. Victor is penniless, and the Colonel is powerful and wealthy. It’s all one big game to see who she’d choose between the two of them. After all, Victor doesn’t want somebody who is only after his fortune. Plus, he’s not entirely sure if somebody like Nikki is good enough for him.
As long-time viewers know, Nikki ended up choosing Victor, but he didn’t end up wanting to marry her, and they shared a one-night stand before she married somebody else. However, their one night together led to pregnancy for Nikki, and later, a paternity test revealed that Victoria was Victor’s daughter. Not too long after that, he and Nikki got married in an absolutely stunning ceremony that viewers were treated to a few weeks ago during a Friday Flashback replay.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MELANIE WHELAN: AFL at odds with gambling issue in sport, COVID-19 opportunity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WE WANT our footy back, but at what cost?
Sports betting as the biggest drug lining our game has been made increasingly clearer as life in isolation has set in. The AFL has a chance to make a big stand in this space, setting the tone for what is acceptable on our football grounds right down to our community leagues.
Instead the AFL's silence on this issue speaks volumes in the months after extending an exorbitant partnership with a betting agency earlier this year.
Former Geelong Cat Allen Christensen speaking up on the toll COVID-19 lockdowns was having on his gambling recovery.
The 28-year-old, now a Brisbane Lion, had spoken in the past about the triggers of walking past certain Geelong pubs where he had raked in a big win. Now he was being bombarded at home with tempting advertisements indoors.
Christensen told Real Drug Talk podcast he could understand some people could have a bet but there was a fine line for many on what could be a dangerous mindset, sitting at home and saving money by not going out at weekend and looking for entertainment.
Online gambling rates in Australia increased by 67 per cent during the first week of April alone, analytics group AlphaBeta showed.
Markets like the colour of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's tie each morning.
Ballarat Community Health doctor Deb Greenslade and health promotions manager Louise Feery told The Courier online gambling, including poker machines, might seem like a stress release - but online gambling companies were exploiting this. BCH was concerned the result would be more stress and anxiety in uncertain times.
Health experts are urging everyone to use this time to take stock of our lives during this isolation period.
In all this suspended reality right now, AFL leaders should be taking a good hard look at our game. The money might be tempting but what kind of message does it really send?
Western Bulldog Easton Wood was vocal on the AFL's partnership extension earlier this year. Wood led a pack of players prepared to take a pay cut to reduce the industry's gambling revenue.
He has long been outspoken on the conflict in putting all players and staff through mandatory education on the dangers of gambling while at the same time getting paid by it.
Wood told The Courier last year when you were bombarded with gambling advertising you did not always question it.
Wood was concerned the impact on children during school visits when young fans would question "who's the favourite" rather than "who are you cheering".
We want our footy back in some form (except maybe AFLX) at all levels of the game. Revenue is a huge headache for all clubs, including all our football-netball clubs across the region.
What form a footy return takes can also be a major opportunity if those leading the game take the time to really think about it. Such talks should not be in isolation.

Sotayo Sobola: The Coronavirus pandemic has changed so much about the way we live, talk, reason and even relate with our fellow humans. And in the wake of the lockdown imposed nationwide by the Federal Government for the past five weeks some rather strange emotions and thoughts have been emanating from people, even the so-called celebrities who always love to put up a front.
As the lockdown lingers like forever there have been all sorts of wishes and prayers, some healthy and some, not so. For the popular Yoruba actress, Sotayo Sobola, famously known as Sotayo Gaga her own prayer is for her debtors to remain alive to survive the pandemic.
“Lord, I’m using this time to pray for the people owing me o. They must not die. Amen,” she had said on her Instagram page.

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne opens door to City exit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the first time in a long time, Kevin De Bruyne left in the air the possibility of changing team next season. All of this is linked to the possibility of the club being in the Champions League or not if they don't avoid the sanction. "Two years can be long. I'm waiting to see what happens", the Belgian said.
Kevin de Bruyne is pure talent, and for now, a Manchester City player. However, the sanction of 2 years without playing in Europe, has changed his way of approaching things, he said in a chat with the Belgian news outlet 'HLN'. For the first time, he opened the door to changing club.
If the English club's appeal is not successful, the elegant midfielder will consider a way out. "The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they are almost 100% sure that they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what happens. I have confidence in my team. Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years (without European football) would be very long. If it's a year I could see it," he said.
De Bruyne also said he would not link his future to that of Guardiola: "I will not let my decision depend on what Pep does. Of course, I have already worked with other coaches and when Pep leaves I will have to continue working with someone else".

The Belgian international, who is being stalked by Madrid, referred to the proposals that have been coming to him in recent years. "There have been many teams that have enquired. But, to be honest, I'm very happy at City. I play for one of the best teams in the world, I play in England, the most competitive league, and I like that. It's still a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What's coming, is coming. But it's not like I've tried to leave City in those five years. I've also kept my cool for my previous transfers. I've never had any problems and I've always waited for my moment," he said. 
De Bruyne ended his speech by denying "real conversations about a contract extension. I don't know what will happen. We're a bit in limbo with everything that's going on in the world right now. When the season finally ends, there may be a chance to look ahead. This is not the time to think about it right now," he concluded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wait, what? Mercedes-Benz Sprinter handed the off-road treatment...</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hartmann tuning's Vansports division has revealed 4x4 upgrades for the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, handing the all-wheel-drive variant of the Stuttgart automaker’s bus a suspension lift, underbody protection and all-terrain tyres.
Based on the third-generation Sprinter, the Vansports-tuned model offers 110 mm more ground clearance up front, while the rear suspension has been lifted by 80 mm, as well as a more favourable approach angle. Riding on a set of 18-inch solid, five-spoke lightweight alloys, traction has improved, too, thanks to the fitment of thick all-terrain tyres.
Aluminium underbody panels protect the engine, transmission and rear differential when traversing rough terrain, while fender guards, which the firm says “blend harmoniously” with the slab-sided bodywork, protect it from unwanted stone chips and scrapes. Side strips can be specified, too.
According to the company, the Sprinter can now be utilised as a “workhorse in fields and forests, on construction sites, or as a 4x4 motorhome”. To test this claim, the German tuner took the modified Mercedes to the ADAC Driving Safety Center in Grevenbroich.
How much does all this equipment cost? Provide Vansports with a donor vehicle and the tuner will convert your standard Sprinter to an off-roader for €7 780. At the current exchange rate, translates to around R155 000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Nintendo Direct In June Is Beginning To Seem Less And Less Likely</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A few days ago, Venture Beat's Jeff Grubb said a Nintendo Direct presentation wouldn't be happening this June around the time E3 2020 should have been taking place.
The same report went on to reveal how Nintendo was currently in the process of "telling partner developers" it wouldn't be holding a Direct next month, following the official cancellation of E3. If you weren't entirely convinced at the time, Eurogamer's own sources have also been able to support this. A story on its website goes on to mention how Nintendo won't be going ahead with a presentation because "it needs more development time" on first-party releases:
According to the original report by Venture Beat, Nintendo was putting together an event for June, where it planned to show its first-party schedule for the rest of this year and reveal the rumoured Super Mario 35th Anniversary remasters.
Jeff Grubb is the same individual who said two Nintendo presentations would air before the end of March this year, and they did (there was an Indie World Showcase followed by a Nintendo Direct Mini). More recently, he backed up the rumours about the Super Mario 35th anniversary remasters with his own sources – adding that there would be a new Paper Mario game returning the series to form.
Nintendo hasn't made an official statement about whether or not a Direct will go ahead next month – or if there'll even be one, but it has previously stated it would "continue to be flexible and redirect [its] efforts" to keep fans up to date, after the cancellation of this year's E3.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hrithik Roshan Shares An Emotional Memory With Rishi Kapoor: “I Used To Get Up, Heart Palpitating…”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hrithik Roshan on Friday took to Instagram to express how much he is missing Chintu uncle, as he called the late actor Rishi Kapoor.
“Even your love had so much energy that I had to stand at attention every time you called. I don’t think I have ever in my life been able to continue sitting down when you spoke to me. Everytime dad called and said ‘chintu uncle just saw your movie and he is calling you’, I used to get up, heart palpitating and start walking around in the room, preparing myself for the deluge of love and reprimand mixed so genuinely together in your own inimitable way that it was difficult for an observer to distinguish which was which,” the actor wrote.
Mentioning how Rishi Kapoor acted as a mentor in his life, Hrithik further wrote: “You gave me strength at my weakest moments. It felt so god damn amazing to think that Rishi Kapoor liked my work. That It made me believe in myself. Thank you for every time you picked up the phone and took the effort , thank you for repeatedly pointing out my mistakes , thank you for that consistent support and encouragement chintu uncle, there will never be any actor or human like you. Thank you for being my childhood , for literally shouting out loud into my ear drums about the importance of hard work. And for being so blatantly and ridiculously honest that it made me believe every single word you ever said . I and the world and everyone you touched and inspired is going to miss you. So so much.”
Rishi Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan have appeared together in the 2012 movie “Agneepath” directed by Karan Malhotra.
Rishi Kapoor passed away on Thursday morning after a battle with cancer. The 67-year-old actor breathed his last at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital in Mumbai.

    <h5 class="mb-1">English football legend David Beckham turns 45</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: When an 11-year-old David Beckham walked into a local newspaper office in east London with his mother in 1986, the trainee reporter summoned to reception could never have known he was about to meet a future international football and cultural icon.
Speaking in barely a whisper, the blonde-haired schoolboy, prompted by mum Sandra, said he had won the Bobby Charlton Soccer Schools skills competition and a trip to train with Barcelona, then managed by Terry Venables.
A story went out, one of a multitude that in years to come would chronicle a Roy of the Rovers tale that took the son of a plumber to fame and fortune beyond his wildest dreams.
Six years later, Beckham fulfilled his childhood ambition by making his first-team debut for Manchester United before going on to captain his country and become a Galactico at Real Madrid.
Explore Briefs
Beckham, one of the so-called "Class of 92", went on to win six Premier League titles under Alex Ferguson at United alongside youth-team buddies Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, and Gary and Phil Neville.
Beckham also won two FA Cups and, memorably, the Champions League in 1999. He topped up his trophy collection with a La Liga winners' medal for Real Madrid and added two MLS Cups during a north American adventure with LA Galaxy.
That barely begins to tell the story, though.
Midfielder Beckham, widely regarded as one of the sweetest strikers of a football in English soccer history, was destined for more than the sports pages.
In 1999, he married one of the Spice Girls, a British pop music sensation at the time, becoming one half of the country's new Golden Couple.
Instead of "just" being a key cog in Manchester United's dominant team of the 1990s and early 2000s, he became a brand, as big a name off the pitch as on it.
High-end companies fell over themselves to sign Beckham up. On billboards around the world, he modelled everything from expensive underpants to watches and sunglasses.
Actors Tom Cruise and George Clooney became pals and even Prince Harry was keen to socialise with soccer royalty.
"Bend it Like Beckham" became a box-office smash and Beckham was even credited with winning London's bid to host the 2012 Olympics, his charm helping sway the IOC vote.
Even after his playing days, father-of-four Beckham is rarely out of the news. He part owns new MLS franchise Inter Miami as well as Salford City.
The door to all that, and an estimated net worth of $450 million, was opened by football gifts.
Venables recalled meeting that boyish Beckham at Barcelona's Nou Camp,
"As we said goodbye I made sure I would not forget his name," he said.
Had his grandfather got his way, Beckham would have signed for Tottenham Hotspur, then managed by Venables. The forms were already printed out, but Beckham only had eyes for United.
After helping them win the FA Youth Cup in 1992, Beckham made his first-team debut months later in the League Cup.
He returned from a brief loan spell at Preston to ignite his Old Trafford career, making his Premier League debut in 1994.
RAISED EYEBROWS
Ferguson's decision to give his "fledglings" their wings at the start of the 1995-96 season initially raised eyebrows. Pundit Alan Hansen famously quipped "you'll never win anything with kids," after an opening-day loss to Aston Villa.
Instead, with Beckham flowering as United's right-side midfielder, they scooped the Premier League and FA Cup double.
On the first day of the next season, Beckham launched a 60-metre shot from inside his own half over Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan and the world sat up and took notice.
Weeks later Glenn Hoddle handed him his England debut and he went on to earn 115 caps. From 2000 to 2006 he was captain.
Beckham's celebrity status infuriated some, straining his relationship with Ferguson so much that the fiery Scot famously threw a boot at him in 2003 and cut his eye.
When he was red-carded for kicking Argentina's Diego Simeone in the last 16 of the 1998 World Cup, fans and media lambasted Beckham for the defeat. A Beckham effigy was strung up outside a London pub, such was the venom aimed his way.
Yet out of adversity, Beckham grew. He led England to a famous 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier in 2001 and his metamorphosis from villain to hero was complete when he curled in a trademark free kick against Greece at Wembley to clinch a place in the 2002 tournament.
Although England's so-called "Golden Generation" never managed to land a trophy, Beckham went past Bobby Moore's appearance record for an outfield player in 2009 before injury ended his hopes of playing at the 2010 World Cup and his international career.
Post-United Beckham never quite scaled the same heights at club level.
When he joined Real Madrid in 2003, 500 journalists turned up for his unveiling at the Bernabeu.
It was not until his final season in 2006-07, however, that Real won La Liga, by which time the Beckham circus was plotting a course for LA Galaxy and the Hollywood stage his fairytale career demanded.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Evans has joined Instagram and offered a virtual hangout with the Avengers as part of the All-In Challenge.
Evans, who plays Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is the latest celebrity to offer fans a once-in-a-lifetime experience in aid of the coronavirus relief effort.
He had been nominated by his fellow Hollywood actor Chris Pratt, who is auctioning off the chance to be eaten by a dinosaur in the new Jurassic World film.
Announcing his own prize – a virtual meeting with his Avengers co-stars – Evans posted his maiden Instagram video and said: “This is a great cause, this helps get food to people who are in need during this Covid nightmare, so I am very happy to be doing this.
“Now I saw what Pratt is offering, I can’t compete with that, I can’t get you eaten by a dinosaur. But here’s what I can offer: a virtual hang out with me and five of my closest friends: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.”
Evans, 38, added: “We can do a private Q&A, you can ask us anything, we’ll spill the beans, then maybe some games. I would recommend Scattergories.”
He then nominated Marvel actors Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie as well as Pose star Billy Porter.
The All-In Challenge raises money for charities Meals On Wheels, No Kid Hungry and America’s Food Fund.
Other celebrities taking part include Leonardo DiCaprio, Drake and Kim Kardashian West.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Suerphero costumes have come a long way. From rubber onesies to Batman armor, things have taken a swift turn since Ruth E. Carter’s Oscar-nominated Black Panther costumes helped changed the game, as have costume design for Wonder Woman to Birds of Prey.
Next to dazzle the screen is the costumes for the forthcoming Cinestudios fan series Impulse, which is slated to have a September release on YouTube, after it’s completed in Australia.
The film, directed Joshua Hoareau, follows Bart Allen, son of The Flash, who is a boy with super speed powers and the ability to time travel. Since Impulse made his debut in DC Comics in 1994, we’ve known him as a sprightly kid with zing—and zig zags.
Impulse’s costume designer Edurne Fernandez shares exclusive drawings, photos and stills from the forthcoming production, which tells the story of one untold superhero. Though the costumes have been built in Los Angeles and shipped to Melbourne for production (which has been put on hold because of the pandemic), Fernandez speaks from her L.A. studio about 3D printing masks, fabric hunting and Hollywood’s greatest lesson.
From Impulse to Perfectly Natural and FLOTUS, you have worked on a lot of sci-fi film sets, where do you start with this kind of costume design?
Edurne Fernandez: Doing sci-fi has always been fun for me. I see it as a mixture of styles and elements we know and recognize with things that are totally new and made up from the imagination. The key is to keep close communication with the director and, with the production designer, come up with a world that resembles as much of the original idea as possible. Research and mood boards are helpful because they are a great way of visualizing what we are trying to accomplish.
How different is it designing contemporary style in a film or TV series versus costumes for a sci-fi or fantasy superhero series? 
People always say that designing contemporary style projects is easier, but I don’t necessarily agree with that. When something has a contemporary style, of course you relate to it because it is something that is happening right now or happened in the near past but costume design is much more than just going to the most popular clothing store and buying the new style of jeans and t-shirts. Costume design is more of a character creation and comes from figuring out deep down who this character is. It is almost as if you and the director were building the personality of the character and that is going to determine what they are going to wear. We sit down to analyze what aspects make each character different from the rest.
What kinds of things do you talk about?
We talk about personality, likes, dislikes, background, among other things that influence what the actor’s costume is going to be when he or she is portraying the character. We talk about the background and baggage of these characters, what makes them who they are, and this background is influenced by the situation or the time period they are living in. So designing for contemporary or sci-fi features requires deep understanding of who the person is, even if you are bringing back someone from World War II, using Barack Obama as a reference or making up a character for 50 years in the future – who they are and how they are living is going to determine what they wear and what they look like.
What was it like working on Impulse, and what did you want to achieve with the costumes?
I am so lucky I got connected with this amazing group of filmmakers and that they trusted me from the beginning with their vision. Even though we have been working long distance because they are based in Melbourne, we are in close communication. Since Impulse characters are based on the DC Comics, we had to keep a close eye on who they were, with and without the superhero costumes. Joshua Hoareau, the director, and creator of the production company Cinestudios wanted to stick as close to the original DC Comics costumes as possible
Where did you begin?
After doing a lot of research on this acclaimed comic, and following Josh’s intuition and expertise, I started digitally sketching each costume. Then, I started searching for the right materials to create these costumes. I sourced a great variety of fabrics and textures here in Los Angeles that fit the needs of each character. I also had to keep in mind while looking for the fabrics that because the actors are portraying superheroes, they are going to perform their own stunts, so I had to make sure the materials were not going to restrict their movements in any way and were as comfortable and practical as possible.
How did you realize your designs?
With specific silhouettes and designs, we decided to build the costumes with the help of a tailor. I had to draw a series of technical sketches to help the seamstress get the correct details of the design. We are also using a 3D printer to mold and create all the accessories such as masks, visors and belt buckles. For the moment, we had to pause the work because of the pandemic. For now, the only costume that has been completed and sent to Australia is the main Impulse costume. The other three superheroes will have to wait until everything goes back to normal.
What has working in Hollywood taught you? 
Hollywood has taught me that there is no small project, job or task; and that there is a place for everyone, if you have the passion and drive to do it. I’ve always been a person who doesn’t give up and works hard to achieve what she wants and, while being in Los Angeles, out of my comfort zone, I’ve come to realize that it is never easy, but it can be done.
What else?
Hollywood has also taught me that there is no small story and that every story is worth telling, if it is told right. It has also made me realize that we are in charge of giving a voice to those who don’t have one and that it is our duty to use this amazing vehicle of expression to bring these voices to the front of the line and let them speak. When I am working on a project, it is not about me, it is about the character I am designing and bringing to life, to tell their stories, their pain and their successes. Every single late night, extra hour or early call is worth it if you have the passion for it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ali Dia is without doubt the biggest chancer to ever grace the Premier League. He may have only played around 50 minutes of football, but it was 50 minutes too many.
The story of how he ended up at Southampton is well-known at this stage. The club got a phone call saying that George Weah's cousin was available, and Graeme Souness ended up playing him that weekend after a few days on trial.
It is often said that the club and manager were conned, but speaking on Sky Sports the Scot said he knew Dia was useless. It's just that he didn't have another player to use instead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day: Born May 2, 1975: David Beckham, English footballer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - When an 11-year-old David Beckham walked into a local newspaper office in east London with his mother in 1986 the trainee reporter summoned to reception could never have known he was about to meet a future international football and cultural icon.
Speaking in barely a whisper, the blonde-haired schoolboy, prompted by mum Sandra, said he had won the Bobby Charlton Soccer Schools skills competition and a trip to train with Barcelona, then managed by Terry Venables.A story went out, one of a multitude that in years to come would chronicle a Roy of the Rovers tale that took the son of a plumber to fame and fortune beyond his wildest dreams.Six years later, Beckham fulfilled his childhood ambition by making his first-team debut for Manchester United before going on to captain his country and become a Galactico at Real Madrid.Beckham, one of the so-called "Class of 92", went on to win six Premier League titles under Alex Ferguson at United alongside youth-team buddies Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, and Gary and Phil Neville.Beckham also won two FA Cups and, memorably, the Champions League in 1999. He topped up his trophy collection with a La Liga winners' medal for Real Madrid and added two MLS Cups during a north American adventure with LA Galaxy.That barely begins to tell the story, though.Midfielder Beckham, widely regarded as one of the sweetest strikers of a football in English soccer history, was destined for more than the sports pages.In 1999, he married one of the Spice Girls, a British pop music sensation at the time, becoming one half of the country's new Golden Couple.Instead of "just" being a key cog in Manchester United's dominant team of the 1990s and early 2000s, he became a brand, as big a name off the pitch as on it.High-end companies fell over themselves to sign Beckham up. On billboards around the world, he modelled everything from expensive underpants to watches and sunglasses.Actors Tom Cruise and George Clooney became pals and even Prince Harry was keen to socialise with soccer royalty."Bend it Like Beckham" became a box-office smash and Beckham was even credited with winning London's bid to host the 2012 Olympics, his charm helping sway the IOC vote.Even after his playing days, father-of-four Beckham is rarely out of the news. He part owns new MLS franchise Inter Miami as well as Salford City.The door to all that, and an estimated net worth of $450 million, was opened by football gifts.Venables recalled meeting that boyish Beckham at Barcelona's Nou Camp,"As we said goodbye I made sure I would not forget his name," he said.Had his grandfather got his way, Beckham would have signed for Tottenham Hotspur, then managed by Venables. The forms were already printed out, but Beckham only had eyes for United.After helping them win the FA Youth Cup in 1992, Beckham made his first-team debut months later in the League Cup.He returned from a brief loan spell at Preston to ignite his Old Trafford career, making his Premier League debut in 1994.RAISED EYEBROWSFerguson's decision to give his "fledglings" their wings at the start of the 1995-96 season initially raised eyebrows. Pundit Alan Hansen famously quipped "you'll never win anything with kids," after an opening-day loss to Aston Villa.Instead, with Beckham flowering as United's right-side midfielder, they scooped the Premier League and FA Cup double.On the first day of the next season, Beckham launched a 60-metre shot from inside his own half over Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan and the world sat up and took notice.Weeks later Glenn Hoddle handed him his England debut and he went on to earn 115 caps. From 2000 to 2006 he was captain.Beckham's celebrity status infuriated some, straining his relationship with Ferguson so much that the fiery Scot famously threw a boot at him in 2003 and cut his eye.When he was red-carded for kicking Argentina's Diego Simeone in the last 16 of the 1998 World Cup, fans and media lambasted Beckham for the defeat. A Beckham effigy was strung up outside a London pub, such was the venom aimed his way.Yet out of adversity, Beckham grew. He led England to a famous 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier in 2001 and his metamorphosis from villain to hero was complete when he curled in a trademark free kick against Greece at Wembley to clinch a place in the 2002 tournament.Although England's so-called "Golden Generation" never managed to land a trophy, Beckham went past Bobby Moore's appearance record for an outfield player in 2009 before injury ended his hopes of playing at the 2010 World Cup and his international career.Post-United Beckham never quite scaled the same heights at club level.When he joined Real Madrid in 2003, 500 journalists turned up for his unveiling at the Bernabeu.It was not until his final season in 2006-07, however, that Real won La Liga, by which time the Beckham circus was plotting a course for LA Galaxy and the Hollywood stage his fairytale career demanded. - Nampa-Reuters

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcos Rojo breaks lockdown rules in Argentina as Man Utd star filmed smoking with friends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has flouted coronavirus lockdown rules in his native Argentina by smoking and playing poker with friends.
The 30-year-old, who moved on loan to Argentinian club Estudiantes in January, was filmed by his brother Franco surrounded by friends in a video which was quickly removed from Instagram - but not before Argentinian outlets were alerted to it.
Rojo spent eight years as a youth player with Estudiantes before breaking into the first-team with his boyhood club.
However, the former Sporting Lisbon man may be disciplined by the club after clearly breaking lockdown rules, which were extended by Argentinian president Alberto Fernandez until 10 May.
A mandatory quarantine has been in force in the South American country since mid-March. Though some restrictions were relaxed recently and people are allowed to go within 500 metres of their homes for exercise, visiting friends is still prohibited.
There have reportedly been 4,681 cases of coronavirus in Argentina and 241 people have died of the illness.
Franco Rojo also landed his brother in hot water only a day earlier when he posted a picture of Marcos playing football with friends in a park.
Controversially, Rojo was also wearing the shirt of Boca Juniors - Estudiantes' rivals - bearing the name of legendary Argentinian player Riquelme, who currently serves as Boca's vice-president.
However, Rojo has also been in the news for the right reasons during the lockdown after delivering food and drinks to over 200 families in his native La Plata in April.
Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is understood to be keen to offload Rojo this summer after the Argentine made only one Premier League start this season.
Rojo has only made one appearance in the Superliga since joining Estudiantes, but he did provide an assist in that match and is keen to extend his stay with the club.
"If it depends on me, I will speak to Manchester United's management about the possibility of staying here for another six months," Rojo said.
"I will feel a tremendous sense of pain if I have to leave after playing in so few matches."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommie Gorman on his one regret over famous Roy Keane Saipan interview</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2002 World Cup was the last chance saloon for Roy Keane on the international stage and Ireland hadn't prepared for the party. 
This is the assessment of Tommie Gorman who famously was the first person to interview the Corkman after his sensational departure from Saipan.
And listening back to his exchanges with Keane nearly 18 years later, Gorman would take a slightly different tact if given another chance. 
"The overriding reaction to it is what a missed opportunity it was," he told RTE's Sunday Sport.
"When I listen back to it now, with the benefit of hindsight, you can see what is exactly bothering Keane. 
"It was his last big opportunity to do something in a World Cup. He was 30, coming on 31, he saw the potential of guys like Robbie Keane, Damien Duff, and he contrasted that with the preparations [in the camp].
"All his professional life Keane was finely tuned, highly-motivated, short-fused - that's what made him the player he was. The whole thing just blew up."
Gorman continued: "He obviously was full of all sorts of intense feelings. He had come back having been trailed by journalists and wanted to give his side of the story. 
"As I listen back to back it now, do I think part of Keane wanted to go back? Yes. 
"Was there an opportunity for him to go back? I think there probably was.
"And I think when you look at what has happened to the FAI subsequently, I think some of the seeds of the destruction were evident from that time."
The Saipan saga is often billed as Keane versus the then Ireland manager Mick McCarthy.
But Gorman thinks Keane's wrath was directed at all levels of the setup.
"Keane was the person who gave everything. He was coming from the Manchester United stable where they had this tradition of excellence under Ferguson.
"He knew what it took - he knew what was required to be a winner. He also was on a very tight rein - Keane could be quite explosive. That's what you got when he was in your team. 
"Then he arrived in Saipan and saw the setup and became conscious of the deal that was done for that.
"Keane wasn't one at that stage in his career for having a few beers and taking things lightly.
"He knew that time was against him. He knew that this was his last shot at it.
"And I think that was that led to him being in the state he was in and that's what led to his confrontation not just with Mick McCarthy but with the FAI structure. 
"I think that's what he rebelled against."
Gorman was one of many journalists that camped outside Keane's Manchester house as the country waited for the midfielder to break his silence. 
But it was during his time spent in the locality that Gorman discovered a softer side to the Corkman.
"There is a really, really soft side to Keane. We were outside his house in Hale and there was quite a high wall around it and there were gates. 
"But you could actually see his kids at the top window waiting for his return. And I remember saying to him 'I see the kids are waiting for you to come home. 
"And typical Keane, when he is hard on himself, said 'oh yeah, I'm sure they are waiting for the presents' 
"The other thing that struck me was that after we had finished the interview, he was walking out and there were a number of the staff around the place. 
"The staff were asking for autographs. And he was really, really mannerly and gentle with them. 
"I also brought into the interview that we had been knocking around in Hale for that weekend. 
"We were in this newspaper shop and the man inside said that Mr. Keane comes in for his papers and he's a perfect gentleman. 
"And I remember we were in a coffee shop and this woman said that Roy sometimes comes in with his father. 
"She said he was a lovely person to have as a customer, that he was very respectful and that he was very attentive to his father. 
"They were the factors that were in the back of my head in the interview - there is a tender side to his guy."
Gorman added: "Guys like him are sometimes treated like show ponies and there must be an awareness in them that they have a very limited shelf life. 
"And in Keane's case, this was the last big international chance that he was going to get. 
"I think that's what was killing him, that they weren't going to give it their best shot."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here Are the Best Twitter Reactions to Netflix's Extraction</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Extraction, which premiered on Netflix on April 24, is on its way to becoming the most-watched feature film on the streaming service. On Saturday, Hemsworth released a video statement on his Instagram account, with the following message:
"Hey what’s up guys?," he starts."Hope you're doing well. I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone that checked out Extraction. You've made it the #1 film on the planet right now."
Netflix also issued a statement expressing their gratitude to fans: "Extraction is well on its way to becoming the biggest-ever film premiere on Netflix—with a projected 90 million households getting in on the action in the first 4 weeks," the company wrote. "Thanks to everyone who watched so far!"
So now that we know everyone is freaking out about this film enough to make it the No. 1 movie people are watching, it's time to look into all the hype on Twitter. First, it's important to know that this film is about a black-market mercenary named Tyler Rake who is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an international crime lord. Obviously, this is a pretty risky, deadly mission, but action movies about deadly missions seem right up Chris Hemsworth's alley.
Hemsworth is obviously feeling the love that people have for his latest big hit. He tweeted that he woke up to find that his Instagram account was absolutely blowing up with likes. "Woke up to a notification saying my new IG acct got put on hold due to unusual activity. Do I already regret this???," he wrote.
Let's take a look at all of this Extraction social media action; maybe this round-up will help the movie's star keep track of all the love he's getting.
According to Hemsworth's Instagram story, this is how we should all wish Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson a happy birthday today:
Genius.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I stand by my social media post: DMC chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Delhi Minorities Commission chairman Zafarul Islam Khan, who was on May 2 booked on charges of sedition after he allegedly made “provocative” social media posts, on Sunday said he did not delete his post and stands by it.
“It has been erroneously reported in a section of media that I have apologised for the tweet and deleted it. I apologised not for the tweet itself but because it was ill-timed and insensitive in the midst of a medical emergency faced by our country,” Mr. Khan said, adding that the post was still there on his Facebook and Twitter pages.
“I stand by my views and convictions. I will continue, now and in future, the fight against hate politics in the country. FIRs, arrest and imprisonments do not change this path which I have chosen continuously to save my country, people and the Indian secular polity and the Constitution,” he said.
A senior police officer said the FIR has been registered under Sections 124 A (Sedition) and 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony base on a complaint by a resident of South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj.
The complaint said Mr. Khan on April 28 had shared a post on Twitter and Facebook which was “provocative”.
Mr. Khan, in his post, had thanked Kuwait for taking note of the persecution of Indian Muslims, in the context of the violence in north-east Delhi.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rosberg comes with a Dutch message: "I hope to see you soon!"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nico Rosberg also regrets that Formula 1 was unable to travel to the Netherlands for the Grand Prix at Zandvoort this weekend. The single world champion is disappointed with the cancellation due to the coronavirus, because he expected a big Dutch party on the circuit located in the dunes.
"Unfortunately there is no DutchGP in Zandvoort today", Rosberg writes Sunday on his Twitter account. The former Formula 1 driver of among others Williams and Mercedes had taken into account a big orange sea. "It would have been a huge F1 party with all the fans going crazy and supporting Max!"
According to Rosberg not only he had been looking forward to the return of the Dutch Grand Prix. "I think we were all looking forward to this weekend very much", says the now 34-year old German. He concludes in Dutch: "I hope to see you soon".
It remains to be seen if the weekend in Zandvoort can be caught up in 2020. The latest reports indicate that there is no place for the Netherlands on the renewed calendar. Circuit director Robert van Overdijk also said last week that FOM has not yet submitted a concrete request for a new date.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Video: Gatorade Releases A New ‘Be Like Mike’ Commercial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the 1990s, Michael Jordan was everywhere. His Airness was a spokesman for several major companies, most notably Gatorade.
Gatorade’s iconic “Be Like Mike” ad campaign debuted in 1992. In 2015, the sports drink giant aired a digitally re-mastered version of its original commercial, but now we have an entirely new promo.
As part of tonight’s broadcast of “The Last Dance” on ESPN, Gatorade is premiering an updated “Be Like Mike” commercial featuring budding NBA stars Jayson Tatum and Zion Williamson and WNBA superstar Elena Delle Donne. Oh yeah, of course Michael will be in it as well.
You can get a first look at the ad below, complete with the new bottle emoji for the #BeLikeMike hashtag.
Love the fact that Gatorade brought this commercial back, but would it be too much to ask to bring back the clear glass bottles, even for a limited time? Talk about a childhood flashback.
Also, bring back the “Citrus Cooler” flavor again. It’s the least you can do, Gatorade.
“The Last Dance” continues tonight at 9 p.m. ET on ESPN.

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Some people don’t understand”: Former Man United star shuts down claims that he was lazy on the pitch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s interesting that British fans still value an energetic player more than a skillful one, because in theory it doesn’t take any skill to be the hardest working player on the pitch.
It’s never a criticism when things are going well, but as soon as things start to go wrong then anyone with bad body language or a low work rate will immediately get singled out – just look at Mesut Ozil.
Dimitar Berbatov is probably under appreciated because he didn’t run about like a headless chicken, but in a recent interview with The BBC it’s clear he felt his way was the right way, as he batted away accusations of being lazy at Man United and Spurs:
“Some people don’t understand it, but if you are clever in your head, even if you are slow in speed, you can still be quick. You can position yourself better and be even more use to your team.”
“But I was running in my head. And when I see someone in a better position than me I always give the ball. No selfishness. In the end we win and lose together.”
“It seems a bit strange, but in every team I have been in, you see my style of play and sometimes fans and players don’t understand that and they become a bit afraid of it, like I am not helping and not good for the team.”
He was always a fascinating player to watch because his style was fantastic in some games while frustrating in others. It was clear he wanted to play at his own pace, but sometimes he did slow things down too much.
He will always be remembered for his glorious touch and calm demeanor, but he could also be deadly in front of goal as he proved with 20 Premier League goals for United in the 2010/2011 season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forfar man heals family rift over gravestone from his estranged wife by agreeing to be buried in the grave</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A STUNNED dad whose name was etched on a headstone bought by his ex said he healed a family rift — by agreeing to be buried in the grave.
Alan Hattel, 75, told how he backpedalled on being laid to rest with estranged wife Berta after seeing the joint plot and working out how much he would save.
The retired welder said he would also be close to some old pals at Newmonthill Cemetery in his hometown Forfar.
The dad of two said: “I’ve changed my mind. I would like to go into the grave because it’s bought and paid for.
“It will save me thousands plus it’s in the best spot in the cemetery. I have a lot of frie­nds who have ended up there. They are all within ten yards.
“Some of my ex-girlfriends are in there too. I’m really at peace with it all now.”
We told how Alan hit the roof when he discovered Berta — who he’s been estranged from for 26 years — secretly bought the couple’s joint lair to save their daughters money in future.
But the OAP’s pals stopped calling after seeing the memorial and believing he was dead.
He had to assure pals he hadn’t popped his clogs after word got round about his plot in the local cemetery.
Alan said he’s apologised to kids Collette, 33, and Lynn, 31, over the feud.
But he added: “After all this they might not want me to be buried there.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In SnowRunner, vehicles mean everything. They’re the tools of your trade and it’s very likely you’ll spend many, many hours behind the wheel of some of these trucks, surveying landscapes and hauling cargo on your SnowRunner odyssey.
The game will start you out with two vehicles and although they’re capable of completing basic tasks you’ll eventually want to explore what other options there are.
Naturally, SnowRunner’s best vehicles are gated off until you achieve a sufficient Driver Rank. Hitting those higher tiers will take a long time so it’s best to spend your money on what’s currently available, upgrading them as you see fit.
Below you’ll find the full list of vehicles up for purchase in the base game. Please note that this will likely expand as DLC and updates are rolled out.
In the meantime be sure to read our review – Dom scored SnowRunner a trucking brilliant 9/10.
SnowRunner is out now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC (exclusively via the Epic Games Store).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Doctors arranged for my death if things went wrong, says Boris Johnson on his coronavirus treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed for the first time on Sunday that there were "contingency plans" in place in case things went “badly wrong” and he died during his treatment for COVID-19 in a hospital here last month.
The 55-year-old leader, who returned to work at 10 Downing Street after his recovery last week, told ‘The Sun On Sunday’ that he was given "litres and litres of oxygen" after going into intensive care at St Thomas’ Hospital on April 7.
"It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin'-type scenario,” he told the newspaper.
"I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place.
The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie," he said as the country reported over 28,000 deaths due to the coronavirus outbreak as on Saturday.
The interview comes a day after his fiancée Carrie Symonds shared a picture on Instagram with the couple’s newborn son, who they have named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson – with the name Nicholas chosen in a nod to the two doctors who saved the British premier's life.
Johnson admitted that he was "in denial" about how serious his condition was after testing positive for coronavirus and that he really did not want to go to hospital.
“I said I really didn't want to go into hospital. It didn't seem to me to be a good move but they were pretty adamant. Looking back, they were right to force me to go," he said.
“It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent. I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better," he said during an emotional interview from the Downing Street.
“But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit… they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally."
In reference to his time in intensive care, he added: "Because the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, 'There's no medicine for this thing and there's no cure'. That was the stage when I was thinking, 'How am I going to get out of this?'"
Johnson admits he was coming to terms - probably for the first time - with his own mortality. He had been in hospital several times before, usually with rugby injuries, but nothing quite like this.
He said: “I’ve broken my nose, I’ve broken my finger, I’ve broken my wrist, I’ve broken my rib. I’ve broken just about everything. I’ve broken all sorts of things, several times in some cases. But I’ve never had anything as serious as this.”
Johnson had been diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26 and was admitted to the hospital 10 days later. The following day, he was moved to intensive care.
He said his recovery was due to the "wonderful, wonderful nursing" and felt "lucky" to have come out of the deadly disease, given so many others were still suffering.
"And so if you ask me, 'Am I driven by a desire to stop other people suffering?' Yes, I absolutely am. But I am also driven by an overwhelming desire to get our country as a whole back on its feet, healthy again, going forward in a way that we can and I'm very confident we'll get there," he said.
The prime minister is expected to unveil the UK's approach to tackling "phase two" of the virus now the peak of infections has passed and lay out a “comprehensive” plan for unlocking the economy.
So far, over 28,000 COVID-19 related deaths have been registered in hospitals and the wider community across the UK, which remains under strict social distancing lockdown measures to curb the spread of the deadly virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A village innovator forced defer his dream</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mr Alex Kithinji is not your ordinary farmer. Since the early 1980s, he has been known for his innovations and groundbreaking research that are always ahead of the village technological clock.
At his house in Kithangari, South Imenti, only a call from his smartphone and a makeshift device made of a DVD player and four mobile phones lights up two bulbs.
‘I call it the Great Brain Technology because I developed it out of inborn talent,” says the self-taught electronics technician.
Mr Kithinji, 54, has shouted “eureka” several times after successfully producing electricity using piped water, transmitting FM radio signals and developing a smart home lighting and security control system.
His dalliance with innovation dates back to 1982 when, as a Form Two student, he made a weed killer (herbicide) earning himself the name Roundup from schoolmates and villagers.
“While in secondary school, I developed keen interest in physics and electronics. I dismantled my mother’s priced Phillips radio out of curiosity,” Mr Kithinji, who has never set foot in college, explains.
“After completing secondary in 1985, I would read about inventors and any book about electronics. I became a self-taught electronics technician.”
Following an acute shortage of kerosene (that locals relied on for lighting) due to the 1990 Gulf crisis, Mr Kithinji did groundbreaking research that saw him light up more than 50 rural homes.
Using a bicycle dynamo and a turbine turned by a piped water jet, Mr Kithinji was able to produce electricity that powered several homes.
“Around 1992, there was a shortage of oil in the world and in our village, we could not get kerosene to light our lamps. I started looking into ways of using a bicycle dynamo to light my house. After studying a neighbour’s bicycle, I started experimenting how to make the dynamo work away from the bicycle,” he recounts.
He adds, “After days of research, I came up with a turbine that could turn the dynamo using a water jet. I borrowed Sh250 from a friend and walked 12 kilometres to Nkubu market to buy an old dynamo.”
Mr Kithinji says he converted the dynamo current to be able to charge a car battery that could then light up four bulbs and a TV set. He then learned electrical wiring from a friend who had studied the course.
“I used to charge Sh5,000 to install the lighting system,” he says.
He would later upgrade his power system using a motorbike magneto ignition system, to produce higher voltage.
“However, I could not install the magneto in many homes because of challenges with water pressure. We could not get a strong water jet to power the magneto,” Mr Kithinji says.
The coming of mobile phones inspired Mr Kithinji’s innovative mind and he started wondering how he could use a phone to do manual work.
“When I started thinking about using a mobile phone to do manual work, I did not own one. Mobile phones were owned by the rich,” says the village innovator.
He says he would borrow faulty and abandoned phones from friends which he used to do experiments for his imaginary device.
October 4, 2012 is still etched on Mr Kithinji’s memory as it is the day he had a breakthrough with his remote lighting control device he calls ‘the great brain technology’.
The smart device allows one to remotely control the lighting system and electronics away from home as it uses the mobile network.
“I remember vividly that I shouted eureka at 11pm on October 4, 2012. I asked my father-in-law who was in Nairobi to call the number I had linked to the device and my wife was shocked to see the bulb light up. He called another number on the system and the light switched off,” Mr Kithinji reminisces.
Since then, he says he has upgraded the device to give feedback after switching on or off as well as integrated an interactive voice.
Mr Kithinji insists that he did not read about the innovation anywhere as he did not have access to the internet or books on advanced information technology.
He says the device can be adapted for use in car tracking, home security as well as automated irrigation systems.
However, Mr Kithinji says he is giving up for lack of support, adding that various attempts to have his works benefit the community did not bear fruit.
He said the government should learn from the coronavirus pandemic to support local researchers and innovators to advance homegrown solutions.
“Research is an expensive venture because during my experiments in 2012, I dismantled mobile phones worth more than Sh300,000. I have spent more than Sh500,000 in developing the smart lighting control device. I am now concentrating on farming because I could not commercialise my innovations,” he laments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia's most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
"All of us have ended up on a desert island and that's the most interesting thing," the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called "Quarantine Russian Style".
"Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we'll make movies!" he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the "craziest" thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
"They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa," he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians' coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour's door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include "Tango and Cash", also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
"Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,"  he said. 
"That is why we will be able to tough it out."
'Tales from Quarantine'
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the "Screenlife" format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called "Tales From The Quarantine". 
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
"Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it's where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are," Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called "Telecommuting" and features professional actors in a web conference.
"Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language," said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers "Day Watch" and "Night Watch".
"Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated," he said.
"We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks."
'We must survive'
Due to the epidemic, the Russian film industry is likely to lose around 60 percent of revenue this year, according to preliminary estimates from the culture ministry.
But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck. 
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia. 
She invited dozens of her actor friends -- who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion -- to participate in a project dubbed "The Isolated".
"'The Isolated' talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics," Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform -- one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown -- to be able to pay her actors.
"We must survive these strange times," she said.

Since the release of the Disney+ series The Mandalorian, the internet has lost their fucking minds over this adorable creature. And now, you can combine your love of this little green man with your love of family-destroying board games. Honestly, what more could you ask for?
Unfortunately, the Monopoly: The Child Edition isn’t available until September, so it won’t be curing your isolation boredom any time soon. But how could you possibly say no to that face?
For the measly price of $68, you could be playing Monopoly as one of four Baby Yodas, which is a truly priceless experience.
In case you missed it, Baby Yoda isn’t actually called Baby Yoda. And at 50-years-old, he’s hardly a baby. But considering Yoda’s species lives to be 900, our boy Baby Yoda is simply called The Child.
The set includes four playable characters, 18 title deed cards, 16 Bounty Puck cards, 16 Camtono cards, 32 plastic hideouts, 12 plastic common houses, 12 dice, a money pack, a game guide and one gameboard.
Hasbro revealed the game in the lead up to International Star Wars Day on May 4th. You won’t be able to play this adorable edition on May 4th, but the Disney+ gods are blessing us by adding The Rise of Skywalker to the platform just in time for your annual Star Wars marathon.
You can pre-order Monopoly: The Child Edition here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fans Flood Reddit With Memes Over Pewdiepie's Accidental Youtube Upload From Nine Years Ago</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Famous Swede and the most-subscribed Youtuber, Felix Kjellberg, who is best known under his nickname PewDiePie, rarely fails to delight his devoted fans with new quality content. However, the Youtube star has accidentally uploaded a video from nine years ago and naturally Internet users just could not just let go off this mishap.
World famous Swedish Youtuber Pewdiepie has left his subscribers scratching their heads recently after he published a commentary video titled "Call of Duty: Black Ops: Team Deathmatch 48-4 Launch", which he actually first uploaded nine years ago.
Soon after, the internet personality admitted his mistake and wrote that he'd done it accidentally.
However, this innocent error sparked a flow of memes on reddit, with some of the users questioning whether it was a mistake after all.
Some other redditors simply wanted to poke fun at the Swede's blunder.
Other commentators noted how much Felix's attitude has changed over the years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd player breaks lockdown rules as he smokes and plays cards with pals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo – who is currently on loan at Estudiantes – appears to have broken coronavirus lockdown rules on multiple occasions in his native Argentina.
The defender, who returned to Buenos Aires during the January transfer window, was seen smoking and playing cards with a group of friends in a video uploaded to Instagram by his brother, Franco, on Saturday night.
Although the clip was quickly deleted, it was shared across social media with many supporters slamming Rojo’s behaviour as he flaunted social distancing guidelines.
Argentina President Alberto Fernandez recently extended the country’s coronavirus lockdown until May 10, with the nationwide mandatory quarantine having been in place since the middle of March.
Although some restrictions were relaxed – with people allowed to go out daily for recreational purposes within a 500-metre radius of their home – that has not been extended to visiting groups of people.
But Rojo appeared to disregard those rules, with at least 11 people spotted in the video his brother uploaded to his Instagram stories.
A day earlier he had also courted controversy when he had a kickabout with friends in the park, with the image again uploaded to Instagram by his brother.
To make matters worse, the Estudiantes loanee was wearing the shirt of rival club Boca Juniors, with legendary player Juan Roman Riquelme’s name on the back, and supporters have called on club president Juan Sebastian Veron to reprimand Rojo.
Despite his recent indiscretions, the 30-year-old has been keen to do his bit during the pandemic and distributed food and drink to more than 200 families in his hometown of La Plata last month.
‘It was a pleasure to do something small locally to me to help in this unfortunate struggle the world is going through,’ he said. ‘Of course, we took the necessary precautions using masks and gloves to protect ourselves and others.
‘My neighbourhood is a humble place but it’s a very friendly place and I am proud to call it home. The community spirit during this crisis has been really uplifting.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moscow, Russia | AFP |  The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia’s most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
“All of us have ended up on a desert island and that’s the most interesting thing,” the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called “Quarantine Russian Style”.
“Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we’ll make movies!” he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the “craziest” thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
“They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa,” he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians’ coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour’s door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include “Tango and Cash”, also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
“Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,”  he said.
“That is why we will be able to tough it out.”
– ‘Tales from Quarantine’  –
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the “Screenlife” format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called “Tales From The Quarantine”.
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
“Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it’s where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are,” Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called “Telecommuting” and features professional actors in a web conference.
“Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language,” said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers “Day Watch” and “Night Watch”.
“Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated,” he said.
“We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks.”
– ‘We must survive’ – 
Due to the epidemic the Russian film industry is likely to lose around 60 percent of revenue this year, according to preliminary estimates from the culture ministry.
But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck.
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia.
She invited dozens of her actor friends — who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion — to participate in a project dubbed “The Isolated”.
“‘The Isolated’ talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics,” Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform — one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown — to be able to pay her actors.
“We must survive these strange times,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On This Day: Easter Rising leader Tom Clarke executed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On this day, May 3, Thomas Clarke faced execution for his involvement with the 1916 Easter Rising.
Thomas J. Clarke was born in 1858 on the Isle of Wight but grew up in County Tyrone.
At age 20 he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and his career as an indefatigable Irish revolutionary began. After a skirmish with police, he was forced to flee to America where he became a citizen of the United States in the City of Brooklyn in 1883. (He was the only American citizen involved in the 1916 Rising executed by the British.)

In that same year, he heeded the call of Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa and returned to England on a secret mission – to blow up London Bridge. He was apprehended and spent the next 15 years in British prisons.
At Millbank Prison, he was Prisoner J464 and was treated brutally:
Upon his release, he returned to New York. There he married Kathleen Daly – of the radically Republican Daly family of Limerick – in 1901. John MacBride was his best man and John Devoy, who Pearse called “the greatest of the Fenians,” was also in the wedding party. The Clarkes lived all over New York City and Long Island as Tom was employed at various jobs, including working for Devoy on the Gaelic American newspaper.
In 1907 he decided, with unrest between the European superpowers becoming apparent, it was time to return to Ireland. He opened several newsagent stores, the most prominent one being on the corner of Sackville (now O’Connell) and Great Britain (now Parnell) Streets, directly across from the Parnell Monument. It became a prime meeting place for every prominent Fenian leader of the coming revolution.
Clarke became the Fenian pied-piper and brought such young men as Seán MacDiarmada, Padraig Pearse, Joseph Mary Plunkett, and Thomas MacDonagh into his Fenian sphere of influence. He even influenced the young Michael Collins.
“It was in 1914, just before the declaration of war, that the chance came to take passage to New York,” Collins is quoted in Hayden Talbot’s "Michael Collins' Own Story." Collins went on to state that “…when I laid the scheme before Tom Clarke…he advised me not to go. His reason satisfied me. He said there was going to be something doing in Ireland within a year. That was good enough for me. I changed my mind about going to America, and plodded along in my uncongenial job [in London].”
Britain’s entry into the Great War in 1914 presented a unique opportunity for Clarke and the radical IRB. With the advent of war, John Redmond of the Irish Parliamentary Party had urged Irishmen to join the fight for Britain. This had caused a split in the Irish Volunteers and Clarke and his group of young revolutionaries moved in to fill the void.
By 1915 planning for a rebellion was underway. Sir Roger Casement and Plunkett traveled to Germany to try and raise arms for the rebellion. Early in 1916 James Connolly and his Irish Citizen Army were brought into the conspiracy.
The Rising was initially set for Easter Sunday 1916, but things went wrong from the start. Eoin MacNeill, the nominal leader of the Volunteers, was kept in the dark about what was happening, and when he learned that the “maneuvers” were actually a march to insurrection he countermanded the order. The Rising was then moved to Easter Monday, but the revolt had been stripped of much of its impact.
On Easter Monday Clarke’s name was the top signature on the Proclamation and, as a mark of admiration and honor, he was the first to march into the GPO to take over the building. On Friday, with the GPO engulfed in flame, Clarke led his men out across Henry Street and into buildings on Moore Street where the rebels made their last stand.

After the surrender, Clarke was bivouacked for the night with the rest of the rebels in the garden of the Rotunda Maternity Hospital. There, according to reports, he was stripped naked by Captain Percival Lea Wilson and beaten. (Michael Collins witnessed this and had Wilson shot dead in Gorey, County Wexford, three years later.) From there, Clarke was transported to Richmond Barracks for court-martial, found guilty, and transported to Kilmainham Gaol for execution.
Unlike Pearse and MacDonagh whose families could not visit in time, Clarke was able to say goodbye to his wife, Kathleen. According to her autobiography, "Revolutionary Woman," he told her his trial had been a “farce.” He then told her, “I suppose you know I am to be shot in the morning. I am glad I am getting a soldier’s death.” Kathleen wrote, “he faced death with a clear and happy conscience.”
But the old Fenian wasn’t finished yet. He railed against Eoin MacNeill who had countermanded the maneuvers for Easter Sunday. “To send out countermanding orders secretly,” Clarke told his wife, “giving us no hint of what he was doing, was despicable, and to my mind dishonorable.” Just hours before he was executed Clarke gave this command to his wife: “I want you to see to it that our people know of his treachery to us. He must never be allowed back into the National life of the country, for so sure as he is, so sure will he act treacherously in a crisis. He is a weak man, but I know every effort will be made to whitewash him.”
Kathleen Clarke may have suffered more than any other survivor of the Rising. She not only lost her husband, but also her brother, Ned Daly, the commandant in charge of the Four Courts.
In addition, she was pregnant at the time of the Rising. “A baby was coming to us,” wrote Kathleen, “but [Tom] did not know. I had not told him before the Rising, fearing to add to his anxieties, and considered if I could tell him then but left without doing so.” Her final tragedy of 1916 was to miscarry that baby. Besides his widow, Clarke was survived by sons Emmet, John Daly, and Tom Jr.
Kathleen Clarke was to carve out a Republican reputation of her own. In 1917 she appointed the young rebel her husband had persuaded not to go to America – Michael Collins – as director of the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund, a charity for indigent survivors of the Rising. Starting with that position Collins was to go on and strike fear into the hearts of the British establishment. During the War of Independence, she served as a judge in the Republican courts and was elected to the Dáil.
In 1939 she became the first woman to become Lord Mayor of Dublin. One of her first official acts was to remove a portrait of Queen Victoria. She died in 1972 at the age of 94. She outlived her husband by 56 years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McFadden opens up on regret and exact reasons for leaving Everton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James McFadden has opened up on exactly why he felt he had to leave Everton, although it is now a decision he regrets the timing of.
The forward spent over four years at Goodison Park having joined from Motherwell in 2003, scoring 18 goals in 139 appearances in all competitions in that time.
However, the Scotland international left the Blues to join Birmingham City in January 2008 - before eventually returning to Everton for a brief spell in 2011.
And McFadden now admits the timing of his move to the midlands was wrong as he explained the reasons behind the transfer - mentioning the lesson David Moyes was trying to teach him.
He told the official Everton podcast: "It was just to go and play regularly. I'd been at the club for four-and-a-half years and I think it was...I wouldn't say it was the right time because I probably should have held on a bit longer, but I was getting frustrated at not playing.
"I was doing well for Scotland, every time I went away I seemed to do well and when I came back the manager [Moyes] in his typical fashion would have something to say to me about even my performances for Scotland!
"If I had come back and done well, he'd tell me what I didn't do so well. At that point I didn't really get it, I didn't understand why he had to be so hard on me.
"In hindsight, I should have held on and stayed a bit longer. I was starting to mature and learn the game the way the manager wanted me to play it. It was just a bit of frustration that I wasn't playing regularly.
"I got the chance to work with Alex McLeish who I'd done so well for at Scotland. He had a different way of dealing with me that I felt I responded better to.
"I just had to move, it was quite hard training every day and doing well, and coming to the weekend and not playing - or playing ten or 20 minutes, with the manger telling me I had to build trust again.
"I felt at that time, it was time to move on. In hindsight I should have stayed, stuck it out - because I feel like I was starting to get into a way of playing the manager wanted me to play."
Victor Anichebe was also a guest on the latest episode of the podcast, and he drew similarity from McFadden's situation to that of James Vaughan.
The striker came through the ranks at Everton before leaving on a permanent basis in 2011 - and his former teammate discussed why he didn't feel that was the right move.
Anichebe added: "I always speak to Vaughany about the same kind of thing, and he left pretty abruptly like that. He was a young kid, same as me, we lived next door to each other.
"If he didn't play he'd come in on Monday and tell the manager he needed to play. I always say to him, even when I left I probably should have tried Martinez for a season, but when Vaughny left I say to him I don't think at that point he should have.
"He was always frustrated, but he was still young at that time. He went on to Norwich and moved around a couple of times - I feel like he should have stayed and stuck it out.
"Even though Moyes was tough, I think he meant well. He would always say the moment he stopped shouting at us when when he didn't care."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scots guitarist gave-up life on road with megastar Calvin Harris to become a dentist</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One went on to be a global megastar with a string of hits and hundreds of millions in the bank.
The other decided to step back from music and concentrate on improving the nation’s smile.
But David Devine doesn’t show the slightest hint of regret when talking about how he gave up life on the road with Calvin Harris to become a dentist.
The 40-year-old helped arrange music on some of the tracks on the superstar DJ’s first studio album I ­Created Disco, which included hit ­single Acceptable in the 80s.
He was introduced to Calvin in 2006 by record label boss Mike Pickering, who was assembling musicians to tour with his unknown act.
Guitarist David, of Hamilton, went on the road with Calvin for two years while the former supermarket ­shelf-stacker took his first steps on the road to becoming one of the world’s richest performers.
But while touring and rubbing ­shoulders with stars including Steve Tyler and Paolo Nutini, David decided on a jaw-dropping career change.
David, who qualified as a dentist in 2015, said: ”I was doing a lot of musical arrangement and Mike needed ­someone like me to work with Calvin.
“Calvin and I became really good friends and it was a good working ­relationship.
“He was supremely ­talented and I’m just so proud of all the things he has achieved since then.
“We did an arena tour with Faithless and Groove Armada. It was a ­whirlwind of TV shows, awards and huge festivals. It was mad times.
“But I was friendly with some ­dentists and their work just sounded amazing. It seemed to be the right sort of career for me.
“They were on at me to get them backstage passes for gigs and ­saying what an amazing lifestyle I had – but it was me who was ­envious of them.
“My musical career was great but it was never going to last a long time while dentistry will.”
Dumfries-born Calvin’s personal fortune is now estimated to be around £150million and he has been named as Scotland’s wealthiest entertainer in the Sunday Times Rich List.
And while the 36-year-old Brit and Grammy winner – whose real name is Adam Wiles – recently sold his Hollywood mansion for £5.4million, David occasionally receives the odd royalty cheque through the post.
But David, a former pupil at Wishaw’s St Aidan's High School, said he would not swap his life treating patients at his Clyde Munro clinic in Glasgow for a jet-set lifestyle.
He said: “Dentistry is an amazing career. It has it all. You get to work with your hands, improve people’s health and run a ­business.
“There’s not many careers that give you those sort of challenges.”
Now he is ­hoping his links to showbiz royalty will help him raise funds for a hospice that cared for his sister Karen Derbyshire in the final stages of her four-year cancer battle.
Karen, who was a cancer nurse at Wishaw General Hospital, died in December 2017, aged 50.
She left behind husband Lenny, 57 and daughter Stephanie, 29.
Sadly, she never got to meet her first grandson Beck, who was born in 2019.
David has appealed to his old pals to take part in his Rock The ­Hospice fundraiser on behalf of St Andrew’s Hospice in Airdrie.
The facility’s ability to generate money has been hit hard by restrictions imposed by the coronavirus lockdown.
Stars and unknown musicians will belt out their songs and ­nominate friends to do the same before the performances are posted on social media.
David, who is working on his own album that will be released later this year, reckons Calvin and Paolo could help out if their ­schedule allows.
He said: “I’m hoping to get some pretty famous friends and some very talented local musicians involved.
“Coronavirus has had a ­massive impact on how charities raise money to keep going. So we’re going to do all we can to help.
“I miss Karen terribly. She developed breast cancer and was given the all clear.
“But unknown to us all, it had travelled to her brain.”
David added: “Beck has now  got some teeth and he’s been to see me as his dentist.
"I’m maybe biased but he’s my favourite patient.”
St Andrew’s Hospice have struggled to put on charity nights that help generate funds to look after patients like Karen.
David decided to start Rock The Hospice last week with an aim of raising £10,000.
The first video, posted last ­Monday, saw him play the song he wrote for Karen – One Last Time – before nominating Paolo and actor Ryan Fletcher.
Former River City star Ryan, 37, posted a version of Ricky Ross’s Most of Me last week,too.
The actor then nominated his Pennyworth co-star Paloma Faith to perform.
David said: “I became good friends with Paolo Nutini and I went with him when he played T in the Park in 2011.
“I’m sure there’s going to be few famous faces appearing on Rock the Hospice as well as some very talented musicians that are less well known. Watch this space.”
Louise O’Donnell, deputy head of fundraising at St Andrew’s Hospice, said: “It’s great David has pulled this together so quickly and we appreciate his efforts.
“He’s been a big supporter of the hospice over the years.
“We rely on fundraising through our shops and organised nights so coronavirus has had a major impact on our finances.
“We are having to turn to ­digital means so it’sgreat for people like David to help out.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia's most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
"All of us have ended up on a desert island and that's the most interesting thing," the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called "Quarantine Russian Style".
"Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we'll make movies!" he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the "craziest" thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
"They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa," he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians' coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour's door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include "Tango and Cash", also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
"Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions," he said.
"That is why we will be able to tough it out."
- 'Tales from Quarantine' -
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the "Screenlife" format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called "Tales From The Quarantine".
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
"Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it's where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are," Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called "Telecommuting" and features professional actors in a web conference.
"Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language," said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers "Day Watch" and "Night Watch".
"Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated," he said.
"We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks."
- 'We must survive' -
Due to the epidemic the Russian film industry is likely to lose around 60 percent of revenue this year, according to preliminary estimates from the culture ministry.
But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck.
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia.
She invited dozens of her actor friends -- who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion -- to participate in a project dubbed "The Isolated".
"'The Isolated' talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics," Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform -- one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown -- to be able to pay her actors.
"We must survive these strange times," she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The goalkeeper has played just the four matches for Mallorca this season as he is number two to Manolo Reina.
The veteran keeper Fabricio Agosto could be on the way back to Turkey. Besiktas, where he had the best matches of his career, want to sign him again for next season.
'Fanatik' talks about this option for the Fulham goalie who is on loan at Mallorca this season. He has been in Manolo Reina's shadow on the Balearics and in the only league game he has played, against Valladolid, his performance was quite questionable.
Main links
Fabricio, whose Fulham contract expires in 2021, was unable to get regular first team football in England in 2018-19 as well. 
He did get that at Besiktas, where he played 87 matches and conceded 94 goals. In addition, he ended up participating in the Champions League so the Spanish goalkeeper may be open to a return.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lamprey Vs. Shark Seen Off Rhode Island In Rare Observation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When one sees a shark, they usually do not see a lamprey attached to said shark. But that’s exactly what scientist Joshua Moyer, PhD Candidate at the University of Massachusetts, and others saw. “Once I recognized that it was a lamprey on the shark, my next thoughts were a series of questions: 'How often do those species interact,' 'How far can a Blue Shark carry a lamprey,' and 'Don't lampreys have a tough time hanging on to a shark covered in placoid scales?' When I turned to the literature, there were no concrete answers to any of those questions,” said Moyer. “The goal of the note we wrote is to use our observation to raise awareness of these questions in the hopes that future research may provide some answers.”
Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) are Agnathans, or fish who lack a jaw. Although they are classified in the subphylum Vertebrata, they actually lack a vertebrae and their entire skeleton is made out of cartilage- similar to the shark this lamprey was attached to! Native to the Atlantic Ocean, these animals prefer shallow coastal areas, but can be found at depths between 3 – 15 feet (1- 4.5 meters). Commonly known for their smooth, cylindrical bodies, they are often confused for eels. But just because this animal lacks a jaw doesn’t mean it’s a meek little thing. Sea lampreys are the largest and most aggressive species of lamprey and can get up to 3 ft (1 m) in length as adults, weighing up to 5.5 lbs (2.5 kg).
This particular sea lamprey measured less than a foot long (0.24 m) and was attached to a blue shark (Prionace glauca) in pelagic waters off Rhode Island. Blue sharks are one of the most wide-ranging shark species, found from the tropics to cold temperate waters all around the world. They mainly dine on fish and cephalopods, reaching depths of 1,148 ft (350 m) to hunt for these delicacies. Blue sharks aren’t exactly small, growing to around 12.5 ft (3.8 m) in length, but the lamprey didn’t seem to take that into account as it latched on to this blue shark’s right clasper.
“Our observation was occasioned by happenstance. We were in the right place at the right time,” explained Moyer. “We had gone out that day to study the feeding performances of Blue Sharks with the Atlantic Shark Institute. Although sharks with lampreys on them are not unheard of, when a Blue Shark showed up carrying a lamprey it took us a moment to recognize what we saw. You expect to see copepods and other small ectoparasites but typically don't associate lampreys with large pelagic sharks.”
Sea lampreys live their adult life as parasitic organisms, and the specific behavioral patterns of this species is not well studied. Lamprey parasitism on sharks isn’t exactly new, as there have been previously published accounts, but they are quite rare. This observation, coupled with those that date back to 1993, suggests that when a sea lamprey does adhere to a shark, the cloaca and that surrounding region is a common point of attachment. Why? “This may be because the placoid scales of that region do not exhibit the same roughness as elsewhere on the body, as has been demonstrated in several shark species,” explains the article.
Like sharks, they have an uphill climb when it comes to earning our affection. Lampreys are often the stuff of nightmares for some people, with movies of these blood suckers with “razor sharp teeth” being made into horror movies (i.e. look up ‘Blood Lake: Attack of the Killer Lampreys’). Despite their unsavory looks, they are quite important in the ecosystems they inhabit. For example, their nests help create cleared habitat ideal for spawning fish like salmon and trout. Not to mention that larval lampreys, called ammocoetes, filter feed and improve their surrounding water quality similarly to mussels. Some lamprey species even have cultural value!
Still not a fan? Well, don’t forget- we are all descended from fish similar to lampreys.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK PM says doctors prepared for his death in COVID-19 battle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed for the first time on Sunday that there were "contingency plans" in place in case things went "badly wrong" and he died during his treatment for COVID-19 in a hospital in London last month.

The 55-year-old leader, who returned to work at 10 Downing Street after his recovery last week, told The Sun On Sunday that he was given "litres and litres of oxygen" after going into intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital on April 7.
"It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin'-type scenario," he told the newspaper.
"I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place.
The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie," he said as the country reported over 28,000 deaths due to the coronavirus outbreak as on Saturday.
The interview comes a day after his fiancée Carrie Symonds shared a picture on Instagram with the couple's newborn son, who they have named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson -- with the name Nicholas chosen in a nod to the two doctors who saved the British premier's life.
Johnson admitted that he was "in denial" about how serious his condition was after testing positive for coronavirus and that he really did not want to go to hospital.
"I said I really didn't want to go into hospital. It didn't seem to me to be a good move but they were pretty adamant. Looking back, they were right to force me to go," he said.
"It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent. I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn't understand why I wasn't getting better," he said during an emotional interview from the Downing Street.
"But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit… they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally."
In reference to his time in intensive care, he added: "Because the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, 'There's no medicine for this thing and there's no cure'. That was the stage when I was thinking, 'How am I going to get out of this?'"
Johnson admits he was coming to terms -- probably for the first time -- with his own mortality.
He had been in hospital several times before, usually with rugby injuries, but nothing quite like this.
He said: “I've broken my nose, I've broken my finger, I've broken my wrist, I've broken my rib. I've broken just about everything. I've broken all sorts of things, several times in some cases. But I've never had anything as serious as this.”
Johnson had been diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26 and was admitted to the hospital 10 days later. The following day, he was moved to intensive care.
He said his recovery was due to the "wonderful, wonderful nursing" and felt "lucky" to have come out of the deadly disease, given so many others were still suffering.
"And so if you ask me, 'Am I driven by a desire to stop other people suffering?' Yes, I absolutely am. But I am also driven by an overwhelming desire to get our country as a whole back on its feet, healthy again, going forward in a way that we can and I'm very confident we'll get there," he said.
The prime minister is expected to unveil the UK's approach to tackling "phase two" of the virus now the peak of infections has passed and lay out a “comprehensive” plan for unlocking the economy.
So far, over 28,000 COVID-19 related deaths have been registered in hospitals and the wider community across the UK, which remains under strict social distancing lockdown measures to curb the spread of the deadly virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">My hero explorer dad was felled by the plague he predicted: Son of 83-year-old Robin Hanbury-Tenison on how his father was one of the first victims of coronavirus... but is battling on to return to the world of nature he loves</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There comes a point in every child's life when they realise their parents aren't invincible. That moment, for me, came later than for most: my father, the explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison, had seemed indestructible even into his 80s. 
But that changed six weeks ago when, desperately ill with coronavirus, he was rushed to hospital by medics in hazmat suits. We haven't seen him since. 
While we were shocked at the suddenness and the terrible danger he found himself in, I know that my father was not surprised, for a global pestilence is what he had predicted in his new and alarmingly prescient book. 
He had believed such a catastrophe was imminent, although he had never imagined that he would be among its first victims. Even as Taming The Four Horsemen: ­Radical Solutions To Defeat Pandemics, War, Famine And The Death Of The Planet was published in February, Covid-19 had begun to silently work its way through Europe. 
His thesis is clear: we humans have consistently and wilfully neglected the world we rely upon to sustain us. Deforestation, intensive agriculture and rampant consumerism have destroyed the natural environment and left us vulnerable to contagions and risks we as yet barely understand. 
History teaches us that, without fertile lands, there is hunger and war, epidemics and climate change. This pattern has destroyed civilisations for centuries, he says, and now we face the same fate. 
As a veteran explorer and conservationist, who has seen the impact of viruses on remote tribes, his anger is deep-seated. Now 83, my father has led more than 30 expeditions around the globe, was one of the founders of the tribal peoples' charity, Survival International, and has written 27 books about his travels and the indigenous people he has lived with. 
The Four Horsemen - with a foreword written by the Prime Minister's father Stanley Johnson - was inspired by a trip to Central America to visit old Mayan temples and pyramids. 
This once huge civilisation of around two million people collapsed very quickly and has almost entirely disappeared, leaving just a few relics to fuel the imagination. To my father, the parallels were clear. Pestilence, famine, war and death - the four horsemen of the apocalypse - had wiped out the Mayans. 
And epidemiologists all agree: we, too, were long overdue a pandemic. The risk today is the speed of its spread as the rate of global travel transports it across continents in hours. 
In the book, he writes: 'Pandemics are extremely difficult to predict and difficult to prepare for. They all start with a random event: a pathogen crossing to humans from another species. The real danger is a brand new virus, probably a strain of influenza.' 
Sound familiar? Today, he lies in hospital, recuperating after a month under sedation in intensive care, a victim of the modern plague he had warned society it was facing. 
But there is hope - not just for his own health, but for the world as we know it. 
Unlike ancient civilisations, he reasons, we have the technology to overcome this and other threats. Scientists are investigating the influence of the ecosystem of bacteria and organisms which live in our digestive system (the gut biome), which may have a role in our ability to fight disease, our physical health and even our moods. Our bodies are 'literally riddled with life', he says. 
Harnessing this power could be a more sustainable way to combat pandemics, rather than creating new chemicals and drugs - particularly when antibiotic resistance is such a growing problem. 
And, crucially, it will be alongside nature that I hope my father makes his recuperation when he returns to our family farm, Cabilla, in rural Cornwall, which he bought in early 1960, aged 23. 
He turned his hand to everything from dairy, sheep and cattle to angora goat breeding, red deer blood stock and wild boar luxury meat farming. Every tree was planted by him and he knows every wildflower, bush and bird. 
He has always been a man of nature, whether sleeping in the Kalahari Desert with bushmen or slinging his hammock in the Amazon rainforest and listening to jaguars prowling beneath him throughout the night. 
Several years ago, I took the farm over after I left the Army. My wife Lizzie and I live in the old farmhouse and my parents live in a barn conversion across the yard. My parents returned from a skiing trip in France in early March so we maintained a strict two-metre distance between us. 
Within a couple of days my father developed a dry cough. Unusually, he felt weak just walking in the garden and, by the evening, he had a temperature and was struggling to breathe. 
So we called an ambulance and he was taken away by paramedics, unable to hug any of us goodbye. Within 24 hours of his arrival at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth he was sedated and on a ventilator with confirmed coronavirus. 
He was kept sedated for almost a month and we were told that, at his age and in his condition, he had a 20 per cent chance of survival. We swung from hopeless optimism and faith in his virility and determination, to dejected misery. 
His lungs were failing; then his kidneys stopped working and he was put on dialysis. This lowered his chances even further. Without the constant kindness and calm care he - and we - received from the nurses on the intensive care unit, we would have given up hope. 
When they began to wake him up, he suffered terribly from a severe bout of sedation delirium. Finding yourself surrounded by strangers in full facial PPE with multiple tubes running in and out of your body would be terrifying at the best of times. 
Submerged in a fog of tranquillisers, antibiotics and other drugs it is panic-inducing and disorientating. Several times he needed to be re-sedated and at no point did he seem lucid or aware of where he was. The first time we were able to speak to him properly was a moment I will never forget. The nurses had wheeled his bed out into a 'secret garden' they have at Derriford for ICU patients. 
He had the sun on his face and greenery in the background. He didn't make a great deal of sense. However, before lapsing into confusion, he looked up at the sky and said how much he'd missed the blue, and complimented the staff on the few flowers that were growing. 
Even this minimal exposure to a natural environment seemed to trigger the turning point in his recovery. It would be a long road but my father was slowly coming back to us. I have long believed in the healing power of the natural world and have spent many hours immersed in peaceful woodland while battling my own demons from three tours of Afghanistan. 
A Japanese study has showed that forest environments promote lower concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, lower pulse rate and lower blood pressure. With that in mind, we had already planned to open our farm as a nature retreat, where people can come to escape the stress and pressure of their busy lives. 
Our first guests were due this month; the opening now delayed because of the Covid crisis. But it's fitting that it will be my father who will now be the first to recuperate there. And I know that, when we get the old explorer back, his condition will improve rapidly. 
The first step will be to gently return him to the woods he knows so well to drink in the air and gaze upon his old friends, the oaks, that dapple the light that reaches the ground and which provide homes and food for the bursting ecosystem that they support. 
Having already started rewilding the farm - returning species such as beavers, water voles, pine martens and, eventually, red squirrels - that have been lost over the past few centuries, there's a wonderful sense of poetry in the idea that we'll also be rewilding my father. Returning him to nature after his medical journey. 
Pulling the fences out on the land will be like pulling all those drips out of his arm. My father left intensive care a couple of weeks ago and is now in a rehabilitation ward while they strengthen him before, hopefully, returning him home. 
He is not out of the woods yet but all of the nurses and doctors have been amazed by his tenacity and refusal to succumb, against all the odds. 
It has probably been his most extraordinary adventure to date. In all his years of being my hero, he hasn't let me down yet. In fact, he's already said he has two plans for his release: to write a book about his experiences, and to perform a series of challenges to raise money so more ICUs can build gardens. 
Sunlight, fresh air and some greenery can perform wonders. In these uncertain times, it's a lesson we would all do well to remember.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'In the dark ages': Stoush brewing over bushfire bunkers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Lionel Buckett was battling a raging bushfire at Berambing in the Blue Mountains last summer, his partner Kooryn took refuge in a fire shelter he’d built among his wilderness cabins.
One problem, though, was the bunker for 20 people was not yet air-tight and it lacked a latch to secure the door.
"If it had had the seals, that’s where you’d want to be," Mr Buckett said. "I was still working on it."
Kooryn Sheaves and a friend were forced to hold grimly to the door to prevent more of the oxygen being sucked out and the furnace-hot air and smoke getting in. "She could feel the heat of the door," he said.
A skilled designer, Mr Buckett insists the shelter would have met Australian building standards - if he’d had more time. Ms Sheaves, meanwhile, "counted slowly to 100", looked outside to see the flames "about the same height as me" and went back to fighting fires.
As several inquiries into last season’s infernos get under way, the usefulness and regulation of bunkers is likely to be among the contested issues.
Recommendation number 4 of the 2009 Royal Commission into Victoria’s Black Saturday bushfires noted personal shelters around homes were "a fallback option for individuals". Despite that call, NSW is yet to follow Victoria in approving them.
Down in North Warrandyte on the north-eastern forested fringe of Melbourne, Drew Gordon jumped at the chance of installing a properly certified shelter after his state settled on standards a decade ago.
"It’s beautiful living here, but for three months of the year, we live in controlled fear," Mr Gordon said. "We have to be realistic, it’s only a matter of time."
Mr Gordon is yet to resort to using his refuge, now barely visible beneath a mound of gravel and mudstone beside a pruned tree about 50 metres from his house.
And the first recourse would be to leave the area with his wife and dogs on the night before severe fire weather days, reserving the shelter as an emergency if roads are blocked by flames and they get trapped.
"It’s like going out in a boat and having a life jacket," he said of the bunker. "Would you make life jackets for yourself? No, you buy ones you know will work."
Just what will work, though, is a point of difference between Victoria and NSW.
Craig Lapsley succeeded in getting formal safety standards for bunkers during his time as Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner and says his former counterparts at the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) remain "dead against them".
For its part, the RFS said it shares concerns of academics, such as Josh Whittaker from the University of Wollongong.
"You don’t want to encourage shelters as a first resort but as an absolutely last resort...they can create a false sense of security and complacency," Dr Whittaker told The Sun-Herald and The Sunday Age.
Bunkers "will not be accepted as a substitute for complying with other development requirements for homes in bushfire-prone areas," an RFS spokesman said. "Inadequately designed, badly located and poorly maintained private bushfire shelters are extremely dangerous.".
Still, the RFS concedes that after the past horror bushfire summer, protection measures such as bunkers "will be reviewed".
One person determined to force a change is Matthew Gray, a senior Qantas pilot who also heads Kangaroo Valley’s community bushfire committee.
Captain Gray is fighting opposition from the local Shoalhaven Council to install two six-person bunkers - one for his family and one for his prized possessions - on his property south of Sydney.
"Other bunker builders and owners have not hit roadblocks because they have taken the back roads which avoids both the council and RFS," he said.
"NSW has to get out of the dark ages," Captain Gray said. "This is one of the ways we can [change NSW] by highlighting at a very personal level, what outdated policy and thinking does in perpetuating poor strategic management."
Not surprisingly, Anthony Tratt, the owner of Wildlife Safety Bunkers - the company that supplied Mr Gordon and hopes to win the Kangaroo Valley contract - supports a national standard for shelters.
At about $17,000 for a six-person bunker and about double that for the 12-person one, Mr Tratt says Victorians can actually save money by owning a certified shelter.
Those living in so-called flame-zones, the highest risk areas, can have their homes rated as if they were in the next lower category - or Bushfire Attack Level 40 - if they have one of his bunkers. The lower rating could save $100-$150,000 in house building costs, he said.
Mr Tratt supplies NSW customers but he says it is their responsibility to ensure they follow state or local regulations around the installation, use and maintenance of the bunker.
"The bunker is another tool, just another piece of equipment to help protect yourself," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Reveals Why He Finally Decided To Post Photos Of Son Adonis, 2: ‘It Was Great For Me’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake surprised us all when he dropped his mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, and he sat down with rapper Lil Wayne on Apple Music’s Young Money Radio to discuss the new tracks, and his role as a father. The “God’s Plan” hitmaker has a two-year-old son, Adonis, who he posted pictures of for the very first time on his Instagram page on March 30. “I posted those pictures. It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like … It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned,” he dished on episode two of Lil Wayne’s talkback show.
“I just woke up one morning and I was like, ‘you know what? This is just something that I want to do’,” Drake continued. “I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. So, I just wanted to free myself of that. And I’ve watched you [Lil Wayne] be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father.” Drake also admitted how much the “Lollipop” singer, and other rappers like 2 Chainz have inspired him to be a better father.
“A lot of the guys that we came up around [were] great family men on those tours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done,” he said. “But specifically you, just how you always just made s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you. And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father. So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.”
Drake also talked about his new music, which he announced on Instagram on April 30. The mixtape not only includes a cheeky reference to Kylie Jenner’s billionaire net worth, but also boasts features from Chris Brown (“Not You Too“), Future (“Desires”), and Playboi Carti (“Pain 1993”). The overall mixtape was a joint effort between Drake and his “brothers,” Oliver El-Khatib (co-founder of Drake’s record label OVO) and producer Noel Cadastre. “My brothers put together a lot of the songs people have been asking for (some leaks and some joints from SoundCloud and some new vibes),” Drake explained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saved from killing himself, NBA star Dennis Rodman went on to win the three-peat with the Chicago Bulls</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former basketball legend and Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman did not only talk the talk, but he also backed it up with consistent and outstanding performances on the court. Though his highly successful playing career was engulfed with controversies both on and off the court, the successes he was able to chalk up, both individually and as a team player, weren’t an easy feat.
Known for his colorful hairstyles, tattoos as well as his conspicuous ear, nose and mouth piercings, Rodman’s performances, notably as a tireless defensive player who did all the “dirty work”, made him one of the very best in that trade. He is also regarded as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history.
Besides 5 NBA championships to his name, the 6’7″ Rodman, also known as “The Worm”, led the league in rebounds for seven consecutive seasons and became the oldest player to lead the league in rebounding at the age of 36 years and 341 days during the 1997/98 season. He also won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award twice and made it into the All-Defensive First Team seven times, among other accolades.
A powerhouse, Rodman played a very instrumental role in helping the Detroit Pistons beat their then bitter rivals, the Chicago Bulls – a team he would later join – in two consecutive Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990. Known as the “Bad Boys” for their physicality, the Pistons went ahead to win both NBA finals.
Rodman later joined the Chicago Bulls in 1995 where he formed a formidable partnership with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen to win the 3-peat in ’96, ‘97 and ‘98. An unbreakable and very dominant trio, Jordan, Pippen, as well as former coach Phil Jackson, have spoken extensively of how indispensable and vital Rodman was to their success – something “The Worm” himself knows.
Appearing on Episode 3 of The Last Dance documentary highlighting their ’98 championship win and final season together, Rodman said:
Rodman’s journey and rise to stardom were, however, not easy. Born in Dallas on May 13, 1961, he was raised by his mother, together with his two sisters, in a poor household. In an interview on ESPN for his Dennis Rodman: For Better or Worse documentary, he admitted he was a shy person growing up and was picked on by bullies. He also said he was scared and lonely and feared for the worst.
“I thought I would be in jail,” he said. “I thought I’d be a drug dealer or be dead. Those were my options.”
After graduating from high school, Rodman, who was yet to stake his claim as a promising basketball talent as compared to his sisters, was kicked out of the house by his mother after he was told to either look for a job or move out.
“She kicked me out,” he said. “She changed the locks. I had, like, a garbage bag full of clothes. I left the house and I just sat on the steps down at the apartment complex with nowhere to go. I went into my friend’s house. He said, ‘You can stay in the backyard, on the couch.”
“Every day when I wake up, I go to the car wash, try to make some extra money. Or I go to the 7-Eleven, try to fold boxes, throw bottles away, stuff like that, for five bucks a day.”
While out on the streets for almost two years, he worked on his basketball craft on a daily basis and finally had his chance when Southeast Oklahoma scouted him while he was playing in a summer league. After a successful three-year stint, he declared for the draft in the NBA and was selected by the Detroit Pistons as the 27th overall pick in 1986.
Despite steadily rising to become one of the standout players on the Pistons roster for his clutch defending and aggressiveness, his off-court and disciplinary issues caught up with him. After his divorce to Annie Bakes, coupled with disagreements with the Pistons management during the 1992/93 season, he almost committed suicide. He was found by the police sleeping in his car at The Palace of Auburn Hills parking lot with a loaded gun.
In his 1996 autobiography, As Bad As I Wanna Be, the 58-year-old admitted he thought about taking his life.
“I decided that instead [of killing myself] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn’t want to go … So I just said, ‘I’m going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.’ At that moment I tamed [sic] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn’t want to be,” he said.
Extensively touching on the suicide attempt during an interview with the Bleacher Report in 2019, Rodman said:
Rodman hasn’t been shy of controversies even after his basketball career. He is “good friends” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and has made multiple visits to the communist nation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Week In Techdirt History: April 26th - May 2nd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five Years Ago
This week in 2015, we learned more about one of the NSA's sweeping but useless surveillance programs, and about the stunning lack of oversight when the CIA wants to drone-strike people. But we weren't learning more about the TPP, since it was secret, even though President Obama was demanding critics explain what was wrong with the agreement they weren't allowed to see (just as a UN expert was saying that secret trade negotiations are a threat to human rights). Tom Friedman, meanwhile, was maybe going just a little overboard in advocating for the deal.
Ten Years Ago
This week in 2010, the UK Labour Party was yet again caught apparently infringing on copyright with a campaign poster while also being the champions of the Digital Economy Bill and its draconian copyright rules. They claimed "innocent error" — a defense notably absent from their own law. In the US, a worrying bill was pushing to extend DMCA-style takedowns to "personal information", while Twitter was taking down a lot of tweets over bogus DMCA claims, and an appeals court upheld a hugely problematic ruling about who counts as a journalist.
Fifteen Years Ago
This week in 2005, Wal-Mart was making a hilariously late second-entry into the online music store market, while Disney was backing down from a video-on-demand offering that I suppose counts as a distant ancestor to Disney Plus. Nathan Myhrvold was mixing up innovation and invention with Intellectual Ventures, while the head of the Patent Office was floating some very bad ideas about reform, even as companies like Intel were getting vocal about the problem of patent trolls.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RuPaul's Drag Race recap: season 12, episode 10: Send in the clowns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We’re down to the big hitters now. No more struggling out of lampshades on the runway and no more desperately snatching your wig off during a lipsync.
The queens that are left by episode 10 are always the most perfected. As perfected as an Absolut cocktail in the Interior Illusions Lounge. Those were the days! (this column does not officially endorse Absolut or Interior Illusions – other brands are available. DING!)
We’ve only got Jaida Essence Hall, Heidi N-Hydrates-Van-Cartier-Dupree-St-James-Closet, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd and someone called Sherry Pie remaining. They’re all great in their various ways – this has been the best top six in a very long time. But which of the six tops do you want to see WIN?
Widow Von’Du was eliminated last week and Heidi surprises herself by saying “and with that, we bid Miss Widow Von’Du ... adieu. Oh yes bitch, French!” Jackie Cox won the lipsync while wearing a hijab which, pleasingly, sparked actual intelligent conversation and received a largely positive response from viewers. Times have changed. It’s probably fair to say that, if this look had been seen on season two of Drag Race, a decade ago (!) the response would have been considerably frostier. (If it had been season one nobody would have been able to see it through the soft-focus filter).
For this week’s maxichallenge, the girls are giving a drag makeover to female superfans of the show. Oh, so AFAB people are allowed on the show as guests but not as contestants? OK, Ru, we see how it is. AFAB stands for “Assigned Female At Birth”. In 2020, we’re AAA – All About Acryonyms. Or, if you like, that can also stand for world famous drag troupe, the AAA Girls). We’ve had a coffee. A lot of coffee.
Anyway, it’s a delight seeing women on the show and getting at least a passing acknowledgement of the fact that women can do drag too. This is a great idea, and a touching tribute to the show’s instrumental and intensely loyal fanbase. The makeover episode has historically been a game-changer, because it depends entirely on who you’re paired with – if even the best contestant is paired with a makeover subject who’s a nightmare, it can send them spiralling.
Superfans Bethany, Nicole, Janet, Shea, Tiffany and Grace walk in and their excitement is irresistible. This is so cute. Exactly the warmth and wholesomeness we need right now. Crystal and her partner Grace seem very well matched – both have louche indie kid energy. Hilariously, Jaida’s partner Bethany, who she chose first, has issues walking in heels. Janet The Planet (“a rollercoaster of a woman” according to Gigi Goode) and Sherry Pie have a great chat about how Janet found solace and family in the drag community.
Jackie’s partner Tiffany says she started watching Drag Race from season 1, when she was 11 years old. The fact that there are now adult Drag Race fans that literally grew up with the show is ... a lot. Heidi’s partner Nicole opens up about her experiences with bullying, and it brings us to tears. We just cried at Drag Race. This lockdown needs to end NOW.
Ru says to Nicole “drag doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are” and Nicole responds “drag brings joy”. Patent it, market it, put it on a t-shirt. $45 not inc. post & packaging. May cause dryness. RuPaul departs the workroom with a final twist – the superfans will be lipsyncing! This. Is. Genius.
Jaida says to her partner “if you come out on the main stage with the mentality that your feet are gonna hurt and you’re gonna fall down – then your feet are gonna hurt and you’re gonna fall down!” Unarguable and accurate, but not particularly reassuring. In fact, that sums up Jaida in general.
RuPaul is SHIMMERING in a lense flare-inducing glissade of encrusted bodice. Michelle Visage says “hi dad!” and we just spat out our coffee. Ross Matthews is here and plugging his new book so shamelessly that it’s hilarious. The special celeb judge this week is Daisy Ridley, one of the highest paid movie stars in the world currently. We’d quote her character from Star Wars but she doesn’t have any remotely memorable lines. Don’t agree? Quote one of her Star Wars lines. Go on. See! You can’t think of any. She’s a great Drag Race judge though, giving considered critique and even swearing. You can tell that Disney contract’s up.
Crystal and her partner’s looks are a wild and brilliant clown/troll/Bert and Ernie mashup. Sherry Pie and her partner look EXACTLY the same, it’s spooky (the partners now have drag names too but we’re getting so confused by the five thousand names floating around that we’re just going to say “partner”). Gigi Goode and Bebe Bad (ok, that’s easy to remember) are giving ski lodge Bond girl. Jaida’s partner’s makeup is flawless. We need a gif of Daisy Ridley saying “yas ... queen ... werk.”
Just when Ross Matthews was starting to be vaguely appealing, he makes an awful joke about beating faces. Ugh. Seeing the superfans lipsync is the purest, most joyous thing since Ash chose Pikachu in Pokemon. 10 points to all involved!
Jaida wins and it’s Heidi and Jackie lipsyncing – both in disco sequin jumpsuits. And the song just HAPPENS to be disco hit, Alex Newell’s Kill The Lights. How utterly fortuitous and totally unplanned! It’s the best lipsync of the season so far. THEY BOTH STAY. Daisy Ridley is crying – showing more emotion in three seconds than she did in three instalments of Star Wars (THE SHADE).
Shadiest moment The aforementioned comments about Daisy Ridley’s acting ability. This episode was all about sisterhood.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Life in lockdown: Psychiatrist’s survival guide for ‘new bizarre, crazy world’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Are you tired of virtual chat and find yourself guzzling snacks and alcohol while fixating on grim death tolls?
You are not alone in this “new bizarre, crazy world” where primitive instincts can ride roughshod over reason, says consultant psychiatrist Mark Salter.
Mr Salter, from Hackney, east London, shares some survival tips in a BlueJeans online chat with lawyer Jill Greenfield, from Fieldfisher.
He said: “First of all you have to start with the fact we are looking at human beings who have brains, who have lives, who have minds.
“The brain or the mind is something that, by and large, likes stability and predictability.
“So, for most of us, when things are going well, our lives are predictable and vaguely manageable and that means we are switching to a relaxed frame of mind where we can measure, deliberate and take our time.”
Mr Salter said: “Anxiety is the mother of all mental illness – the mother of all unhappiness as well.
“Fear freezes our ability to reason. And that means we fall back on the more primitive, more frightening part of our brain, which is the bit that has been with us ever since we evolved from apes, which teaches us to look after Number One.
“That involves withdrawal, flight, isolation and also a lack of abstract thinking about solutions.”
The biological effect can disrupt normal sleep patterns and people turn to snacking over meals.
Mr Salter said: “We will reach for richer, sweeter foods. We will find ourselves nipping off to the fridge a bit more frequently – comfort-snacking.
“The very important thing that goes with the sleep cycle is the one or two meals a day cycle.
“We retreat to our favourite tranquiliser – usually alcohol.”
As “sociable creatures” the crisis has also meant withdrawing from the world and relying on electronic devices to communicate.
Remote working from home has forced those from different walks of life to rely on video conferencing over face-to-face chat.
“Those squeaks of the chair, those quiet sighs, those breaks of vision, those silent moments.
“Notice how silence seems so long on Skype, Blue Jeans, Zoom or whatever.
“It’s hard to read the meaning of silence because the silence is devoid of its context and that is a very unconscious, subtle manifestation of this creeping unfamiliarity which has already got us on edge as it is.”
He suggested sitting as close to the screen as possible, ensuring videos are well lit, and discussing the strange artificiality from the start.
He said: “Let silence take effect. Normally we interrupt prematurely.
“A good therapist will understand the importance of letting silence sink in.”
Using video conferencing is like speaking a foreign language, he said.
“As you will know when you are in a country for the first time and you are using your schoolgirl French – it’s exhausting.
“You can minimise that exhaustion, but it takes a lot of patience.”
He said the whole process requires more cognitive effort, meaning the brain burns more glucose.
“The act of trying to seem as if you are familiar with a situation in which you are relatively unfamiliar burns energy. It’s exhausting.
“That’s a reason why you have to look after your body.
“Watch what comes out of your mouth and what goes into it.”
He said maintaining a normal sleep cycle, having “down time”, keeping up with friends and getting out of the house are all important.
As humans in crisis, we look out for anything that is a threat or risk and become “sensitised” to events.
People are drawn to “trigger words” like Covid, death, disaster, ventilators, and PPE, which resonate in the “new bizarre, crazy world”, he said.
“There is an old line in the media: ‘If it bleeds, it leads’. In this case it’s ‘If it coughs, wheezes and dies, it leads’.
“So what we are doing is looking out for Covid-positive items.
“That is at the expense of looking out for things we probably would have looked out for elsewhere when we were more relaxed.
“If we are not careful, we can get into this terrible ‘pas de deux’ with the media.
“Psychologists call it an availability cascade. You are frightened; journalists know they can get your attention by giving you things that are frightening that will resonate with you.”
Mr Salter advises using trusted websites, stretching the brain and trying not to “soak up more of the same because of fearful fixity on a single subject”.
And just when we get used to the new normal, a fresh fear approaches – what will the world look like when we open our doors again?
Mr Salter supports clients who have been physically and psychologically injured following terror attacks, sexual abuse and road crashes.
Ms Greenfield said: “It’s vital that support doesn’t go away during lockdown. My team, Mark and other therapists like him offer invaluable contact via online platforms to keep people going.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington Redskins quarterback Dwayne Haskins shared a classy message for Alex Smith after watching his documentary on Friday night.
Smith’s devastating leg injury and his lengthy recovery were featured in an E:60 documentary this weekend. The documentary, Project 11, highlighted Smith’s brutal leg fracture in Week 11 of the 2018 regular season.
The veteran NFL quarterback nearly lost his leg because of the injury. Smith had to undergo dozens of surgeries and faced a long and tiring rehabilitation process.
Smith, who’s played in the NFL since 2005, has shown an incredible amount of resilience and determination with his recovery.
Haskins, the Redskins’ first-round pick in 2019, posted a heartfelt message for his teammate after watching the documentary.
“Hope those who watched Project 11 appreciate the person Alex is. He helped me tremendously the back end of the season on and off the field. I understand why people respect him the way they do. All love to you 11!” Haskins shared.
The Redskins are Haskins’ team moving forward, but he’ll benefit a lot from getting to learn from Smith, who remains a big part of the organization.
Haskins is coming off an up-and-down rookie season. He’ll look to make a big jump in Year 2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Affordable housing project gets lifeline</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The recent amendment to the Retirement Benefits Act that allows partial access of money to purchase a residential house has thrown a lifeline to the affordable housing programme.
After much public resistance to a mandatory contribution of a housing levy towards achieving the housing pillar of the Big Four Agenda, President Uhuru Kenyatta had in December 2019 announced that the programme would be voluntary.
“You all know, the implementation of the Housing Fund Levy as a mandatory contribution, for both employees and employers, has at every turn, been fraught with an avalanche of legal hurdles and obstacles. But we need to soldier on with the nobility of this programme. In this regard, and to ensure that the implementation of the programme is not derailed any further, I hereby direct and order that The National Treasury, the Ministry responsible for Housing moves to Parliament, for a revision to the legal requirement in respect to the Housing Fund Levy, to make the contribution voluntary, with immediate effect,” the President said, marking an about-turn on the approach towards implementation of the agenda.
Section 38 of the Act has been amended to state that “prescribed portion accruing to a member in a scheme may be assigned and used by the member to secure a mortgage loan or to purchase a residential house from such institutions and on such terms as prescribed by the minister”.
The amendment is part of the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020, which President Kenyatta assented to on April 25.
Before the amendment, the law only allowed members of retirement benefits schemes to use up to 60 per cent of their accumulated benefit as security for a mortgage. The amendment, on the other hand, allows members to directly partially access their cumulative benefit and have the option to use it as a security or access it as cash towards the purchase of a home.
With the change from mandatory to voluntary contributions, the plan for expanded home ownerships was sinking as the President’s term heads to the end. But the amendment to Section 38 of the Retirement Benefits Act
 (1997) has excited the State Department of Housing and Urban Development, with the PS Charles Hinga hailing it as “a smart and viable provision”.
“This change in the RBA Act makes home ownership easier for these members, by accessing the large amounts of money they save in retirement benefit schemes, and use these funds for a deposit payment or to further reduce their borrowing needs when buying a home,” says Mr Hinga. The implementation of the amendment is awaiting regulations that RBA says it is working on, and will include the percentage of the pension that members will be able to access to purchase a house while still safeguarding the scheme and the procedure to be followed.
“Please note that amendment of The Retirement Benefits (Mortgage Loan) Regulations is underway to operationalise this law and we will advise stakeholders once the Cabinet Secretary, National Treasury gazettes the amendments,” RBA CEO Nzomo Mutuku said.
According to Mr Mutuku, the amendment is laudable as it will increase home ownership in the country as envisaged in the housing pillar of the government's Big 4 Agenda.
For Mr Hinga, the amendment is a godsend after his pet project, the affordable housing scheme has hit massive turbulence after countrywide public disapproval of the initial mandatory deduction of 1.5 per cent of the basic salary from all employed Kenyans to go into financing the affordable housing scheme. The planned deductions were stopped by the Employment and Labour Relations Court in 2019 and on Jamhuri Day in 2019, President Kenyatta directed that the housing levy be made voluntary.
Under the voluntary programme, Kenyans who buy into the affordable housing scheme contribute a minimum of Sh200 per month. However, the voluntary programme has gained little traction and which is why the amendment to the RBA Act has been welcomed by Mr Hinga.
The State Department of Housing says there are over 300,000 Kenyans registered on the Bomayangu portal and over 20,000 are making voluntary contributions, which so far stands at Sh230 million. The department also says there are 228 houses under the Affordable Housing Programme which are ready for occupation at Parkroad, Ngara, while a total of 1,370 will be ready by December this year.
“By allowing for these monies to be used towards the purchase of a home, there is bound to be increased demand. This is because many people will now be able to afford the deposit payment required to qualify for a home. Lenders will view the 60 per cent cash more favourably as security and therefore qualify more people for mortgages. Others will significantly reduce their borrowing needs and make their mortgage payments much smaller,” said Mr Hinga.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus in Ballarat | Ballarat brewers feeling in pinch during isolation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the vast majority of bars and venues closed around the country because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ballarat's brewers have had to work hard to adjust to the new landscape.
Despite reports alcohol sales have increased during the pandemic, local brewers such as Malcolm Sachs from Cubby Haus Brewing say that has not been their experience.
Mr Sachs was forced to close his Mount Pleasant bar because of social distancing restrictions, limiting him to sell his beer online and in limited bottle shops around the region.
"We're well down on our usual sales, having the bar close hit us very hard," he said.
"We're transitioning into online sales with the help of a new sales manager who has been very busy trying to get our product into bottle shops.
With local sales being crucial to his business during this time, Mr Sachs voiced his frustrations surrounding some bottle shops which have declined to stock his beers in favour of more popular, large scale suppliers.
"The larger brewers are doing well at bottle shops, which has made some businesses stop stocking our beers.
"I know one bottle shop that stocks our product said they were selling around twice as much CUB product and very little local beer. We need people to support local brewers but unfortunately some bottle shops aren't coming to that party."
These sentiments were echoed by Red Duck owner Scott Wilson-Browne, who added while he has continued to receive orders locally, his business is down by 90 per cent.
"It's pretty quiet, I would say we're only operating at 10 per cent of what we would normally do," he said.
"In terms of overall turnover, it's still very difficult. We've had a handful of local deliveries everyday dropping off beer and gin.
"It's encouraging, we're also seeing a lot of those people re-ordering as well which is producing some regular trade."
One local brewer devastated by the pub and venue shutdown was Dollar Bill Brewing, who told The Courier they were set for potentially their biggest ever month.
Co-owners Ed and Fiona Nolle said while the news was terrible for them from a business and exposure perspective, they considered themselves lucky because of their ability to operate as a duo without outside pressures.
"It really couldn't have come at a worse time," Fiona Nolle said.
"When everything broke we were booked through with events until the end of August. All of that was ripped out from under us.
"For us, because we run our own operation and it's mainly just Ed and I, we've been hit hard but we'll survive. There are a lot of craft breweries that won't. Being limited to just us two has been a bit of a god send."
One constant across all three brewers is the perseverance to continue producing and working towards what they're doing to do once isolation ends.
"We're always looking at what's next, so for us to have a bit of time to hunker down and think about what we want to do has been important," Mrs Nolle added.
"We're thinking about launching a membership service where people can get behind us if they like our beer. All these ideas that were at the back of our mind have moved to the forefront."
Similar thoughts were shared by Mr Wilson-Browne and Mr Sachs. The Red Duck owner said having time to undertake some general maintenance has been key, while Mr Sachs said he will use this period to look at how his business can reinvent itself.
"We're using the downtime for lots of maintenance... a lot of tidying up and sorting things out and making use of this time," Mr Wilson-Browne said.
"We're really using this time to reinvent ourselves, to look at the ways we've been failing in the past and re-jig how we will run the bar in the future," Mr Sachs added.
"Maintenance has also been a high priority, this time has been really important to look within and see what needs to be done before we re-open the doors."

When all that is included in the price tag, it's a bargain if you ask us!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Radical plan to move Six Nations to later in the year emerges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Rugby chiefs are proposing to move the Six Nations as part of radical plans to shake up the game's sporting calendar.
The Rugby Paper report that pushing the competition from its usual starting date of early February to later in the year - in April - in order to ease the conflict between the club and international game.
The bold plans would also see the European club season start in December, with a source saying the proposed schedule is getting "a lot of traction with clubs in the Gallagher Premiership, the PRO14 and the Top 14".
The same publication state that the move revolves around the Rugby Championship, involving South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina, due to kick off in August, being moved to start at the same time as the Six Nations.
That would then free up space for Tests involving northern and southern hemisphere sides to take place in October and November.
At present the Six Nations starts in early February and reaches its climax around the end of March.
"We are working on a model for the club game starting some time in December," a club executive told the Rugby Paper.
"The proposal is for a 29-30-week season which would take us through to July with a break for the Six Nations to be played in April and finished in mid-May.
"That schedule is gaining a lot of traction with clubs in the Gallagher Premiership, the PRO14 and the Top 14.
"It's the one aspect of the global season which most people agree on. We know we have a big opportunity to build a better future.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, on Saturday evening, May 2, revealed his intention to seek the highest office in the land.
Taking to his social media pages, the vocal senator shared a quote and a photo in which 'I can be president' was emblazoned and highlighted using red markings.
“Some men see things as they are, and ask why. I dream of things that never were, and ask why not.” Murkomen stated, while quoting Robert Kennedy  - an American politician and lawyer who served as the 64th United States Attorney General from January 1961 to September 1964.
The Majority Leader of the Senate announced his entry into active politics in remarkable fashion, having trumped the powerful Nicholas Biwott and several other veteran politicians in the 2013 general elections.

In 2017, his re-election was almost a formality, as he easily beat is direct competitor, David Kimaiyo, who had previously served as the Inspector General of Police.
The senator's journey into becoming an active public figure started as far back as his time at the University of Nairobi, where during his second year in pursuit of a Bachelors Degree in Law, he was elected as Chairman of the law society of Kenya.
An ardent supporter of Deputy President William Ruto, Murkomen is renowned for his habit of speaking his mind, with total disregard to the occasion, ruffling some feathers in the process.
On January 8, while speaking in Nyeri, he warned President Uhuru Kenyatta that the Jubilee Party was their decade-long investment and that they were all hitched to it until 2022.
"For those of you that thought we'd be leaving the party, you have another thing coming, we have put our own political investment on Uhuru Kenyatta for over 10 years," he stated at the time.
Having already served his two terms as a Senator in his home county, it is inevitable that Murkomen will be going after a new seat in 2022.
He has been at loggerheads with his county governor -Alex Tolgos, ever since the Ksh63 billion Arror and Kimwarer dams project stalled and turned into a national saga riddled with corruption allegations.
The scandal, which led to the arrest and suspension of Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich and his Principal Secretary Kamau Thugge as well as several officials of the Kerio Valley Development Authority, is now a matter before court.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shaka Returns As Jessica Nkosi and Menzi Ngubane Join The Queen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Fergusons have bounced back from a turbulent week by announcing some good news. Barely two months after leaving drama series Isibaya, Jessica Nkosi and veteran actor Menzi Ngubane have found a new home on Mzansi Magic’s most-watched show, The Queen. News that Jessica Nkosi and Menzi Ngubane joined The Queen was however met with mixed reaction.
Also, it was revealed that Shaka is also set to resurrect from the dead and make a come back. Mzansi Magic announced that SK Khoza who played Shaka on “The Queen” will be making a comeback. This comes after Shaka, who viewers were introduced to in season one of the hit show four years ago, was killed off the show last year. It was not clear how Shaka would make a comeback but we guess anything is possible in soapie land.
The Queen currently boasts a viewership of more than 2-million. Adding Jessica Nkosi and Menzi Ngubane to their cast is a sure recipe to boost their viewership.
On Saturday, the production company confirmed in a statement that Jessica Nkosi and Menzi Ngubane were among the new five faces who will be introduced in season five, which promises to be full of surprises.
Although she didn’t reveal much on their characters, she did give away the fact that Nkosi and Ngubane would be playing the father-daughter characters.
Ferguson added: “Get ready to be taken on an emotional roller coaster ride. We are very excited about the talent that will be joining the show. We can confirm that we have five new leads coming on board, and one return that we like to call the comeback kid – that’s SK Khoza.”
The Fergusons Films has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons of late, with an exodus of actors seemingly leaving on a bad note. Many felt they treat their cast members unfairly judging by the mass exodus of actors in recent times. Fans warned Jessica Nkosi and Menzi Ngubane to be careful they might be dropped like hot potatoes.
The latest victim of the Ferguson axe is Dineo Langa, who was allegedly fired recently. However, Connie and Shona Ferguson have refuted the claims, saying Langa’s contract was not terminated as she was still on the payroll until the end of this month.
Langa has kept mum. Shona, the co-executive producer of The Queen, admitted that there had been a negative narrative-driven round some of the people who have left the show. This is the case with all shows, and is not exclusive to The Queen,” he said.
“I suppose that is testament to how invested people are in our characters and our stories, and more importantly in the show itself, The Queen.
The reality is that in the nature of story-telling, especially in long-form characters come and go. Some are designed to stay for a foreseeable future, and some to serve a specific story arc, exit and maybe return at a later stage, depending on how the story develops.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner Says Someone “Close To Home” Has Coronavirus And Lord, I’m So Tired</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was inevitable that Kylie Jenner and the rest of the Kardashian clan would seize upon the coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity for self-promotion. The only question was how shameless they’d be, and based on the new Keeping Up With The Kardashians trailer, the answer to that is “quite shameless indeed.”
The show, currently in its 18th season, will return in September, and will follow the family into quarantine in Los Angeles. The new footage, which seems to have been shot on their personal devices, shows them wearing masks and dealing with the challenges of lockdown, like weeping in closets and joining endless Zoom calls.
The kicker comes when Kylie Jenner, seemingly at the point of tears, appears in a confessional to say: “It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive.” 
Now, the trailer clearly wants us to think that Kris or Kanye or whoever has been struck down with KOVID-19 (patent pending), but this is almost definitely not the case.
Given the deliberately vague wording, the mystery person will almost certainly turn out to be some rando who lives in the next street over (and therefore “close to home”), or somebody with an even more tenuous connection to the family than that.
Still, you kind of have to admire this family’s hustle for finding a way to make this pandemic all about them. Check out the trailer below:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Life in lockdown: Psychiatrist’s survival guide for ‘new bizarre, crazy world’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Are you tired of virtual chat and find yourself guzzling snacks and alcohol while fixating on grim death tolls?
You are not alone in this “new bizarre, crazy world” where primitive instincts can ride roughshod over reason, says consultant psychiatrist Mark Salter.
Mr Salter, from Hackney, east London, shares some survival tips in a BlueJeans online chat with lawyer Jill Greenfield, from Fieldfisher.
He said: “First of all you have to start with the fact we are looking at human beings who have brains, who have lives, who have minds.
“The brain or the mind is something that, by and large, likes stability and predictability.
“So, for most of us, when things are going well, our lives are predictable and vaguely manageable and that means we are switching to a relaxed frame of mind where we can measure, deliberate and take our time.”
But in periods of rapid change, such as in a viral pandemic, anxiety begins to rack up, he said.
Mr Salter said: “Anxiety is the mother of all mental illness – the mother of all unhappiness as well.
“Fear freezes our ability to reason. And that means we fall back on the more primitive, more frightening part of our brain, which is the bit that has been with us ever since we evolved from apes, which teaches us to look after Number One.
“That involves withdrawal, flight, isolation and also a lack of abstract thinking about solutions.”
The biological effect can disrupt normal sleep patterns and people turn to snacking over meals.
Mr Salter said: “We will reach for richer, sweeter foods. We will find ourselves nipping off to the fridge a bit more frequently – comfort-snacking.
“The very important thing that goes with the sleep cycle is the one or two meals a day cycle.
“We retreat to our favourite tranquiliser – usually alcohol.”
As “sociable creatures” the crisis has also meant withdrawing from the world and relying on electronic devices to communicate.
Remote working from home has forced those from different walks of life to rely on video conferencing over face-to-face chat.
On the challenges of speaking to vulnerable clients from afar, Mr Salter said: “It’s very, very hard to reach out to establish and maintain an empathic, understanding, caring, even some may say loving, link with someone at the other end when you are not in the room.
“Those squeaks of the chair, those quiet sighs, those breaks of vision, those silent moments.
“Notice how silence seems so long on Skype, Blue Jeans, Zoom or whatever.
“It’s hard to read the meaning of silence because the silence is devoid of its context and that is a very unconscious, subtle manifestation of this creeping unfamiliarity which has already got us on edge as it is.”
He suggested sitting as close to the screen as possible, ensuring videos are well lit, and discussing the strange artificiality from the start.
He said: “Let silence take effect. Normally we interrupt prematurely.
“A good therapist will understand the importance of letting silence sink in.”
Using video conferencing is like speaking a foreign language, he said.
“As you will know when you are in a country for the first time and you are using your schoolgirl French – it’s exhausting.
“You can minimise that exhaustion, but it takes a lot of patience.”
He said the whole process requires more cognitive effort, meaning the brain burns more glucose.
“The act of trying to seem as if you are familiar with a situation in which you are relatively unfamiliar burns energy. It’s exhausting.
“That’s a reason why you have to look after your body.
“Watch what comes out of your mouth and what goes into it.”
He said maintaining a normal sleep cycle, having “down time”, keeping up with friends and getting out of the house are all important.
As humans in crisis, we look out for anything that is a threat or risk and become “sensitised” to events.
Mr Salter warned against developing an unhealthy fixation with negative news.
People are drawn to “trigger words” like Covid, death, disaster, ventilators, and PPE, which resonate in the “new bizarre, crazy world”, he said.
“There is an old line in the media: ‘If it bleeds, it leads’. In this case it’s ‘If it coughs, wheezes and dies, it leads’.
“So what we are doing is looking out for Covid-positive items.
“That is at the expense of looking out for things we probably would have looked out for elsewhere when we were more relaxed.
“If we are not careful, we can get into this terrible ‘pas de deux’ with the media.
“Psychologists call it an availability cascade. You are frightened; journalists know they can get your attention by giving you things that are frightening that will resonate with you.”
Mr Salter advises using trusted websites, stretching the brain and trying not to “soak up more of the same because of fearful fixity on a single subject”.
And just when we get used to the new normal, a fresh fear approaches – what will the world look like when we open our doors again?
Mr Salter supports clients who have been physically and psychologically injured following terror attacks, sexual abuse and road crashes.
Ms Greenfield said: “It’s vital that support doesn’t go away during lockdown. My team, Mark and other therapists like him offer invaluable contact via online platforms to keep people going.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Draft 2020 calendar includes Spa, Hungary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to sources, the calendar was sent to certain members of the media by an unnamed F1 team.
It follows earlier news that Spa and Monza may in fact be excluded from the racing if it gets underway this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“Yes, it is still quite possible to have a Belgian GP,” race promoter Spa Grand Prix president Melchior Wathelet confirmed to RTBF.
“The date is still free and Belgium is a candidate for the organisation of its event.”
As well as ‘double races’ in Austria, Britain and even Bahrain later in the year, the calendar includes Barcelona, China and Hanoi – but not Zandvoort or Singapore.
Italian automobile club president Angelo Sticchi Damiani told Formula Passion that Italy might also host a second race in addition to Monza.
“Personally I would be pleased if we could consider the Imola and Mugello circuits for a possible second Formula 1 race,” he said.
Officials in Azerbaijan, meanwhile, hit back at earlier claims that the Baku street race will definitely not go ahead.
“The information put out by media outlets on this issue is not true, as Formula 1 has not yet announced a new race calendar,” a spokesman told Trend news agency.
A race in Hungary may be able to dodge the country’s new events ban until mid-August by hosting its round later in that month. The new provisional calendar pencils in an August 23 race date for Budapest.
Still, there are those who are opposed to F1’s push to get back up and racing.
“It seems absolutely incredible to me that in the current situation, with the pandemic still raging, one series can be so optimistic by saying that the season can start in July,” Finnish broadcaster Niki Juusela told C More.
“It feels as though there is now pressure to make some kind of plan, and that the importance of this is greater than realism itself.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Facebook group honors Acadiana seniors, touches thousands</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAFAYETTE, LA. (AP) - With schools closed across Louisiana and the country due to COVID-19, seniors’ final semesters are not turning out like they thought.
So an Acadiana mom started a Facebook group with a simple post about her graduating senior son, Seth. She wanted to recognize him and his big brother, Blake, who is graduating from college, along with everyone else in their shoes.
“I thought, ‘What’s something that we can do to help kids have the best end of their senior year they can have?‘” Amanda Menard Hunt said.
The “Greater Acadiana Area Adopt A Senior 2020″ group was born April 13. Ten days later it has more than 16,000 members, and about 2,000 high school and college graduates have been “adopted.”
People from across the community and beyond have showered their adoptee with little gifts, from their favorite snacks to T-shirts and gift cards.
Many of them know each other; some don’t. They’re sending envelopes in the mail and leaving baskets of goodies on doorsteps.
“I didn’t expect it to grow like it did, but I love it,” Hunt said. “The outpouring of positivity is insane.”
‘IT’S AN OUTPOURING OF LOVE’
It’s grown into a movement, with local seniors adopting each other and more states following Hunt’s lead. She’s created about 12 similar groups for other states.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Things will look a bit different at the 2020 Kids’ Choice Awards on May 2. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the show will have to take place virtually, with stars calling in from home to make appearances on fans’ television screens. However, in years’ past, the award show has been the perfect opportunity for celebrity parents to bring their kids to a red carpet event. So many stars have walked the KCA’s orange carpet with their little ones, and it’s given us so many adorable family photos over the years.
Even after ending their marriage, Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey made a point to bring their twins, Moroccan and Monroe, to the family-friendly show on more than one occasion. The two have remained good friends since their split, and the foursome always looks beyond adorable while taking red carpet photos together. Whether they’re in matching outfits or striking goofy poses, this family has the KCAs down pat, and we love that Mariah and Nick are still able to come together for this fun occasion with their kids.
Meanwhile, In 2015, Angelina Jolie had a special night out with her daughters, Zahara and Shiloh, at the Kids’ Choice Awards. While trio did not hit the red carpet, they were seated inside the show together, and the girls looked SO happy while taking in the fun-filled show. Angelina won an award during the event, and Zahara and Shiloh could not contain their excitement as they jumped up and hugged their gorgeous mama before she hit the stage.
Another adorable KCAs appearance was Blac Chyna and her son, King Cairo, in 2017. Blac had just given birth to her daughter, Dream, a few months earlier, but she made sure all her attention was on King for this fun mother/son night out!
There were plenty of more amazing celebrity family moments at the Kids’ Choice Awards over the years! From Lamar Odom to Kevin Hart to DJ Khaled and plenty more with their cute kids, click through the gallery above to check them all out!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Family issue desperate appeal to find 'vulnerable' brother who disappeared after visiting aunt</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Police are searching for a ‘vulnerable’ young man who disappeared after visiting his Scottish family.
Aaron Simpson has not been seen since around 10pm on Thursday night when he was caught on CCTV at Mount Florida Train Station in Glasgow.
The 22-year-old, who has mental health difficulties, has failed to make any contact with his frantic loved ones who are desperately appealing for help to find him.
He is described as being 5ft 5 and speaks with an Essex accent.
The young man had been visiting a relative in Mount Florida before going to the transport hub to catch a train back to Paisley, where he had been staying.
Relative Robert Thomson said: “He’s in a vulnerable state of mind and he doesn’t know anyone up here apart from the family that we know of.
“He hasn’t gone to any family members house. We have contacted the police who are looking for him also.
“He has an aunt in Mount Florida who he was visiting but he never returned there after missing the last train back to Paisley.
“He suffers from mental health problems so I am very worried about him. He also hasn’t accessed his phone since.”
Police Scotland confirmed they are continuing to search for Aaron.
A spokeswoman said: “Enquiries continue and we would ask anyone with information to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1212 of Friday, 1 May.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City's most influential players of the Sheikh Mansour era ranked</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City have been transformed as a football club since being purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008.
In the 128 years prior to the takeover, City won two league titles and four FA Cups, and in the 12 years since have won the Premier League four times and the FA Cup twice.
The recent success has come in two phases. First, the initial triumph under Roberto Mancini in 2012 and subsequent, similar triumph two years later with Manuel Pellegrini at the helm. Then, following a few years of gradual decline, Pep Guardiola arrived to transform their fortunes.
Here, we take a look at the ten most important City players in that time, ranking them on influence and longevity.
Zabaleta actually arrived at City before they were taken over, which makes it all the more remarkable he stayed to become such a crucial part of the team that won the first two league titles in 2011/12 and 2013/14.
He spent seven years between 2008 and 2015 as the team’s first-choice right-back and remained at City for another two seasons, putting him seventh in the chart for Premier League appearances for the club.
Having fulfilled his potential under Pep Guardiola, Sterling has become arguably the most influential English footballer of his generation. From calling out racist abuse to his charity work, Sterling’s journey in England has been an inspirational story.
He was also outstanding for City during their back-to-back Premier League wins under Guardiola, scoring 35 goals between 2017 and 2019.
Despite his decline over the last few years, Hart’s role in the formation of the modern City should not be forgotten. Before Guardiola arrived, he was the team’s number one - and a natural leader - between 2007 and 2016.
He was one of the Premier League’s best goalkeepers when City won their first two league titles, making a total of 226 league appearances for the club, the second-most in the Premier League era.
The man who ultimately replaced Hart will no doubt go on to spend many more years at Man City. Ederson has changed the way England thinks about goalkeepers, his extraordinary technical ability allowing Guardiola’s tactics to take hold in English football.
City might not have been able to dominate quite so brilliantly between 2017 and 2019 without Ederson starting moves. He is the most influential Premier League goalkeeper of the 21st century.
Possibly the most talented footballer to have ever played for City, De Bruyne only ranks sixth on this list because his legacy is not yet finished. He will no doubt win more titles in the coming years, but for now his two winners’ medals leave him midtable.
De Bruyne was on course to break the Premier League assist record before the suspension, and leaving out his injury-hit 2018/19 season the last three years have brought 16, 16, and 18 league assists. He is the creative linchpin of the Guardiola project.
Man City top 50 players of all-time - ranked

The turning point for Mancini and City came in the summer of 2010, when the club signed David Silva and Yaya Toure from Spain. The latter quickly became the powerhouse in central midfield, a defining emblem of the project and driving force behind everything that followed.
That first league title, in 2011/12, was crucial; the most important moment in the making of the modern Manchester City. That’s why Toure ranks above De Bruyne here, even if the Ivorian’s influence waned by the time Guardiola arrived.
The top four have been present for all of the glory years so far, and it is very difficult to separate them. Fernandinho’s influence hardly needs to be explained, although he is the most subtle footballer to survive Mancini to Guardiola.
The Brazilian’s ability to break up counter-attacks, sweep up in front of the back four, and sew things together while City are in possession ensured he was Guardiola’s most important player in the Centurion season.
Aguero has scored 254 goals and counting for City, making him their all-time record goalscorer, and while his consistent excellence is enough to earn a high spot on this list, there are two even bigger reasons for his inclusion.
First, the way Aguero dramatically altered his game to fit in with Guardiola’s system is often underplayed. But that fact is eclipsed, of course, by the Argentine’s iconic title-winning moment against Queens Park Rangers in 2012.
Nobody sums up City under the Abu Dhabi United Group like David Silva, whose elegance and creative genius has connected the dots for Mancini, Pellegrini, and Guardiola.
The Spaniard might not top any charts for goals and assists, but the way he has gelled the team together is unmatched. Silva would surely get into anyone’s Premier League team of the 21st century.
Who else? The statue that Gary Neville alluded to when Kompany scored that stunning goal against Leicester City in 2019 hasn’t been built yet, but it is surely coming. The Belgian centre-back captained City between 2011 and 2019, leading the team through all of its best years.
Not only has he been the brick wall in defence for that period, he has also scored plenty of crucial goals, including the winner in the Manchester derby in 2012 that put City in the driving seat ahead of their first Premier League win.

    <h5 class="mb-1">More people looking to foster, adopt dogs during pandemic (3 photos)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The not-for-profit organization, Golden Rescue, has its hands full with a number of adoption applications at the moment.
Like many organizations, they've had to make some changes during the pandemic - including contactless rescue, foster, and adoption processes to protect volunteers, their families, and the dogs as well.
Typically, Golden Rescue would receive two to five foster applications in a good month. However, it's reporting 63 eager new foster homes since March.
As for adoptions, the organization on average sees up to 100 applications per month, with 60 sent in during the first week of April alone.
Neil Sarginson recently adopted a golden from the group. Sarginson says, having a dog right now has benefited his family in more ways than one.
"Having a dog in this time, dogs are great to be around, goldens are just wonderful. They can sense your emotions, and when you're a little more stressed, just petting the dog and being relaxed with them really helps quite a bit."
Sarginson says, having a dog during a global pandemic has a number of benefits, beyond just companionship.
"I think the other thing is too, you get outside, you get some fresh air, walking. When you see other dog walkers, the dogs can of course walk up and say hi to each other, but we can't - but at least we start talking to each other so at least we start talking to each other. So it keeps the human interaction going, which I think is fantastic."
Aside from more dogs being adopted, and more homes wanting to foster the animals, Sarginson says the number of dogs needing a place to live has gone up as well.
"You'd be really helping out these loving creatures that just want nothing but to please you all the time, and to come and have a good life and have a forever home."
Golden Rescue operates strictly by help of volunteers, so 100 per cent of the funds raised goes directly towards the dogs rescued.
Sarginson adds, because of the pandemic, the group will not been able to carry out their usual May to August fundraising so they are in desperate need of donations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Seahawks Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin give a virtual commencement speech to alma mater Central Florida</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unique times call for unique ways of conducting traditional ceremonies.
And maybe there were no two people better to fill the duties of giving a commencement speech in 2020 than members of a family who have overcome sizable obstacles to reach significant heights in their profession — Seahawks Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin.
The twins delivered a roughly eight-minute virtual commencement address Saturday to the graduating class at Central Florida in Orlando, Florida, their alma mater. They graduated from UCF in 2016 with Bachelor of Arts degrees in Human Communication.
Dressed in “half suits” bearing UCF colors, the two took turns speaking, each saying they didn’t want to read off a piece of paper, but that they wanted to speak from the heart.
Shaquill — the oldest of the two by roughly two minutes — spoke first, telling of how he “hit a little wall” during his junior year at UCF, “(forgot) the worth that I thought I had” and “thought I wasn’t going to make it.”
He said at that time he was inspired greatly by seeing how Shaquem — who lost his left hand at the age of 4 due to amniotic band syndrome — was beginning to make a real impact on the field for Central Florida.
“He doesn’t know that he’s one of my biggest motivators,” Shaquill said.

Shaquill said he hoped that would be a lesson to graduates to always “know your worth.”
“Now it’s time to just find your purpose,” Shaquill said. “What’s the reason why you did all this? What’s the reason why you sacrificed so much time, so much time away from family, to be able to get this next exam done, to make sure you have the best grades so you can achieve whatever you want to achieve? So find your purpose. Find what makes you happy. Find what you love and take full advantage of it.”
Following Shaquill, Shaquem talked about what can be gained in accepting the challenge when adversity hits.
“Don’t let adversity dictate who you are going to be,” Shaquem said.
Shaquem talked of his first year with the Seahawks when he said being drafted to join Shaquill made him feel like everything was going his way “until it wasn’t” — which was likely a reference to the challenge of being a starter for the first game of his NFL career and barely playing the rest of the season.
Shaquem said to get through that time he drew on many of the lessons he learned in college.

“That was something that I needed,’’ he said. “Something that taught me, something that built me to be a better person.’’
Earlier in the week, the two told reporters that in preparation for the event they scoured the internet looking for “inspiring commencement speeches,” and coming across one from former President Barack Obama.
“I don’t think I’m going to top that one,” Shaquill said, according to TampaBay.com.
Shaquill Griffin is entering his fourth season with the Seahawks as a cornerback and Shaquem Griffin his third season as a linebacker.
A press release from the school reported that “approximately 8,500 UCF degrees were conferred” on Saturday during 12 separate and successive ceremonies. All graduate’s names were read aloud. Overall, UCF has awarded more than 354,000 total degrees since classes began in 1968.
The school also noted in its release that “nearly half of this semester’s degrees were earned by students from underrepresented communities. Hispanic students comprised more than one quarter of all UCF degree recipients. Annually, the University graduates one of the highest numbers of minorities in the nation.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alexander Albon denies penalised Leclerc a virtual F1 hat-trick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alexander Albon won a virtual Formula One thriller, against a field that included England cricketers Ben Stokes and Stuart Broad, around Brazil's Interlagos circuit on Sunday to deny Charles Leclerc an esports hat-trick.
The Thai's victory over his Ferrari rival gave Red Bull something to celebrate on a day that should have seen the return of Max Verstappen's home Dutch Grand Prix after a 35-year absence.
Formula One's 2020 season has yet to start due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has shut down sport worldwide, with the postponed race at Zandvoort one of many casualties.
The Brazilian layout, with all the drivers competing online from the comfort of their homes, was chosen by fans because Zandvoort does not feature in the 2019 version of the video game.
It provided more changes of lead than commentators could count after Stoffel Vandoorne, on pole for Mercedes a day after doing the same in a virtual Formula E race, threw away his advantage.
Albon, who collided with six-times world champion Lewis Hamilton on the penultimate lap of the real Brazilian race last year while running second, made no mistakes in a wheel-to-wheel race-long battle.
Leclerc, winner of the last two virtual races in China and Vietnam, traded the lead on almost every lap but opted for the hard tyres at his pit stop while the Red Bull driver came in later for mediums.
Leclerc picked up a three second penalty with 13 laps to go for exceeding track limits, dropping the 22-year-old Monegasque to third at the end behind Williams' George Russell.
"I was shaking afterwards, I had so much adrenaline in my body. I feel more scared driving the simulator than I do the real thing. The pressure was unbelievable," said Albon.
Leclerc said it was 'proper fun' and similar to the real scrap he had in Austria with Verstappen, only with "less contact and even more overtaking.
"I knew I had the penalty but after that it was also about having fun, so I kept overtaking Alex," he added. "I really enjoyed this race."
The rivalry between World Cup-winner Stokes and test teammate Broad provided a sub plot, with the former taking bragging rights in 13th place to Broad's 17th.
"Me and Stu were training together actually," said Stokes.
"As soon as we knew that we were about to do the proper race it just completely threw all of that out of the window and we were both very, very nervous."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Canberra records its first sub-zero morning for 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Canberra has recorded its coldest morning of the year with the temperature dropping below zero for the first time in 2020.
The mercury reached minus 1.4 degrees at Canberra Airport just after 6am on Monday.
The Bureau of Meteorology said Monday's minimum was four degrees below the average low for May.
However, it hasn't quite broken temperature records, with the coldest May temperature being even lower at minus 7.5.
Widespread frost was also seen across Canberra.
Meteorologist Helen Reid said the low temperatures were driven by a high-pressure system that was forming across south-east Australia.
"As the wind eased over the last few days, with clear skies and light winds, that's allowed for the temperature to get quite cool," she said.
"The cold has been a bit more notable without the wind."
Ms Reid said the high-pressure system was sitting behind the cold front that moved through the ACT late last week, which brought strong winds and cold temperatures.
The cold front brought with it winds of up to 90km/h in some areas, while southern parts of the ACT such as Corin Forest received a dusting of snow.
While the temperatures on Monday may be colder than those seen on the weekend, snow was not expected to fall.
Ms Reid said the wind was not expected to reach the speeds seen several days ago.
"The alpine region could have another severe weather warning situation, but the ACT itself is expected to be less windy," she said.
The high-pressure system is set to stick around for the next few days, however, the temperatures aren't forecast to be as cold as those on Monday morning.
"It will get gradually warmer over the next day or two and there'll be chilly mornings but not quite as cold," Ms Reid said.
"There's the possibility of frost, getting to only 2 degrees tomorrow morning."
The high-pressure system will give way to another cold front later in the week, but Ms Reid said it wasn't likely it would be as severe as the one seen in Canberra last week.
Monday will see the temperature rise to a top of 16 after its frosty start."
Frost is also expected on Tuesday morning with a low of 2 and a top of 17 with sunny conditions expected.
Minimum temperatures will remain in single digits for the rest of the week, getting down to 3 on Wednesday and 6 on Thursday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Biden: I'll Protect the Press, Even Though My Staff Locked a Reporter In a Closet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Biden campaign on Sunday released a statement honoring journalists for their work to keep Americans informed on "World Press Freedom Day." He also used the opportunity to punch back at President Donald Trump for claiming the media is the "enemy of the people" and his use of the term "fake news."
"Today is World Press Freedom Day – a day to recognize the vital importance of journalism to upholding free and open democracies, both here at home and around the world. It's also a day to honor the journalists who dedicate their lives to advancing media freedom, at times braving immense pressure, sacrificing livelihood or liberty, or even facing mortal danger to bring the truth to light," Biden said in a statement.
"... A free press is essential to a free society. Tyrants know this all too well. That is why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook," the statement read. "And, it's why Donald Trump's repeated efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path. When he labels the press as the 'ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE' or decries 'FAKE NEWS,' he is eroding our essential, Constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press in ways large and small."
According to the campaign, President Trump continually "bullies and berates" reporters as a means of deflecting from his "failed leadership." Biden said that although most presidents are unhappy with reporters digging to get the facts, none have "attacked the independence of journalists and launched an all-out assault on the media" the way Trump has.
The former vice president promised to hold regular "fact-based" press briefings from major departments and agencies and "restore a relationship with the independent press that is grounded in mutual respect" should he win in November.
While all of that sounds fine and dandy, Biden seems to forget one thing: back in 2011, Scott Powers, a reporter for the Orland Sun Sentinel, was locked in a storage closet during a fundraiser. The goal was to keep Powers from talking with people before the vice president showed up. 
Biden spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander responded at the time by saying it was an "unfortunate mistake of an inexperienced staffer and the vice president's office has made sure it will never happen again."
According to a spokeswoman, Powers was put in a so-called "hold room," which is a place for reporters to work while part of the press pool that covers the vice president. Although Powers was provided with a table and chair to work, Alexander agreed that "a hold room should not be a storage room."
At the time, the Sun Sentinel said Powers was ordered to stay in the storage closet until Biden took the podium to address high-dollar donors. A Biden staffer stood outside the room to ensure Powers stayed in place until Biden was on stage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will Smith's heartbreaking tribute to Fresh Prince Of Bel Air co-star James Avery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Will Smith paid an emotional tribute to his Fresh Prince Of Bel Air co-star James Avery during a virtual reunion with the rest of the cast.
He was joined by Tatyana Ali, Alfonso Ribeiro, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Karyn Parsons, Daphne Reid and Joseph Marcell on his Snapchat series Will From Home to remember Avery, who played the Banks family patriarch Uncle Phil.
He died in 2014 due to complications from open heart surgery.
During the reunion, the group watched a montage of footage of Avery from the hit sitcom and Smith wiped his eyes as he said: “That just makes me teary.”
Posting a clip from the reunion on Instagram, Smith wrote: “Our show wouldn’t have been HALF what it was without the talent and light that was James Avery.
“We all love and miss you, James.
During the reunion, Jazzy Jeff, real name Jeffrey Allen Townes, also discussed his battle with suspected coronavirus.
Ribeiro told him: “You had us all scared, and Townes replied: “Not as scared as I was. It was a little rough but I’m definitely happy to be on the other side.”
The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air ran from 1990 to 1996.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Moynihan: Opportunities now abound for Paul in not-so-normal times</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul - congrats, bubbeleh!
The reviews are in and Normal People is a success. I hear that the burghers of your native land are up in arms and complaining about the sex scenes. Believe me, there’s no such thing as bad publicity, my friend. We’re away.
We have to talk, though. I see that everyone is talking about the sports content - how realistic it is, how rare it is to see a realistic depiction on-screen of Gaelic football (is that really what you call it? Marketing department, line one!)
This is fine as far as it goes, Paul, but I see you giving interviews. Talking about Kildare. Talking about being a minor and U21 county player.
Now some of that interview was harmless. Saying that your sport helped “in terms of self-discipline and being ready and being able to capitalize on opportunities” - that’s textbook actorese. Looks real, sounds real, but means nothing. Couldn't have put it better myself.
The other parts, I’m not so sure. “When it came to applying for colleges, I was putting down law and arts and things that would support playing Gaelic football”.
Come on Paul. That won’t fly. Nobody would believe that an amateur sportsman would make a career choice based on that. Believe me.
You may know Gaelic games, but I know the real world.
Better news, though, with the new scripts coming in. There are a couple of projects here - Anchorman: The Mick Lyons Story is one, Get Out (The Goalie Talks) - and as far as I can figure, your only real competition is Chris O’Dowd. You were telling me he was - am I right? - the Roscommon minor ‘keeper in the 1997 Connacht final, if any of those words mean anything in reality, but I think you have the inside track.
For instance, just because you played club football in Kildare - am I even saying that right? - we’ve already been sent a few boxing scripts. I have no doubt you’d star in any of those roles, but what I want to avoid is having to get some poor boxer to say you could have boxed professionally as soon as the movie is released.
Let’s try to hold onto our self-respect in this lousy business, am I right?
The other genre we need to avoid is the old reliable - the movie star as hot-rod car racer.
Now, there was a time when this was good enough for Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Steve McQueen and Tom Cruise: they all made race-car movies, they all enjoyed them and - most important - those movies made money.
But now . . . the new green agenda, carbon footprints, electric cars: it’s just not as sexy any more.
You don’t believe me? Look up one of my other clients, he’ll tell you all about it. Le Mans ’66 is doing okay, and one of the main men in that movie is Matt Damon - he’s sheltering in place somewhere near you at the moment, I believe.
But Paul, I have to ask you to stay away from one topic if you meet up with Matt.
Everyone thinks he’s trapped in Ireland but he’s got another reason to hang out on the Emerald Isle.
He got an early look at Normal People and he’s decided to branch into filmmaking with Gaelic games as a template. Last week he told me he’s moving to some place in east Cork to prepare for his next role: shaving back his hairline, wearing blue contact lenses, using a hurley and ball to build up his skills for a new biopic.
(The name they use for this ball in hurling I can’t even begin to spell. Oy.)
It’s under wraps right now but I can tell you Aaron Sorkin has a second draft ready to go.
They haven’t cast the second lead, if you’re interested. How’s your Cork accent?
A question.
Is anyone else scrolling absently through online sports-gear websites, mindlessly clicking on the availability of random tops and t-shirts for the simple comfort of having one’s attention blunted by plenitude?
Who knew, for instance, that you could get a personalised New York Subliners top for only $99? Or that a Brazil 1970 jersey (kids version) can be had for just £24, though the authentic sweat-stains need to be supplied by the wearer? Or a ROOTED IN OAKLAND t-shirt is available for just $22.49 (though shipping may be extra)?
What amazes me is the sheer variety, the infinite differences. I remember a seminal day in second year in school when one of our classmates produced a replica Barcelona kit for PE; his brother had been working in Spain and came through with this ground-breaking ensemble.
Now every last variation in the Barcelona catalogue is available to you at the click of a mouse. If you had told 14-year-old me that this world would exist I would have confidently predicted my instantaneous insolvency on assimilating that fact.
Now it just serves as an anaesthetic.
Apart from the Fanatics Branded Toronto Maple Leafs Blue/White Mission Full-Zip Hoodie.
That one’s mine.
There isn’t much happening in the way of sports news - see the largest chunk of this week’s column if you doubt me - but a development overseas caught my eye a few days ago.
You’re aware that college sports in America is a hugely lucrative business for the colleges involved - there have been suggestions that the shutdown of college sports in the States may actually endanger some colleges’ future, never mind the sports’ future, so central is that income to those institutions.
Last week, though, we learned the NCAA, the organisation regulating college sports, is to allow student athletes to cash in on their likenesses, images and names, thus bringing an end to what one observer called the greatest economic model ever conceived: one in which those generating vast revenues earn no part of those revenues.
This is an interesting development which has the potential to turn a century’s tradition on its head and create a financial/economic headache for those in charge of sports beloved across an entire country.
Feel free to draw any parallels you want with similar situations here.
Many thanks to the Yale University Press for zipping out a copy of Sons Of The Waves by Philip Taylor. The subtitle should inform you of its appeal to me: The Common Seaman in the Heroic Age of Sail.
Like a lot of you I enjoyed Master and Commander, with Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, but the books behind that movie I have to avoid in case of sudden, ruinous addiction to the works of Patrick O’Brian.
This Taylor book more than compensates. If you think it has no relevance to the current moment, think for a second. Here’s a book that tells you what it’s like for people to spend years on end living cheek by jowl with each other - literally - though hopefully in your situation scurvy is not a real prospect any time soon. A triumph.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Movie fans around the world are preparing to mark Star Wars Day.
The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with aficionados wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Fans refer to the movies’ famous phrase May The Force Be With You by declaring “May the Fourth be with you”.
Last year, after the death of Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew, his family shared a special message, saying that “May the 4th is a tribute to the scale of Star Wars reach”.
Entertainment giant Disney+ is putting the final instalment in the Skywalker saga, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, on its platform on the day.
The Rise Of Skywalker was released in December and featured a star-studded cast including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver.
It received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 52% score on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film earned just over one billion dollars at the global box office, making it less successful than both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin May be Topping Out After Buyers Lost a Key Level</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has entered what appears to be another bout of sideways trading within the upper-$8,000 region. This has come about after the crypto’s bulls made another attempt to propel it past the resistance that has been established throughout the lower-to-mid $9,000 region.
The benchmark crypto’s recent price action has led analysts to note that it could be topping out, as the consecutive rejections it has posted throughout the past few days is a dire sign that greatly favors sellers.
If the crypto confirms this possibility and begins declining lower, its first major support zone exists around $8,250.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up marginally at its current price of $8,935, marking a notable decline from daily highs of $9,200 that were set yesterday afternoon.
The crypto was able to post what appeared to be a sustained break above $9,000 yesterday afternoon, as buyers held BTC above this level for several hours before moving to test the resistance at $9,200.
The visit to this level, however, sparked a sharp selloff that led it down to its strong support at $8,800, which has since been defended.
One popular crypto trader spoke about this latest rejection in a recent tweet, explaining that it is now imperative that buyers continue defending the crypto’s point-of-control at $8,800.

Another popular pseudonymous trader recently explained that he believes BTC could be forming a local top as it fails to surmount its overhead resistance.

Because Bitcoin has broken below $9,000 in the time since this analysis was offered, it is a growing possibility that the crypto declines lower in the hours and days ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kelvin Gastelum targets July comeback and Israel Adesanya rematch after full LCL tear of knee</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kelvin Gastelum doesn’t live with regret. But in the aftermath of his loss to Darren Till this past November, he knows he probably should have sat that one out.
Following a five-round war with Israel Adesanya at UFC 236, Gastelum booked his next fight six months later. He didn’t quite feel like himself after coming up just short in his bid to capture the interim middleweight title.
“I realized I should have taken more time off after my fight against Israel,” Gastelum said in an interview with MMA Fighting. “I felt like I needed to prove something after losing that title fight, and I kind of rushed myself back in there in a fight against Darren Till.
“Obviously, it didn’t work out in my favor. I wasn’t very emotionally invested in that fight. Obviously, I trained for that fight, and Darren Till had a great game plan for me and how to neutralize my game. I realized after that fight, I should have taken more time off.”
The three-round bout ended in a split decision loss and consecutive setbacks for Gastelum.
“It’s not like he outclassed me,” he said. “He might have landed one punch more than me or something. He didn’t outclass me. I don’t feel like he was the better man that night. I just feel like mentally, physically, emotionally, I was not there that night – on top of him having a really great game plan. He nullified all of the tools that I had.”
Never one to stay away from the gym for long, Gastelum kept training after the loss. But in January, he suffered a knee injury that knocked him out of action. Luckily, he wasn’t forced to go under the knife to repair the damage. But it forced him to the sidelines for a few months.
“I’ve been recovering from a torn LCL back in January – I had a full tear,” Gastelum revealed. “No surgery needed, thankfully. Just been doing therapy on it and reconstructive therapy on it. It’s about 85 or 90 percent there.
“I’m just starting to grapple a bit, starting to box again. I’m starting to kick again. Training is picking back up a little bit. Just at the right time. Hopefully by July — I don’t know where this whole pandemic thing will be by then — but I’m hoping to fight by July.”
Considering how the fight with Till played out, Gastelum is thankful for the time off, even if it wasn’t under ideal circumstances.
“This injury was kind of a blessing in disguise, where I was able to take that time off to heal up physically, mentally and emotionally after that last year that I had,” he said.
Now that he’s back in the gym, Gastelum is anxious to book his next fight so he can begin the climb back up the middleweight ranks.
After splitting four rounds with Adesanya this past April, Gastelum was five minutes away from becoming champion, but he ultimately came up short. That loss still stings, but it’s also served as motivation to work his way back to another shot at gold.
“You work your whole life toward this type of opportunity, and I lost,” Gastelum said. “It burns in my soul to be that close to a dream that you’ve had for the longest time, which is to be world champion. It burns my soul. But at the same time, I don’t want to be one of those guys 10 years from now that says, ‘I was that close, one round away from beating the champion.’
“No, I want to be able to say I did it. I’m still going to work through, I’m still going to make another run. I’m only 28 years old. I don’t even think I’ve hit my physical prime yet. I feel like I’ve got a lot of room to grow and I’m excited for it.”
As far as what comes next, Gastelum is open to just about any fight against another top-ranked middleweight, though there is one name in particular that stands out when he scans the division for potential opponents.
“I like to be able to fight anybody in the top-five,” Gastelum said. “In my opinion, a fight with Jack Hermansson would make sense. We’re both coming off losses. He’s in the top-five. A win for either of us would take us where we need to go.
“We both need to work our way back up the division, back up to Adesanya. I feel that’s the one that makes sense, but you never know what the matchmakers are thinking.”

Movie fans around the world are preparing to mark Star Wars Day.
The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with aficionados wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Fans refer to the movies’ famous phrase May The Force Be With You by declaring “May the Fourth be with you”.
Last year, after the death of Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew, his family shared a special message, saying that “May the 4th is a tribute to the scale of Star Wars reach”.
Entertainment giant Disney+ is putting the final instalment in the Skywalker saga, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, on its platform on the day.
The Rise Of Skywalker was released in December and featured a star-studded cast including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver.
It received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 52% score on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film earned just over one billion dollars at the global box office, making it less successful than both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM, rename it WHO CARES</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Indian Railways are charging migrants an additional Rs 50 to ferry them back to their homes.
The BJP-run government in Karnataka announced a “double” bus fare, including the return rate presumably because the vehicles would have to return empty, before withdrawing it because of a furore.
The rare display of “economic prudence” by the arms of the State threw up a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma: what happened to the celebrated PM CARES Fund?
The controversial fund has apparently been raking in money, blessed by companies vying with one another to contribute to the national cause even if they cannot pay their employees.
Critics say its opaqueness and favoured treatment (donations to the PM CARES Fund can be counted under the corporate social responsibility head while the same concession is not allowed to chief ministers’ funds) suggest its main objective is to glorify the Prime Minister.
The dedicated fund has been set up with the “primary objective of dealing with any kind of emergency or distress situation, like (that) posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to provide relief to the affected”.
Lakhs of migrants who have been locked up for over a month without any means of livelihood should meet the conditions of “distress situation” and “affected”. The acronym “CARES” — which stands for Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations — sounds like it was coined to help people like the distressed migrants.
So far, no one in authority has said how much money from the PM CARES Fund has been spent on the migrants or why their fare is not being paid from the fund. Even a “distressed” party like the Congress has offered the Karnataka government Rs 1 crore to take care of the migrants’ travel.
Asked how much the PM CARES Fund had collected so far and whether any allocation had been made yet, a government official associated with the PMO replied on phone on Sunday: “No information.”
Neither does the website of the PM CARES Fund provide any information on how much money has been collected or what the money has been used for. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of the fund while the defence minister and the home minister are its ex-officio trustees.
Several corporate groups have publicly announced that they are donating hundreds of crores to the PM CARES Fund.
The railway decision to charge the migrants an additional Rs 50 stands out because the national utility itself had contributed Rs 151 crore to the PM CARES Fund.
According to a letter the director (passenger marketing) in the Railway Board sent to the principal chief commercial managers of all the zonal railways on May 1, the ticket costs of the special non-stop trains would be the fares for Sleeper, Mail and Express trains plus a super-fast charge of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.
Several of the chief ministers’ relief funds provide more information on collections and disbursals. The Kerala chief minister’s disaster relief fund has often been described as offering the best template of transparency and accountability, providing details of both income and expenditure that are updated in real time.
Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav tweeted in Hindi that even the BJP’s staunchest supporters were now wondering about the use of all the crores that had been deposited in the PM CARES Fund “if the poorest of the poor are being asked to pay for their return journey home”.
Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren has urged the central government to reconsider its decision to charge extra from the passengers.
CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said: “It is sheer cruelty to expect workers who have absolutely no earnings for the last two months, because of the lockdown, to pay for their own train tickets. Nor can state governments bear this financial expenditure when they have not received any help from the central government.”
The CPM politburo demanded that the Centre bear the entire travel expenses of the workers who want to go home. The politburo has said that all arrangements for their safe travel within a state must be made by the state governments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IMD puts low-pressure area under extended watch of 7 days</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Increasing uncertainty over enabling environment over the South Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal has ruled out any definite forecast with respect to the life of a resident low-pressure area, three days after its formation.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has merely decided to put the system under watch for the next seven days given the fact that the pre-monsoon season (April-May) can always throw up a surprise. It also referred to a series of projections by global weather models ranging from practically nil activity in the short to medium term over the Bay to a potentially strong cyclone developing there.
What seem to prevent the intensification is the inconsistent cloud-building process around the system as well as a slight increase in the vertical wind shear (sudden change in wind speed and direction with height).
A storm can develop only in an environment of low vertical wind shear values. The IMD’s best hope is that the system could become well-marked over the South-East Bay around May 7 while moving slowly to the North-West (towards Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh coasts) and concentrate into a depression the following day.
Currently, some global and domestic weather models do not even capture the low-pressure area. These include the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMRWF); the IMD-GFS (Global Forecast System); the NCEP-GFS (the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction-Global Forecast System); the GEFS (Global Ensemble Forecast System); the NEPS (Ensemble Prediction System of India’s National Centres for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, NCMRWF); and the NCUM, a global coupled model from NCMRWF.
But the ECMRWF, IMD-GFS, and NCEP-GFS signal cyclogenesis (birth of a cyclone) over the South-West Bay of Bengal (closer to the Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu coasts) by end of next week with rapid intensification and a movement to the North-North-West into the East-Central Bay up to the Andhra Pradesh coast.
There is, however, large variation with respect to the date of cyclogenesis.
The IMD’s Genesis Potential Parameter-based outlook indicates that the zone of cyclogenesis may move North-North-West towards the East-Central Bay (open Bay waters) during the next four days.
It is in view of these conflicting outlooks that the IMD has resolved to keep the area over the Andaman Sea and the South Bay of Bengal under continuous watch for the next seven days.
The intensification of the prevailing low-pressure area would be a gradual and prolonged process, it added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ivorian group holds exorcism ceremony against virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Ivorian traditional group based in the southeast of the West African nation, held a special exorcism ceremony recently seeking divine intervention to protect its population of three million people against the coronavirus epidemic.
The chief of Sanwi, in speaking at the ceremony alluded to divine instructions underlying the pandemic: “Because science can’t fix everything. It just can’t. Take for example the virus, this little virus that we don’t see that silences everybody.
“Those that we call powerful, less powerful and so on. Everybody is at the same level, everybody hides. Today if everybody hides, we are weak. This is a message that God is giving us,” he stressed.
With the top cocoa grower having imposed limits on gathering as is the case across much of Africa, the ceremony was held with a limited number of participants.
Traditional “komians” or women healers dressed in white purified the royal court by sprinkling alcohol to the strains of the “abodan,” a traditional beat. Those attending then daubed their faces with the wet earth as a sign of obeisance to the chief and lifted their heads towards the sun.
“So we’d have to do some soul-searching. After this examination of conscience we can then address the Almighty because there is God and the chief.
“That is why the chief makes the libation, a prayer to God, a prayer to the ancestors, those who see the unseen, of being able then to help us, to save our life, otherwise it would be the disappearance of the whole world.”
Such ceremonies are held from time to time to ward off natural disasters such as droughts or floods.
Ivory Coast as of May 3 had recorded had recorded 1,362 confirmed cases with 15 deaths and 622 recoveries. The government has roped in traditional rulers to enforce social distancing and other measures.
Records indicate that about 20 percent of the population is animist. Muslims and Christians account for 40 percent each and many members of the two faiths also practise traditional beliefs along side their faiths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Rockers and spies’ – how the CIA used culture to shred the iron curtain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two memories: one, from November 1989, of a crowded bar at 3am in Berlin, not far from the wall breached just 36 hours beforehand. My brother and I are in town for the craic and biggest street party of all time. An awful band called Eurocheque strikes up a cover of the Scorpions’ Big City Nights and, inebriated, the crowd joins in. An elderly couple from the eastern sector two-steps to the beat. It’s very moving. A few months earlier, the Scorpions had played a music festival in Moscow, and were already working on their most famous song: Wind of Change.
Second memory: the less epic surroundings of Mote Park, Kent, three decades later. The Scorpions, this time for real, with bedazzling lightshow and backdrop of peace signs on a holograph of the Berlin Wall; Klaus Meine – born 1948, year of the Berlin blockade – singing Wind of Change through a chilly night. “The world is closing in/ Did you ever think/That we could be so close, like brothers … ?”
Now, it turns out, that sparkler-swaying anthem may have been contrived by US intelligence as cultural subversion of communism. An upcoming podcast series, Wind of Change, by the New Yorker’s Pat Radden Keefe, investigates whether it was – as the journalist was told a decade ago – actually a CIA-crafted confection.
The producers can be sure of an audience for Keefe’s exploration of “the dark byways of cold war history and … nearly a hundred interviews in four countries with rockers and spies”. But if the song was created by the agency, this was nothing new – indeed, it would have been a late arrival to a policy and practice almost as long-established as the Berlin Wall itself.
As the United States and Soviet Union amassed sufficient nuclear arsenals to blow the world up several times over, and – respectively – installed murderous dictatorships across Latin America and colonised Eastern Europe, each also stirred riptides of cultural subversion, one of the other. It wasn’t until 1990 that a book by Joseph Nye gave all this a name: Soft Power, exerted “when one country gets other countries to do want what it wants”.
From 1947, Voice of America radio diverted its attentions from wartime to cold war, broadcasting to the USSR and Warsaw Pact countries. But the CIA had also built a facade of front structures in pursuit of American cultural hegemony, beginning with the Propaganda Assets Inventory, which claimed indirect influence over 800 publications, and in 1950 the International Organisations Division under a former secretary general of New York’s Museum of Modern Art, Thomas Braden.
Appalled at the appeal of communism in Europe, these agencies waged cultural cold war against serial Soviet “peace initiatives”. A CIA-run Congress for Cultural Freedom was coordinated by Russian composer and writer Nicolas Nabokov, exiled in the US, with offices in 35 countries, funded and tasked to mount exhibitions, stage concerts and sponsor anti-communist activity, in intellectual disguise.
Among its apparently benign charges was the vibrant, impeccably liberal, Encounter magazine, based in London and edited by Stephen Spender.
Music, even before the Scorpions, was always central. Modernist orchestral music was anathema to the Soviets, and the imposition of classical forms a pillar of domestic cultural orthodoxy. At the centre of the tussle was the 20th century’s greatest composer, Dmitri Shostakovich, who worked on a knife-edge dais between innovation and censorship for what the communist cultural commissar Andrei Zhdanov called “formalism” from the decadent west. The CIA was among many trying to secure his defection when Josef Stalin released Shostakovich to address the Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace in New York in 1949.
But Shostakovich frustrated and confounded his western supporters. He returned to Russia and enabled the USSR to present him as a loyal comrade, a claim as outrageous as attempts in the west, from the mid-1970s until the present, to ventriloquise Shostakovich as a political dissident.
Soviet contempt for western modernism was an invitation to US intelligence to promote such music. Accordingly, in 1952, the CCF coordinated the Festival of Twentieth-Century Masterpieces of Modern Arts, in Paris. The Boston Symphony Orchestra was flown at State Department expense to perform Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring; Braden remarked that the performance “brought more acclaim for the US than Dwight Eisenhower could in a hundred speeches”.
Russia was equally canny: the Leningrad Philharmonic toured the BBC Proms and other venues in 1971 (I was among those who gratefully benefited) and even kept its “touring conductor”, Arvid Jansons, on hand as principal guest conductor at the Hallé orchestra in Manchester.
The visual arts scene was also fertile terrain. Nowadays, it is hard to imagine a world divided between socialist realism in the Soviet Union and abstract expressionism as a tool of the CIA in defence of the west. But that is how the agency saw innovations pioneered by Jackson Pollock and others.
Joseph McCarthy’s acolytes in purging the American left found abstract expressionism “unAmerican”. But the CIA begged to differ, finding in the new art an assertive individualism – in stark contrast to the collectivist confinements of socialist realism.
The centre of gravity in fine art shifted from Paris to New York. In her book on the cultural cold war, Who Paid the Piper?, Frances Stonor Saunders says the CIA deported itself “in the manner of a Renaissance prince, except that it acted secretly”.
The artists – Pollock especially, but also Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning – benefited from CIA-backed international promotion, despite their political views.
The same irony applied to jazz, still largely black music in the US, where artists’ tours, like everything else, were segregated. But the racial origins of jazz had been used in propaganda against Nazi Germany, so why not red Russia?
The genius of Louis Armstrong was pounced upon, and the trumpeter appointed a “goodwill jazz ambassador”, dispatched on government-funded tours of Europe and Africa, while Jim Crow laws applied at home.
Jazz “ambassadors”, however, proved less manageable than the painters. Armstrong withdrew from the post – reneging on what was intended to be a showcase tour of the USSR – after President Eisenhower refused deployment of troops to enforce desegregation laws of 1957. “Satchmo” resumed tours when the policy was reversed and a division mobilised in Arkansas.
Dizzy Gillespie joined the first State Department-organised tour in 1956, but wouldn’t attend official briefings, saying he “wasn’t going to apologise for the racist policies of America”. The white jazz pianist Dave Brubeck was another “ambassador” for US cultural policy, dispatched much later, on a 13-concert tour of the USSR in 1985.
The CIA’s most infamous meddling with literature concerned Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at Noon and George Orwell’s Animal Farm and 1984. Copies of the former – deemed anti-communist commentary - were carried across the Iron Curtain by air balloon, while the French Communist Party ordered its members to mass-purchase, then destroy, copies.
Everyone knows that Orwell held dictatorships of all political colours in equal contempt, and that the closing scene in Animal Farm featuring humans and pigs can refer to both systems.
But Stonor Saunders’ book uncovered a scheme by the CIA to secure film rights to Animal Farm in order to doctor its ending, and show a revolt against the pigs, with the other tyrants – humans – omitted.
The CIA also changed the ending of the movie version of 1984, in defiance of Orwell’s instructions. In the novel, the protagonist Winston Smith is cowered by the generic totalitarian regime; its last line is: “He loved Big Brother.” But in the film Winston and his lover, Julia, are shot down after the former declaims: “Down with Big Brother!”
Significantly, though, whatever impact the CIA’s efforts may or may not have had, they were overtaken by the avant-garde’s own potency. By the late 1960s, cultural foment was off the leash worldwide, and the new music – integrated into protest and peace movements antagonistic towards both capitalism and communism – cut both ways in terms of the cold war. And where rock ’n’ roll culture was eroding the latter, it needed little help from US intelligence.
Although the Prague Spring of 1968 was crushed, a band called Plastic People of the Universe chipped away at the edifice of Czech communism, only because, as keyboard player Joseph Janiček told me: “In Prague in 1968, if you wanted to play your own music you became political whether you intended it or not, because the authorities deemed that you were a threat to their ‘official’ culture.” The eventual “Velvet” revolution was so-called not because of any CIA shenanigans, but in part the influence of the Velvet Underground on the Plastics and their champion, Václav Havel.
By the time Bruce Springsteen played Chimes of Freedom in East Berlin in 1988 – one of the most politically charged performances ever – no one was in any doubt what was happening: the CIA was irrelevant.
But then, after that festival in Moscow in August 1989, the Scorpions released Wind of Change, with its references to the Moskva river and Gorky Park. This lyrical celebration of the proclaimed new world order sits oddly in the band’s other material from that time, markedly Crazy World, with its disillusionment: “Spend your dollars and roubles / Buy a piece of the wall … I’m so sick of it all”.
So we’ll see what Keefe’s podcast turns up. Meanwhile, the British writer Robert Winder is about to publish a book about soft power in a post-Scorpions world, and he wonders: “It is hard in these Trump-damaged times even to recall the cultural moment when a pianist, Dave Brubeck, could be told, on a 1958 tour of Poland: ‘What you brought wasn’t just jazz. It was the Grand Canyon. It was America’.”
The first of eight episodes of Pat Radden Keefe’s podcast, Wind of Change, will be broadcast on Spotify on 11 May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DEBRA J. SAUNDERS: The silence of the media lambs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar — self-styled feminists who bought every flimsy claim made against now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh — have chosen to stand by Joe Biden in the face of a sexual assault allegation made against him by a former staffer.
The #MeToo movement, which followed a New York Times expose on Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s abuse and degradation of women in the entertainment industry, was supposed to prove that the feminist movement was a moral entity committed to fair treatment of women, even when big Democratic figures stood accused.
Biden’s preferred treatment shows what a sham the accusation industry has become.
When Kavanaugh faced moldy stories of misbehavior going back to his high school years, the bedrock American principle of due process and the notion that the burden of proof should fall on an accuser, not the accused, was conspicuously absent.
With Tara Reade’s allegations against the presumptive Democratic nominee, the news media are reporting the story with a different set of rules.
When you look at the frenzy to report new bogus claims against Kavanaugh and compare it to the lack of urgency on the Biden front, you get the sense that Big Media stooped to cover the Reade story only in a half-hearted feint to discredit conservative critics who saw liberal bias.
The Times waited more than two weeks to report on Reade’s allegations. Executive Editor Dean Baquet framed the news value of accusations against Kavanaugh as part of “a running, hot story” of a figure who was “already in a public forum in a large way.” Be it noted, that “running, hot story” did not apply to Reade’s claims against Biden, who just wants to be president of the United States.
Reade’s allegation of Biden sexually assaulting her when she was a Senate aide aired on March 25. On April 30, The Washington Post went out on a limb with an editorial calling on Biden to provide documentation to refute Reade’s troubling accusation.
At least Post reporters have tried to ask Biden about Reade’s accusations. No reporter, including CNN’s Anderson Cooper, asked Biden about Reade during recent TV interviews.
Having failed to ask Biden about the matter earlier, MSBNC’s “Morning Joe” had Biden back Friday morning to address the allegation. First “Morning Joe” showed clips of the show’s cast calling for due process for Kavanaugh. Then host Mika Brezinski cataloged all the sexual harassment charges made against President Donald Trump with no caveats. Brezinski alone asked Biden about Reade. Biden denied the charge. Brezinksi did not follow up with questions about reports that corroborate Reade’s accusation.
On Wednesday, Reade told the Times’ Ben Smith, who has covered this story like a pro, that the only network which had offered her an on-camera interview was Fox News.
Let me make this clear. Unless Biden killed someone in the 1990s, I don’t care what he did with a staffer decades ago, as creepy or loathsome as his behavior might have been. Maybe it’s true, but the time to talk was when the offense occurred. What matters now is how officials treat members of their staffs today.
Back to the media and the feminists with pitchforks.
Kavanaugh’s accusers were able to smear a man with unsubstantiated charges that crumbled under scrutiny — and still cable news aired and re-aired the smears. Many Democrats still speak as if Kavanaugh were guilty.
Now there’s newly released footage of a woman Reade has identified as her mother calling CNN’s Larry King to complain about her daughter’s mistreatment by a “prominent senator.” That is substantiation, not the kind that should hold up in court, but enough to generate a torrent of stories against a conservative.
Does that mean Big Media should cover the charges against Biden as ruthlessly as they regurgitated the dirt thrown at Kavanaugh? No. The benefit of the doubt Biden has been enjoying is due to every figure who stands accused of something decades old that is impossible to disprove.
As for Cortez Masto, Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar and Warren, all potential Biden running mates, they’ve shown who they really are. They don’t care about what happens to women who may have been ill-used or assaulted — unless they can use their story against a rival. Then they get really indignant.

    <h5 class="mb-1">City hall on the backburner</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The City of West Kelowna has its hands full trying to get construction started on its new Rose Valley Water Treatment Plant, while also dealing with the economic fallout of a worldwide pandemic.
Planning for a new city hall will have to wait.
West Kelowna CAO Paul Gipps says those plans are on the backburner.
"We're very clear, water before city hall," Gipps told Castanet News.
"My whole thing is getting the Rose Valley Water Treatment Plant numbers nailed down, and the last of the design finalized."
Gipps unveiled a plan to finance a new city hall back in February, before the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed the country, utilizing funds put into a reserve for such a project.
"We've got an inventory of land that we will look at when we get (treatment plant) done, and say what are the site options for city hall but, at this point, it's all water treatment plant. It really is."
"We are trying to keep feeding the economy. It's surprising how much money we put into local services, and local opportunities. We want to keep that going, because if we slow that down, that's just going to add fuel to a fire we're trying to put out."
Gipps says the city is getting very close to nailing down renderings and design for the new water treatment plant.
He expects the final tender to close at the end of August, with work to begin almost immediately after that.
It's crucial the city get the project up and running, and substantially completed by time the federal grant expires in 2022.
Gipps says the timeline is doable, and expects water to be flowing from the site by the summer of 2022.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin Falls Back Into The Upper-$8,000 Region</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has entered what has all the earmarks of being another episode of sideways trading inside the upper-$8,000 area. This has come to to fruition after the cryptocurrency’s bulls made another attempt endeavor to drive it past the resistance that has been built up all through the lower-to-mid $9,000 region.
The benchmark cryptocurrency’s recent value activity has driven experts to take note of that it could be topping out, as the consecutive dismissals it has posted all through the previous few days is a desperate sign that extraordinarily favors sellers.
In case the cryptocurrency confirms this chance and starts declining lower, its first significant support zone exists around $8,250.
At the hour of writing this post, Bitcoin is trading up hardly at its present price of $8,846, denoting an notable decay from daily highs of $9,200 that were set yesterday evening.
The cryptocurrency had the option to present what showed up on be a continued break above $9,000 yesterday evening, as purchasers held Bitcoin (BTC) over this level for a few hours before moving to test the resistance at $9,200.
The visit to this level, nonetheless, started a sharp selloff that drove it down to its solid support at $8,800, which has since been guarded.
One well-known cryptocurrency trader talked about this most recent dismissal in a recent tweet, clarifying that it is presently imperative that buyers keep shielding the cryptocurrency’s point-of-control at $8,800.
He said –
Another mainstream pseudonymous trader recently clarified that he trusts that Bitcoin could be shaping a local top as it neglects to conquer its overhead resistance.
He said –
Since Bitcoin has broken underneath $9,000 in the time since this analysis was offered, it is developing chance that the cryptocurrency decreases lower in the hours and days ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Wilder's Bombastic Blades Rock the Premier League Apple Cart - 2019/20 Season Highlights</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The challenge: try and write a piece about Sheffield United without using the phrase 'overl*pping centre-b*cks'.
The obstacle (and an obstacle for dozens of Premier League attackers): Chris Basham.
Between the rampaging Basham and Jack O'Connell, the swashbuckling, stylish full back pairing of George Baldock and Enda Stevens, and the subtle craft of Oliver Norwood, to name but a few, the Premier League has been introduced, or reintroduced in some cases, to a group of unlikely, exciting new protagonists.
Next to Daniel Farke's stylish Norwich side, who blew away the Championship, and Aston Villa, who were merely taking an extended hiatus from Premier League action, a handful of pundits, neutrals and arm chair experts had written off the best-of-budget-British Sheffield United before the season had even began.
Even their opening day 1-1 draw had a touch of the FA Cup fourth round upset about it, the local hero Billy Sharp bravely rescues his hometown club a draw, but you know they're going to get blown away in the replay, or in this case, the 37 other replays.
But something funny happened after that gutsy curtain-raiser at the Vitality Stadium - Sheffield United didn't fold, nor did vastly resourced teams start putting them away by four or five goal margins.
They dispatched Everton, brushed aside Arsenal and ended Mauricio Pochettino's reign at Tottenham with a 1-1 away draw that could well have been a win.
In the most impressive of these results, the Bladesmen were 2-0 down at half time, sinking without trace against a Tammy Abraham-inspired Chelsea side, and you would have been justified in wondering whether they weren't doing what Premier League sides with more pluck than prosperity often do in regressing to the mean.
Sheffield United didn't sparkle here, but after nicking a 46th minute goal through Callum Robinson, held on long enough to equalise in a game where chances were few and far between through a scrappy Kurt Zouma own goal - if their early results indicated that they might be a team to watch, their resilience at Stamford Bridge demonstrated that they were a team here to stay.
'We are not day trippers getting autographs and collecting shirts,' Wilder said afterwards, echoing the spirit of comments made in the previous week's defeat to Leicester at Bramall Lane, when the Blades had been clapped off.
Though harsh on day trippers and shirt collectors, Wilder's remarks give us an essential insight into what makes his side tick - while they thoroughly embody the qualities which characterise a promoted side, they refuse to accept that alone as sufficient for top-flight survival.
In one sense, the Blades are the football team that your Dad watches in his dreams - if you watched just ten minutes of their 3-3 draw against Manchester United in November you could clearly see that they fight for every second ball, never stop running and know how to stick it in the mixer, relying on a gifted shot-stopper in Dean Henderson when it all goes pear-shaped.
Wilder - a strong character who demands the proverbial 110%, is equally comfortable delivering a team talk or a press conference and has steadily increased the quality of the squad without upsetting the Bramall Lane dressing room - is suited to cultivating these survival instincts, following in the footsteps of Tony Pulis, Sean Dyche and Sam Allardyce.
Where Wilder differs (if you'll allow a slightly unfair generalisation) from these stalwarts of getting stuck in is that his efforts are underpinned by a philosophy which goes beyond reaching 40 points.
This is an area where assistant manager Alan Knill has been credited, with Sheffield United, going beyond the O-word, genuinely revolutionary in how they create overloads through pouring forward in their droves.
It's genuinely tricky for opponents to figure out and compared to the practice of packing the side with size and strength in the hope of taking advantage of set-piece situations, gives a greater window of opportunity for the Blades to take all three points.
Rather than waiting for the ball to drop kindly once or twice a game, United can create openings through the sheer aggression of their own innovation, leading them to more than just safety-securing draws, but the wins which make European football a realistic possibility.
With Sander Berge, one of Europe's hottest and most wanted properties before his January move, yet to settle in, Sheffield United have plenty to look forward to upon football's resumption - and we, the neutral - along with many others - look forward to seeing how they approach things with the graceful tenacity (and inevitability when it comes to summing them up in an article) of their overlapping centre-backs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rodrigo: nightmare start to race win</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sunday at the Red Bull Virtual Grand Prix of Spain saw Kömmerling Gresini Moto3’s Gabriel Rodrigo pick up his first World Championship victory – only this time it was Virtual.
Launching from the spearhead of the grid, the start couldn’t have gone much worse for the Honda rider as he slipped from first to almost last off the line. And the Argentine admitted that he’d been practising his starts, but it didn’t quite go to plan as the lights went out.
“I had been training a lot for starts, knowing full well that this was my weak point. But this Sunday, I don't know why, it didn't go as planned. It was a disaster,” said Rodrigo. “In any case, I did not give up. I came back, pushing Tony (Arbolino) a little and then Raul (Fernandez)” referring to the Turn 6 incident between the duo.
It was the drama that ultimately handed Rodrigo the race lead and from then on it was an easy ride to the chequered flag for the number 2 rider. "I think I would have attacked him, but with a little more care," admitted the race winner.
Overall, Rodrigo declared himself "happy with the race" after a "really fun" experience in the first ever Moto3™ Virtual Race. "The most important thing is that we have had a good time and we hope that the people have had fun," commented Rodrigo, echoing the thoughts of everyone involved in the Virtual Grand Prix.

    <h5 class="mb-1">All the Chasers on The Chase and how they're spending lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ITV's The Chase has proved phenomenally popular since it came to our screens in 2009.
Hosted by Bradley Walsh, the smash hit show pulls in millions of viewers keen to see a team of strangers go up against one of the finest quizzers in the world.
The quizzing stars of the show, the eponymous Chasers, have gone on to amass an army of loyal fans.
From a former stand-up comic to a barrister - the Chasers have proved their real lives are just as interesting to their on-screen alter-egos.
So what are they getting up to during lockdown?
Nicknamed "The Beast" on the show, Mark is one of the original Chasers who has been on the show since it first started in 2009.
During lockdown, the Beast has agreed to host a live quiz on national digital radio station Union JACK and will feature new voice technology which allows listeners to play along with the quiz live, submitting their answers verbally through their smart phones and enabling real-time interaction with the Chaser.
The quiz, titled the Not-in-a-Pub Pub Quiz, is held at 1pm every Tuesday and Thursday, from Thursday, April 30.
A keen quizzer, before he was cast as a Chaser, Paul also made appearances on Stake Out, University Challenge, Fifteen to One, the Syndicate and Who Wants to be a Millionaire? where he left with £32,000 after incorrectly answering his £64,000 question.
The Chaser seems to be spending a lot of time on Twitter while the lockdown continues and has been tweeting about the coronavirus pandemic.
Shaun is the only other original Chaser on the show - but his career began in the courtroom not in the spotlight, and he previously worked as a barrister.
He was called to the Bar in 1984 but made waves in the quizzing world when he became the BBC Mastermind champion in 2004.
Shaun is popular on social media for recording videos for fans and even singing 'Happy Birthday' to them - he shares the videos on his Twitter account.
The Dark Destroyer has carried on his much-loved tradition during the lockdown.
The Chelsea FC fan has also written an autobiography of his life, which is titled Chasing the Dream.
He's even appeared on YouTube channels to give interviews while the lockdown continues.
Anne Hegerty joined the show in 2010 and was dubbed "The Governess".
Before making her debut on The Chase, Anne worked as a reporter and features writer for the South Wales Argus until she moved to Manchester.
During lockdown, she has been promoting new spin-off show Beat the Chasers while also interacting with fans of the quizzing shows..
Anne has also shared a funny interaction with co-host of rival quiz show Pointless, Richard Osman.
She's also used her social media platform to promote Just Giving pages, as well as raising awareness of stolen items, recently tweeting a picture of Oakwood Dog Rescue's stolen van.
The Governess also appeared on the Virgin Media show Elaine, presented by Elaine Crowley, to talk about life on The Chase and what it was like to go into the jungle.
Paul started his career as a doctor and a comedian.
It was during his training at medical school that lead to his love of the stage, after he took part in the school's annual revue, so it's likely no surprise that he's been using lockdown to crack some jokes on Twitter.
"The Sinnerman" has embarked on a comedy tour and new dates in Otley are slated for February 2021.
The show is titled Paul Sinha: Hazy Little Thing Called Love.
During lockdown, he has tweeted facts and insights into the planning of Beat the Chasers.
Jenny, the most recent Chaser to join the show until the newest member of the quizzing team was announced this month, joined in 2015.
Jenny's Chaser alter ego is "The Vixen", though she is sometimes referred to as the Bolton Brainiac.
As the lockdown continues, Jenny has been keeping busy with a range of projects including working with Book Cameo to create personalised video messages in order to raise funds for Trussell Trust.
She has also made appearances on This Morning to talk about the latest spin on the hit quizzing show, Beat the Chasers.
She has also been catching up on RuPaul's Drag Race and re-watching The Golden Girls.
Jenny has also been tweeting about a virtual pub quiz, which took place on Friday, May 1 at 8pm via video app Zoom at the so-called 'The Covid Arms'.
The Big Comedy Quiz raised cash for the National Emergencies Trust.
Comedians including Russell Howard and Joe Wilkinson joined the action while Kiri Pritchard-Mclean hosted.
*The Chase airs every weeknight on ITV at 5pm

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fiction is often more honest than official history: The Crown creator Peter Morgan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Peter Morgan is the showrunner of one of Netflix’s most acclaimed shows, The Crown. The historical drama that chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II has achieved the rather difficult and delicate balance of depicting the royal family, while not displeasing them (yet). It also is a startling case study in humanising one of the most inaccessible figures in history, the Queen herself.
In an interview with IndieWire, Morgan had divulged, “I don’t want to recommit until I see what sort of impact the show does or doesn’t have. If the show is sort of politely received, then I don’t think I want to continue.” This was just after the completion of the first season. The Crown is now in production for a fourth season, and the popularity of the series is a testament to how his doubts were demolished.
Morgan will be a part of the new digital initiative of Jaipur Literature Festival, JLF Brave New World. He will be in conversation with director Ritesh Batra on May 2 at 7:30 pm. You can watch the session on Youtube and Facebook.
In an exclusive interview with indianexpress.com, Morgan throws light on his research, the way fact marries fiction in the series and confirms what we knew from the start: Olivia Colman is brilliant.
For a show that spans the long life of a reigning monarch, how exactly does the writers’ room choose a particular phase, build a narrative and go about access and research?
Outlining and researching each season is a process that takes many months – with much deliberation, changing of direction, but ultimately it’s also the most satisfying part of the process. Often I use the length of a Prime Minister’s ‘reign’ as the way to divide the Queen’s long reign into manageable portions. Season 4 is a case in point, going from 1979-1990 (Mrs. Thatcher’s time in office).
What is the risk of balancing fact with fiction, knowing that the Queen and the royal family is well in the position to scrutinise your show?
I do my very best to be responsible in this area, but sometimes a writer has to use their creative imagination, and I think the audience expects (and welcomes) that. Often fiction is more honest than “official history”.
Given that part of the cast has changed twice already, do the actors have different ways of preparing for the roles? How much of the physical history do they fall back upon? For example, Claire Foy might have had less audiovisual references to work with than, say, an Olivia Colman.
All actors have wildly different processes and ways of preparing. Olivia Colman is brilliant and instinctive and spontaneous. Gillian Anderson (Thatcher) is brilliant and prepared and meticulously researches her role.
Do you, as a creator, find yourself thinking in terms of the life-cycle of the show when major events unfurl in the Royal Family today? Prince Harry leaving the fold, the Meghan Markle effect, the Queen’s rare address during the pandemic?
I try not to focus on any ‘metaphors’ or ‘parables’ – but an audience cannot help making their own associations and interpretations and connections, and I welcome that. What audience members bring to the work, the connections they make is every bit as valuable, and usually more profound and interesting than what I am writing, and what my intentions are as author. I try to keep at least 10 years, preferably a whole generation between the time when I am writing and the period I am writing about,  otherwise it becomes journalistic.
There’s no end to the mining of a life lived, so where do you draw the line? Are these specific or unofficial rules about what can be depicted and what stays off-limits?
I suppose that whenever one writes about another person’s life, one cannot help but also bring other factors into the equation – including one’s own life’s experience. I have often thought I have chosen the British Royal Family as avatars almost, through which to explore the multi-generational experiences of a family that are yes, specifically the Windsors, but also in a way all of us, too. Set against a backdrop of the history of Great Britain in the second half of the twentieth century.
How difficult is it to critique the position of privilege while simultaneously sympathising with the family as duty-bound victims of a nation? How does one resist shifting the perspective to the more mercurial and interesting characters of the show like Princess Margaret or Phillips?
Anecdotally, I’m told the show is watched, and I hope enjoyed and valued, by anti-monarchists and monarchists in equal number, which suggests we have got that about right and is perhaps a reflection of the fact that after all these years I still haven’t quite made up my mind what I think about them all, and believe me, I’ve given it thought. I enjoy writing all the characters equally, but I try to keep it focused on the core Crown characters, which is Elizabeth and Charles first and foremost. Then the senior royals – including Margaret, Philip – and now Anne, too.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gurmeet Chaudhary and Drashti Dhami starrer Geet-Hui Sabse Parayi is the latest series to be re-telecasted on TV. The hugely popular shows’ return on the small screen has bought much cheer it’s ardent fans. And now, in an interview with SpotBoyE, lead star Gurmeet opened up about the show and its special place in his heart.
Gurmeet said, “You won't believe but I almost auditioned 10-12 times for it and every time the channel was rejecting me and asking for more options. But Gul (Producer Gul Khan) had made up her mind that it will be only me who will play the lead and no one else. Then the channel decided to do a proper mock shoot with Drashti and me. And in that shoot, the chemistry and dialogue between me and her came out so well that I became confident that I will only be Maan. And that's how finally I got the role.”
He went on to add, “TV shows often get forgotten by people once they end. But Geet is still so fresh in people's mind that a new GEC channel is launching it. And ever since the news has come out, you won't believe how many messages and comments I have been receiving on my social media. Fans are sending me my video edits and what not.” (sic)
On being quizzed if fans will ever get to see his hit pairing with Drashti again on screen, the actor replied, “We didn't get any such offers honestly. If something interesting would have come across, I am sure we would have done that. After Geet was over, I got busy with my reality shows and filmy career. We may have not worked together post that but fans tag us so much together till now on social media that I feel the show is still on. And I think those who were demanding to see the on-screen chemistry, will love to watch the re-telecast of the show.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After 10 years together, Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler have announced they're getting a divorce. While they announced on Sunday, it's being reported that this isn't the first time they've entertained the idea of calling it quits. According to one source, they've thought about going their separate ways several times, and tried to work things out each time it came up, but ultimately decided that it was best to start a new chapter of life separately.
Both Cavallari and Cutler have "brought up the idea of divorce several times in the past years before," one source revealed to E! but "ultimately decided they truly both aren't happy." The insider added that their kids "definitely kept them together at times." The two share three children, Camden Jack Cutler, Jaxon Wyatt Cutler and Saylor James Cutler. As of right now, the two have been "seeing each other and co-parenting the kids together" and that they're trying their best to make things as normal as possible for their kids, but there have been challenges considering they're still "sorting out their living situation." The reality star and former NFL player still have two homes in Nashville, Tennessee and haven't made any "big decisions" on their living situation just yet. "They have really tried to make it work for years, but are on different pages about lifestyles and were arguing a lot," the source explained.
The couple announced over the weekend via Instagram that they have come to a "loving conclusion" to get a divorce. "With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce. We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of. This is just the situation of two people growing apart. We ask everyone to respect our privacy as we navigate this difficult time within our family," the post reads. Below, are photos of Cavallari and Cutler throughout the years.
Cavallari and Cutler met back in 2009 after Cutler made the first move. "I got a call from my publicist that Jay wanted to fly me out to Chicago and take me out," she revealed during an interview on the web series A Drink With. "I didn't know who he was! I had to Google him. I was in the middle of filming The Hills so I was like, 'I don't want a boyfriend in Chicago,' and passed on it." 
After attending a Chicago Bears game with her mom following his attempt to fly her out, she was reminded about Cutler's chivalrous move to take her on a date and decided to do so. The two quickly fell in love shortly after. 
But in 2011, the couple got engaged, however, they broke up shortly after over their differences.  
Later that same year, the two reunited and continued their relationship. That following year in 2012, while still engaged, the two announced they were expecting their first child together. 
On June 7, 2013 the couple said "I do" in Nashville, Tennessee. 
In 2014, the couple announced they were expecting their second child together. 
Less than one year after that, they announced they were expecting their third child. 
In 2017, their relationship dynamic changed after Cutler was let go by the Chicago Bears after eight years in the Windy City. Cavallari then began her new journey towards building a business empire. 
After the launch of their reality show Very Cavallari, the couple was faced with cheating rumors between Cutler and the Laguna Beach stars best friend at the time, Kelly Henderson. All cheating allegations were denied by both parties accused. 
After recently being stuck in the Bahamas together amid the coronavirus pandemic, the couple announced just days after their return that they would be getting a divorce. It's being reported that Cavallari has accused Cutler of "marital misconduct" in new legal documents obtained by TMZ. Now the two are currently trying to figure out their living situation as they navigate through this challenging time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New police documentary shot in Derbyshire starts next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new TV documentary series about Derbyshire police starts on Monday.
Police: Hour of Duty captures incidents the county's police force tackle in one 60-minute period, between 9pm and 10pm.
The Channel 5 show will see local officers dealing with a wide range of cases, from missing children to drug house stake-outs.
The four-episode series focuses on police stations across Derby and the south of the county.
A teaser for the show reveals what viewers can expect from the first episode.
It says: "At 9pm, it’s a busy night in Comms HQ as 999 requests flood in. On the line is a woman claiming to have swallowed over 40 pills who desperately needs help.
"At the same time, officers in the Proactive Unit are following up on a raid earlier in the day when they arrested three people thought to be part of a ‘county lines’ drug-dealing operation.
"With the suspects in custody, can they persuade the Crown Prosecution Service that they have enough evidence to secure a charge?"
The teaser adds: "In another part of the force, it’s 9.15pm and a team is preparing to go undercover to disrupt a prostitution ring while 30 minutes later a car has ploughed into someone’s garden and the driver has fled the scene. Was this just an accident or was the driver drunk?
"Back in Comms HQ, it’s 9.20pm and another 999 call comes in from a distressed mother whose daughter has attacked her and officers race to the scene.
"With violent domestic incidents on the rise, the police are tackling hundreds every week facing often tragic circumstances. For this mother, it is a call she never wanted to make."
* Episode 1 of Police: Hour of Duty airs on Channel 5 on Monday, May 4 at 9pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New trailers: Lovecraft Country, The Painter and the Thief, and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I finally caught up on the Amazon series Undone, which I’ve been wanting to watch since getting a glimpse of its wonderful rotoscoped style. I think I complained in one of these columns recently that, upon rewatching A Scanner Darkly, I felt like its animation was underused, barely scratching the surface of what such a dark, trippy film could do with that dreamy style. Undone gets it right.
The series does a wonderful job of using its dreamy look to tell a story where characters are constantly going in and out of memories, leaving moments behind only to return to them later, mid-conversation. It’s something that could easily be overdone, but the story keeps it all grounded, even as the visuals help to express just how disorienting and occasionally wonderful the feeling of slipping in and out of time can be.
And ultimately, the show’s characters are just so strong and colorful on their own that it’d be worth watching even if people weren’t constantly slipping through time and space. The rotoscoped style could have distanced us, but instead it gives the actors space to be even more expressive, as the scene focuses us on their eyes, mouth, or hands, making simple motions feel large and impactful.
Check out seven trailers from this week below.
J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele are two of the executive producers behind this new HBO series, which basically boils down to: what if the Jim Crow South also had Lovecraftian monsters? It looks like a very cool blend of genres so far. The show starts in August.
A painter confronts — and befriends — a man who stole two of her paintings in the documentary The Painter and the Thief. It looks like a fascinating story, and it’s worth checking out the trailer just for a glimpse at the relationship the two build, particularly as she begins to paint a portrait of him. The film comes out May 22nd.
It’s probably been over a decade since I’ve seen an episode of Reno 911, but this revival of the show looks like it hasn’t lost a step from the ridiculous series I remember. The show is coming to Quibi, which, alright fine. It returns May 4th.
Amazon has a new season of Homecoming coming up, and this installment has Janelle Monáe in the lead, which seems like a solid reason to revisit the show. The new season premieres May 22nd.
A year after ending the series, Netflix is bringing back Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt for a special episode to take advantage of its Choose Your Own Adventure-style (TM?) tech. The revival arrives May 12th.
Hulu has a new animated comedy coming up from two of the producers behind Robot Chicken. The comedy feels a little cheap, but I really like the animation style, which has the characters and world all looking like little woodblock toys. The show premieres June 12th.
Here’s the first real look at Jerry Seinfeld’s new comedy special, his first in more than two decades. There’s something very charming about seeing bits of Seinfeld’s routine — he has his style down so perfectly, it feels a little like listening to a forgotten track on an old album you used to love. The special comes to Netflix on May 5th.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No country for migrant workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mohammad Osman Goni, a migrant worker, shuttered his tiny green grocery shop in Malaysia and flew home to Bangladesh, a day before the Southeast Asian nation locked itself down on March 18 amid the coronavirus rampage.

Malaysia started the nationwide “movement control order,” as it is officially known, hours after it reported its first fatality from the disease. It was a moment of reckoning for Mr. Goni. He feared that he would end up paying a hefty fine for keeping his shop open.
“I realised it’s time to go home,” Mr. Goni, 41, said in an interview from his home in the central district of Munshiganj. “My earnings collapsed. I suffered a big loss.” Mr. Goni’s case offers insight into migrant workers’ struggle in times of crisis as global remittances are projected to decline sharply by about 20% this year due to the economic crisis induced by COVID-19. It also shows the depth of economic chills consuming the entire migrant community and the countries that largely depend on remittances to keep up economic growth momentum.
Mr. Goni is one of about 19,000 migrant workers who returned to Bangladesh from Malaysia between February 18 and March 18. About 2,00,000 Bangladeshi workers returned home in the same period, mostly from West Asian nations, before the country shut its airspace. The projected fall in remittances, which would be the sharpest in recent history, is largely due to a decline in the wages and employment of migrant workers, the World Bank said in a report on April 22.
Remittances to low- and middle-income countries may fall by 19.7% to $445 billion, representing a loss of a crucial financing lifeline for many vulnerable households.
Remittances to Bangladesh and other South Asian nations are forecast to decline by 22% to $109 billion in 2020, following the growth of 6.1% in 2019.

The slowdown is likely to directly affect remittance outflows from the U.S., the U.K., and EU countries to South Asia. Falling oil prices will affect remittance outflows from West Asian countries and Malaysia, which together supplied $10.88 billion to Bangladesh last fiscal year. Signs of a deceleration are already on the horizon in the country. Inward remittances in March dropped 13% year-on-year to $1.29 billion, lowest in 15 months, according to data from the central bank.
“As countries respond to the COVID-19 crisis, there is a strong case for supporting the migrant workforce, which is vital to many economies. There are several interventions governments should consider,” Dilip Ratha, a World Bank economist, wrote in a report. Mr. Ratha recommended supporting stranded migrants and their access to health, housing, and other social services, and offering incentives to reduce the cost of remittance services.
In the medium to long-term, policies should encourage the interoperability of online remittance systems and support efforts to reduce remittance costs, which remain far too high for some of the poorest regions, according to Mr. Ratha.
The coronavirus crisis may have one upside — more people may start sending money home digitally, which the World Bank says can be 50% cheaper than traditional transfers, where recipients have to go to a shop to pick up the money.
In Bangladesh, bKash saw a surge in remittance transfers through its channel. Expatriates sent around 150% more remittances on a daily average in April, compared to the first three months of this year through online and wallet-based money transfer companies from around the world, bKash, Bangladesh’s largest mobile money company, said in a statement.
Much about the pandemic is maddeningly unclear. Economies have nosedived, societies have paused. And the impacts of the disease on migrant workers in parts of the world are swift and severe. For Mr. Goni, the job loss is not the central torment, but uncertainty over a future job is. He pleaded with his friend, a university teacher in Dhaka, for help, but a job is hard to come by anytime soon.
Just after Mr. Goni arrived home on March 17, he had another battle to fight: his wife was pregnant and the delivery date loomed. He worried that the nationwide lockdown in Bangladesh that shut public transport would delay his wife’s access to a hospital. “It’s an uncertain time.”
Days later, Mr. Goni’s wife gave birth to their second child. He is now staying at home, nervously watching over the newborn, the only good news in the midst of gloom.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: See Your Shadow Songwriting melt hearts with new single and video </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">See Your Shadow Songwriting is run by artistic director Michael Coleman, who is also known as the "Metropolitan Cowboy." He wrote "I Will Tell Jesus You Said Hello" and it is quite moving and inspirational; moreover, its lyrics are optimistic, reassuring, and comforting. Simply put, it's exactly what we need today while the world is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
What makes it even more compelling is that Coleman allows both the male and female perspective of the song, and it works even better as a duet. It ought to be enjoyed for its beauty and simplicity. Well done.
The song is available on Apple Music and on Spotify.
The Verdict
Overall, "I Will Tell Jesus You Said Hello" will resonate well with anybody who has ever dealt with loss and grief. It is relevant especially in the trying times that we are living in today.
Michael Coleman is able to convey a wide spectrum of raw emotions as both a songwriter and storyteller. He is not afraid to be vulnerable. This song and its music video garner an A rating.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Super Sixes SRL | SA vs ENG Evaluation Chart: Archer-Ali cameos in vain as SA edges England in dull encounter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the majority of the game, slow was the new order and everyone seemed to have signed under the petition. I mean, tell me seriously, what was happening there? After being put to bat first, South Africa started slow, but once Eoin Morgan introduced Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali, things plummeted even more. From 123/5 in the 16 overs, South Africa added just 25 runs in the last four, giving England a lot to cheer about.
Chasing 149 was not going to be difficult for an English side that have batsmen until No.9 but well, it was that kind of a day. They kept on losing wickets in all phases, neither of their batsmen could find their eye in and eventually, some fiery display of bowling ensured South Africa came out the winner. However, there was a fleeting moment or two, which threatened to take the game away from them but all that ended up being too late too little.
South Africa possesses one of the most fragile batting order in the tournament and a lot was dependent on how the top three would play. On an unfortunate day, when Rassie Van der Dussen followed Quinton de Kock to the pavilion, it sounded the death knell for the Proteas. The former’s dismissal started a beeline to the comforts of the pavilion and there was no hiding from the bad performance.
While it was one really dull game for the majority part of it, Jofra Archer alongside Moeen Ali, with their 45-run partnership at the end, ensured the game went down to the wire. Archer tonked a few in the end, while Steyn and Rabada had all sorts of pressure in the last couple of overs. That three overs alone was the real battle of the game, and definitely, the highest point as well.
Powerplay is one of the most interesting things about T20 cricket and often the only phase for which people pay a heavy price to buy a ticket. But the way both England and South Africa put many off. For the uninformed, while South Africa scored 44 runs, England managed 39, ending a boring phase of the game.
Powerplay exploitation: South Africa  3/10   England  2.5/10
Clearly, the domination that Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma have shown in the entire duration of Super Sixes SRL went for a toss in the penultimate game of the tournament as the duo failed to muster enough steam in the powerplay. Come to think of it, only 44 runs in the first six overs were not something that could give any team a strong base to capitalise on and from that point on, South Africa were playing catch up with their own necessity.
If South Africa’s performances were bad, then England went one step ahead and stopped them on their tracks, to question their sanity. After Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada picked one wicket each, England’s runs were far and few in between, with the middle-order not being able to rise above that. England eventually managed to score just 39 runs losing two wickets in the process, putting all sorts of pressure on Eoin Morgan.
Middle-overs manoeuvring: South Africa  4/10  England  3/10
As the old maxim goes, “Morning shows the day” and in T20 cricket, “powerplay sets up the game”. And South Africa fell behind the target way too early, as the English spinners managed to create sustained pressure on them. Both Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were too hot to handle for the Saffers, who scored only 67 runs in the process. Loss of wickets in the flurry didn’t help the cause either as England took momentum with them into the death overs.
57 runs were all England could score in the 54-ball period and tell me, how can I describe more about this game better? Until the 35th over of the game, it was one classic anomaly. The dismissal of three of the most destroying T20 players - Jason Roy, Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow - made things worse for England in the subsequent overs.  
Death bowling: South Africa  6/10   England 8/10
Despite a 12-run over from Adil Rashid, it was a stellar effort from English bowlers to contain the South African to 37 runs in the last five overs. That despite the Proteas having hard-hitters like Andile Phehlukwayo and Dwaine Pretorious was a mighty effort. Especially for Chris Jordan, who has made a name for himself in the death, it was a fine redemption after remaining unlucky in the powerplay exchange.
This was the only phase where England salvaged some pride, thanks to the enterprising knocks by Moeen Ali and Jofra Archer. The game seemed like a lost deal when Archer came out to bat, but by smashing Rabada and Steyn for fun, he made his intentions clear. However, South Africa must thank Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi for bowling two parsimonious overs at death to help South Africa stay ahead of their English counterpart by three runs.
Match Frenzy O Meter - Average
As I said before, the final stages of the game was the only bright spot in a match that was dull and boring throughout. However, just for the sake of those two overs, this game would pass as Average.

We’re back again with Video Game Deep Cuts newsletter on Substack, folks. I’m still enjoying putting these together - not least because there are plenty ‘big news of the day/week’ newsletters, but finding time to discover the alternative material is rewarding.
The ‘all the notable new games’ section may be getting too big/complex. But even working out what came out can be surprisingly tricky for the average reader, with all the platforms/microscenes out there. So I’ll keep noodling!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford announces baby news</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">She said her body was ‘changing with the seasons’.
TV and radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford is expecting her first child, with football manager Brian Barry-Murphy.
The host of the Sunday Chart Show on Hits Radio discovered she was pregnant before Christmas, and is due to give birth in early August.
After a difficult first trimester, Crawford said she was feeling “more energised” as she prepared to enter the final stage.
She told Hello! magazine: “We are both over the moon. We found out just before Christmas. It was an incredible present.
“I’ve noticed my body is changing with the seasons. When summer comes it will be the blossoming of everything. It’s an amazing journey.”
Rochdale manager Barry-Murphy, 41, has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.
Crawford said: “Blending a family is a special thing. I’ve come from a blended family too.
“Brian is very excited to be a dad all over again. He loves being a dad and he knew (being a parent) is something I really wanted, too. It’s a new chapter in our relationship.”
Crawford, who has West African and Irish heritage, said that, having dealt with insecurities, she would be passing on a positive message to her child.
She said: “I had things I hated about myself, like my lips, when I was growing up, but now I’m really proud of my looks.
“I’ll pass on the message to my child that: ‘You’re beautiful.’
“I want them to know that their uniqueness is what makes them special. I want them to feel proud of themselves and of their own natural beauty.
“When it comes to learning to love yourself, I have lots of good life experience to pass on.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 20-year-old left Manchester City for Madrid in January 2019 and made 11 appearances for the Spanish giants in the second half of last season, contributing one goal in the process.
Diaz has only featured on seven occasions for Los Blancos during the 2019-20 campaign, though, playing just 23 minutes of La Liga football this term.
According to OK Diario, Madrid are not interested in selling the attacker this summer but want to send him on loan in order to gain valuable first-team experience.
The report claims that Real Sociedad and Getafe are among the clubs currently showing an interest.
Diaz made 15 first-team appearances for Man City between 2016 and 2019 but turned down the chance to sign a new deal at the Etihad Stadium before joining Zinedine Zidane's side.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global evidence says it's not time to throw open school doors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having shown good leadership in balancing health imperatives and economic costs in the early phase of COVID-19, our government now looks to relax the lockdown. Other countries are also keen to move.
Why? Because extended lockdowns are destructive. Business failures accelerate, concentration rises, investment ceases and production capacity falls. Government debt levels rise further as more handouts are needed. Superannuation problems mount: falling valuations, low interest rates, reduced share dividends and fund withdrawals. New health issues accumulate: stress, suicides, depression, family violence.
The end point is a rupture of supply chains and ultimately societal collapse. We already see milk, fruit and vegetables in some countries being destroyed.
But which countries should go first? and how can the risk of a second wave be reduced?
The chart shows the state of play in a selection of countries.
Countries with significant cases-per-million (the dots and the right axis) and high percentages of active cases (left axis) are not in good shape for early general opening. They risk automatically infecting large COVID-19 negative groups (US, France, Spain and Italy). Typically, these countries have large clusters of positive cases in high-density urbanisations, while other areas are less affected. Opening-up is likely to be drawn out and sequenced by region.
Australia and South Korea have low case rates and low active percentages. We have managed to keep the virus out and have used distancing, testing, tracing and isolation to good effect. Getting back to work more quickly is feasible.
But a big problem remains. Australia’s population is extremely "naive to the virus" in the event of a second wave. This risk is high. One month ago Singapore looked better than us: 150 cases per-million – but today, 2674 and 90 per cent active. They also led us with widespread use of a tracing app.
So, while ramping up testing and tracing is great, we need to avoid patting ourselves on the back and think about what more is needed to keep the lid on the high risk of a second wave.
A good starting point is getting the schooling issue right. You can see the government’s thinking here. Education is important, but schools are also great childcare facilities. Pushing so hard to open schools suggests the government really is wanting to move rapidly on the economy. They stress repeatedly that children are safe and aren’t transmitters of the disease. On what evidence? An official NSW study which conveniently comes to exactly that conclusion.
The NSW study looked at 19 COVID-19 cases across 15 schools, all of which sit inside a country virtually free of the disease. Qualitative interviews were used to establish the close contacts of the handful of presenting cases. The study period included some of the weeks after children were advised to stay home and distancing was in place. It also included part of the school holidays.
I hope non-statisticians can follow the problems here. But just to be clear, the study does not address the issue that matters to Australia right now. It says absolutely nothing about what might happen to a school inside a large infection cluster in the event of a second wave.
A Pasteur Institute study of COVID-19 for a school inside a large clustered outbreak in the Oise region of France does address this issue. A high school where two student cases dating back to January was selected and 661 volunteer participants including pupils, teachers, cleaning staff, parents and siblings were recruited following the outbreak. All were tested for antibodies.
The results were compared with the general population outside the school –obtained by testing for antibodies in serum from blood banks in the surrounding region. The results were as follows. There was a 3 per cent positive antibody presence in the region, but an infection attack rate of 25.9 per cent for the 661 participants; 40.9 per cent in pupils and teachers; and 10.9 per cent for parents and siblings.
France has experienced what happens inside a large outbreak. Its advice for returning to school is therefore very different from that of our government: sequenced opening (kindergarten and primary first, junior high second and senior high third); class numbers limited to 15 (teachers asked for 10); masks are obligatory for junior and senior high; and teachers are asked to wear masks.
Australia has done well, but we now enter the dangerous phase of re-opening the economy with a "naive-to-the-virus" population. The basics of the plan are good (testing, tracing, isolation, travel restrictions). But rethinking schools and adding a few other things into the mix are needed too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hamilton: "Despite all the setbacks, I never thought of giving up"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lewis Hamilton has been in F1 for more than thirteen years now and will be competing for his seventh world championship this year. This would put him on an equal terms with Michael Schumacher. As a child he never expected to come this far and to achieve the things he has achieved. In an interview with Style Magazine he goes deeper into his dreams as a child.
"It's always important to follow your dreams," let Hamilton know. "No matter how impossible they seem sometimes, keep following them. When I was a kid, the dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver also seemed impossible". The British man says that his father has played an important role in always following his dreams. "I have been very happy that my father has always encouraged me to follow my dreams and never give up".
The road to being a Formula 1 driver is a long and exhausting one, and can also change your mind. However, the Mercedes driver never let himself be distracted, so now he is where he should be. "I've never thought of giving up, I don't think so. That mindset is one of the reasons I'm where I'm supposed to be now. There have, of course, been really difficult moments."
Hamilton didn't come from a wealthy family, so they could kart on a budget. "There were days when I came back from school, very excited to go karting and my dad had to tell me we didn't have the money to go that week. It didn't bother the other kids on the track," Hamilton said of the moments when he was disappointed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I got Quest's new COVID-19 antibody test and it was strange | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last week, Quest Diagnostics announced a new direct-to-consumer test for coronavirus antibodies. So I tried it.
Sometimes, I'm not alone with my thoughts.
Many people -- some of whom I know -- are convinced they've already had coronavirus. On the West Coast, there are rumors the virus arrived much earlier than first thought. And, yes, at the end of last year, I caught a bug that demonstrated some of the symptoms and lasted two weeks. Since then, of course, I've been convinced it was COVID-19, while my wife -- a scientist -- has snorted elegantly, but derisively.Last week, Quest Diagnostics declared its antibody tests were now available to anyone. As I am truly anyone, I thought I'd try it. After all, if there's one thing that our nation hasn't quite prioritized or perfected during this crisis, it's the need for as much testing as possible.We're now just pieces of software, after all. Test it, test it, test it.
What transpired with this Quest experience was a little strange. And a model of the life that is to come.First, I went online to GetQuestTest and made an appointment. All I had to do to secure one was to answer several simple questions about my identity and current health.
Somehow, there are several Quest Diagnostics centers not too far from my house. Some had appointments for the same day. Others, the next day. I made an appointment at the closest one.You have to pay upfront, naturally. Your health is a business in the US, a little like everything else. As soon as your credit card clears, you get an email confirming your appointment and containing a QR code. I arrived slightly early and was met by no friendly receptionist whatsoever. The waiting area was completely empty. There was no evidence a receptionist had ever even had lunch there.This really was the future, and I'm not sure I liked it. I enjoy a little warm reassurance any time I'm doing something medical, don't you?Here, there was just a screen, not dissimilar to those at airports that photograph your face and compare it to your passport photo.At Quest, you hold up your phone, display your QR code on the screen, and ping, you're checked in.I sat down. No other customers were in the waiting room. All was a little eerie. Until, that is, I heard two female voices chatting and laughing. Yet I couldn't see them. So the whole thing bordered on the slightly macabre, as I sat in this apparently deserted room, yet could hear faraway giggles.At exactly the minute of my appointment, a phlebotomist emerged in full protective clothing. She took me to her quarters, sat me down, found a suitable vein, prepared her needle, and forgot to tell me she was going straight in. I'm not (excessively) squeamish, so I was amused at the nurse's "oops, sorry" as I uttered a mild ow. Perhaps she was a junior phlebotomist.Quest had warned there might be an examination of my temperature. That didn't happen. Nor were any questions asked about my health. It was in and out. Testing as fast food.This was the efficiency of the new world, I feared, one in which we robotically and regularly examine the minutiae of our innards, with a view to knowing them better and sometimes fearing the worst.At least the phlebotomist and I managed to chat about my silly name, my reason for getting the test, and whether it was possible to stay sane in the current circumstances. We concluded it wasn't.The whole process was absurdly smooth. Perhaps for $129 it should be. I couldn't help, though, consider the simple ways in which it bypassed at least some of what had occurred in the past. Just as with One Medical's primary care system -- in which Alphabet is invested -- you go online instead of calling, and you make an appointment. Yet here, you're greeted by no one in the waiting area and the human contact is reduced to an absolute minimum.Tech wins again.But what about the results, I hear you groan. The phlebotomist promised them within 24 to 48 hours.48 hours went by. No results. On the third day, however, an email telling me the answer was ready. I went to the Quest site and clicked on the verdict, with my wife peering at it over my shoulder.She instantly snorted. This time, less than elegantly, I thought. She's always right about this sort of thing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Penniless mum given life-changing offer after tear-jerking discovery about millionaire</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nadine Hills is a single mum struggling to make ends meet.
Bringing up four-year-old Morgan on her own means working full-time is impossible for the hairdresser, who can only work one day a week.
Nadine lives in a tiny flat in Portsmouth and dreams of having her own salon, but is drowning in serious debt and relies on benefits to survive.
The worried mum has just £86-a-week disposable income for food and any extra treats or costs, but confesses to having "champagne taste on a lemonade budget".
Nadine gets a taste of the high life when she swaps home, budgets and life with a millionaire family alongside her friend Alex.
However, she makes a tear-jerking discovery behind the luxury furniture, expensive clothes and flash cars.
Katy Bobbins was a misbehaving kid at school who was told she would never make anything of her life.
After leaving home with nothing at the age of 16, Katy became a nail technician and met love of her life Paul Bate.
With the help of her marketing graduate husband, Katy started up a hugely successful beauty clinic in East Sussex.
The permanent makeup artist now has a turnover approaching half a million pounds a year.
Katy and Paul have spent £200,000 to convert an old police station into their dream home and £2,000 on a chandelier.
Katy reveals that she once bought a pair of shoes that cost £1,400, while they also have a Porsche and Aston Martin DB9 on the driveway of their luxury house.
When the families swap homes, their are some stunned faces when they discover their new weekly budgets.
"How does someone have that much disposable income in a week. I cannot get my head around it," asked Nadine when she discovers she has £1,800 to spend over five days.
It's a different story in Portsmouth, as Katy and Paul tuck into pizza and chips and are forced to do the weekly shop for £31.
They make a worrying discovery when they find a tonne of bills that Nadine has been hiding away.
Katy admits: "It must be hard to be inspired when you focus so much on survival."
Nadine gets a shocking realisation when she meets one of Katy's clients, who has had chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.
Ella lost all her hair and had major surgery for breast cancer, so Katy gave her tattooed eyebrows and nipples.
She also reveals that her treatments would have cost thousands, but Katy provided them all for free.
"Financially it wasn’t a problem because she does it free for cancer patients. It just seemed a natural thing to say yes," says Ella.
In admiration, Nadine says: "Katy has transformed her life a bit. If she couldn’t afford to have those treatments she wouldn’t feel as confident.
"If everybody was kind and caring like that we’d live in a beautiful world."
With no money for fun activities, Katy takes her kids down to the arcade, where they scavenge around for money behind the machines.
Meanwhile, Nadine and Alex join a karate class and are thrilled to see Morgan coming out of his shell.
Alex says: "Families with money see extra curricular activities as the norm. I definitely think maybe Morgan may be missing out on things by not being able to afford these classes."
Katy and Paul then do a shift at Nadine's salon, which entails washing hair and sweeping floors.
After speaking to Nadine's manager, Katy says: "She's a person I feel like i could help and want to help but it's if she has the focus and would stick with the skill I could help her with."
The topic of Nadine's debt is finally brought up during a fancy dinner with pal Alex, where they dine on lobster with champagne.
Concerned Alex admits he had no idea of the extent of her debt problem.
Nadine explains: "I feel if people think you don’t have any money and are in debt you're a lower person.
"I’m not a lower person than anyone. I'm a proud person. I want to be self-efficient again. I’ve had to make sacrifices since having Morgan."
After five days it's time to swap back around, but not before the families meet each other for the first time.
Katy realises that she may have taken for granted what she has, while Nadine says she has been inspired to go out and not give up on her dreams.
The women realise that they have a lot in common and had similar experience of being knocked down and having low self-esteem.
"Nadine was amazing she was everything I wanted her to be. I already had such an idea of what she was like. I felt I knew her already," says Katy.
The businesswoman explains that she used the power of positive thinking to make something of her life, while Nadine calls her a "beautiful soul inside and out".
Before they leave, Katy gives Nadine an offer that will change her life for the better.
Admitting Nadine reminds her of herself when she first started, Katy offers to train her for free in permanent make-up and become her personal mentor.
Gobsmacked Nadine asks: "Are you sure?"
With Nadine in tears, Katy says: "i just know if I get you to the level I want you to be at and you would love to be at you can go and do some amazing things like burns and cancer patients. People that really need it."
Nadine confesses: "There's no words to say how grateful I am as it's so overwhelming. She's a successful businesswoman.
"I don't think she would be wasting her time if she didn't believe in me and I won’t be letting her down."
Giving her take on the week, Katy says: "There were no extra frills and I don’t think I could continue like that for very long.
"I think money does buy you some happiness but not all happiness as that's an inside job."
Nadine adds: "I feel refreshed. I have a new lease in life. This is going to change mine and Morgan's life."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI: An Abu Dhabi doctor said the new stem cell treatment against COVID-19 “doesn’t provide an entire cure,” but helps patients overcome its symptoms, local daily Khaleej Times reported.“It's a national achievement. This treatment is supportive and doesn't provide an entire cure. It helps patients overcome the symptoms caused by the virus but doesn't kill it,” Dr. Fatima Al-Kaabi, Head Hematology and Oncology at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, said.Al-Kaabi, who was part of the 28-man team that came up with the treatment, added clinical trials are ongoing.“We are about to conclude the collection of data to conduct further comparative experiments and compare them with patients who have not received the treatment,” she explained at a press conference on Saturday.The treatment works by extracting stem cells from a patient’s blood and reintroducing it in an “activated” state to the lungs through a fine mist.It was first used on a patient early last month, and has so far helped 73 coronavirus patients.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MY WEEKEND: The new enemy is taking social toll on our children</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">My eldest two bicker a lot, although I am sure that deep down, they love each other. They do love each other, don’t they?
Anyway, when schools were shut a month ago, confining them to the house, their squabbles escalated — they would fight about everything and nothing, even the way one looked at the other.
They also started telling on each other more, with the snitch hoping that I will castigate or punish the offender. This progression had me greatly worried and questioning my parenting skills.
It seemed that I spent more time playing referee instead of working, a factor that frustrated me, and which managed to draw me into their petty fights.
Before I go further, perhaps it’s necessary to tell you a little about these two, to lend my story some perspective. My first is 10 years and being child number one, I have noticed that he tends to flex his muscles a lot and is fond of ordering number two around.
I have to confess that I am partly to blame for this, having once mentioned that when the grown-ups are not around, he is the chief whip.
Number two is eight, and she is as assertive and headstrong as they come. She takes offence at being ordered around by her elder brother, who, she must tell herself, is not that taller than her to begin with.
SOCIAL LIFE
Her resistance to his imperious ways almost always ends up with a spat, which has me wondering whether other siblings this age fight or whether it is just my children.
I was, therefore, immensely relieved when week three into isolation, the bickering began to go down. I think it finally dawned on them that having been cut off from their friends in school indefinitely, as well as the cousins they spent most weekends with, they only had each other to play with, so they might as well get along.
As I write this, I can hear them running around laughing in glee, a sound that was not very common before Covid-19 came and changed how families live and interact with each other.
It’s true; there are some good things emerging from this gloomy period. My prayer is that after we contain this virus and they go back to interacting with their friends, they will hold onto this new-found friendship.
This experience with my children has taught me that children, too, are struggling with the changes that have been brought about by this pandemic.
Being locked up at home week after week, wrenched from the vibrant social life that school had accorded them, is taking a toll on them, and if parents are not conscious of this they might end up with stressed or even depressed children.
WORK TOGETHER
Research has shown that children are, by nature, social beings, and that depriving them of this socialisation might affect their development.
But since we are still in isolation and have no idea how long this will go on, experts say that this need to socialise must be met at home.
Parents I have talked to say they manage to meet this need by coming up with activities that require everyone’s participation, such as doing the house work together, eating together and cooking together — basically, spending quality time together where family members actually get to really talk and listen to one another.
It will also help to read up on the warning signs that could signify anxiety in your child and how you can alleviate it. Who ever imagined a period such as this?

    <h5 class="mb-1">The domino effect - how Liverpool, Man Utd and Newcastle United will have huge say in Swansea City's rebuilding project</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No-one really knows what is going on in football right now.
On a daily basis, different theories are floated concerning how campaigns will finish, indeed if they finish at all.
The only certainty is uncertainty at present, something which breeds even more confusion.
We will, though, come through this one way or another and football will continue, albeit in changed surroundings.
It is good to hear from people at Swansea City that plans are in place for what may come.
Head coach Steve Cooper has set a tentative date in terms of a return to training, which will be the first step.
"There's still some assumptions.. but you've got to work towards that (16 May)," Cooper told BBC Sport Wales a few days ago
"We're following the latest guidelines both from the Government and the EFL, we're still in the lockdown and I think the next update is 6th or 7th of May.
"A few weeks ago the EFL talked about not returning to training before the 16th of May and then they talked about 56 days to play the remaining nine games and the play-offs.
"We've done some plans around that... until we get told something different by the Government or the EFL then that's what we'll stick to."
On the recruitment front, Andy Scott has been using this time effectively to plan for next term and beyond. Thirty-five players are being tracked at present, with free agents also being looked at, with Scott adding that he has been in touch with Premier League sides about possible recruits.
This summer's transfer window will be like no other, with budgets at even the highest level likely to be much tighter, and with there being so many unknowns over the length of the window and clubs' spending powers, we could see some extremely hard bargains driven.
Cooper used his connections and knowledge of youth team football to bring in some talented starlets over the course of the last campaign, with Freddie Woodman, Aldo Kalulu, Ben Wilmot, Conor Gallagher, Marc Guehi and Rhian Brewster arriving on loan.
Developments at those players' parent clubs are likely to have a big knock-on effect on Swansea and their own plans for next season.
Woodman's employers Newcastle United are currently subject to a well-publicised takeover bid, and should the Saudi-backed deal go through it will immediately put the Magpies in amongst the big boys in terms of spending power.
Woodman has professed his fondness for South Wales having lived here for the best part of eight months, while Cooper expressed his desire to keep the stopper in SA1 beyond the end of his loan deal.
"We'd all love Freddie to stay for longer than the season," said Cooper.
"Whether that's possible, we'll have a look in the summer. I think he'd definitely like to.
"The affection the fans have shown Freddie, I think he really feels it and likes to show it back because it's mutual."
Woodman would have to settle for a place on the bench should he return to St James' Park, with Martin Dubravka the incumbent number 1 - and that's even before you take into account the freshly-boosted transfer coffers up on Tyneside.
Erwin Mulder will be leaving Swansea this summer when his deal expires, meaning a new keeper is on the agenda for Cooper and Scott - although highly-rated Steven Benda is due to return from his loan at Swindon.
At the opposite end of the field, Brewster has done well since his January switch from Liverpool. He has done his chances of impressing Jurgen Klopp ahead of the new campaign no harm, but it remains to be seen whether the German boss will give the 20-year-old a chance to break into his star-studded first-team squad next season.
German striker Timo Werner is on Klopp's watchlist this summer, meaning Brewster may have to look away from Anfield once again next term. Game-time would be guaranteed at the Liberty under Cooper - so could the Reds be tempted to allow him to stay for another spell? The player's wishes would obviously have to be taken into account, but minutes are what Brewster desperately needs at this stage in his career to showcase his undoubted potential.
Guehi signed a loan deal until the end of the season (with an option for another 12 months which Swansea will operate) meaning he'll be at Fairwood next season regardless, but Gallagher's situation is curious. There have been links in recent weeks with a transfer to Turkey to link up with Eddie Newton's Trabzonspor, but Chelsea and Frank Lampard will be keen to take a look at him again come the end of the 2019-20 season. You suspect Gallagher will be playing in the Premier League next season, with the Blues or for someone else.
Away from Swansea's loan players, we now turn to the jewel in the club's crown. Joe Rodon will likely move on this summer, with Swansea's finances dictating that sales are required to balance the books.
A whole host of teams have been linked with his services, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea all tracking him. Swansea will be looking for close to £20million for him, in line with the fees they received from Sheffield United and the Red Devils for Oli McBurnie and Daniel James respectively.
As previously stated, even the big hitters will be looking to push prices down this summer due to the impact coronavirus has had on football's bottom line. But Swansea will have to play hard ball themselves to seek a fee which would help keep them financially stable for the coming season. This is where chairman Trevor Birch will no doubt earn his crust. It is inevitable that Rodon will leave Landore this summer - it is simply a question of who to and for how much.
However this campaign finishes, football's domino effect will be in full swing come the off season, and unfortunately for Swansea their own recruitment plans will be effected massively by it and indeed will be determined by the will of those higher up the food chain. Twas ever thus.
The players they have brought it on loan have been massive for them - without them next term, Swansea have a big rebuilding job on their hands.
Mike van der Hoorn, Kyle Naughton, Wayne Routledge, Nathan Dyer, Courtney Baker-Richardson, Jefferson Montero and Mulder are all out of contract, while Andre Ayew is almost certain to leave due to his astronomical wages. Kalulu is also unlikely to stay beyond his loan agreement. If Rodon goes and the loan players listed above return to their parent clubs, that is a huge turnover of players to address in one cramped window.
As stressed above, it is good news that Scott has been addressing future recruitment for this summer, and has been for some time. Because Swansea will likely have a lot of work to do when some semblance of normality returns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commentary: Virtual solemnisation - weddings could return to basics, with opportunities and challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"Here comes the bride … I’ll send a like." As Singapore works towards enabling remote solemnisation, sociologist Terence Heng discusses what is gained and lost in this transition.
LIVERPOOL: Recent lockdowns, movement control orders and circuit breakers around the world have meant that all manner of face-to-face activities are now being done remotely, or are “home-based”.
You know, all the essentials - home-based working, home-based learning, home-based-bubble-tea-bingeing (to get free delivery).
Even the military is getting in on it. In Singapore, fresh conscripts who would otherwise be confined in-camp for Basic Military Training (BMT) are getting remote instructions over the Internet.
It makes me wonder how Warrant Officer Mani would make Recruit Heng get down on the ground for some push-up punishments.
“Eh, knock it down! Are you knocking it down? I can’t see. Can you angle the webcam lower? Ah, thanks. Knock it down!”
EVERYTHING IS GOING ONLINE – WEDDINGS TOO
It’s not surprising that, where possible, the everyday activities that we do (and need to do) are the first to go online. Of course, that still masks the unequal distribution of labour and privilege in society – certain jobs will always be easily done at home, some not so.
But what about those special, one-off events? The kinds that are “once in a lifetime”?
Next week, the Singapore Parliament will discuss the possibility of allowing weddings to take place online, with caveats about ensuring both bride and groom are physically in Singapore, among other restrictions.
This has already happened elsewhere around the world, like in New York, where virtual weddings appear to be the only option for a city in lockdown. Virtual toasts and virtual guests, but all still able to share in a happy occasion.
WEDDINGS GO BACK TO BASICS
On the face of it, streaming a wedding ceremony where a couple exchanges vows is a very good idea, especially when physical distancing rules are in place.
Such ceremonies lend themselves well to digitalising (the act of turning something physical into something virtual) because there is a particular focus (wedding couple) and the audience’s role is largely observational and passive.
Just think back to attending weddings or Registry of Marriages (ROM) ceremonies. There wasn’t much for you to do as a guest, and at large events, you may not even get a chance to interact with the wedding couple.
(Unless you were that one uncle who thinks he’s a wedding photographer because he owns a camera, and proceeds to get into every. Wedding. Photograph.)
In a time when weddings are becoming increasingly commercialised, the idea of minimising the ceremony down to its bare, legal essentials is a tempting proposition.
By disregarding the bells and whistles and layers of ostentation, the virtual wedding, as it currently stands, offers us a chance to disengage from pomp and focus on people.
Virtual weddings also challenge us to question what is really necessary for a wedding to be successful and meaningful.
Whatever the circumstances that have forced us into these arrangements, it is nevertheless an opportunity to slow down the credit card spending just a little bit.
However, I am not so naïve as to believe the wedding industry would not eventually find a way to get people to spend virtually. Ultra high-definition streaming, custom emojis and multiple angles from remote mini-drones all come to mind (that last one exists somewhere in science-fiction already).
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER CEREMONIES?
At the same time, once we start examining cultural practices, the reality is virtual weddings will struggle to mimic dearly held and longstanding rituals that have come to become an integral part of that ceremony but require multiple instances of physical interaction.
After all, as I’ve mentioned in other commentaries, weddings are rarely just about the couple, but a conundrum of kinship, social and commercial networks assembled in a concentrated burst of activity.
Tea ceremonies in Chinese weddings are a good example of this, where a wedding couple offer cups of tea to family elders.
On the surface, they are about “paying respect”, but sociologically, they are also about constructing and affirming familial bonds. To some, this affirmation of bonds exceeds the legal ceremony in importance and legitimacy.
Some of these tangible rituals can be made symbolic. They can even be digitised. But for this to succeed, one requires the buy-in from not just the state, the celebrants and the wedding couple, but also the complex networks of individuals that make up the wedding.
This is not always so simple. And turning something that has been physical for so long into something digital means encountering resistance.
To digress, this is also why apps that purport to replace religious rituals (like burning offerings) have never really taken off, because they ignore the deep and stubborn precedents of practice.
NOT EVERY BRIDE, GROOM OR GUEST HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES
Apart from the challenges involved in digitising very physical actions, it is also important to remember that not everyone has the same access to the resources required to conduct a virtual wedding.
While the digital divide goes some way in helping us to understand unequal levels of access, I offer two more points for us to think about.
One, place both matters and does not matter. While a virtual wedding can be conducted anywhere (that’s the whole point), not everyone can stream live on a chic rooftop overlooking the city skyline. And not everyone wants extended family and friends peering into their living room.
While it could be argued virtual backgrounds could address this issue (who would not want a wedding on the bridge of an Imperial Star Destroyer?), such solutions are situational and yet again dependent on the different resources available to different people.
To this extent, town halls and marriage registries are still vital for virtual weddings to succeed, because they offer a way to level the proverbial playing field of “my virtual wedding venue is nicer than yours”.
Two, virtual weddings run the risk of excluding entire groups of individuals who do not have the technology, which could include the networks of family and close friends that weddings comprise of.
To assume that all of one’s family and friends have laptops, smartphones and Wi-Fi to stream a 30-minute video likely assumes too much.
For any legislation of virtual weddings to succeed, it must take into account the same challenges individuals and groups face when working or studying at home. That is why support from institutions that provide spaces and the requisite tech (like ROM perhaps) is crucial.
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE
Technology continues to shape and influence the way we socialise, interact and ritualise.
That couples now regularly create custom hashtags for their weddings and include livestreaming even before lockdowns began suggests that society was already developing a hybrid mix of tangible and intangible wedding practices.
The question that we must now raise in a post-COVID-19 world is this: When we make deliberate and dramatic shifts to familiar ways of life, whether out of preference or necessity, we need to first think of the human before the technology.
Around the world, those who create the technology (and the rules that come with it) are often overly enamoured with the utopian possibilities and opportunities afforded to those they genuinely intend to help.
The belief that technology or technological advances are either only neutral or beneficial fails to take into account the unevenness of everyday life.
While there are many things to gain from going online, there are also many things to lose. Intimacy, closeness and shared social spaces are still fundamental to the human experience.
In other words, we should not be so quick to disregard the tangible.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.
Talk about the swings and roundabouts of racing. Sylvia's Memory was sidelined for about a year before finally returning with a clean bill of health at the trials a month ago and has been taken along quietly since.
Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.
Talk about the swings and roundabouts of racing. Sylvia's Memory was sidelined for about a year before finally returning with a clean bill of health at the trials a month ago and has been taken along quietly since.
Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lorenzo Baldassarri (FlexBox HP40) confirmed his love affair with the Circuito de Jerez – Angel Nieto after taking victory in the Moto2™ Virtual Race at the Red Bull Virtual Grand Prix of Spain.
The Italian has now won three races on the spin in Andalucia and took the maiden Virtual Moto2™ race honours having started from pole, edging out compatriot Luca Marini (SKY Racing Team VR46) in qualifying by 0.006 seconds. And Baldassarri made no mistake in the race to pick up his first victory of 2020, going one better than he did at the Qatar GP.
"I think this race was even tougher than the others. It was not easy to achieve victory,” said Baldassarri after the race. “I was sweating and so nervous that I had trouble controlling my fingers. I wouldn't be surprised if I was diagnosed with compartment syndrome,” joked ‘Balda’, who reviewed his initial battle with Marini and Jake Dixon (Petronas Sprinta Racing) on the opening laps.
 "I first had contact with Luca. So suddenly, Jake hit me. Honestly, I was lucky I didn't fall. Once I was in the lead, I tried to stay calm and in the end managed quite well. It was definitely a good race.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Black Panther' screenwriter Joe Robert Cole on directing his gritty new Netflix movie 'All Day and a Night'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At 40 years old, Joe Robert Cole is one of the most sought after screenwriters working today in Hollywood thanks to his work in TV (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”) and movies (“Black Panther”).
But for his latest project, he’s moving away from helping the vision of people like Ryan Murphy and Ryan Coogler to set out and direct his own story.
“All Day and a Night” (available on Netflix) is an unforgiving look at Jahkor (Aston Sanders of “Moonlight”), an Oakland kid who is trying to make a better life for his newborn baby with his skills as a rapper but finds himself falling into a life of crime that puts him in jail alongside his gang banging father, James (Jeffrey Wright).
This a story that Cole wanted to tell long before “Black Panther” was made. A decade to be exact. And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at. There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”
Going forward still expect Cole to pen comic book-based projects. He’s currently adapting the Vault Comics title “Failsafe” (a project also for Netflix), with Michael B. Jordan producing. But at the same time, Cole also wants to continue to direct movies like “All Day and a Night,” where the story is shedding light on someone you wouldn’t expect you’d be interested in.
“What I wanted to achieve was taking the audience on a journey and humanising someone we often struggle to see the humanity in,” he said. “I was constantly working on finding the humanity in the stylised crime genre.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lionel Shriver: 'Some people think I'm evil incarnate'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionel Shriver is a US-born writer whose novels include Big Brother, The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047 and the bestsellingWe Need to Talk About Kevin, which won the 2005 Orange prize and was turned into a film by Lynne Ramsay starring Tilda Swinton. In 2014, she won the BBC national short story award. Her new novel, The Motion of the Body Through Space, is about a long-married couple whose relationship is almost destroyed when one of them becomes obsessed with exercise.
What kind of lockdown are you having?One of the most horrifying things about this experience is that it’s having so little effect on my life. I live in lockdown all the time! I don’t think this reflects well on me, but either I don’t have a very keen social appetite or I’m under-aware of when I’m starting to get lonely.
How do you feel about your new novel being published during this time?Oh, that’s a catastrophe. I’m ashamed of myself because I’m not supposed to care about what’s happening to my book; it’s nothing compared to losing a business you’ve spent your whole life building. But it’s two years’ work, and I’m publishing into a big, black hole; all the bookshops closed.
What are these weeks of seclusion and anxiety going to do for art?Cataclysm is always good for the arts. The possibility of catastrophe is stimulating to the imagination, though I worry this is potentially catastrophic on a scale that’s bigger than anything I could make up – and I don’t mean the disease itself, but everything that follows economically. It’s the same for all of us, though. We feel like we’re in a disaster movie, only we’re on the wrong side of the screen and there’ll be no happy endings for our favourite characters.
Your novel Big Brother was about obesity. The new book is about exercise. Are they companion pieces?There is a correspondence there, yes. Big Brother was about food and people’s relationship to it. In this one I’ve kept food out of it. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with the relationship between mind and body, and the weirdness of living in an organism that’s in the process of corruption and, ultimately, death. That’s a big subject and I don’t mind visiting it more than once.
Was there a specific trigger for this novel? Something that set you off?I’ve always been an exercise nut, so in some ways this is putting that under the microscope. But like Serenata [the wife in The Motion of the Body Through Space] I have drastically arthritic knees. That’s sobering. There’s the feeling of being punished for having been good; the first intimations of limitation.
Serenata’s husband, Remington, takes up extreme exercise late in life, and enters a “Mettleman” triathlon. It’s almost as if he’s joined a cult. How did you research this?I went with my husband to the Lake Placid Ironman [in the Adirondack Mountains, New York]. What was interesting was that I had to really force myself to go, and when I got there I only did one interview. It was fascinating how repelled I was by my own subject matter.
Serenata has a harder time ageing than Remington. Is the unfairness of the way women age – and are seen to age – at the heart of your story?I wasn’t motivated by that. But I do think it’s especially hard to get older as a female. I found the menopause horrific: all these stupid hormones pinging around your body arbitrarily. They’re not organised to a purpose, yet they won’t go away; they just go haywire. There’s a strong feeling of being discarded that one can’t really blame entirely on men. Nature doesn’t want you around any more.
At the 2016 Brisbane writers festival, there was outrage when you said that you hoped the notion of cultural appropriation in fiction was a fad. Does the row that recently blew up around Jeanine Cummins’s novel, American Dirt, about a Mexican bookseller, suggest your optimism was misplaced?Yes. I was talking to an executive at HarperCollins, which publishes the No 1. Ladies’ Detective Agency series. He said they’d be turned down today: a middle-aged, white Scot [Alexander McCall Smith] writing about a black woman in Botswana – that’s not on. But let’s not waste time listing all the books that would break the rules now. What made the American Dirt row horrifying was the author’s response. She didn’t stand up and defend herself. Instead, she pushed to the fore her Puerto Rican grandmother. It was completely wrong-headed. The whole idea of cultural appropriation limits fiction’s ability to be fiction.
What did you make of the decision of Hachette, Woody Allen’s original publisher, to cancel the publication of his memoir following protests from Ronan Farrow and several company employees?I took it a little personally. It sets a terrible precedent. I’ve stuck my neck out in the past. I’ve made a lot of enemies. Some people think I’m evil incarnate. What if enough of them were working at HarperCollins and didn’t want my book published, and staged a walkout? Would HarperCollins stand behind me? Should I feel confident it would honour my contract? That a writer can be the victim of the mob like this should be terrifying for any author.
What are you reading?Oh dear. In all honesty, I’m reading newspapers and magazines exclusively. I can’t read fiction right now, which makes me a hypocrite because I expect everyone to read mine.
What will you write next? Something about the apocalypse?One way in which the lockdown has been great for me is that I’m going to finish the draft of my new novel in four months. It’s about a couple who make a pact that they’re going to kill themselves when they’re 80. It sounds like a downer but it’s actually a huge amount of fun because it’s a parallel-universe book. Honestly, it has turned out to be hilarious.

- It was Gedoni's birthday but Khafi said his day is also her own and vice versa
- A video of their love journey was used to celebrate the special day
BBNaija 2019 couple Khafi and Gedoni's love has continued to wax stronger since they made it public after their engagement.
Theirs is not a love that is one-sided as both gush about each other at every given opportunity and that is exactly what Khafi has done by celebrating the love of her life Gedoni as he adds another year to his age.
Saturday, May 2, is Gedoni's birthday, and his affianced, Khafi, rather than tell too much story, decided to celebrate the love they have between them. She said that Gedoni's birthday is also her birthday so it is their birthday together.
In a short video of one minute, she appreciates Gedoni for the love he has shown her thus far as she noted that she never knew she will find through love but has found one in him. She also highlighted his qualities. She said he is gentle, generous, and genuine.
This is what BB Naija's Mercy Eke told ex-housemate and lover Ike that set social media on fire
She captioned the video:
"Today is our birthday. Yes, our birthday because I am you and you are me. Your full name means God's blessings, and I can't tell you how much that is what you are to me. I thank you for showing me the true meaning of love and loving every part of me. The good, the bad, and the parts no one else sees. Trying to put this altogether in a video is just a fraction, but just know that I love you. Now and always. Happy birthday my baby"

Meanwhile, Legit.ng had previously reported that Saturday, April 4, would have been Khafi and Gedoni's wedding day but it was cancelled.
The bride-to-be, Khafi, took to her social media page, Instagram, and her Youtube channel, to announce what led to the cancellation of her wedding to the love of her life.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Where was the Netflix series Hollywood filmed?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the many new shows to have dropped onto to Netflix this May, Hollywood is the intriguing period drama from Glee creator Ryan Murphy.
The series, which is available to stream on Netflix now, follows a group of aspiring actors and filmmakers in post-World War II Hollywood as they try to make it in LA.
Exploring a Hollywood in a parallel universe, the diverse characters aren’t afraid to be bold in chasing their dreams and fulfilling their ambitions. 
The show has received mixed reviews so far, with Metro.co.uk saying: ‘It covers a lot of ground and a lot of talking points – mainly successfully. This show isn’t just a letter to Hollywood – it’s built for die-hard Murphy fans who has made his career on shining a spotlight on representation, in particular queer representation, when there wasn’t one before.’
Unsurprisingly for a show named Hollywood, the primary filming location for this new Netflix series was Los Angeles, California. 
Most of the scenes from the series were filmed inside sets on a film studio lot in LA, allowing the makers of the show to style the world of the show in true 1940s old Hollywood glamour.
However, there are elements of the location and set that are inspired by places that exisit in real life in Hollywood – just as many of the characters in the series are inspired be real-life people.
For example, Ace Studios, the fictional move studio where most of the drama takes place in Hollywood is modelled on the Bronson Gate from Paramount Pictures’ studio which you can still see today in LA. 
Hollywood is available to stream on Netflix now.

And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at. There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”
Going forward still expect Cole to pen comic book-based projects. He’s currently adapting the Vault Comics title “Failsafe” (a project also for Netflix), with Michael B. Jordan producing. But at the same time, Cole also wants to continue to direct movies like “All Day and a Night,” where the story is shedding light on someone you wouldn’t expect you’d be interested in.
“What I wanted to achieve was taking the audience on a journey and humanizing someone we often struggle to see the humanity in,” he said. “I was constantly working on finding the humanity in the stylized crime genre.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patiala Babes star Ashnoor Kaur will be turning a year older tomorrow (May 4). However, due to the extension by the COVID-19 lockdown in the nation, the young actress won’t be able to celebrate her birthday. But she did open up to an entertainment portal about understanding the need of the hour and has no qualms in prioritizing safety and precaution.
Ashnoor said, "Well, to be very honest, I was really excited for my 16th, I mean obviously, everyone is. But of course, the safety of the people is more important. We had actually decided where are we going to celebrate our birthday, which would have been possible if there wasn't a lockdown, but I guess this lockdown has slashed away a lot of us. It is not just my birthday, but also our entire show, so I just want to tell everyone to stay safe and stay indoors."
On being quizzed about Patiala Babes abruptly going off-air, the actress replied, "This decision had to be taken right now in times of the crisis because the lockdown is on and it is very uncertain. If we talk about my reaction emotionally, it was really very heartbreaking for me and I am going to take some days to digest the fact because I remember how on the last day, we were all so excited because we left the show at a crucial point and we were really excited to resume the shoot. But it is forever going to live in my heart and I am going to cherish the memories with the team, the producers. I also want to express my thanks to the channel for this beautiful journey."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Free-roaming horse Jenny cheers up German lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Every morning white mare Jenny leaves her stable to stroll through her Frankfurt neighbourhood. Bringing trams to a halt and smiles to people's faces, the free-roaming horse is brightening up the coronavirus lockdown for many.
"Everyone else has to live with coronavirus restrictions but Jenny is as free as ever," her owner Anna Weischedel, 65, told AFP.
For more than a decade Jenny has wandered solo through her local Fechenheim area, a green part of Frankfurt on the bank of the Main river.
She explores the high street, trots along the tram line to a nearby field, and spends hours nibbling on patches of grass.
The beloved Arabian mare, already a venerable 25 years old, has always been a hit with residents. But never more so than in recent weeks.
"People seem to notice her more because they have more time. A lot of passers-by stroke her, maybe because they are missing some human contact," said Anna.
Like many countries, Germany has closed schools, playgrounds and many businesses to curb the outbreak.
Though it has slowly started easing some lockdown measures, people are encouraged to limit their social interactions and keep their distance.
But there are no rules against snuggling with Jenny.
"It makes us so happy to see Jenny, we miss her when we don't pass her on our walks," said Gaby Marxen, 61, holding two dogs on a leash.
Johanna, 8, who was also out walking a dog, said: "My brother and I like to pet her."
To avoid misunderstandings, since people have in the past called the police to report an unaccompanied horse, Jenny wears a note around her neck that reads: "I haven't run away, I'm just out for a walk."
The daily ramble ends at around 4:00 pm, when Anna's 80-year-old husband, Werner, jumps on his e-scooter to find Jenny along her usual route and tell her it's home time. 
"And then she slowly heads back," said Werner, a retired flower shop owner.
'Very patient'
In all her years of ambling, Jenny has never caused trouble and local authorities have embraced their equine celebrity, the couple said.
"She's a very patient horse, it takes a lot to stress her out," said Anna.
The only thing that upsets Jenny is the noise of fireworks, something she shares with Werner who is haunted by the sounds of bombs dropping on Frankfurt when he was a child during World War II.
"Jenny and I spend New Year's Eve cowering together," Werner smiled.
Jenny's animal-loving owners, who also have a near-toothless chihuahua and look after more than 100 birds, are taking the coronavirus pandemic in their stride.
"We survived the war, we'll survive corona," shrugged Werner.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘GDP Shrank 4.8%’ - No. Forecast 30% Drop? Fantasy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The economists' statistical engine is running amok again, just like in 2008-2009. It's making mountains from molehills (make that sinkholes from potholes), scaring the heck out of investors, reporters and just about everyone else. Here's what's wrong...
Whenever the economy coughs, economist's yell, "Pneumonia!" They are not being alarmists. The problem is that their analytical machinery only works when big numbers take mini-steps along a stable trend.
For example, in 2019 the GDP rose 2.3% for the year, broken down by quarterly moves of 0.76%, 0.50%, 0.52% and 0.52%. This has been the picture for pretty much all of the past five years.
Those boring quarterly numbers are matched by ho-hum GDP amounts. In 2019, GDP increased $0.4 T, from $18.8 T to $19.2 T. The quarterly figures, starting with the fourth quarter 2018, were $4.70 T, $4.73 T, $4.76 T, $4.78 T and $4.81 T. Feeling sleepy? Well, just check out the first quarter of 2020:
Is that all there is? Well, yes, those are the actual numbers. And this is where economists wheel out their "make it look significant" machine.
Note: "Significant" in this case does not mean more accurate or more meaningful. In fact, the effect is just the opposite. The keyword is "look," to which should be added, "feel," because the result is emotional, not educational.
Annualization is the magic process
Converting the quarterly data to annualized figures is a common practice among economists. The conversions are straightforward.
For the GDP amounts: Take the seasonally-adjusted, inflation-adjusted quarterly amount and multiply by four. Voila! First quarter 2020 just become an annualized $19.0 T, down $0.24 T.
For percentage changes, the conversion requires understanding compound interest. Take that 1.22% first quarter drop and compound it for four quarters. The result is food for a front-page headline: a "significant" decline of -4.8%.
This graph shows the annualized quarterly rates from 1985. Clearly the volatility makes any trend hard to see.
Now look at the comparison of those annalized rates with the actual, quarterly rates. Aren’t those green bars a better way to separate the stable growth periods from the volatile, negative ones?
So, why annualize?
Perhaps annualizing produces easier to understand small changes in big numbers, but only in normal (i.e., stable) times when the data inches along at a relatively slow pace. However, when those same items being measured encounter abnormal forces that throw results off the long-term trend, annualizing implicitly assumes the observed or forecast quarterly change will continue for four quarters. Since such a forecast is folly, the annualized results are nonsensical and misleading.
That is where most economic measurements are now. The data have become volatile and/or negative. Therefore, annualization should be turned off. Magnifying instability by a factor of four is wrong.
2020: Sequel to 2008/2009 misstatements and misdirection
The last time we had to say "That's not right!" was when the fourth quarter of 2008 came in at a collapse of -8.4%. [Read more about that period in the Addendum, below.]
However, today's COVID-19 period could be worse, based on the "that's not right, either" forecast for this second quarter - a potential plummet of -30%.
The real 2020 story is a potential 10% decline in the first half
That -30% is the result of annualizing a forecast quarterly drop of about -8.5%. Combined with the -1.22% first quarter decline means a potential ~10% fall for the first half of 2020. Such an anticipated result is certainly understandable given the amount of temporary business closures and slow-downs. A decline of 10% in the entire U.S. GDP over two quarters is, in itself, a serious issue. However, those headline numbers of -4.8% and -30% hide reality and imply much worse is at hand.
The bottom line
Economists and analysts work with big numbers that often don't move much. Quarterly GDP changes like 0.5% and .0525% look uninteresting. Therefore, they annualize the data to 2% and 2.1%. In normal times, that's okay, if it's made clear that those are annualized numbers.
The problem occurs when an aberration happens, creating volatility and/or negativity that is divorced from the longer-term trend. That is when annualization is a flawed adjustment, particularly because space-constrained headlines drop the word, "annualized." Moreover, the actual quarterly change is rarely reported anywhere in the articles.
Therefore, it is upon us - as investors, advisers and writers - to both understand and communicate the true results.
Addendum: More about the reporting of the biggest drop in the 2008/2009 Great Recession
From The New York Times NYT (February 27, 2009) [Note: This is only days before the stock market's bottom] (Underlining is mine)
NytimesG.D.P. Revision Suggests a Long, Steep Downfall
"The economy contracted at a far faster rate than initially estimated in the final months of 2008, the government reported Friday, suggesting a deeper recession that will further challenge the health of the financial system."
"In the fourth quarter, the gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of -6.2 percent, the steepest decline since the 1982 recession and sharper than the -3.8 percent reported earlier. Every major component of the economy shrank, except government spending. Economists said all signs point to a similar drop in output in the current quarter."
Note: The fourth quarter 2008 GDP drop was later revised lower to -8.4%. Even though this article was written when the first quarter 2009 was two-thirds completed, economists significantly overshot the negative results: The annualized decline for that quarter came in at -4.4%, followed by -0.6% in the second quarter and +4.5% in the third.
The actual (non-annualized) quarterly changes were -2.2%, -1.1%, -0.2% and +1.1%. Compounded, those rates were a total annual of -2.3%, far from those misleading economist/media annualized-quarterly rates. Another, quicker way to get accurate, actual annual rates is simply to calculate the percentage change from the same inflation-adjusted quarter one year ago. Doing so removes the need to seasonally adjust the results. Most importantly, it gets rid of the headline-making, confusion-causing and highly inaccurate, annualized quarterly numbers during volatile times.
This graph contrasts the year-over-year rates of change with the annualized quarter-over-quarter change. Clearly, the latter numbers do not provide better insight.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Under The Hood Of Second Reality, PC Demoscene Landmark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In 1993, IBM PCs & clones were a significant but not dominant fraction of the home computer market. They were saddled with the stigma of boring business machines. Lacking Apple Macintosh’s polish, unable to match Apple II’s software library, and missing Commodore’s audio/visual capabilities. The Amiga was the default platform of choice for impressive demos, but some demoscene hackers saw the PC’s potential to blow some minds. [Future Crew] was such a team, and their Second Reality accomplished exactly that. People who remember and interested in a trip back in time should take [Fabien Sanglard]’s tour of Second Reality source code.
We recently covered another impressive PC demo executed in just 256 bytes, for which several commenters were thankful the author shared how it was done. Source for demos aren’t necessarily released: the primary objective being to put on a show, and some authors want to keep a few tricks secret. [Future Crew] didn’t release source for Second Reality until 20th anniversary of its premiere, by which time it was difficult to run on a modern PC. Technically it is supported by DOSBox but rife with glitches, as Second Reality uses so many nonstandard tricks. The easiest way to revisit nostalgia is via video captures posted to YouTube (one embedded below the break.)
A PC from 1993 is primitive by modern standards. It was well before the age of GPUs. In fact before any floating point hardware was commonplace: Intel’s 80387 math co-processor was a separate add-on to the 80386 CPU. With the kind of hardware at our disposal today it can be hard to understand what a technical achievement Second Reality was. But PC users of the time understood, sharing it and dropping jaws well beyond the demoscene community. Its spread was as close to “going viral” as possible when “high speed data” was anything faster than 2400 baud.
Many members of [Future Crew] went on to make impact elsewhere in the industry, and their influence spread far and wide. But PC graphics wasn’t done blowing minds in 1993 just yet… December 10th of that year would see the public shareware release of a little thing called Doom.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sure, Elijah Wood might be the model Animal Crossing visitor, but T-Pain has proven himself to be your ideal Animal Crossing husband.
The world at large first learned of this monumental fact just a couple of days ago when the rapper and R&B singer tweeted about the generous stimulus package that he left for wife, Amber Najm.
But there's much more to the story, as evidenced by this live stream of the two on Twitch just yesterday. In it, he enlisted fans to come to a house warming on Amber's brand new island. Speaking for everyone, commenter TonyDaddi wrote in the chat, "Just say the WORD WHAT U NEED MRS. PAIN."
T-Pain, the best provider and hype man one could ever ask for, told fans to come bearing gifts or GTFO. And sure enough, Amber was showered with a stockpile so enormous that it puts every other desert island getaway package to shame. 
Fans "made it rain" iron nuggets, a red kimono, various bugs, STAR FRAGMENTS (!!) — all made possible by the man best known for heavily auto-tuned tracks such as "Buy U a Drank." 
On top of everything, T-Pain also ensured that the moose villager on Amber's island would think twice before asking his wife to "take a nap" together, requesting his "alpha team" go out and use bug-catching nets on the harassing villager. That moose will surely think twice before propositioning a married woman ever again.
T-Pain's Twitch channel and Twitter feed are both full of all kinds of other relatable Animal Crossing content, too.
As someone who's pretty new to Animal Crossing himself, T-Pain was frustrated by the game's initially slow pace. Though, unlike the rest of us plebs just starting out, he has an army at the ready to turn him into a billionaire in no time.
We demand the T-Pain x K.K. Slider collab the world deserves now, please!

    <h5 class="mb-1">CSX Is (Still) Too Expensive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Since writing my cautious note on CSX Corp. (CSX) back in early February, the shares are down about 11% against a loss of 8.9% for the S&P 500. Since the company just published earnings, I thought it would be worthwhile to look in on the name again. I’ll review the financial history here, and will look at the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business. I’ll also review the results of the short options trade I recommended in my previous article. For those who missed this article's title, and who don't want to wade through to the end of this article, I'll come to the point. I think CSX shares remain overpriced at this point, and so I recommend avoiding the shares until they drop in price. I think there's money to be made in the options market, though.
Financial Snapshot
CSX is like every other Class 1 railroad in that they have managed to increase profitability in the face of declining revenues. This prompts questions about how sustainable profit growth might be, but it also should put to bed any concerns about slowing revenues cratering the company. In particular, in spite of the fact that revenue has declined at a CAGR of about -.9% over the past six years, earnings from operations has grown at a CAGR of 9.5%. Given that the company spent (wasted?) $12.968 billion on buybacks since 2014, there are ~229 million fewer shares outstanding now than there were in 2014, and this drove EPS to grow at a CAGR of over 13%.
Dividend Sustainability
In my view, the sustainability of dividends is of particular importance to investors at the moment, so I’ll spend a relatively large amount of time on that topic. In order to do this, I’ll look at the upcoming financial obligations the firm has and compare those to the resources available to the firm. In my view, CSX, like every other Class 1 railroad, has taken on way too much debt over the past several years. In particular, CSX’s long-term debt has grown at a CAGR of about 9.5% since 2014. On the surface, this increase in debt may be understandable, given that this is obviously a capital-intensive business. The problem is that over the past six years, the company has spent just under $13 billion on share buybacks, which represents about 81% of current long-term debt.
On the following table, I’ve compiled the amounts and timing of future cash obligations for your reading pleasure. This year, for instance, the company will need to spend just more than $1.34 billion on lease payments, maintenance and the like. Note that the $750 million interest expense is 38% higher than it was in 2015. Against these various obligations, the company has a large cash hoard of just under $2.5 billion. This means that the company has sufficient resources to cover the next three years.

This suggests to me that there’s not much risk of a dividend cut here anytime soon. I would like to see the company pay down debt. I would have liked the company to spend less on buybacks and more on dividends. That said, there’s little reason to be nervous about the dividend at this point.

The Stock
I think the returns that an investor enjoys - or suffers - is largely a function of the price they pay for that investment. If a stream of future cash flows can be discounted back to be worth X, paying more than X will generate a negative return, and paying a fraction of X will generate a positive return. So returns can be drastically different on the same “X” of future cash flows. This is why I always obsess over valuations. I want to avoid overpaying for future cash flows.
I judge whether or not I risk overpaying in a few ways, ranging from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value (earnings, free cash flow and the like). In particular, before I buy, I want to ensure that the shares are inexpensive relative to both the overall market and their own history. This relationship is captured in the following chart. The shares have certainly been more expensive than they currently are, but they’ve certainly been cheaper also.
In addition to looking at the ratio of price to earnings, I want to understand what the market is currently assuming about the future of a given company. In order to do this, I turn to the methodology employed by Professor Stephen Penman in his book “Accounting for Value.” In the book, Penman walks an investor through how they might use a standard finance formula (and the magic of high school algebra) to isolate the “g” (growth) variable and work out what the market must be assuming about the future. Using this approach suggests that the market is expecting a perpetual growth rate of ~5.5% for CSX. I consider this to be a fairly optimistic forecast. That optimism, plus the fact that the PE multiple is on the high side, leads me to want to avoid the shares at these levels.
Options Update
In my previous article, I went through my two year history of writing puts against this name. I found that I earned $14.30 of put premia prior to the publication of that article. In addition, I generated an additional $2.30 of put premia in early February, bringing the total to $16.80 premia per share over the past two years. This compares favorably to the performance of the total return of the stock of $14.90 during that time. In my view, the trade history here demonstrates the relative power of short puts vs. long stock positions. Please also note that the risk of these puts is lower as they require less capital than stock ownership.
In the last article on this name, I recommended selling the January CSX put with a strike of $62.50. At the time, these puts were bid-asked at $2.30-$2.46. Although nearly two months of time value has been lost, they are currently bid-asked at $6.35-$6.80. Given that I’m comfortable owning these shares at that price, I think it would be worthwhile to sell these same puts again.
Now that I’ve written about the benefits of short puts, it’s time to splash some cold water on the idea by writing about risks. Investing, like life in general, involves making choices among a host of imperfect trade-offs. There are no risk-free options. There’s risk a, and there’s risk b. We do our best to navigate the world by exchanging one pair of risk-reward trade-offs for another. For example, holding cash presents the risk of erosion of purchasing power via inflation and the reward of preserving capital at times of extreme volatility. The risk-reward trade-off of buying shares should be pretty self-evident in early 2020. For those who missed it, the risk-reward trade-off for stock ownership involves the potential for capital loss weighed against the potential for capital gain.
Put options are no different in this regard. I've described the reward potential of these often, so I'll spend the rest of this section talking about their risks. I think the risks of put options are very similar to those associated with a long stock position. If the shares drop in price, the stockholder loses money and the short put writer may be obliged to buy the stock. Thus, both long stock and short put investors typically want to see higher stock prices.
Puts are distinct from stocks in that some put writers don't want to actually buy the stock, they simply want to collect premia. Such investors care more about maximizing their income, and will therefore be less discriminating about which stock they sell puts on. These people don't want to own the underlying security. For my part, I'll only ever write puts on companies that I'd be happy to own, at strike prices that represent good entry points for me. For that reason, being exercised isn't the trauma for me that's for many other put writers.
In my view, put writers take on risk, but they take on less risk (sometimes significantly less risk) than stock buyers in a critical way. Short put writers generate income simply for taking on the obligation to buy a business that they like at a price that they find attractive. This circumstance is objectively better than simply taking the prevailing market price. This is why I consider the risks of selling puts on a given day to be far lower than the risks associated with simply buying the stock on that day.
I’ll drive the point home by using CSX as an example of the choice facing a hypothetical investor. The investor can choose to buy the shares today at a price of ~$68.70. Alternatively, they can generate a credit for their accounts by selling put options that oblige them - under the worst possible circumstance - to buy the shares at a net price 18% below today's level. In my view, that's the definition of lower risk.
Conclusion
I think this is a well-run business that's in possession of an unassailable “moat.” In addition, over time, the company has demonstrated that slowing revenues won’t necessarily harm profitability. Finally, the company is moderately shareholder friendly in light of the fact that they’ve increased dividends per share at a CAGR of about 7% over the past six years. Also, the dividend is well covered in my estimation, in spite of the huge debt overhang the company has taken on. The problem isn’t with the company, it’s with the stock. In my view, it remains expensive, and I therefore think investors would be wise to avoid the name. Just because I don’t see value at current prices, though, doesn’t mean I think this company is worthless. I would be happy to buy shares, just not at the current price. Because I’m comfortable buying 18% below the current level, I think the put options that I recommended selling are a great trade. If the shares rally from these levels, the investor pockets the premia. If the shares drop, the investor buys this great company at a great price.

Additional disclosure: I'll be selling the puts mentioned in this article.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Review: Sakura Wars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Times are tough for the Tokyo Imperial Theater. In the decade following The Great War, the International Combat Revue's Flower Division has fallen on hard times. If it wasn't enough that the theater troupe's best performers never returned from the battlefield all those years ago, its replacement thespians are struggling to find their own identity in the looming shadow of those that came before.
Under-furnished, under-funded, and under-attended, the once-great theater has become a laughing stock to its audience, with its new cast desperate for direction, support, and guidance. It will be up to a stranger to bring passion and performance back to the rickety wooden stage, to help its promising-but-doubting young actors reach the peak of their dramatic potential. To reach, maybe surpass, the theater's storied legacy...
...Also, to guide them in mech-riding warfare against armies of inter-dimensional demons aiming to bring about the global apocalypse.
Having been 15 years since the last release, many fans were sure Sakura Wars had taken its final bow. But with this, the sixth mainline entry and only the second to launch in the west, Sega is giving the franchise a fresh start. Powered by a new engine, starring a brand new cast of characters, and with only rudimentary connections to previous titles, Sakura Wars is intended as a "jumping-off" point for new fans and hopes to enchant them with its trademark mash-up of JRPG, visual novel, dating sim, and explosive mech-based combat. Curtain up.
Sakura Wars (PS4)Developer: Sega CS2Publisher: SegaReleased: April 28, 2020MSRP: $59.99
Sakura Wars is a game of two distinct halves. "Adventure Mode" consists of a dialogue-heavy, character-driven RPG/social sim, while "Battle Mode" sees the cast take to their personalised mechs for demon-mashing combat. It's important to note upfront, however, that Sakura Wars leans heavily on the former. At an estimate, the ratio of social sim to mech warfare stands about 70:30. This will come as no surprise to series fans, but should be clarified for newcomers.
Set in an alternate 1940s Tokyo, Sakura Wars puts players in the role of Seijro Kamiyama, a handsome young man who, in true anime fashion, has risen to the rank of naval captain despite looking 16 years old. He also carries two swords at all times. Yeah, why not? In the aftermath of the last demonic conflict, Sejiro is stationed at the Imperial Theater, where he is tasked with turning around the venue's ailing reputation while cultivating its troupe of actors-cum-demon fighters: The Flower Division.
As Seijiro, the player is introduced to acast of new characters, lovingly designed by Bleach creator Tite Kubo. Front and center are the Flower Division themselves: boisterous Hatsuho; studious Claris; deadpan child ninja Azami; stage diva Anastasia; and poster girl Sakura Amamiya. In time, Seijiro will also meet the theater's staff and patrons, the local townsfolk, and other Combat Revue representatives. Adventure Mode amounts to wandering the theater and its surrounding locations, engaging in lengthy conversations with the cast, and getting embroiled in silly shenanigans. From minute one, Sakura Wars is wholly personality-driven. The emphasis on building close relationships through dialogue choices and running errands is the spine of its gameplay.
While at first glance Sakura Wars might seem reminiscent of a Persona 5 or a Yakuza, it doesn't have quite the same level of activity to offer. There is no buying-and-selling in stores, for example. The town exists merely as a stage for character interaction, scene-setting, or – for smooth-tongued Lotharios – starlit dates. Sakura Wars does have its share of fun side-activities, however, including combat simulator Battle-Bot, traditional card game Koi-Koi, and a habitual obsession with collecting hidden "bromides" (or photographs). Overall it does lack the variety of similar "stroll around town" RPGs, instead choosing to focus squarely on conversations and relationships.
It's fortunate, then, that Sakura Wars successfully hits it out of the park with its delightful new cast. These characters, while admittedly as tropey as any other JRPG, are simply a joy to engage with. Dialogue-centric games necessitate good scripting, and while some eyes may roll at the inevitable cheese and creep factor that occasionally rears its head, the conversations had in and around the city are almost always a pleasure, rarely a chore.
The striking charisma of each character is a testament to Sakura Wars' excellent vocal performances. Despite only featuring the original Japanese voice track, every spoken nuance – from sorrow to shame, happiness to sarcasm, comedic timing, and everything in-between – all hits with vigor and clarity. Each character brings a unique dynamic to the dialogue, whilst Seijiro himself is a solid protagonist, if scattered in his moral center. The flawed, down-to-earth nature of the cast helps endear them to the player, even if their individual character arcs are somewhat plain.
Perhaps most surprisingly of all, the writing is often very funny. Not "OMG! Girls' Pants!" funny (although plenty of that material exists herein), but legitimately witty. Many scenes are loaded with smart comebacks, dubious misunderstandings, expressive reactions, and even some classic physical comedy. It can be difficult to resist "breaking" the narrative by intentionally choosing the worst dialogue options simply because you want to see the unfolding social disaster.
Eventually, inevitably, all the gals get gooey-eyed for our boy Seijiro, enabling clumsy dates and "communication" scenes. The latter are weird first-person sequences where you literally click on your favorite gal's hair, lips, and cheeks while she blushes and stammers "W-what is this thing that you call 'k-kissing?'" Ok, maybe not exactly that, but you know the score. An integral part of the franchise, Sakura Wars' romance scenes bounce between coy and, frankly, creepy-as-fuck. Successful trysts will unlock battle bonuses, special bromides, and custom endings.
Out of interest, I somehow ended up dating an entirely different girl to the one I was actually trying to court, which should give you some idea as to why I'm such a total catch in real life... Stop laughing.
At the climax of each chapter, plot necessity calls The Flower Division into Battle Mode. What follows is, for want of better description, stripped-down Dynasty Warriors gameplay as Seijiro and Co. take to the Dark Realm for demon-smashing showdowns. At this point, it becomes apparent that the action sequences are unequivocally the "side mode" to the game's social elements.
Now, that isn't to say that action is Sakura Wars is terrible. The character models are slickly designed, the visual effects are stunning, and the fights are technically proficient – with nary a single frame-drop in sight. But the combat is super-simplistic, both by design and in nature, boiling down to mashing out the same optimised combo repeatedly until everyone's dead. Throughout my playthrough, I never once lost a fight, wiping out armies of demons with absolute ease. The Flower Division was virtually unstoppable come the final act, defeating major boss characters in seconds. What did you expect? I wasn't made a naval captain for nothing...wait, I wasn't made a naval captain at all.
The action has its plus-points. Incessant chatter keeps the fight "alive" with personality, the player can switch out their character for variety, and there are some stylish, cinematic special maneuvers. But it should be clarified that Sakura Wars' priorities lie definitively with its social elements. I guess you can't fight mechs when there's still head pats to be dished out and bakeries to visit.
Where Sakura Wars shines – truly shines – is in its magnificent presentation. From its wonderful opening sequence, which I watched every time, to its emotional climax, Sakura Wars buzzes with energy. It boasts a majestic score by Kohei Tanaka, with the One Piece composer's soundtrack packed full of infectious themes and well-fit compositions. Accentuating scenes of hope, tragedy, joy, goofiness, and celebration, the score is as much a leading character as anyone in The Flower Division.
For all of its peaks and pitfalls, it's crystal clear that Sakura Wars really, really wants you to fall in love with the franchise. It goes above and beyond to bewitch the player with its upbeat tone, colourful settings, and friendly characters. The whole adventure is dripping with an infectious "feel-good" positivity that gets under your skin. What it lacks in deep, engaging combat, and interesting side-attractions, Sakura Wars makes up for in heart, a game enthusiastically hoping to welcome you into the Imperial Combat Revue family.
Personally, I had a great time with Sakura Wars. I was in love with its characters, I dug its witty script, I enjoyed its triumphant tone, and I've been humming its indelible score for weeks. If you are up for an exciting anime tale packed with dialogue, drama, and dating, then grab a front-row seat. But those expecting an action-heavy title that prioritises deep combat, knife-edge boss battles, intricate plotting, and not a lot of "looking wistfully out of windows" might best be served elsewhere, or left waiting on a discount. Sega has been mostly successful here, but there are definite lessons to be learned for future entries.
Sakura Wars represents an ambitious new start for the franchise, one that might not be to everyone's tastes. While its mediocre combat and dialogue-heavy design may leave some players disengaged, its fabulous presentation, pleasing visuals, delightful characters, and histrionic melodrama will delight others. Perhaps most importantly, it offers the franchise a bright future bursting with potential. Encore!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As coronavirus tightens its grip on the world, and we all find ourselves stuck indoors without access to so much of the culture we are accustomed to, on-demand streaming services may just about keep you sane.
Amazon has plenty of critically acclaimed options, from the bleakly funny Tonya Harding biopic I, Tonya to the devastating portrait of early-onset Alzheimer's Still Alice.
But if you're in search of something a little more light-hearted, there's a heartwarming Love Actually or tear-jerking The Notebook for every challenging watch.

Genre: Comedy Dir: Olivia Wilde Cast: Kaitlyn Dever, Beanie Feldstein, Jessica Williams, Lisa Kudrow, Will Forte, Jason Sudeikis. Cert: 15 Time: 105 mins
In a nutshell: Olivia Wilde’s snappy and funny directorial debut about two graduating high school girls who decide to go wild after years of knuckling down. Nothing Wilde has done in her previous acting career could have tipped us off that she had this film in her, though her sweet, shambolic performance in Joe Swanberg’s 2013 dramedy Drinking Buddies probably comes closest to the tone on screen.

Genre: Drama Dir: Tom Harper Cast: Jessie Buckley, Julie Walters, Sophie Okonedo, Jamie Sives, Craig Parkinson, James Harkness. Cert: 15 Time: 101 mins
In a nutshell: Relative newcomer Jessie Buckley shines as the lead in this heartening tale of a Scottish woman, fresh out of prison and with two kids, who wants to make it as a country music star. Buckley previously appeared on the BBC’s I’d Do Anything, and puts her vocal chops to good use in this refreshing crowd-pleaser that turns down any easy emotional shortcuts.

Dir: Luca Guadagnino Cast: Dakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton, Mia Goth, Angela Winkler, Ingrid Caven, Chloë Grace Moretz. Cert: 18 Time: 152 mins
In a nutshell: In a thrilling remake of the 1977 horror film of the same name, a renowned German dance company (led by Tilda Swinton's enigmatic instructor) falls under the influence of something dark. As dancers disappear, secrets begin to be uncovered which could kill them all. 
Read our 5 star review of Suspiria
Genre: Drama Dir: Scott Z. Burns Cast: Adam Driver, Annette Benning, Jon Hamm, Ted Levine, Michael C. Hall, Maura Tierney. Cert: 15 Time: 119 mins
In a nutshell: Cat and mouse, lanyard-heavy drama following a US senate staffer who leads an investigation into the CIA’s detention and interrogation (read: torture) programme following the 9/11 attacks. Director Scott Z. Burns paints strictly within the lines of a bone-dry procedural, which is powered above all by Driver’s mournful integrity. There’s not much wrong with it, but maybe the subject needed heating up.
Read our 3 star review of The Report 
Genre: Drama Dir: Peter Farrelly Cast: Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardellini, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dimiter D. Marinov. Cert: 12 Time: 130 mins
In a nutshell: This Best Picture winner caused controversy for advancing a "white saviour" narrative. Telling the true story of Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a working-class Italian-American bouncer who takes on a job as a chauffeur for Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a highly-educated African-American classical pianist, Green Book is a solid if slightly pedestrian film.
Read our 3 star review of Green Book 
Genre: Romantic Comedy Dir: Mike Newell Cast: Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, James Fleet Cert: 15 Time: 117 mins
In a nutshell: The best of Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant's romcoms about awfully nice chaps dithering over frightfully pretty girls. Grant plays bumbling Charles, who, ah, er, can't tell what's, um, going on between him and the scrummy Carrie (Andie MacDowell), whom he keeps, gosh, bumping into at weddings. It's aged pretty well and certainly knocks spots off Love, Actually.
Dir: Oliver Stone Cast: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen Cert: 15 Time: 114 mins
In a nutshell: This is a chance to see a young Charlie Sheen at the start of his turbulent career. The horrors of the Vietnam War are seen through the prism of a fresh-faced college dropout (Sheen) who finds himself in the thick of battle while Willem Dafoe plays his sympathetic sergeant. Director Oliver Stone used his own experiences of serving in the US army during the war to inform this harrowing film, which won four Oscars.
Genre: War drama Dir: Mel Gibson Cast: Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, Vince Vaughn. Cert: 15 Time: 139 mins
In a nutshell: Mel Gibson’s biographical war film tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a Seventh-Day Adventist Christian and pacifist who saved 75 men in one of the bloodiest battles of the Second World War without firing a gun. Gibson finds a kindred spirit in Doss, an unconventional man of faith, shunned by the establishment. Thick with Christian symbolism, this is a zealous but compelling story of faith and the horrors of war. 
Read our 4 star review of Hacksaw Ridge
Genre: Romance Dir: Nick Cassavetes Cast: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, James Marsden, Sam Shepard, Joan Allen. Cert: 12 Time: 124 mins
In a nutshell: Classic tear-jerker starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love but are separated by fate. Although at times cringey and sentimental, it manages to capture the pathos lacking in so many similarly pitched films, with strong performances from the two leads. 
Genre: Musical Dir: Hiro Murai Cast: Donald Glover, Rihanna, Nonso Anozie, Letitia Wright Cert: 12 Time: 55 mins
In a nutshell: This lean and sumptuous 50-minute short (an Amazon original production) casts Donald Glover as Deni Maroon, an amateur musician and the joyous beating heart of a fictional Caribbean island, who clashes with a rich businessman (Nonso Anozie). Largely an excuse to tie together hit songs by Glover's alter-ego Childish Gambino, it's a beautifully shot – if largely inconsequential – slice of island melodrama.
Read our 3 star review of Guava Island 
Genre: Crime Dir: Bryan Singer Cast: Pete Postlethwaite, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin Cert: 18 Time: 104 mins
In a nutshell: This dexterous tour de force is a treat, keeping the audience guessing about whether criminal kingpin Keyser Soze actually exists. Starting at the end of five criminals' six-week odyssey, it details how a boat came to be blown up, and on each rewatching it seems more complex. Postlethwaite, Spacey and Baldwin effortlessly make Christopher McQuarrie's tricky script seem plausible.
Genre: Horror Dir: Ari Aster Cast: Florence Pugh Jack Reynor, William Jackson Harper, Vilhelm Blomgren, Ellora Torchia, Archie Madekwe, Will Poulter. Cert: 18 Time: 104 mins
In a nutshell: Ari Aster's much-hyped follow up to Hereditary, largely set during a blindingly bright nine-day pagan festival in Sweden, is a delicious prank of a film that’s by turns heroically upsetting and deeply funny. Aster is some new cinematic god of misrule, tickling blossoms under your nose with one hand, while he uses the other to sneak a poisoned blade almost lovingly between your ribs.
Read our 5 star review of Midsommar
Genre: Sci-fi Dir: Jonathan Glazer Cast: Scarlett Johansson, Adam Pearson Cert: 15 Time: 108 minutes
In a nutshell: There are shades of Nicolas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth in this extraordinary film from the British director Jonathan Glazer. By turns sensual, funereal and entrancing, it finds Scarlett Johansson on breath-snatching femme fatale form as an alien in human disguise who roams the streets of Glasgow, sizing up earthlings to feast on.
Genre: Romantic Comedy Dir: Michael Showalter Cast: Kumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Holly Hunter, Ray Romano, Adeel Akhtar Cert: 15 Time: 120 mins
In a nutshell: One of the best things a romcom can do is make you feel party to the falling-in-love stuff – and Kumail Nanjiani and Zoe Kazan have such tremendous chemistry in this oddly shaped, culture-clash piece from the Judd Apatow workshop, that you may find yourself pulling puppy-dog faces throughout. Here's the hook: Kazan's character breaks up with Kumail's shortly before going into a coma – but once she's comatose, he finds himself back at her side, doing a kind of affable penance.
Read our 3 star review of The Big Sick
Genre: Drama Dir: Stephen Chbosky Cast: Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller, Mae, Whitman, Kate Walsh, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusack, Paul Rudd. Cert: 12 Time: 103 mins
In a nutshell: In Stephen Chbosky’s wonderfully observed coming-of-age film, which the director adapted from his own novel, 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) is just one wallflower in an entire herbaceous border of them. He struggles with depression after a friend’s suicide but learns to cope with his tumultuous past after befriending two high school seniors.
Read our 4 star review of The Perks of Being a Wallflower
Genre: Comedy Dir: Joel and Ethan Coen Cast: Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund Cert: 15 Time: 105 mins
In a nutshell: This often overlooked film from the Coen Brothers follows a week in the career of struggling musician Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) in Sixties New York. A jumble of terrible luck and even worse decisions make for a gloomily amusing film. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake complete the line up as a dysfunctional married couple and singing partnership.

Genre: Drama Dir: Ron Howard Cast: Frank Langella, Michael Sheen, Kevin Bacon, Rebecca, Hall, Toby Jones, Matthew Macfadyen, Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell. Cert: 15 Time: 122 mins
In a nutshell: Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon sets itself up as a prize fight between a yapping underdog and a grizzly bear, telling the story of the 1977 interviews between disgraced president Richard Nixon and British journalist David Frost. Frank Langella and Michael Sheen strike up a riveting partnership as the two respective leads in this punchy retelling.

Genre: Drama Dir: Sebastián Lelio Cast: Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams, Alessandro Nivola, Allan Corduner, Anton Lesser, Nicholas Woodeson Cert: 15 Time: 114 mins
In a nutshell: Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams star in a story of illicit lesbian love played out under the disapproving gaze of north London's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, as two women given a chance to reunite when Weisz's character returns from the US for her father's funeral. There's real potency to the sense of shame and condemnation they feel, and the performances are a knockout.
Genre: Comedy Dir: Adam McKay Cast: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carell, Sam, Rockwell, Tyler Perry, Alison Pill, Lily Rabe, Jesse Plemons. Cert: 15 Time: 132 mins
In a nutshell: Christian Bale undergoes a dramatic transformation, bodysuit and all, to portray pantomime villain and presidential puppeteer Dick Cheney, who served as Bush’s Vice-President during the Iraq War. A head-spinning shock-and-awe satire that comes in hot then cranks up the thermostat to infernal – a Molotov cocktail of biopic, documentary and black comedy, with a thrillingly short fuse.

Genre: Biographical comedy Dir: James Franco Cast: James Franco, Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, Alison, Brie, Ari Graynor, Josh Hutcherson, Jacki Weaver. Cert: 15  Time: 103 mins
In a nutshell: James Franco tells the true story behind The Room, widely considered one of the worst films ever made. Tommy Wiseau and actor Greg Sestero move to Los Angeles to look for Hollywood stardom, before turning their attention to filmmaking. A lively companion piece to the original - but the best possible account of The Room’s beguiling awfulness remains The Room.
Read our 3 star review of The Disaster Artist
Genre: Drama Dir: Wash Westmoreland, Richard Glatzer Cast: Julianne Moore, Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth Cert: 12 Time: 101 mins
In a nutshell: Moore finally netted a long-overdue Oscar for this modest, piercing drama about a linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s. The increments of her decline are acted with devastating subtlety, and there’s terrific support from Stewart as her youngest daughter.
Genre: Drama Dir: Charlie Kaufman Cast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Catherine Keener, Emily Watson, Dianne Wiest. Cert: 15 Time: 123 mins
In a nutshell: Charlie Kaufman makes his directorial debut after making his name as a screenwriter, behind a series of modern classics including Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich. Synecdoche New York follows an ailing theatre director (Charlie Kaufman) who develops an unhealthy obsession with realism. In keeping with his subject, Kaufman blurs the lines between fiction and reality in this at times alienating but remarkable postmodern fiasco. 
Read our 5 star review of Synecdoche, New York
Genre: Sci-fi Dir: Terry Gilliam Cast: Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Ian, Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan. Cert: 15 Time: 143 mins
In a nutshell: Terry Gilliam’s off-beat sci-fi fantasy about a shy bureaucrat in an Orwellian future gave De Niro a strange comic turn as the oddly named maintenance man Harry Tuttle, who moonlights as a terrorist and memorably arrives to fix the ventilation shaft in full night camouflage garb. It was the first glimpse of De Niro in full comic mode and a classic cameo in a great movie.
Genre: Drama Dir: Richard Eyre Starring: Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, Fionn Whitehead, Ben Chaplin, Jason Watkins Cert: 12 Time: 105 mins
In a nutshell: You could hardly cook up a juicier moral quandary than the one at The Children Act's heart. And cooked up is exactly what the new film from Richard Eyre (Iris, Notes on a Scandal) often feels like. Adapted by Ian McEwan from his own 2014 novel, it is a drama in which, like a Michelin-star-wannabe dish, every component feels painstakingly tweezered into place. They do rest on one impeccable, locally sourced ingredient, though: a tremendous performance from Emma Thompson, in her first lead role of substance since Saving Mr Banks (2013).

Genre: Action Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra; Starring: Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Sam Neill, Jonathan Banks, Elizabeth McGovern, Andy Nyman, Florence Pugh, Dean-Charles Chapman Cert: 15 Time: 104 mins
In a nutshell: In yet another of his post-Taken revenge thrillers, Liam Neeson plays an insurance manager who makes a strange deal witha mystery woman (Vera Farmiga) on his commuter train: identify a passenger on board “who doesn’t belong”, plant a tracking device on them, and collect a large sum of money for his efforts. Because this is a Liam Neeson movie, Michael quickly discovers that Farmiga’s scheme is far bigger than the moral dilemma she flirtatiously described, when his wife and son are threatened with abduction.

Genre: Biopic Drama Dir: Sam Taylor-Wood Cast: Aaron Johnson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Anne-Marie Duff Cert: 15 Time: 98 mins
In a nutshell: He doesn't look much like the young John Lennon, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson makes a decent fist of playing the future Beatle in his formative years in Sam Taylor-Wood's directing debut. Kristin Scott Thomas is a particular highlight as John's uptight aunt.
Genre: Fantasy Dir: Stephen Spielberg Cast: Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill, Penelope Wilton, Jemaine Clement, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall, Bill Hader. Cert: PG Time: 117 mins
In a nutshell: Charming adaptation of Roald Dahl’s much-loved children’s book starring Mark Rylance as the titular Big Friendly Giant, who abducts Sophie in the middle of the night and carries her off to giant country. Stephen Spielberg’s dreamlike picture captures Dahl’s playful humour with some groundbreaking use of motion capture technology and CGI. 
Read our 5 star review of The BFG
Genre: Thriller Dir: Alfred Hitchcock Cast: Robert Donat, Madeleine Carroll, Lucie Mannheim, Godfrey Tearle, Peggy Ashcroft, John Laurie. Cert: U Time: 86 mins
In a nutshell: An average Joe stumbles upon a plot to steal British military secrets by a shady organisation called the 39 Steps. Alfred Hitchcock’s pacey spy caper set the bar for modern entertainment films with its idiosyncratic blend of suspense and comic relief.
Genre: Drama Dir: James Marsh Cast: Colin Firth, Rachel Weisz, David Thewlis Cert: 12 Time: 102 mins
In a nutshell: The tragic story of Donald Crowhurst's bid to win the round-the-world yacht race in 1969 is ably dramatised by James Marsh, with Colin Firth digging into the man's lost soul – and giving his best performance in years. Rachel Weisz co-stars as his wife, Clare.
Read our 3 star review of Mercy
Genre: Drama Dir: Jon S. Baird Cast: Steve Coogan,John C. Reilly, Shirley Henderson, Nina, Arianda, Rufus Jones, Danny Huston. Cert: PG Time: 97 mins
In a nutshell: Laurel and Hardy tour the music halls of Britain after their Hollywood star begins to wane, along with that of the silent movie. Darker, more human portrayal than normally given to two of cinema’s greatest clowns. Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly establish an impressive partnership of their own with striking moments of light and shade.

Genre: Documentary Dir: Alex Gibney Cast: N/A Cert: 15 Time: 106 mins
In a nutshell: Reliable muckraker Alex Gibney (Taxi to the Dark Side, We Steal Secrets) takes on the abuse of power by the Catholic Church, focusing on the case of four deaf men who were victimised by the same priest in the Sixties.
Read our 4 star review of Mea Maxima Culpa
Genre: Documentary Dir: Kevin Macdonald Cast: N/A Cert: 15 Time: 120 mins
In a nutshell: Kevin Macdonald's documentary tells the life story of Whitney Houston with input – some of it cagey – from her family and friends. Although it is curiously unmoving as a memorial, there's a bombshell about her childhood buried near the end and her tragic burnout is cogently analysed.
Read our 3 star review of Whitney 
Genre: Animation Dir: Wes Anderson Cast: George Clooney (voice), Meryl Streep (voice), Bill Murray (voice) Cert: PG Time: 87 mins
In a nutshell: George Clooney voices the eponymous hero in this fantastic stop-motion animation of Roald Dahl's much-loved children's book. Director Wes Anderson finds the charm and humour in Dahl's story and adds lots of his own. This is an Anderson film with an overwhelming sense of Seventies nostalgia (think Clangers). It's a dazzlingly imaginative and poetically inflected comic caper.
Genre: Thriller Dir: Steven Soderbergh Cast: Jude Law, Rooney Mara, Channing Tatum, Catherine Zeta-Jones Cert: 15 Time: 106 mins
In a nutshell: Side Effects is set waist-deep in the moral murk of prescription-drug culture, with Jude Law as a well meaning psychiatrist testing a new depression med, and Rooney Mara as his troubled young patient-stroke-guinea pig. It begins as a sober psychological thriller, which Soderbergh ferments with a chemist's precision into a queasy Hitchcockian whodunit. Pathologically satisfying stuff.

Genre: Comedy Dir: Nisha Ganatra Cast: Emma Thompson, Mindy Kaling, Max Casella, Hugh Dancy, John Lithgow, Denis O'Hare, Reid Scott, Amy Ryan. Cert: 15 Time: 102 mins
In a nutshell: Enjoyable if slightly limp comedy about a late night talk-show host (Emma Thompson) forced to hire a female writer (Mindy Kayling) after falling ratings. Funny in parts with some satisfying shots at the increasingly annoying American talk-show scene, it always seems short of the biting satire and hateful thrill of Devil Wears Prada. 
Read our 3 star review of Late Night​
Genre: Drama Dir: Robert De Niro Cast: Robert De Niro, Chazz Palminteri, Lillo Brancato Cert: 18 Time: 141 mins
In a nutshell: A superb directorial debut from Robert De Niro who adapted Chazz Palminteri's one-character play for this gripping film. It follows an Italian–American teenager (Francis Capra) and the battle of two father figures – one his father Lorenzo (De Niro), the other a local mobster (Chazz Palminteri), fighting for influence in his life.
Genre: Drama Dir: Todd Haynes Starring: Rooney Mara, Cate Blanchett, Kyle Chandler Cert: 15 Time: 116 minutes
In a nutshell: Everything in this long-gestating adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel feels weighted to perfection. The film’s a smorgasbord of edible Fifties design which finds meaning in the smallest details. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) and her maybe-girlfriend Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) are inexorably drawn together, despite the disapproval of Carol's husband and Therese's boyfriend.  
Read our 5 star review of Carol
Genre: Drama Dir: David Fincher Cast: Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter Cert: 18 Time: 136 mins
In a nutshell: Based on Chuck Palahniuk’s novel, this gripping dark satire includes one of Brad Pitt’s best performances. He plays salesman Tyler Durden, who, along with Ed Norton’s nameless character, establishes an anti-capitalist network centred around an underground fight club. Its members meet to unleash the primal violent urges kept bottled up during the day.
Genre: Drama Dir: Mike Newell Cast: Lily James, Michiel Huisman, Glen Powell, Jessica Brown Findlay, Tom Courtenay, Penelope Wilton, Katherine Parkinson, Matthew Goode Cert: 12 Time: 124 mins
In a nutshell: Mystery, comedy and romance combine in this hearty, comforting casserole of a film, adapted by Mike Newell from the book group favourite. Lily James leads the ensemble cast as a writer unearthing wartime secrets on the island. It is a confection in every sense, but plump with natural sweetness.
Read our 4 star review of The Guernsey Literary And Potato Peel Pie Society 
Genre: Animation Dir: George Miller Cast: Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh, Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, Steve Irwin. Cert: U Time: 108 mins
In a nutshell: Endearing animation comedy about a penguin who cannot sing, crucial for finding a soul mate, but is a gnarly tap dancer. Visually dazzling, funny and with some surprisingly catchy musical numbers, Happy Feet is a guilty pleasure. 
Genre: Family Dir: Paul King Cast: Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters Cert: PG Time: 95 mins
In a nutshell: This is as warm and welcome as a hot pair of socks on a winter morning. The bear from Darkest Peru is brought beautifully to life by Ben Whishaw and the digital artists at visual effects house Framestore; it's every bit as charming as Michael Bond's original. Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins are terrific as Paddington's guardians Mr and Mrs Brown. Look out for a very game Nicole Kidman as a fanatical taxidermist.

Genre: Animation Dir: Nick Park Cast: Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston, Maisie Williams, Timothy Spall, Miriam Margolyes, Rob Brydon, Kayvan Novak, Gina Yashere, Richard Ayoade, Johnny Vegas (voices) Cert: PG Time: 89 mins
In a nutshell: When a Stone Age tribe are shooed from their valley by Bronze Age invaders, they vow to win back their home in a high-stakes football match – because, this being an Aardman film, that's exactly how it works. The stop-motion studio's imagination feels ever-so-slightly hemmed in by the underdog sports plot, but the craftsmanship is dazzling, and the film's sense of fun is enormous.
Read our 4 star review of Early Man
Genre: Drama Dir: Yorgos Lanthimos Cast: Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Alicia Silverstone. Cert: 15 Time: 121 mins
In a nutshell: Heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) has it all: a storied career, an elegant spouse (Nicole Kidman) and two cute children. But then along comes Martin (Barry Keoghan), a strange teen with some sense-defying news that sets the family to self-destruct. Hair-raising absurdism with a venomously funny streak.
Read our 5 star review of The Killing of a Sacred Deer
Genre: Thriller Dir: Alfred Hitchcock Cast: Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, Jessie Royce Landis, John Williams,Charles Vanel, Brigitte Auber. Cert: PG Time: 106 mins
In a nutshell: A reformed cat burglar (Cary Grant) must save his reputation after a spate of robberies targeting wealthy citizens. One of Hitchcock’s lesser known films, and low on his trademark suspense, but eminently watchable and stylish.
Genre: Romantic Comedy Dir: Tom Vaughan Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Cameron Diaz, Queen Latifah Cert: 12 Time: 100 mins
In a nutshell: Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz play mismatched New Yorkers – she's a workaholic, he's a slob – who meet while drowning their respective sorrows in Las Vegas and drunkenly tie the knot; before they can get a quickie divorce, however, he hits the jackpot with her quarter. Back in Manhattan, a judge decrees they stick together for six months or forfeit the three million dollars, leading to a battle of wits as each tries to trick the other and claim the dosh. Diaz, as always, is game for anything, and Kutcher is the cutest slacker you ever saw.
Genre: Comedy Dir: Declan Lowney Cast: Steve Coogan, Colm Meaney, Tim Key Cert: 15 Time: 90 mins
In a nutshell: Films based on sitcoms tend to play broader than the real series, and this feature-length outing for Steve Coogan's fading media gasbag is no exception. The plot has Alan held hostage at a radio station in Norfolk. Old friends, such as his assistant Lynn (Felicity Montagu), join in. Viewers hoping for new catchphrases will be happy, but Partridge loses his Pooterish potency when moving from talk to action.

Genre: Comedy / Crime Dir: Steven Soderbergh Cast: Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig Cert: 12 Time: 116 mins
In a nutshell: As you might expect from Steven Soderbergh, the director of Ocean's Eleven, this latest heist caper runs like clockwork: there's a small fortune to be stolen from a speedway track, and a jostling ensemble (including Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, and Daniel Craig) needed to do it. What has changed this time is the setting: blue-collar West Virginia, land of recession, is worlds away from the coastal milieus of the Ocean's franchise. Great fun.
Read our 4 star review of Logan Lucky
Genre: Drama Dir: Robert Altman Cast: David Arkin, Barbara Baxley, Ned Beatty Cert: 15 Time: 160 mins
In a nutshell: This epic follows two dozen main characters (musicians, businessmen, politicians) in the countdown to a presidential primary. Great Altman is really hard to beat, and this is where it peaks: the high masterwork of patchwork cinema from which Paul Thomas Anderson has borrowed liberally. A scintillating pageant of American weirdness, hypocrisy, hope and sadness.
Genre: Live-action animation Dir: Paul King Cast: Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Brendan Gleeson, Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi, Hugh Grant, Ben Whishaw. Cert: U Time: 104 mins
In a nutshell: So good it makes the list twice, the Paddington series is a lesson in how to put a beloved children’s book character on the big screen. In the second installment, the marmalade-loving Peruvian bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) is framed for a crime he did not commit. Irresistibly funny and beautifully shot, director Paul King comes up trumps again.

Genre: Horror/Comedy Dir: Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement Cast: Jemaine Clement, Taikia Waititi, Jonathan Brugh Cert: 15 Time: 85 min
In a nutshell: From such unpreposessing ideas as a largely plotless vampire mockumentary are desperately funny films spawned. This irresistible Kiwi offering about a quartet of bloodsuckers has at least one hilarious line a minute, and it’s amazing what legs the basic joke has.
Read our 4 star review of What We Do in the Shadows
Genre: Drama Dir: Morten Tyldum Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode Cert: 12 Time: 112 mins
In a nutshell: This film gives a fine account of mathematician Alan Turing by juggling three time frames: the school years, the Enigma-cracking mission at Bletchley Park years, and the persecuted aftermath. Benedict Cumberbatch is compelling as Turing and cracks open an imaginary window onto the genius's torment, though the script adopts a proper attitude towards what should stay private.

Genre: Drama Dir: Barry Jenkins Cast: KiKi Layne, tephan James, Colman Domingo, Teyonah, Parris, Michael Beach, Dave Franco, Diego Luna, Regina King. Cert: 15 Time: 117 mins
In a nutshell: Barry Jenkins's follow up to the Oscar winning Moonlight premiered at the London Film Festival, and follows the joy and despair of a young black couple in 1950s New York City when Fonny (James) is wrongly incarcerated and Tish works to free her husband before their child is born. 
Read our 5 star review of If Beale Street Could Talk
Genre: Drama Dir: Gus Van Sant Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara Cert: 15 Time: 114 min
In a nutshell: Joaquin Phoenix plays the tetraplegic, alcoholic cartoonist John Callahan, in Gus Van Sant's Oscar-baity vehicle about addiction and recovery. He transforms physically for the role, of course, but the film depends just as much on how recognisably Phoenix-y he is – what humour, energy, humanity and understanding he pours into his performance.
Read our 3 star review of Don't Worry he Won't Get Far on Foot
Genre: Drama Dir: Kenneth Lonergan Cast: Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler Cert: 15 Time: 134 mins
In a nutshell: Lonergan, the great American dramatist behind Margaret and Gangs of New York, picked up well-deserved Oscar nods for Best Screenplay and Best Direction with this story of broken lives in Massachusetts. Casey Affleck gives an intensely sorrowful performance as a man tasked with caring for his teenage nephew (Chandler) after his brother's death.

Genre: Comedy Dir: Ron Howard Cast: Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon. Cert: PG Time: 105 mins
In a nutshell: Based on Dr Seuss’s classic children’s book. The Grinch plots to steal Christmas from the insufferably quaint townsfolk of Whoville. Ron Howard’s quirky adaptation gives Jim Carey one of his weirdest, most well-suited roles - 105 minutes of boundless hyperactivity, impressions and slapstick. Heaven or hell?
Genre: Drama Dir: John Crowley Cast: Saoirse Ronan, Domhnall Gleeson, Michael Zegen Cert: 15 Year: 2015
In a nutshell: Saoirse Ronan stars as a young woman forced to move from Fifties rural Ireland to New York, in Nick Hornby’s powerfully understated adaptation of Colm Tóibín’s coming-of-age novel. It won the 2015 Bafta for Best British Film, while Ronan earned a nod at both the Oscars and the Golden Globes.

Genre: Drama Dir: Luca Guadagnino Cast: Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson Cert: 15 Time: 122 mins
In a nutshell: Come for the Olympic-grade dad-dancing (courtesy of a never-better Fiennes) and stay for a serpentine comic sex thriller, dripping with glamour and intrigue. Guadagnino (I Am Love) reworks Jacques Deray’s La Piscine with Swinton as an androgynous rock goddess and an impossibly cool supporting cast.
Genre: Drama Dir: Martin Scorsese Cast: Andrew Garfield, Liam Neeson, Adam Driver Cert: 15 Time: 157 mins
In a nutshell: Martin Scorsese’s monumental epic follows the search for a devout Portuguese Jesuit priest (Andrew Garfield) who has gone native in 17th-century Japan. Stunning.
Read our 5 star review of Silence
Genre: Documentary Dir: Malik Bendjelloul Cert: 12 Time: 86 mins
In a nutshell: The late Malik Bendjelloul's film is one of the most uplifting documentaries in recent memory. It tells the story of a Detroit folk singer called Sixto Rodriguez who became a bigger star in South Africa in the Seventies than Elvis Presley. The lilting, honeyed soundtrack, made up of Rodriguez's own songs, makes his relative obscurity here seem all the more puzzling. Happily, this film attempts to set that right.
Read our 4 star review of Searching for Sugarman
Genre: Drama Dir: Robert Mulligan Cast: Gregory Peck, John Megna, Frank Overton Cert: PG Time: 124 mins
In a nutshell: Deftly adapted from Harper Lee's novel, this poignant coming-of-age tale is considered one the finest dramas of all time. Set in the Thirties in a racially charged Alabama, the story is seen through the eyes of a young white girl whose father (an Oscar-winning Gregory Peck) decides to defend a black man (Brock Peters) charged with rape.
Genre: Fantasy Dir: Guillermo Del Toro Cast: Ivana Baquero, Doug Jones, Sergi Lopez Cert: 15 Time: 199 mins
In a nutshell: The real and the imaginary are brought together in striking fashion in Guillermo del Toro’s wonderfully inventive award-winning film. Set in Spain five years after the Civil War, the tale comes via 10-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who goes to live with her new stepfather, the vicious Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). There, she meets the faunlike god creature Pan, who gives her three challenges. Magical.
Genre: Drama Dir: Anton Corbijn Cast: Sam Riley, Samantha Morton Cert: 15 Time: 119 mins
In a nutshell: Sam Riley (SS-GB) stars as troubled Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis in this moving portrait of the seminal Eighties post-punk band. Director Anton Corbijn is as acclaimed for his photography as his filmmaking, and it shows; this black-and-white biopic is a gorgeous piece of visual art.
Read our review of Control
Genre: Drama Dir: Ridley Scott Cast: Keith Carradine, Harvey Keitel Cert: PG Time: 96 mins
In a nutshell: Ridley Scott’s debut, and the kind of exercise he ought to revisit: based on a Joseph Conrad short story, it’s about the lifelong quarrel between two Napoleonic officers (Harvey Keitel, Keith Carradine), whose frequent skirmishes are brilliantly authentic.
Genre: Spy Thriller Dir: Tomas Alfredson Cast: Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Benedict Cumberbatch Cert: 15 Time: 124 mins
In a nutshell: This superb adaptation of John le Carré's brilliant, intricate Cold War spy novel is a triumph. The espionage drama follows the hunt for a Soviet double agent at the top of the British secret service, with Gary Oldman spearheading the excellent ensemble cast. It's funny, seductive and suspenseful.
Read our 5 star review of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 
Genre: Action Dir: Ben Wheatley Cast: Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer, Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy Cert: 15 Time: 89 mins
In a nutshell: This breathless shoot-'em-up takes place almost entirely inside a warehouse in Boston, in 1978, where an IRA delegation are collecting a shipment of assault rifles from a South African gun-runner and his seamy associates. When the deal goes south, the film descends into a bloodbath, but one that retains excitement, tension and purpose.
Read our 4 star review of Free Fire
Genre: Romance Dir: Anne Fontaine Cast: Audrey Tautou, Benoît Poelvoorde, Alessandro Nivola Cert: 12 Time: 105 mins
In a nutshell: Audrey Tautou single-handedly elevates what would otherwise be a dutiful, sometimes plodding biopic. The story traces Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel's life from childhood in an orphanage, includes her years as a struggling tavern singer and deals with her love affairs with rich suitors (Benoit Poelvoorde, Alessandro Nivola). It leaves her at the dawn of her stellar career. Tautou offsets her cuteness with square-jawed determination, a sulky demeanour and a will of iron.
Read our 3 star review of Coco Before Chanel
Genre: Tragedy Dir: Justin Kurzel Cast: Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, David Thewlis Cert: 15 Time: 110 mins
In a nutshell: With its blockbuster battle scenes and spine-tingling staging, is this as good as Shakespeare on film gets? This adaptation of the tragedy from Australian film-maker Justin Kurzel is raw and visceral, and its poetry really gets to you. Mostly, though, it’s built around powerful performances from Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.
Genre: Romantic Comedy Dir: Ben Palmer Cast: Lake Bell, Simon Pegg, Rory Kinnear Cert: 15 Time: 88 mins
In a nutshell: Ben Palmer's likeable, and perfectly British, romcom (that isn't really very romantic) stars a sizzling Simon Pegg and Lake Bell. Nancy (Bell) plays a Bridget Jones-type character. On the way to her parents' 40th wedding anniversary, however, she is mistakenly identified as the blind date whom Jack (Pegg) has been waiting for at Waterloo station. Nancy goes along with it and they wind up having a ball.
Genre: Action Dir: Michael Mann Cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight Cert: 15 Time: 171 mins
In a nutshell: Bringing together the irresistible pairing of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Heat is tautly plotted and superbly acted thriller. Its premise is simple: a dedicated LAPD cop (Pacino) is on the trail of a professional bank robber (De Niro, his last great role), who lives by the callous motto "Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds flat." 
Genre: Fantasy Dir: Brian Desmond Hurst Cast: Alastair Sim, Kathleen Harrison, Mervyn Johns, Michael Hordern Cert: U Time: 83 mins
In a nutshell: Brian Desmond Hurst's touching film is still the definitive film version of Charles Dickens's beloved story. Alastair Sim is a magisterial Scrooge, faced with the ghost of old partner Marley (Michael Hordern), and those of Christmases past, present and "yet to come".
Genre: Romance Dir: Darren Aronofsky Cast: Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, Marcello Bezina Cert: 15 Time: 96 mins
In a nutshell: Darren Aronofsky had his work cut out with this metaphysical melodrama about the quest for eternal life. Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman star in a visually resplendent time-travelling three-pronged narrative. The leap-frogging in time is a little bewildering.
Genre: Comedy Dir: Maren Ade Cast: Peter Simonischek, Sandra Hüller, Michael Wittenborn Cert: 15 Time: 162 mins
In a nutshell: The best comedy of 2016 was also the most unlikely: it’s nearly three hours long, and set in the world of German management consultancy. When a depressed go-getter (Sandra Hüller) finds her work interrupted by ridiculous pranks from her own father (Peter Simonischek), healing gusts of laughter repair their relationship.

Genre: Drama Dir: Sergio Leone Cast: Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern Cert: 18 Time: 223 mins
In a nutshell: The much-lauded director of Westerns, Sergio Leone, gives us an epic saga of gangland America. Charting the lives of New York mobsters Noodles (Robert De Niro) and Max (James Woods) over four decades, the narrative is compelling and De Niro's controlled performance makes this a classic.
Genre: Drama Dir: John Lee Hancock Cast: Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch Cert: 12 Time: 113 mins
In a nutshell: Between 1955 and 1984, a milkshake mixer salesman turned McDonald’s from a California burger stand into the Godzilla of fast-food brands. This bright, absorbing biopic, starring Michael Keaton in his first lead role since winning the Best Actor Oscar for Birdman, shows how he did it.

Genre: Documentary Dir: Alex Gibney Cert: 15 Time: 111 mins
In a nutshell: On a summer's night in 1994, six men were gunned down in the small Northern Irish town of Loughinisland as they watched an Ireland Vs Italy World Cup match in the pub. Despite the fact that police quickly found the getaway car and weapons used in the murders, no-one was ever charged. In this documentary, Oscar-winner Alex Gibney explores the unsolved case and allegations that police colluded with the killers. 
Genre: Comedy Dir: Sofia Coppola Cast: Israel Broussard, Katie Chang, Taissa Farmiga, Claire Julien, Georgia Rock, Emma Watson, Leslie Mann. Cert: 15 Time: 90 mins
In a nutshell: Sofia Coppola's biting and stylish comic drama follows a group of Los Angeles high schoolers who decide to burgle the homes of their idols (Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom and Lindsay Lohan). The film is based on a true story, as detailed in Vanity Fair, but its incisive take on celebrity culture is so timely that if it hadn't happened, someone would have had to make it up. Emma Watson is among the stars.  
Read our 4 star review of The Bling Ring
Genre: War Dir: Kathryn Bigelow Cast: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty Cert: 15  Time: 128 mins
In a nutshell: The Hurt Locker has been talked up as that rarest of things: a film about the war in Iraq that doesn’t preach or pontificate, that isn’t instant box-office poison. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, whose track record includes Point Break (1991) and Strange Days (1995), it’s a super-sharp, nerve-shredding thriller that reveals more about the realities of contemporary military conflict than most documentaries, is as fissile and explosive as a Transformers movie, and delivers a powerful and often haunting critique of American society both at home and as its faultlines are expressed abroad. 
Read our 4 star review of The Hurt Locker
Genre: Biographical drama Dir: Brian Hegleland Cast: Tom Hardy, Emily Browning, Colin, Morgan, David Thewlis, Duffy, Christopher Eccleston. Cert: 18 Time: 131 mins
In a nutshell: Emerging from the well-mined cinematic pit of London’s most famous gangster duo, this is a fast and loose take from writer-director Brian Helgeland, who centres his rise and fall story in the brother’s wildly differing personalities. Tom Hardy takes a dual role as Ronnie and Reggie Kray, the gangster twins who rose from boxing careers cut short by trouble with the law to become, briefly, almost-respectable businessmen. Long and muddled but with some enjoyable moments.
Genre: Thiller Dir: Lenny Abrahamson Cast: Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, William H Macy, Joan Allen Cert: 15 Time: 118 mins
In a nutshell: This disturbing – but ultimately uplifting – drama won Brie Larson both a Bafta and an Oscar for her portrayal of a brutalised mother, imprisoned for years in a garden shed with her 5-year-old son. ​Based on Emma Donoghue's best-selling novel, it's a powerful tale of love and hope in the face of almost unimaginable cruelty.

Genre: Action Dir: Curtis Hanson Cast: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James, Cromwell, David Strathairn, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito. Cert: 18 Time: 138 mins
In a nutshell:  Three cops try to solve a series of killings: Guy Pearce's ambitious young hot-shot, Kevin Spacey's cynical celebrity, and Russell Crowe's hot-headed bruiser. Lesser men than Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson would have baulked at adapting LA Confidential for the screen. This is a film with sex, drugs, death, obsession and corruption coursing through its veins.

Genre: Drama Dir: Joel Schumacher Cast: Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Mary-Louise, Parker, Anthony LaPaglia, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis. Cert: 15 Time: 121 mins
In a nutshell: Based on John Grisham’s novel of the same name, Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones face off in this gritty legal drama about a young boy who comes across dangerous information about a prominent politician. Well-paced and well-acted, but a bit old-school and predictable.
Genre: Comedy Dir: Chris Morris Starring: Riz Ahmed, Kayvan Novak Cert: 15 Time: 97 minutes
In a nutshell: Satirist Chris Morris inspired a miasma of condemnation back in 2010 for having the temerity to explore the funny side of terrorism. But his boldness paid off – Four Lions is an explosively funny farce charting the journey of five hapless British would-be jihadist bombers, as they plan a mass suicide attack.

Genre: Drama Dir: Jeff Nichols Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland, Sam Shepard, Reese Witherspoon. Cert: 12 Time: 130 mins
In a nutshell: A wholly pleasant, Mark Twain-ish coming-of-age fable written and directed by Jeff Nichols and starring a resurgent Matthew McConaughey. Two 14-year-old boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan, unearthed in Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland, making his screen debut), discover a flat-bottomed skiff stranded high in a tree, on a small island in the Mississippi Delta.

Genre: Action Dir: Martin McDonagh Cast: Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waits, Abbie Cornish, Olga Kurylenko. Cert: 15 Time: 110 mins
In a nutshell: Martin McDonagh’s comic thriller Seven Psychopaths is a film about films. An aspiring screenwriter gets caught up in the crime underworld when a friend abducts a powerful gangster’s pet. The script is infused with Tarantino tricks: the sly melding of violence and irony, topless hookers, casual misogyny, slashed throats and exploding heads. This film tries to satirise and sell those things at the same time, but such strategies might have felt cleverer five or 10 years ago, but since then we’ve had a surfeit of artful incongruity in cinema. The film still has just enough verbal dazzle and structural daring to be worth seeing. But only just.

Genre: Drama Dir: Noel Langley Cast: Hildegard Knef, Donald Wolfit, Terence Morgan. Cert: PG Time: 82 mins
In a nutshell: The inspiration for a thousand terrible magicians. In the bohemia of mid-19th-century Paris, the bare-footed beauty Trilby falls under the influence of Svengali. When hypnotised by Svengali, Trilby can sing wonderfully. Tragedy follows. 
Genre: Crime Dir: Steven Soderbergh Cast: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts. Cert: 12  Time: 117 mins
In a nutshell: Star-studded crime caper about a group of eleven specialists brought together by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) to rob three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Funny and fast-paced enough to forgive the over-wrought suspense and silly score.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inside the $125 million former mansion of William Randolph Hearst</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The former estate of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst is on sale (again), and at $125 million, the estate is a “bargain.”
Despite its beauty, acreage and history, the house has been a hard sell. Originally listed for $195 million several years ago, its price was cut to $135 million in 2018 before being cut further.
Described by the estate agent, The Agency, as “among the most unique trophy properties in the United States,” the Beverly House was not only home to Hearst and Marion Davies, but was the honeymoon love nest for Jacqueline and John F. Kennedy — and served as JFK’s Presidential Election Headquarters.
Film buffs will recognize it as the setting for scenes in both “The Godfather” and “The Bodyguard.”
Located three blocks from the Beverly Hills Hotel, the estate, designed by Gordan Kaufmann, features 18 bedrooms, a near Olympic-size swimming pool, tennis court, two screening rooms, a commercial-grade kitchen, terraces to accommodate 400 or more guests and grounds to accommodate more than 1,000 people, according to the listing.
It also comes complete with four security gates and several perimeter housing structures.
The Beverly House “stands as an emblem of Hollywood’s Golden Era,” the listing boasts. Inside are floor-to-ceiling windows, a two-story paneled library a formal living room with its 22-foot-high arched ceiling, spa and a Dennis Abbe mural.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the freelance world of British jazz, a band that manages to stay in existence long enough to record its second album is something of a rarity. But these seven musicians virtually grew up together, musically at any rate, having met at college and in late-night jam sessions at Ronnie Scott’s. What keeps them together is the music of their leader: trombonist and composer Tom Green.
With trumpet, trombone, two saxophones, piano, bass and drums, the resources are limited, but in the hands of an imaginative and ingenious composer such as Green, the possibilities seem endless. There’s so much going on that it’s best not to try following who’s doing what. Just take in the changing sound colours and melodic patterns.
It’s easy to forget that this seamless flow comes from seven individuals working as a minutely exact ensemble. There are improvised solos too, of course, and moments when you can’t tell whether what you’re hearing is improvised or part of the score. That’s when you can be sure that, although they’re all quite young still, this is a band with a history behind it – and, we hope, more to come.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season's finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race," is in her house. 
For a drag queen, that's unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world — and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
"We've really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days," Aquaria told Business Insider, "where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home."
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going — and attempt to recoup some lost income.
"I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress — in theory — when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized," Aquaria said.
But she noted that that's not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience — and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans — is a difficult task. 
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow "Drag Race" stars, has been competing in "Werq The World Battle Royale." It's a livestream of the self-described "largest drag show on the planet" — and, according to its website, all funds raised go to "displaced local drag entertainers around the globe." The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of "Human Touch."
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of "Drag Race" — fan-favorite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12's queens will experience life post-"Drag Race."
As a season of "Drag Race" airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
"Drag Race" also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience — one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
"Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me," Aquaria said. "Getting to share my experiences on 'Drag Race' with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space."
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won't get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won't get the post-season visibility — and monetary opportunities — that other competitors have benefited from.
"I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I'd won," Aquaria said. "So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it's really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try."
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
"I don't know if it's just 'cause I'm online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls," Aquaria said. "Because if they can't build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being."
And this season — which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations —  now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn't made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes "some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable." She said that potentially delaying the finale — and keeping everyone "on the edge of our seats" — would be a preferable alternative.
"I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there," Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there's been one constant.
"It's wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they're at a drag show. It's certainly an extremely surreal time," Aquaria said. "I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who's been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it's been, how interesting it's been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support."

For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there’s been one constant.
“It’s wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they’re at a drag show. It’s certainly an extremely surreal time,” Aquaria said. “I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who’s been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it’s been, how interesting it’s been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season’s finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” is in her house.
For a drag queen, that’s unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world – and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’ve really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days,” Aquaria told Business Insider, “where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home.”
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going – and attempt to recoup some lost income.
“I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress – in theory – when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized,” Aquaria said.
But she noted that that’s not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience – and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans – is a difficult task.
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow “Drag Race” stars, has been competing in “Werq The World Battle Royale.” It’s a livestream of the self-described “largest drag show on the planet” – and, according to its website, all funds raised go to “displaced local drag entertainers around the globe.” The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of “Human Touch.”
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of “Drag Race” – fan-favorite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12’s queens will experience life post-“Drag Race.”
As a season of “Drag Race” airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
“Drag Race” also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience – one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
“Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me,” Aquaria said. “Getting to share my experiences on ‘Drag Race’ with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space.”
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won’t get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won’t get the post-season visibility – and monetary opportunities – that other competitors have benefited from.
“I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I’d won,” Aquaria said. “So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it’s really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try.”
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
“I don’t know if it’s just ’cause I’m online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls,” Aquaria said. “Because if they can’t build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being.”
And this season – which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations – now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn’t made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes “some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable.” She said that potentially delaying the finale – and keeping everyone “on the edge of our seats” – would be a preferable alternative.
“I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there,” Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there’s been one constant.
“It’s wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they’re at a drag show.

And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Comedy is dominating among movie and TV viewers as people look for laughs while social distancing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At-home audiences are looking for a good laugh as people practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The talent agency UTA's data group UTA IQ, along with the research firm SightX, conducted a representative survey of nearly 1,100 people across the US, ages 18 to 54, who had been social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak from April 4 to April 11.
The survey found that 51% of respondents were watching comedy TV shows during the outbreak, the leading genre.
Drama (39%), action/adventure (33%), and news (33%) followed among TV viewers. Family came in at 27%.
"A third of people still rely on TV to get their news, and family-friendly content is important with so many children home 24/7," the survey said. 
The popularity of family television is good for Disney Plus, which was the streaming service with the highest level of "intent to add" among survey respondents, at 37%, followed by the Disney-operated Hulu at 33% and the upcoming HBO Max at 31%.
HBO Max was the leading service among those that recently launched or are launching this year, such as the mobile-only Quibi and NBCUniversal's Peacock. 
The chart below breaks down each TV genre:
The comedy genre also dominated among movie viewers, with 59% of respondents saying they were consuming comedy movies while home. This it notable considering comedies have struggled in theaters in recent years while blockbuster superhero movies dominate the box office.
But only 24% of respondents said they were watching superhero/comic-book movies while social distancing, suggesting audiences prefer a spectacle on the big screen while comedies provide comfort at home.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar has appealed to prominent film and sports persons to help spread awareness on Covid-19 and remove the stigma attached to it. Sudhakar spoke to several film personalities such as Ravichandran, Sumalatha Ambareesh (also a Lok Sabha member), Puneeth Rajkumar, Upendra, Shruthi, Ragini Dwivedi, Prem, Vasuki Vaibhav, Pawan Wodeyar, music director Arjun Janya, Abhishek Ambareesh, producer Rockline Venkatesh, among others and requested them to be a part of the awareness campaign besides asking people to take precautionary measures. The Minister, who is under home quarantine after he had come in contact with a video journalist of a private new channel who had tested positive for Covid-19, also spoke to sports person Anil Kumble and former World Billiards champion Pankaj Advani. He also requested celebrities to participate in a documentary video that is being made as a part of the Medical Education Department’s efforts to raise awareness on Covid-19. Sudhakar is also set to speak to Darshan, Yash, Sudeep and Rakshith Shetty. Meanwhile, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa released a video song written and directed by noted Kannada film director Yogaraj Bhat on Saturday. The song is dedicated to the Covid-19 warriors, including ASHA workers, medical and para-medical staff and the police among others. Music director Arjun Janya has composed the song and it is sung by singer Vijay Prakash.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tributes paid to top QC found dead at his Glasgow home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tributes have been paid to the QC and civil rights activist Derek Ogg who has died at the age of 65.
His career spanned work as a Crown prosecutor and latterly as a defence advocate.
Mr Ogg campaigned for the 2018 law which automatically pardoned gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal.
Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Ogg was a "brilliant advocate and a truly lovely man".
In a Twitter post, the first minister added: "It was always a pleasure for me to hear from him on issues he felt strongly about, and I will miss his wisdom and good sense."
Gordon Jackson QC, dean of Faculty of Advocates, said: "All of us who knew Derek Ogg are deeply saddened by his passing.
"He was a marvellous advocate but more than that he was a fierce campaigner for his beliefs both on a personal and professional level. He will be greatly missed by everyone at the faculty."
Police Scotland said Mr Ogg was found by officers in his Glasgow home on Friday evening and there "would appear to be no suspicious circumstances" surrounding his death.
When Nicola Sturgeon offered an unequivocal apology to gay men convicted of sexual offences at Holyood in 2017, Mr Ogg was in the gallery watching.
Speaking on Radio Scotland that day, he said was a "wonderful day".
He added: "It's Scotland at peace with itself and it is a reconciliation between the people in Scotland who are alive and the families of gay people who are dead, who were prosecuted, convicted, simply because of the gender of the person they loved or fancied.
"You can't underestimate the scars that leaves on people. I've never been convicted of such an offence but the fact is that the law was there and could have been used, I could have been arrested.
"I was at the very beginning of my legal career - my career would have been destroyed. An apology, together with the pardons bill, is appropriate."
Fellow QC Tony Graham, stable director of Optimum Advocates, of which Mr Ogg was a member, said: "There was far more to Derek than his time in wig and gown.
"Whilst Derek was one of most well-read individuals one could encounter, he was also a man who was full of fun, compassion and ready to assist anyone - colleague or not - in any way he could.
"He provided an ear to those who needed his wisdom, could put a smile on the face of the sullen, inspire a laugh from those engrossed in sadness, and create a conversation in even the solemnest of rooms. Often, he did all of these things in a self-deprecating way."
He added: "We have lost not just a committed and talented colleague, but a loyal and generous friend. Glasgow High Court will be an unfortunately quieter place without Derek as he leaves a void uneasy to fill."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' actor Hafthór Björnsson breaks deadlifting world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an electric display of power, Icelandic strongman and Game of Thrones actor Hafþór (Hafthor) Björnsson broke the deadlift world record Saturday, picking up 501 kilograms (nearly 1,105 pounds) of weight.
Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka The Mountain on Game of Thrones, made his deadlift world record attempt on Saturday, which was broadcast live on ESPN and streamed on YouTube. The previous record was set at 500 kilograms (about 1,102 pounds) by Eddie Hall in 2016.
The record-breaking lift is incredible to watch. His form from the start to the end is spectacular and his lockout at the top is uncharacteristically stable. Many lifters would wobble when attempting a personal record, but the 31-year-old looks like a rock.
The lifting event took place in Iceland, which with its small population of just 364,000, has been operating on lighter social distancing measures than other European countries. (Gatherings of more than 20 are banned through Monday; it's unclear exactly how many attended this event, but in footage, the gym looks sparsely populated.) The country has recorded only 10 COVID-19 deaths; Iceland implemented mass testing and contact tracing early on. Before Björnsson took the stage, event commentators described the attempt as something to look forward to amid the coronavirus crisis.
Before hitting the record, Björnsson warmed up by lifting 420 kilograms (roughly 926 pounds) and 465 kilograms (approximately 1,025 pounds), which means he pulled up a grand total of 1,386 kilograms (nearly 3,056 pounds) over three rounds that day.
After breaking the world record and taking a few minutes to kiss his wife, catch his breath, and cool down, Björnsson said in an interview that he was thankful he had the opportunity to attempt this record despite everything that's going on in the world. 
"Not only did I pull this incredible weight, but I also just feel great afterwards," he said, noting that he didn't get any injuries. "I believe today I could have done more but what's the point? I'm happy with this."
Björnsson also holds the world record for the elephant bar deadlift, which is the same lift but with a longer barbell, and won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: Icelandic actor and strongman Hafthor Bjornsson set a world record for the deadlift on Saturday when he lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kg) at Thor's Power Gym in Iceland.
Bjornsson, best known for his portrayal of Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, broke the record previously held by Briton Eddie Hall who in 2016 became the first man to lift 500 kg.
The event was streamed live on ESPN https://twitter.com/espn/status/1256627646106079234?s=19 and Bjornsson, 31, lifted the barbell that was bending and straining under the weights, holding it for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">He really is The Mountain! 6ft 9ins Game of Thrones star Hafþór Björnsson breaks the world deadlifting record by lifting 1,104lbs - and thinks he could have shifted MORE if he'd had a crowd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson has broken the world deadlift record at an event held in Iceland.
Incredible footage shows the 31-year-old actor lifting a whopping 1,104 pounds (501 kg) off the ground inside Thor's Power Gym in Reykjavík on Saturday.
Björnsson  - who is best known for playing Ser Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane on the hit HBO series - has now smashed a record previously set by Briton Eddie Hall. 
Back in 2016,  Hall made international headlines after he lifted 1,102 pounds (500 kg). 
Björnsson's deadlift was streamed live on ESPN Saturday, with footage showing him lifting a barbell that was bending and straining under the massive amount of weights. 
The star held the barbell for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
The event took place without a crowd, due to current restrictions on large gatherings that have been put in place due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
In Iceland, no more than 20 people can currently gather in one place. 
Björnsson only completed the deadlift in the company of his doctor, referee and film crew.  
Afterward he told ESPN: 'I'm obviously speechless..'I'm over the moon.'
Björnsson even bragged that he could possibly lift even more weight if he had a crowd. 
He previously told the New York Post that he performs 'maybe 10 percent better in a competition — the crowd gives you that adrenaline rush that you need'.
But the strongman was simply happy to take the world record.  
He stated on Saturday: 'I'm standing here, tall, feeling good, no injuries. I'm healthy as well. I believe today I could have done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this.'
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.
 He played 'The Mountain' - a famous knight loyal to the Lannisters - on Game of Thrones between seasons four and eight. His character was killed in the penultimate episode of the series.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The betrayal of Harry Dunn: HARRY COLE reveals the full shameful story of the Foreign Office's incompetence and double-dealing in letting the teen's US killer off – and a letter to the PM from the dead boy's twin brother</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary about life in the Foreign Office, the head of the Diplomatic Service, Sir Simon McDonald, made it clear that he relished his position of power. 
'Diplomacy is the art of letting other people have your way,' he mischievously explained, adding that the aim was to make others 'feel they've been taken into your confidence, but, in the end, without actually telling them anything'. 
One reviewer of the BBC series in 2018 described Sir Simon as 'oozing not just poise but considerable self-satisfaction'. However, that poise suddenly seems to have abandoned the career diplomat in charge of 14,000 public servants whose job it is to smooth Britain's passage through the world and to look after our citizens' interests. 
For Sir Simon, 59, has become embroiled in controversy over the Government's failure to get justice for the parents of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn, who was killed in a road crash in Northamptonshire last summer.
The other person involved was Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official. She claimed diplomatic immunity from prosecution and returned to America despite later being charged with causing death by dangerous driving. 
Sir Simon is now accused of misleading Parliament. Last month he gave evidence to the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, saying that Foreign Office (FO) staff had told police investigating the 19-year-old's death that they could not arrest the American. 
Two days later, he was forced to write to the committee saying no such instruction was given. But today a leaked email reveals that FO staff did inform police that they could not arrest her. 
This hugely embarrassing U-turn was the latest twist in the tragedy about which The Mail on Sunday has broken a string of exclusive stories. These have suggested that Harry's family has been scandalously let down by the FO and they have also questioned the legitimacy of Mrs Sacoolas's claim to diplomatic immunity. 
Sir Simon's humiliating volte-face happened after senior FO colleagues realised that his earlier statement contradicted evidence presented by them to the High Court in an upcoming legal challenge by Harry's family on the circumstances around Mrs Sacoolas's abscondment. 
A legal source said: 'He nearly blew the whole defence - and might still have yet.' It also comes as The Mail on Sunday reveals that Harry's twin brother, Niall, has written to Boris Johnson imploring him to meet the family and take charge of the case. Niall says that watching his parents 'go through this torture is just awful'. 
He adds that 'anyone can see that the Foreign Office has made a mess of this' and urges the Government to tell the truth. We can also reveal that an email sent by the FO to Northamptonshire Police six days after the fatal crash outside RAF Croughton last August seemingly contradicts Sir Simon's statement and explicitly stated that Mrs Sacoolas was above the law.
Dear Prime Minister, 
I want to issue a direct plea to you. Please Mr Johnson, my parents are having a terrible time. They have asked to meet you a number of times and you have refused so far, saying you want Mr Raab to deal with it. But we worry he has lost control of this scandal. 
I love and miss Harry. I am sick and tired of seeing my mum and dad suffering. It was bad enough losing Harry. But watching them go through this torture is just awful. It’s just cruel. 
Please get involved in our case. Anyone can see that the Foreign Office has made a mess of this. Please get a grip of Mr Raab and our case, come and tell us the truth and what you are going to do to fix things. 
We are not the dirt at the bottom of the Government’s shoes. We are UK citizens and we have the right to know the truth. 
Please, I beg you. 
Niall Dunn
Having received this advice, the police said they felt obliged to end their investigation into the status of the American mother-of-three. For their part, Harry's family complain about 'interference' in the case from the highest levels of Government and about confusion on whether Mrs Sacoolas had immunity. 
This allowed her, they say, 'with the blessing of the Foreign Office, to get on the next flight out of Britain'. With the subsequent row having damaged relations between the British and US governments, it is clear that politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are desperate to reach a compromise. 
That is why the clumsy behaviour of the head of the FO has not been at all helpful. Although the Prime Minister asked the White House for Mrs Sacoolas to return to Britain for questioning, US President Donald Trump has been intransigent. 
He has simply said he would 'see what we can come up with, so there can be some healing'. No wonder Harry's parents described Mr Trump's attitude as 'oafish' and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's handling of the case 'cold and strange'. 
Throughout this whole story, there has been official obfuscation. The Mail on Sunday has discovered several details the authorities have been reluctant to admit. For example, US government officials were present at the only interview that Mrs Sacoolas had with police, the day after the fatal collision. 
And that FO staff initially told their American counterparts that she did not have immunity from prosecution, only to change their mind after advice from 'US State Department lawyers'. 
To make matters worse, the FO asked Northamptonshire Police to delay telling Harry's family that Mrs Sacoolas had absconded to America, so they could 'get their ducks in a row'. 
What is now clear is that the FO told Detective Inspector Louise Hemingway in an email on September 2 – six days after the crash – that Mrs Sacoolas, 43, had diplomatic immunity. 
As a result, police felt hamstrung and didn't investigate her status further. The email came three days after Ministers were told during a phone call with the US Embassy 'that US State Department lawyers take the view' that Mrs Sacoolas had immunity. 
Last night, Harry's father Tim said: 'We still do not have the full picture. But Sir Simon McDonald's evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee was not the truth. How can the country's leading diplomat mislead Parliament so badly?'
With little chance of Mrs Sacoolas ever returning to Britain, the family launched a crowd-funded judicial review into the handling of the case by both the FO and the police. 
Ultimately, they hope to prove Mrs Sacoolas's claims of immunity to be unlawful. Undoubtedly, the review will look in detail at all the actions of FO staff immediately after the fatal crash. 
What is not disputed is that Mrs Sacoolas, who had been in Britain for only three weeks, was driving her Volvo XC90 on the wrong side of the B4031 at 8.21pm on Tuesday, August 27 last year, and was involved in a head-on collision with Harry. 
She admitted later being at fault. The teenager died from his injuries. Mrs Sacoolas passed a breathtest that evening and was allowed home. At noon the following day, Det Insp Hemingway visited Mrs Sacoolas and her husband at the couple's rented home, where she found them with a US Air Force lawyer and two officials from the US State Department. 
During their conversation, Det Insp Hemingway noted that Mrs Sacoolas said she had no plans to leave Britain. Nor was there any mention of diplomatic immunity. However, later that day, Northamptonshire Police were in contact with Scotland Yard's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection squad and were told Mrs Sacoolas had 'diplomatic status'. 
The convention of diplomatic immunity dates back centuries – there are about 23,000 people in the UK with the status under the 1961 Vienna Convention. It means foreign diplomats and their families cannot be prosecuted for a crime. But they are expected to obey their host country's laws and the FO can ask a foreign government to waive immunity if it is appropriate. 
With regard RAF Croughton, there is an intriguing history concerning diplomatic immunity. In the 1990s, Washington requested permission – which was granted by London – for 200 of its agents and officials to be allowed diplomatic immunity while posted to the US listening station. 
There was one caveat: the Americans would not be beyond British criminal liability for anything outside of their official duties. However, no mention was made of spouses – something, in respect of the Harry Dunn case, that Dominic Raab has called an 'anomaly'. 
Against this background, two days after the crash, the FO told their American counterparts that they did not believe Mrs Sacoolas had immunity. Yet, on August 30, Ministers were told that while State Department lawyers believed there were limits to the immunity for workers at RAF Croughton, these did not extend to their dependants. 
Understandably, Whitehall officials regarded this as against the spirit of the agreements and warned Mr Raab's office of 'unpalatable headlines' should Mrs Sacoolas leave the country. 
Washington then sent a formal diplomatic note to London demanding that Mrs Sacoolas should not be arrested. Meanwhile, in Northamptonshire, Det Insp Hemingway received an email on September 2 from the FO Protocol Office.
It said: 'Following consultation with the US Embassy, we are going to proceed with a formal request to the US government to seek a waiver of the immunity held by Anne Sacoolas.' The note arrived just before the detective's first meeting with Harry's grieving family. 
Despite Harry's mother Charlotte asking 'She [Mrs Sacoolas] won't be allowed to leave the country, will she?', the police officer made no mention of the diplomatic wrangling that had been going on between London and Washington. 
There was only a vague reference to 'complications', as DI Hemingway told them: 'I have been to see the driver and there are no plans for her to leave the country.' But she also admitted that police were powerless to stop her if she tried. 
Presciently, Harry's father commented: 'I am concerned that it is an American citizen.' He was right to be concerned. Officials from the US and UK governments met three days later. 
On the British side, there was a belief that Mrs Sacoolas would face justice as the UK had never turned down a waiver request from America for the 13 Britons with diplomatic immunity who had been arrested in the US since 1999. 
But according to documents seen by The Mail on Sunday, such optimism – or naivety – turned to 'disappointment'. On September 13, the British authorities were told that Washington would not waive Mrs Sacoolas's immunity. 
A deeply embarrassed Mr Raab told MPs that Britain had 'objected in clear and strong terms' and sought a fresh waiver. But the veracity of that claim was challenged after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the FO's director of protocol, Neil Holland, sent a text message on September 14 to his US counterpart, saying: 'Now the decision has been taken not to waive, there's not much mileage in us asking you to keep the [Sacoolas] family here. 
'It's obviously not us approving of their departure but I think you should feel able to put them on the next flight out.' The next day – unknown to Harry's family and Northamptonshire Police – the Sacoolas family left Britain on a commercial flight. 
Twenty-four hours later, Det Insp Hemingway was told by the FO that the waiver request had been rejected, and, worse, the Sacoolas family were back in America. She was advised not to inform the family. 
She says she was told this would help the FO 'get its ducks in a row'. She agreed as Harry's funeral was just hours away and she did not want to distress the family further. 
A few days later, the FO expressed its 'grave disappointment' and Mr Raab called the US ambassador. But all this was too late. Shamefully, the family were not told that Mrs Sacoolas had left Britain until 11 days after she had fled. 
Having felt abandoned by the FO, Harry's family looked for support from the media. Within a few weeks, they flew to Washington and met Mr Trump in the White House. It was claimed that, characteristically, he offered to write the family a cheque to drop their campaign for justice. 
To make matters worse, the family felt 'ambushed' when Mr Trump told them that Mrs Sacoolas was in a neighbouring room and that he wanted them to meet her. Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, says they refused. 
'We were there to find a resolution and we only wanted to meet her on UK soil once she had been appeared in court.' Despite Mr Trump telling Harry's family he would 'take another look at the case', the US authorities rejected an extradition request. 
In February, this newspaper revealed what might have been the reason: Mrs Sacoolas's career in the CIA. Harry's mother Charlotte said afterwards: 'I can't work out what is worse. 
How the Foreign Office caved in to the US and let Anne Sacoolas leave, or how it continues to treat us by covering things up and not telling us the truth.' A FO spokesman told the MoS: 'We have done, and will continue to do, everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done.' 
With the truth due to be disentangled in the High Court, this a very awkward time for Sir Simon McDonald. How ironic that during that TV documentary he said with just a little conceitedness: 'It's not difficult to interest a dinner party in what I am doing at work!'

    <h5 class="mb-1">'It was incredible to witness': RTÉ documentary shows the power of the arts for young children</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE IMPACT OF the arts on young children in Irish schools is explored in an RTÉ documentary tomorrow about a new creative programme.
The documentary looks at the roll-out of Creative Schools, a pilot project focusing on creativity and the arts in primary and secondary schools all around Ireland.
The scheme is about bringing creativity into the classroom across the curriculum, and is a Creative Ireland initiative funded by the Department of Education, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Arts Council. 
Kim Bartley and Aoife Kavanagh, of Frontline Films, brought director Anna Rodgers and additional director Garry Keane on board to film the implementation of the programme at the different schools across the country. Rodgers told TheJournal.ie that they saw children blossom as they took part in the scheme – including children who had previously hated attending school.
One of the schools Rodgers visited was the Presentation Primary School in Tralee, Co Kerry. “It was a really old convent building but inside it is such a modern representation of new Ireland because there are 23 nationalities in the school,” said Rodgers. “There is such a mix of students. The students themselves wanted to express something in their art project to do with diversity and give a message about prejudice.”
The students chose to hold a musical show with the theme of ‘breaking boundaries’. The ideas for the artistic events came from the children themselves. 
When it came to choosing the children to focus on for the documentary, Rodgers said they didn’t just want to focus on the young people who “always put their hands up”. They wanted to give opportunities to those who might not always be first in front of the camera.
They wanted to show that “everyone can be creative and everyone has a talent for something and has something to contribute”. 
Some of the schools decided to focus on a myriad of projects while other schools built towards one finale project. 
At Stepaside Educate Together, for example, they were really passionate about sustainability, and so decided to have a festival with a theme of sustainability. They brought in visiting artists to chat to the children as part of the process. 
“Most used the grants they had got to bring in visiting artists, which was fantastic because they got to meet people they wouldn’t get to meet otherwise,” said Rodgers of the schools.
Through the process they got to know some very interesting students, like Cuan Weijer (15). 
1. Cuan Weijer: Cuan is 15 and attends Stepaside Educate Together secondary school in Stepaside, Co. Dublin. Cuan loves Stepaside Educate Together having had some negative experiences in two previous schools he attended. Cuan is really embracing the Creative Schools project – he’s the Chairman of the Festival committee and is really enjoying organising the various events and activities leading up to festival day. Cuan was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome and finds great relief from involving himself in creative activities.
We visit Cuan’s home in Glencree in Wicklow. When Cuan is at home he spends hours helping his grandad in his work shop – one of their favourite things to do together is fix old clocks.
“He had a difficult time in school, and had been diagnosed with aspergers. But he was thriving in Stepaside Education Together,” said Rodgers. “He was very happy, a big part was that he was getting invested in creative activities in his school. He was the chairperson on the creative council – it was such a brilliant example of how creativity in schools can be of benefit to young peope.”
Two students in another school told Rodgers that being able to take part in a dance and music show in school made them want to not miss school – they wanted to be in there every day.
Another boy in the documentary told they on the first day that he hates school. “But then we filmed a workshop with poet John W Sexton, who comes from punk rock band background. He was teaching creative writing and poetry. His style was so arresting and almost shocking he was really quite loud and dramatic and very different to how a normal class would go,” said Rodgers. They watched as the boy who hated school became “the one with the hand shooting up for every question”.
“It was an incredible thing to witness,” said Rodgers. “He just really needed to find something he was interested in.”
Witnessing moments like this showed her that “this is really having an effect” on the children. “Children should enjoy school and be happy, and it’s sad if their school days are filled with pressure and stress,” said Rodgers.
The idea with the documentary was also to show how the arts can enable children to learn transferrable skills that would help them outside the class. “They might have learned to stand up in front of class and talk and do public speaking,” said Rodgers. “All these skills like public speaking and being able to create a project together as a group. We need these skills as an adult but so much time is present on individual study and individual work.”
Psychological benefits
Rodgers described the documentary as “very heartwarming”. “I hope that people take away the message that the arts isn’t for the elite, that it’s for everyone and that there’s huge value to spending time doing creative projects,” said Rodgers.
“And you’re not wasting time,that it shouldn’t be an add-on, that it should be part of everyday life and everyday school life and that creative life has huge benefits psycological benefits for young people. They get to grow and develop and work together on something.”
Creative Kids followed five schools over the course of the academic year as they implemented the Creative Schools project and encouraged their pupils to think about the arts and creativity in a whole new way.
The five schools featured are: Presentation Primary School, Tralee, Co. Kerry; Stepaside Educate Together Secondary School, Stepaside, Co. Dublin, St. Patricks De La Salle Primary school, Castlebar, Co. Mayo, Presentation Primary School, Warrenmount, Blackpitts, Dublin 8 and Scoil Athphoirt primary, Arranmore island, Co. Donegal.
Creative Kids airing on Sunday 3 May on RTE. It follows a pilot project Creative Schools focussing on creativity and arts in primary and secondary schools all around Ireland.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds have named their newborn son in honor of their grandfathers and two of the doctors who cared for the politician while he was hospitalized with the coronavirus last month.
Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson was born Wednesday, just two weeks after Johnson left the hospital where he spent three nights in the intensive care unit.
Symonds announced the name on her Instagram account Saturday and included a photo of her cradling their son.
“Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am,” she wrote in the post. “Wilfred after Boris’ grandfather, Lawrie after my grandfather, Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart - the two doctors that saved Boris’ life last month.’’
She added her “heart is full.”
BORIS JOHNSON SET TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER CORONAVIRUS FIGHT, FACES MOUNTING PRESSUR
Both doctors said they were honored by the name.
“We wish the new family every health and happiness,” Hart, director of respiratory and critical care, said, according to Reuters.
“We are honored and humbled to have been recognized in this way,” Price, director of infection at Guy’s and St.Thomas’ hospital, added.
Johnson returned to work Monday as the nation continues to grapple with the pandemic.

On Thursday, he said the country was "past the peak" but didn't give any indication he would lift the lockdown order.
He spent a week at St. Thomas' Hospital, receiving oxygen treatments while under constant observation by medical staff. Symonds also suffered coronavirus symptoms but wasn’t hospitalized.
He was present for the birth and will take paternity leave later in the year, according to Reuters.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kate Middleton giggles and coos as she meets newborn baby and his proud parents</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Smitten Kate Middleton has been filmed cooing on camera as she virtually met a newborn baby and his parents.
The Duchess Of Cambridge was introduced to the tot during a video call ahead of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week.
As she said hello to the proud mum and dad, Kate giggled and said: "It's nice to meet you. This is definitely a first I think!"
Kate, 38, was then introduced to their little bundle. Cooing, she gasped: "He is so sweet. Ah, congratulations."
The tot's tired mum revealed she had only given birth to her son the night before.
"My goodness. You must be exhausted," Kate sympathised.

In the footage, which has been posted on Kensington Palace's social media accounts, Kate also meets a range of staff from the midwifery sector.
Mum-of-three Kate tells them: "As organisations, you are playing such a vital role.
"Giving key information, you are hugely trusted by the public. Therefore, the information you provide is a lifeline to a lot of people at this time."
One of the medics explains to Kate that it is important to "get the message out about mental health".
He then urges new parents: "If you need help, get help."
Kate also spoke to midwives about the impact that the coronavirus pandemic is having on them.
She asked them how they were, saying: "There's stress and anxieties out there for families anyway, but you're still working and there's extra pressure and worry.
"And also trying to wear very uncomfortable kit as well.
Kate added: "Babies come all the time, so the fact you have to work in these difficult times...well done."
Both Kate and her husband, Prince William, work tirelessly to promote mental health awareness.
Her latest efforts have been applauded by their fans.
One tweeted: "The baby is cute. keep up the good work duchess Kate, mental health is really important."

Another added: "I think it’s wonderful that the Royals are using ways online to speak directly to their people. It’s so lovely to see them. God bless them all.'
A third remarked: "Love her, she’s going to be a brilliant Queen one day."
Meanwhile, it was celebrations all round in Kate and William's household on Saturday (May 2, 2020).
The couple's middle child, Princess Charlotte, turned five. Kate and William shared a beautiful photo of their daughter to mark the special occasion.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Joe Allen
The new mother was operating on two hours of sleep when she spoke with the Duchess of Cambridge.
Even as she’s quarantined with her family, Kate Middleton is still finding ways to bring some love to families across the United Kingdom. The Duchess of Cambridge recently surprised a pair of new parents with a video chat in which she congratulated them on their new child, People reports. Middleton was introduced to the couple, Rebecca and John, at Kingston Hospital, where Middleton did some work shadowing last November.
“Very nice to meet you. This is definitely a first. Well, firstly, huge congratulations. Is it a little boy or a little girl?” Middleton said on the call.
After the couple told the duchess that it was a boy, Middleton offered even more congratulations.
“He’s so sweet. Congratulations!,” the royal mother said.
In speaking with People, Rebecca said that her conversation with a member of the royal family had come as a shock to her.
“Having a baby is an extraordinary experience at any time, but having one during lockdown and then having a surprise conversation with the Duchess of Cambridge after two hours sleep was particularly surreal!,” she said.
Rebecca continued by saying that Middleton had asked what it was like to give birth during the coronavirus pandemic. She said that the midwives in the maternity ward had tried to make the process as normal as possible. The new mother said that apart from the masks, this birth was almost identical to when she had her first son in 2015.
On her call, Middleton also checked in with the hospital’s staff to see how they’d been coping in light of the virus.
“Are you very aware of a difference, or a shift in a mother’s emotional and mental wellbeing in comparison to before the pandemic?” Middleton asked.
The staff told the duchess that the situation had led to an increase in anxiety, and then praised the staff for their ability to work through the challenge. The midwives on the call discussed the impact the coronavirus had had on them, and the importance of continued support for frontline workers.
Last week, Middleton and Prince William launched Our Frontline, an initiative designed to provide 24-hour mental health support for frontline staff and key workers dealing with the virus.
Throughout her time as a royal, Middleton has prioritized childhood development and the mental health of parents as two of her key issues. On the call, she told the staff that babies come regardless of the circumstances in the world, and said she was grateful to them for continuing to do the work they do in these new circumstances.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson's tribute to the doctors who saved his life - Europe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds named their new baby Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, BBC reported.
In an Instagram post, Symonds wrote that the names were in honor of their grandfathers and the doctors who saved Johnson's life when he fell ill with coronavirus.
Lawrie was Symonds' grandfather, and Wilfred was Boris' paternal grandfather, she wrote. She added that Nicholas is after two doctors, Dr. Nick Price and Dr. Nick Hart, who worked to save the Prime Minister's life.
The baby, born on Wednesday, made his arrival just two weeks after his father was discharged from the hospital after suffering complications from COVID-19.
Following his release, Johnson admitted that "things could have gone either way," emphasizing that, "the NHS saved my life, no question."
Symonds suffered a lighter bought of coronavirus around the same time Johnson was ill.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris and Carrie share first picture of newborn son</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first picture of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds’ newborn son has been released.
New mother Carrie posted a photo of her cradling their baby, named Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, to Instagram this afternoon.
The little boy is seen all snuggled up in a cream knitted blanket, showcasing a full head of blonde hair.
His mum revealed this afternoon that he was named both parents’ grandparents, as well as the two doctors that saved the PM’s life from coronavirus.
She wrote on Instagram: ‘Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicolas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am.
‘Wilfred after Boris’ grandfather. Lawrie after my grandfather. Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart – the two doctors that saved Boris’ life last month.
‘Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well. I couldn’t be happier. My heart is full.’
Downing Street would not confirm if Wilfred was born prematurely, and did not provide details of the weight, timing, nature or location of the birth.
However, it was confirmed that the prime minister was present at the birth of his son.
The Tory leader was due to take two weeks paternity leave, but has confirmed he will take time off later in the year in order to keep a ‘firm grip’ on decisions about the Covid-19 lockdown.
He and Carrie announced the pregnancy, along with their engagement, on Instagram on February 29.
She wrote: ‘I wouldn’t normally post this kind of thing on here but I wanted my friends to find out from me.
‘Many of you already know but for my friends that still don’t, we got engaged at the end of last year… and we’ve got a baby hatching early summer.’
The birth came just two days after the Conservative politician made his return to work after battling a severe case of coronavirus in hopsital.
In his first post-recovery appearance on Monday, he told the nation the lockdown must continue for a while yet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson baby photo shows newborn inherited strong genetic trait from dad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Young Wilfred Lawrence Nicholas Johnson may be just a few days old, but it's already clear he's inherited one of his dad's most famous features.
Proud mum Carrie Symonds, who gave birth on Wednesday, posted a picture of the newborn on Instagram.
Wrapped in a blanket, the infant sported a full head of light brown hair - similar to the blond locks of the Prime Minister.
Ms Symonds, the PM's fiancee, wrote: "Introducing Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson born on 29.04.20 at 9am.
"Wilfred after Boris' grandfather. Lawrie after my grandfather.
"Nicholas after Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart - the two doctors that saved Boris' life last month.
"Thank you so, so much to the incredible NHS maternity team at UCLH that looked after us so well.
"I couldn't be happier. My heart is full."
The engaged couple welcomed their first child together on Wednesday morning when the newborn apparently arrived weeks earlier than expected.
Ms Symonds, 32, had previously said that the baby was due in the early summer, leading to the belief that the due date was in June.
Mr Johnson, 55, was hospitalised with coronavirus and spent three days in intensive care in April.
A spokeswoman for the couple said the "healthy" baby boy was born at an NHS hospital in London. Both mother and baby were said to be "doing very well".
The PM said he would take a "short period" of paternity leave later in the year.
New fathers are entitled to up to two weeks of statutory paternity leave.
It must end within 56 days, or eight weeks, of the birth, a period that would take Mr Johnson to the last week of June.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Eiffel Tower joined other global landmarks Saturday in capping a sparkling tribute launched by the Empire State Building in New York to those battling the coronavirus.
At 8:00 pm (1800 GMT), when people in France have been clapping daily from windows and balconies to thank health-care workers, the Paris landmark lit up in "sparkling white" to hail "the unfailing courage of care workers confronting the coronavirus pandemic," said SETE, the company that manages the Eiffel Tower.
A half hour later, the lights on the 20th century Montparnasse Tower, another tall landmark in the French capital, transitioned from white to red "to show its support even more intensively, like a beating heart," the company added.
The nine-day #HeroesShineBright initiative started on April 24 in New York and each night a different color is used there to salute various groups including health care staff, transit workers and police or military personnel, SETE added.  
Other landmarks that have supported the initiative are the Euromast in Rotterdam, 360 Chicago, the UAE'S Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest structure, the CN Tower in Toronto, the Macao tower in China, the Busan Tower in South Korea, the Ostankino TV Tower in Russia, the Tallinn TV Tower in Estonia and the OVNI Tower in Slovakia.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In issue number 1171 of Soccer Laduma, Teko ‘The General’ Modise named three players who he thinks are strong candidates for the Footballer of the Season award.
The 37-year-old retired midfielder won back-to-back Footballer of the Season awards in 2008 and 2009 during his professional career, this while on the books of Orlando Pirates.
Speaking in this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma, Modise named Mamelodi Sundowns’ Themba Zwane and Kaizer Chiefs’ Lebogang Manyama and Samir Nurkovic as his three contenders for the annual award.

“There (are) three. First, it’s Lebo (Lebogang) Manyama. The type of football he plays now is different to what he was doing for Cape Town City,” The General told Soccer Laduma.
“Then there’s Nurkovic. He came in and the way he has stamped his authority is amazing. I think Themba Zwane has been outstanding and he is ahead of the pack. He is scoring and he has played so many games and his stats are crazy and he is consistent,” he added.
(To read Modise’s full exclusive interview, check out issue number 1171 of Soccer Laduma.)
Manyama has missed just one game for Kaizer Chiefs all season and has played an instrumental role in their run for the league title.
The 29-year-old has on four occasions scored match-winning goals in the Absa Premiership for Amakhosi; he scored two goals in a 3-2 win over Highlands Park and scored the only goal in 1-0 wins over Baroka FC, Golden Arrows and Orlando Pirates.
On the other hand, Nurkovic is Chiefs’ current top goal-scorer, hitting the back of the net 12 times in all competitions this season.

Themba Zwane is also having a high-scoring season with Sundowns, making it his personal best of nine Absa Premiership goals, while it’s been 12 in all competitions.
Who of the aforementioned players should be crowned the Footballer of the Season this year? Let us know in the comments section below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Online dating surges as singles entertain themselves in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The use of dating apps has skyrocketed as singles spend the coronavirus lockdown matching and messaging prospective partners, but taking the next step to meeting in real life remains fraught.
A leading epidemiologist has warned that even when restrictions start to ease, lovers could be limited to dating within the "germ bubble" of their own postcode, to reduce the chance of a new wave of infections.
Last weekend, activity on RSVP - including the number of members on the site and the volume of virtual winks and messages - was 45 per cent higher than in mid-March when Australia went into lockdown.
It was also 10 per cent higher than the period before lockdown, which includes Valentine's Day and is RSVP's busiest time of year.
Meanwhile, the Inner Circle, a dating platform for young professionals, reports a 64.5 per cent increase in matches since mid-March in Australia when stricter travel restrictions were imposed.
The number of messages sent by Australians through the platform was up 140 per cent. Globally, there has been a 99 per cent increase in matches and a 116 per cent increase in messages.
John Francis, 39, an IT project manager who lives in Millers Point near the CBD, said he had been spending a lot more time on dating sites, including the Inner Circle and Tinder. He used to get a couple of matches a month but is now getting one a day, progressing from exchanging messages on the platform to phone calls and FaceTime.
Mr Francis, who moved to Sydney a year ago, said he was looking forward to going on dates in real life and had a shortlist of two or three women he would like to meet.
Restrictions eased on Friday to allow up to two adults and any dependent children to visit another household in their home but Mr Francis said this did not help with planning a first date.
"It's too way early to go to a person's house," he said. "I'm a little bit confused as to how to take the next step - I just hope they start opening the restaurants and bars soon.
"You need to keep that spark of interest going for a very long time without actually seeing the person and that is very tough."
A Sydney lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had been doing more matching and messaging on dating platforms but would not take the next step until the pandemic risk had abated.
"You would be surprised at the guys who wanted to hook up at the height of the COVID curve, including one who purported to be a radiographer," she said. "No thanks!"
Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist from the University of NSW, said a revival of dating could lead to a second wave of infections.
"It's potentially going to be an amplification if there are any hidden infections out there if people are meeting up with many people that they've identified as being of interest to them," she said.
Professor McLaws said when restrictions ease, people might be asked to stay in the "germ bubble" of their postcode, meaning they could date people from their suburb but not another part of Sydney.
Given most restaurant tables did not span 1.5 metres, she suggested people might go on first dates wearing masks - though she warned they could become "hot and uncomfortable".
Matchmaker and dating coach Louanne Ward said there would be a lot of time-wasters and scammers on the online platforms at the moment.
"You've got a lot of people who are looking for entertainment at the moment, they've got no intention of following through," she said.
"They're bored and they might be doing it under their partner's noses - they're window shopping, they're tyre kicking, they're having a look to see if the grass is greener on the other side of the fence."
Ms Ward also warned romance scammers would be out in force, with the pandemic and lockdown providing the perfect excuse to avoid meeting up in person and the opportunity to invent new and compelling sob stories.
Meanwhile, many people are turning to sex toys to spice up life in lockdown. Adulttoymegastore owner Nicola Relph said sales were "unprecedented".
NSW was the biggest market for sex toys, with hot spots in Sydney, the Hunter Valley and Coffs Harbour. Melbourne, Mildura and Ballarat were the biggest markets in Victoria.
"We opened in 2009 and nothing has come close to the sales we've had in Australia in the past three weeks," Ms Relph said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Kylie Kwong couldn’t be paid to wear a dress</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Simple, androgynous, practical. I like oversized clothes and I love black.
An embroidered jacket I bought on my first trip to Tibet in 2005. I love the traditional clothing of Asian countries, especially Japan and Tibet.
In Tokyo in 2018 I bought six beautiful Japanese designer shirts.
… on a first date? On my first date with Nell, my wife, I wore denim jeans, a Tibetan embroidered jacket and boots.
… on a plane? Loose cotton pants, a loose shirt and joggers.
… to the Oscars? One of Yohji Yamamoto’s black, asymmetrical pantsuit looks with a piece of striking jewellery.
The ’70s to the ’80s, when Japanese designers Yohji Yamamoto, Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo [Comme des Garçons] came to prominence. It was the introduction of classic Asian cuts into Western fashion.
Romance Was Born. Anna [Plunkett] and Luke [Sales] are incredible artists, original and playful. One of my favourite pieces is a black silk pyjama-style shirt with a beautiful bird-print design by photographer Gary Heery.
My black Issey Miyake Pleats Please scarf – you can roll it up in your suitcase, fly across the world and it’s still crisp and springy. Black Yohji Yamamoto shirts – I’ve got several. And my Maggie Beer striped apron.
When I was five, Mum tried to clothe me in a light-blue dress that she had made for me. I hated it. She would say, “Kylie, I’ll give you five cents if you wear a dress.” That’s how much I disliked wearing dresses – and absolutely nothing has changed!
For my year 12 formal, Mum made me an emerald-green suede skirt. I thought I liked it, but when I was there I felt so incredibly awkward – it just wasn’t me. I’ve never felt comfortable in skirts, dresses or high heels. It’s not who I am.
Aesop’s Hwyl Eau de Parfum. It’s reminiscent of a hinoki forest – smoky, woody and earthy.
What I wear is what I’ve loved to wear for a long time – simple, high-quality, innovative, ageless, interesting pieces.
Baggy fisherman-style pants with a loose cotton shirt and joggers.
Issey Miyake Pleats Please scarves in every colour. And I would continuously support not-for-profit organisations such as Oz Harvest, Too Good, Wayside Chapel and Weave Youth.
Adelaide-based designer Khai Liew is inspiring – he’s an interior designer, furniture maker, craftsman and artist. But it’s more to do with his personal style – he’s completely ego-less. When I think about style, it comes from within the person as much as their talent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Kylie Kwong couldn’t be paid to wear a dress</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Simple, androgynous, practical. I like oversized clothes and I love black.
An embroidered jacket I bought on my first trip to Tibet in 2005. I love the traditional clothing of Asian countries, especially Japan and Tibet.
In Tokyo in 2018 I bought six beautiful Japanese designer shirts.
… on a first date? On my first date with Nell, my wife, I wore denim jeans, a Tibetan embroidered jacket and boots.
… on a plane? Loose cotton pants, a loose shirt and joggers.
… to the Oscars? One of Yohji Yamamoto’s black, asymmetrical pantsuit looks with a piece of striking jewellery.
The ’70s to the ’80s, when Japanese designers Yohji Yamamoto, Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo [Comme des Garçons] came to prominence. It was the introduction of classic Asian cuts into Western fashion.
Romance Was Born. Anna [Plunkett] and Luke [Sales] are incredible artists, original and playful. One of my favourite pieces is a black silk pyjama-style shirt with a beautiful bird-print design by photographer Gary Heery.
My black Issey Miyake Pleats Please scarf – you can roll it up in your suitcase, fly across the world and it’s still crisp and springy. Black Yohji Yamamoto shirts – I’ve got several. And my Maggie Beer striped apron.
When I was five, Mum tried to clothe me in a light-blue dress that she had made for me. I hated it. She would say, “Kylie, I’ll give you five cents if you wear a dress.” That’s how much I disliked wearing dresses – and absolutely nothing has changed!
For my year 12 formal, Mum made me an emerald-green suede skirt. I thought I liked it, but when I was there I felt so incredibly awkward – it just wasn’t me. I’ve never felt comfortable in skirts, dresses or high heels. It’s not who I am.
Aesop’s Hwyl Eau de Parfum. It’s reminiscent of a hinoki forest – smoky, woody and earthy.
What I wear is what I’ve loved to wear for a long time – simple, high-quality, innovative, ageless, interesting pieces.
Baggy fisherman-style pants with a loose cotton shirt and joggers.
Issey Miyake Pleats Please scarves in every colour. And I would continuously support not-for-profit organisations such as Oz Harvest, Too Good, Wayside Chapel and Weave Youth.
Adelaide-based designer Khai Liew is inspiring – he’s an interior designer, furniture maker, craftsman and artist. But it’s more to do with his personal style – he’s completely ego-less. When I think about style, it comes from within the person as much as their talent.

INTERNATIONAL JAZZ DAY LIVE STREAM ★★★★
April 30
Reviewed by JOHN SHAND
International Jazz Day (April 30) has celebrated jazz's role in helping unite people the world over since 2011. This year, when the host nation was to have been South Africa, it was, instead, another reminder of a community splintered into an epidemic of isolation. But, thanks to a commendable collaboration between the Sydney Improvised Music Association and Johnston St Jazz, a 140-minute mini-festival occurred via two livestreams and one pre-recorded concert.
If the bands chosen could have more thoroughly reflected the sheer diversity of what passes for jazz, they were all able to bridge the livestream remoteness. Over half the time was allotted to the final act, the Jeremy Rose Quartet, with Rose having become a composer of note, especially via his major work, Iron in the Blood, which was included in the distant memory that is this year's Sydney Festival.
Although Rose's work for his quartet stays much closer to the jazz mainstream than does Iron in the Blood, he still finds fresh compositional ideas with which to prod the idiom and to stimulate improvising options. In the piano solo on the meditative Religion, for instance, Steve Barry could deploy all his capacity to tease, suspend or subvert the listener's expectations. The dark, edgy and aptly named Precipice began with solo bass from Noel Mason, which beckoned Rose's bass clarinet, the instrument on which he has developed his most distinctive voice and widest palette of colours. On the brilliantly evocative Aktau, Mason's bass seemed to convey the enormity of Kazakhstan's White Mountains, Rose's tenor the altitude, Barry's piano the crystalline air, and Alex Hirlian's drums the excitement.
The Mezza/Ginsburg Ensemble, a collaboration co-led by Italian pianist Vittorio Mezza and Australian pianist Mark Ginsburg (with bassist Karl Dunnicliff and drummer Tim Firth) was filmed at last year's Sydney Con International Jazz Festival, and suddenly it was novel to see an audience on hand! Dunnicliff produced notably fine solos on two of Ginsburg's pieces: the gentle For You and Common Purpose, the latter made lush with the addition of a substantial choir.
Vocalist Kate Wadey, pianist Andrew Scott and bassist Sam Dobson opened the celebration and, while Wadey's breathy, unforced singing was especially effective on I've Got a Crush on You, with the piano dancing behind her, the rest of the performance proved more uneven.

International Jazz Day (April 30) has celebrated jazz's role in helping unite people the world over since 2011. This year, when the host nation was to have been South Africa, it was, instead, another reminder of a community splintered into an epidemic of isolation. But, thanks to a commendable collaboration between the Sydney Improvised Music Association and Johnston St Jazz, a 140-minute mini-festival occurred via two livestreams and one pre-recorded concert.
If the bands chosen could have more thoroughly reflected the sheer diversity of what passes for jazz, they were all able to bridge the livestream remoteness. Over half the time was allotted to the final act, the Jeremy Rose Quartet, with Rose having become a composer of note, especially via his major work, Iron in the Blood, which was included in the distant memory that is this year's Sydney Festival.
Although Rose's work for his quartet stays much closer to the jazz mainstream than does Iron in the Blood, he still finds fresh compositional ideas with which to prod the idiom and to stimulate improvising options. In the piano solo on the meditative Religion, for instance, Steve Barry could deploy all his capacity to tease, suspend or subvert the listener's expectations. The dark, edgy and aptly named Precipice began with solo bass from Noel Mason, which beckoned Rose's bass clarinet, the instrument on which he has developed his most distinctive voice and widest palette of colours. On the brilliantly evocative Aktau, Mason's bass seemed to convey the enormity of Kazakhstan's White Mountains, Rose's tenor the altitude, Barry's piano the crystalline air, and Alex Hirlian's drums the excitement.
The Mezza/Ginsburg Ensemble, a collaboration co-led by Italian pianist Vittorio Mezza and Australian pianist Mark Ginsburg (with bassist Karl Dunnicliff and drummer Tim Firth) was filmed at last year's Sydney Con International Jazz Festival, and suddenly it was novel to see an audience on hand! Dunnicliff produced notably fine solos on two of Ginsburg's pieces: the gentle For You and Common Purpose, the latter made lush with the addition of a substantial choir.
Vocalist Kate Wadey, pianist Andrew Scott and bassist Sam Dobson opened the celebration and, while Wadey's breathy, unforced singing was especially effective on I've Got a Crush on You, with the piano dancing behind her, the rest of the performance proved more uneven.

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Each day, trade 20 minutes of social media scrolling for one chapter of a physical book” with Claudia Christie</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I had the pleasure to interview Claudia Christie. Inspired by the NYC cultural backdrop, Claudia ( a certified organic and natural skincare formulator ) and her team decided to fully immerse in a world that’s usually driven by vanity and miracle products to offer something genuine and personal: A skincare line created to offer a full body experience which is effective, easy to use, and mostly organic.
Having trained extensively with the world’s leading accredited Organic Cosmetic Science School Formula Botanica, Claudia developed her formulating skills from the ground up and has comprehensive knowledge and understanding of how organic, natural and nature-derived ingredients can come together to create a harmonious solution to most skin concerns. Of integral importance to her and her team is the R&D process. All formulas must be made from scratch, laboriously tweaked, audience-tested and approved before being submitted for efficacy, challenge and compatibility testing. They don’t believe in repackaging off the shelf formulas, which is why their designs take time and also what makes them so unique. Mainly addressed to people in urban areas, all of Claudiana Beautanica’s unique formulations seek to revitalize and empower skin and senses with smart, clean ingredients, textural skin feels and organic aromatics, deliciously complementing a daily habit of self-care. Currently available from their online boutique located at www.claudianabeautanica.com.
Thank you so much for doing this with us! Our readers would love to “get to know you” better. Can you share your “backstory” with us?
I’m a creative who grew up between rural and urban environments in the South Pacific. While my life was always very transient, I found continuity in nature early on from my experiences living on a farm in Canterbury, NZ. From a young age, I’ve been very sensitive to natural cycles, seasons, growth and decline, and the essence and energies of life. Regardless of geography, these constants are our house. My formative years lead me into the arts, I studied performance and mixed media as a way of exploring and expressing the human condition and nature within and beyond us. All the while, I loved using kitchen sourced ingredients as the basis of my skincare routine. In particular, Olive oil, just as women of the Mediterranean have done for centuries, a practice I was introduced to by Rosa, my Italian baby-sitter when I was very little. I started to employ other ingredients when I was tall enough to reach them on the kitchen shelf.
As a lot of young creatives do, I fell upon a time of existential crisis, which left me in a depleted physical, emotional, and mental state. Therefore, I made the decision 8 years ago to flip the script, move across the globe and brave a whole new world. I was always drawn to North America, it’s difficult to explain why. Living in NYC, with all its environmental stressors, I found my heart in the creative pursuit of organic skincare formulation, which incorporates all the things I love including, creativity, nature, and holistic care.
Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started your career? What were the main lessons or takeaways from that story?
Not so much a story but more a series of stories related to our product test audience, which in the beginning were friends and acquaintances. When I first formulated our 002 Skin Soothe Ointment, I gave it out to people to try and the feedback coming in about how to use it was mind blowing and often comic. From retail and office workers to musicians to construction workers, everybody had a different story about how it soothed their irritations. From using it in the ears to soothe reactions to chlorine in the water (I thought What, you stuck it in your ear? Ok!) to the aromatherapeutic ‘calm the angry panda’ office go-to, to a gym guy who started using it for his hands and then tried it for his jock itch. He loved it and actually came across the gym one day to audibly tell me so! He’s still a customer. The takeaway here is that one thing that you create can reach people in various ways, so always try to do your best with it — you never know how it will be appreciated.
Can you share a story about the biggest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?
One of the beautiful things about formulating is that breakthroughs usually follow, and are often the result of, the mistakes we make. You have to mess with things and you’re never going to get it correct the first time. Throughout my formulation studies, I purchased a lot of ingredients, I mean A LOT, in order to experiment with as many as possible. Which is great from a practical education standpoint. I learned a lot about functional ingredients, which you have to, but I also believed that the more exotic and complex ingredients I could include in my formulas, the better they would be. Not so the case. In fact, I found that putting too much in resulted in less effective skincare, too much noise all competing and bombarding the skin rather than truly complimenting the skin. It took some time for me to learn how to pull back and formulate intelligently and scientifically, using synergistic principles to combine ingredients that work in harmony with the skin. I learned that simplicity is key when it comes to managing our complex integumentary system, which by and large knows how to look after itself. It needs help from us to survive our environmental conditions.
None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?
My Mum, Katerina. She emigrated from former Yugoslavia to Australia in her teens, and helped her immediate Hungarian family to re-situate themselves in a new country. She learned to speak English and took on work whilst simultaneously studying to become an RN, which is a lot for a young Woman. Mum is very creative and always brought craft into our home with DIY projects and a flair for aesthetics. She taught me that no matter what life throws at you, you have the strength to survive the most adverse circumstances. Her innate caring nature and tenacious spirit lives in me and has helped me get where I am today.
Ok perfect. Now let’s jump to our main focus. When it comes to health and wellness, how is the work you are doing helping to make a bigger impact in the world?
We work holistically to consider the health of our patrons and our environment at large. Our impact starts with small steps that have flow on effects, which ultimately seek to harmonize the way we live and the products we use in the world. We limit our ingredient list so as not to over source, and we source our ingredients as locally as possible through trusted suppliers, many who foster initiatives to improve the economic conditions of the communities who produce the goods. Since we began formulating in 2014, we’ve avoided what are now called ‘dirty list’ ingredients per the Credo standard. We use glass jar packaging, which is readily accepted in recycling centers, and we are working to make all of our packaging plastic free. All of this sits behind to our main objective, which is to help our patrons on an individual level feel more comfortable in their skin. We believe that by positively impacting peoples mood and personal comfort, with sustainably sourced, conscientiously packaged, healthy skin food, we help spread the message that we deserve to feel good in our bodies and the body of the planet, which depends on us for optimal co-existence, deserves to be healthy too. Our work is to not just produce another product that sells and makes money, but to find out how to help people and help their skin by going beyond the face and focusing on overall well-being. This is why we formulated from the ground up and through the process are trying to close the loop, and why buying into plug and play white label and tweaking a couple of things here or there and sticking our brand on it isn’t for us — real change starts from the seed and we need to be involved in every aspect from conception to ensure traceability and to fulfill our personal desire to work through all the processes so we know how to effect change. Ours is a business, but it’s not just here for profit, its primary concern is to help people.
Can you share your top five“lifestyle tweaks” that you believe will help support people’s journey towards better wellbeing? Please give an example or story for each.
1.) Learn how to practice proper sleep hygiene. Sleep is where we truly recover our body, mind and spirit, and so many of us suffer from lack of it. A friend recently turned me onto Matthew Walkers Why we sleep, and I’ve fallen more in love with my sleep ritual than I thought possible thanks to it. Apps like Headspace and Relax Melodies also offer some great sleepcasts and meditations that help you drift off.
2.) Trade 20 minutes of social media scrolling for one chapter of a physical book a day and even more, if you can. Studies have shown we memorize better when we flip an actual page. Additionally, reading helps boost brain power and expand our understanding of the inner and outer world.
3.) Study your breathe and breathing patterns. It sounds simple enough, but there are all sorts of strange and common patterns we adopt, like shallow breathing and not fully exhaling, which contribute to increased anxiety.
4) Find time each day to have fun, or ways to bring fun into your day. We put so much pressure on ourselves and when it starts to weigh, we forget that essentially time is fleeting and underneath it all, we thrive on joy.
5.) We live in a fast-paced society, so it helps to make time to explore the non-material strivings of the soul. A slow practice that gives you space to explore your inner world, like yoga, qigong, meditation, are helpful. Try adopting one without turning it into a digital commodity. Learn from it, for yourself. Listen to music, explore art, read literature, and create rituals that nourish and nurture the physical self and make your soul feel alive and embodied. It’s ok not to share everything all the time. Your soul is hungry. Feed it first.
If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of wellness to the most amount of people, what would that be?
Not sure, but it would align with movements already in place that work to put trees back in the ground.
What are your “5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started” and why?
I’m not sure anyone can prepare you for the obstacles you’ll face when venturing into entrepreneurship, and I feel you have to experience the very real challenges for yourself in order to grow and develop the mindset strength you need for business. One thing I would have liked to have understood earlier on is that there are plenty of people out there willing to help you, but also plenty ready to take advantage, so be careful who you trust. Also, it’s not so easy to create a sustainable brand when you are bootstrapping all the way, so focus on getting as close as you can to your ideal before launch and then adjust once in flight. You have to be in business to make changes to your business.
Sustainability, veganism, mental health and environmental changes are big topics at the moment. Which one of these causes is dearest to you, and why?
They are all connected. Sustainability and environmental change begins at the individual level, and our mental health, as well as our individual beliefs around the commodity status of animals, influences the decisions we make every day, which in turn affect the environment around us. I think one of the biggest struggles people face is restricted access to healthy, sustainable goods, largely due to price, and although they want to positively participate in the sustainable cycle and eat a nutritious plant-based diet, they simply can’t afford it. Conventional foods and products processed with pesticides, fertilizers, GMO’s, and microplastics, which are furthermore packaged in more plastic, have a negative impact on our body chemistry, which affects our mental health. Yet they are more financially affordable. The economics and education behind all of these causes are the focus for me, because a global understanding of the interconnectedness of them, and actions taken based on that understanding, is how we will create a healthier planet and healthier people. A great deal of energy goes into considering all of this when formulating, because we want our products to be healthy, and accessible, and good for the environment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Southern Queensland dips below freezing as mercury hits minus 2 degrees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The southern Queensland town of Applethorpe near the New South Wales border has plummeted to minus 2 degrees on Monday morning in a final chill for the state's weekend cold snap.
The Bureau of Meteorology expects the weather to warm up from Tuesday and Wednesday in Queensland's coastal areas, while inland parts should get relief from Thursday to Saturday.
On Monday, Darling Downs and Granite Belt was coldest with Applethorpe's minus 2 degrees, Oakey, near Toowoomba, had minus 0.2 and Warwick, south of Toowoomba, got 0.1.
In the south-east, the Scenic Rim town of Canungra shivered through 2.4 degrees, the Logan suburb of Greenbank hit 3.8, the Ipswich suburb of Amberley recorded 3.9, the Scenic Rim town of Beaudesert experienced 4.1 and Gatton in the Lockyer Valley got 5.2 degrees.
Brisbane dropped to 11.6 degrees on Monday, the Gold Coast Seaway recorded 12.5 and the Sunshine Coast Airport had a low of 12.4.
In the Wide Bay and Burnett region, Kingaroy shivered through 1.7 degrees, Gympie had a minimum of 5.3 and Gayndah recorded 5.5.
Roma, 430 kilometres north-west of Brisbane, in the Maranoa region dropped to 0.7 degrees.
Weather bureau senior meteorologist Gabriel Branescu said the Sunshine Coast was 7 degrees below the May average on Sunday, while the Wide Bay region recorded 7-10 degrees below average.
"We have a slow-moving high-pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directing the really dry and cool air mass directly across the state," he said.
“Temperatures will start to moderate from Tuesday and Wednesday next week as the winds will tend more easterly and bring in more moisture from the ocean.
"We’re expecting the minimum temperatures to stay about 13 or 14 degrees in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, around 11 or 12 degrees in the Gold Coast area.
"Cool temperatures will remain inland for another two or three mornings until the warmer and more moist air mass makes its way to the Northern Territory border later next week."
On Saturday, the mercury in Oakey, west of Toowoomba, sank to minus 0.4 degrees and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, broke the freezing barrier by the narrowest of margins with minus 0.1.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Perth to get first taste of winter after glorious autumn weather</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A cold front bringing buckets of rain and damaging winds has sparked a severe weather warning for the Perth metropolitan area, the South West and parts of the Great Southern and Southern coastal districts.
The Bureau of Meteorology said a cold front will move through the state, bringing showers, isolated thunderstorms and winds with speeds of up to 100km/h which could damage properties.
The damaging winds are most likely to occur ahead of the leading edge of the storm but thunderstorms but showers and gusty winds will continue through much of Monday morning.
Bureau of Meteorology spokesman Neil Bennett said the worst of the storm would hit Perth in the afternoon.
"We are expecting some very localised gusty winds of up to 100 km/h. But the key thing with this front is the rain, we are expecting some decent falls out this one, round about 20 millimetres for Perth," he said.
"The strongest winds will probably be about mid-afternoon and continuing with rain right through the afternoon and the evening and then slowly easing off."
On Tuesday evening a much stronger cold front is expected to come through, bringing with it more thunderstorms affecting communities in Albany, Bunbury, Busselton, Mandurah, Margaret River, Mount Barker and the Perth metropolitan area.
"We are more concerned with a front due to arrive during Tuesday evening, it does look like it will be a particularly strong front," Mr Bennett said.
He said the front is due to go through the state from mid-afternoon and winds with speeds of up to 125km/h were possible.
"This is a very much stronger front ...[it] will be packing much more of a punch."
The wet weather will continue throughout the rest of the week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Harper May Stefanovic.
The Today host confirmed his happy news on Saturday morning, revealing Jasmine, 36, gave birth in Sydney on Friday.
"I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect," Stefanovic said in a statement to Nine. "Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep."
The Sydney Morning Herald understands the new 2.9-kilogram addition arrived via a planned Caesarean section at North Shore Private Hospital with the 45-year-old Stefanovic by his wife's side in the delivery suite.
Friend and fellow Nine employee Richard Wilkins also confirmed the exciting news on the Weekend Today Show.
"To Karl and Jas, you guys are going to love this special time in your life," Wilkins said on air.
The proud new parents shared a beautiful first photo of their daughter hours after her Friday arrival.
Sadly, friends and family close to the couple, including Karl's three older children aren't able to meet their new half-sibling due to the coronavirus and visitation restrictions at the hospital.
Jasmine's parents, Bob and Cheryl Yarbrough, are currently self-isolating in Sydney after arriving from their home in Ascot Hill, Brisbane. The first-time grandparents are understood to be overjoyed by Harper’s arrival and are staying in town to help care for the new baby.
The couple married in a lavish Mexican wedding in 2018 after they began dating in 2016. Karl shares three children – Jackson, 20, Ava, 15 and River, 12, with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn.
Nine, publishers of this masthead, confirmed Today Extra presenter David Campbell will cover Karl’s presenting duties on Today to lap up time with his girls.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Click to read all about coronavirus →
Founding President of policy think tank, IMANI, Franklin Cudjoe has dared President Akufo-Addo to also conduct a Facebook Live session with Questions and Answers from Ghanaians as that is the new “game”, MyNewsGh.com reports.
The IMANI boss, who was apparently impressed by the performance of opposition Leader John Mahama during his most recent Facebook Live session advised that President Akufo-Addo “for look sharp” in the next presidential address which he says must come with a question and answer opportunity as well.
According to Mr. Cudjoe, Mahama has shown “such depth” and did “pretty well” in the Questions and Answer session too, applauding John Mahama for taking advantage of digitization and Covid-19 to get all the online eyeballs.
“Charley, JM is trending oooo. He is doing pretty well in the Q&A too- such depth. Nana Addo, boss, the game is now LIVE interactions with a Q&A opportunity ooo. We for look sharp. Next presidential address for be live with Q&A too.” The IMANI boss tweeted.
Some Ghanaian influencers had criticized President Akufo-Addo for his recorded late-night addresses which was later rescheduled to 8pm following criticisms. It is still recorded and has no question and answer components.
Mahama Facebook Live
Mr. Mahama has been using Facebook live addresses to reach audiences long before Covid-19 hit.
Last Thursday, he held a session at 8:15pm where he promised a potential administration under him would look to expand training for doctors in particular at the University of Health and Allied Sciences and the University of Development Studies.
“We have the possibility and we have the plan, if we get elected, to look at the University of Health and Allied Sciences and expand the training of medical professionals in those institutions.”
He added that in the University of Development Studies, his administration would “expand the numbers of doctors that we are able to train in that institution.”
Mr. Mahama also proposed fast-tracked medicine courses from biomedical students.
“We have the biomedical science students who can transition to do a medical degree in four years so if we get some of these biomedical students onto a fast-track medical degree, we can turn out several more doctors than we currently doing.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">CONGRATULATIONS: Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl.
The baby news was announced on Saturday morning on Weekend Today by Stefanovic’s close friend and colleague, entertainment reporter Richard Wilkins.
Their daughter was born at North Shore Private Hospital in Sydney on May 1, just after midday.
The couple has named their daughter Harper May Stefanovic, with the new arrival weighing in at 2.9kg.
“Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep. I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect,” Stefanovic told Today.
Karl Stefanovic announced his wife's pregnancy in December 2019, sharing a paparazzi photo of himself emerging from the ocean while holidaying in Byron Bay.
"After a great deal of speculation… the rumours are true," Karl wrote, alongside a baby emoji.
The Channel Nine presenter met shoe designer Yarbrough onboard a luxury cruise ship in Sydney in 2016, five months following Stefanovic's divorce from his wife of 21 years, Cassandra Thorburn.
Since then, they’ve fielded many scandals along the way, starting from when the couple was forced to go public with their relationship in 2017 when they were pictured in Bora Bora on James Packer’s yacht.
At the time, Karl’s detractors thought he had moved on from his marriage too quickly. Their relationship became the catalyst for an onslaught of media attention, intense scrutiny and the ruthless intrusion of their personal lives.
But despite it all, the couple remained strong and they married in a lavish three-day wedding ceremony in San Jòse del Cabo, Mexico, in December 2018.
One year later, in December of last year, Karl and Jasmine announced they were expecting their first child together, a baby girl.
In April, Karl Stefanovic spoke to Stellar about his marriage with Jasmine.
"She’s been through so much... It’s not her fault she fell in love with bugalugs, and the accusations were wrong about her stealing me from Cassandra. It’s rubbish and it’s hurtful.
Karl admitted the relentless public scrutiny led him to ask Jasmine if she was sure she wanted to be in a relationship with him.
"There were times when I asked, ‘Do you really want to do this?’" he explained to the publication.
"She’s just a beautiful, sweet woman from Queensland who runs a business and fell in love with me."
Stefanovic has three children from his previous marriage with Cassandra Thorburn: Jackson, 20, Ava, 15, and River, 13.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson jokes that fans are 'bigger than Kevin Hart' while accepting Kids' Choice Award</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson can't help but poke fun at his friend.
On Saturday, Johnson was awarded favorite movie actor at the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards, and in his acceptance speech, he playfully jabbed his good pal Kevin Hart, joking about his height.

"Hey, kids all around the world, I want to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for voting for me. And I also want to thank and commend the Kids' Choice Awards for using this broadcast to raise really critical awareness for child hunger," said Johnson, 48, over a video chat, per E! News. "So, well done to you guys."
The actor then brought up his "Jumanji: The Next Level" co-star.
"I want you to stay positive; I want you to stay happy; I want you to stay healthy; I want you to go to bed tonight feeling great," Johnson joked. "Because however old you are, around the world, just know that you are still bigger than Kevin Hart."

Johnson added: "I love you guys."
The actor bagged the award for his work in both "Jumanji" and "Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw."
John teased future appearances of his character from the films, telling fans they'll "see more Hobbs [from 'Fast & Furious] and more Dr. Smolder Bravestone [from 'Jumanji'] coming soon."

    <h5 class="mb-1">From The Archives: Krishna Menon — ‘World’s Most Hated Diplomat’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: Close students of the dramatic arts like to argue that today’s greatest actor is not Sir Laurence Olivier or Sir John Gielgud but India’s chief delegate to the UN, V. K. Krishna Menon.
News that Menon is about to speak invariably fills the UN galleries. Even the most jaded delegates turn in their seats to stare when the gaunt Indian with curley silver hair, worn theatrically long stalks into the Assembly chamber leaning on his cane. (Menon uses the cane for mere than sheer effect; for years he has suffered from arthritis in his back, legs and joints.)
People whisper, nudge one another, then sit back in happy anticipation of a brilliant performance.
Few delegates leave the room when Menon is speaking, not only because he is a major orator, but because India — in large part as a result of his efforts — has become a major power in the UN and one whose position on any issue is of real importance.
Nobody in the eighty-one nation UN can put on a show as ably as Menon. He can talk glibly for hours without consulting note (A reporter seeing him in the UN Delegates’ Lounge studying a manuscript, said: “I thought you were famous for talking off the top of your head.”).
Menon, flashing the infrequent smile that displays his big, glisteningly white teeth, cracked; “One should at least do a text the courtesy of looking at it before throwing it away.”)
He is celebrated for his snarling manners; yet, he can be charming and conciliatory when he chooses.
He can switch effortlessly from merciless invective to deliberately legalistic discourse. Usually, however, Menon is insistent, aggressive and notoriously fond of having the last word.
Such characteristics, joined by a barely concealed belief that the other diplomats of the world are distinctly his intellectual inferiors, have made Menon the most enthusiastically disliked representative at the UN.
In the Delegates’ Lounge, where much of the average day’s work is accomplished over drinks and coffee, the controversial Menon is a steady subject of conversation.
At one time or another, he has been described as the bad fairy of the UN, a man who eats his young, “the old snake charmer,” the ‘swami,” (the phrase most often applied to him by ex-Secretary of State Dean Acheson), a combination of the three witches in Macbeth, and a camel about to spit.
One of the more charitable diplomats, desperately thinking of something nice to say about Menon, blurted out: “Well, I guess you could call him an acquired taste.”
Menon’s bursting vanity, rudeness and superciliousness have also antagonised many of his own countrymen, large numbers of India’s top officials dislike him some, no doubt, because of envy of what has been called Menon’s “Peter and Christ relationship” with India’s Prime Minister Nehru.
After the Bandung Conference., in which Menon played his usual significant role, an American reporter who covered it was telephoned by G. L. Mehta, India’s Ambassador to the United States.
“What did you think of Menon?” asked the Ambassador.
“I thought he was a remarkable man,” said the reporter, “easily the brightest and most impressive at the conference.”
After a long silence, Ambassador Mehta said icily: “Well, I see he has one friend, anyway.”
Members of the American delegation to the UN, who must worse intimately with Menon, are inclined to take a sympathetic view of him.
“Menon isn’t difficult just for the hell of it,” says one delegate. “It takes somebody like a Menon to accept opprobrium and bully the UN into accepting India as a great power.”
Millions of Americans who know Menon only through television ‘or an almost uniformly press think otherwise.
Remembering his advocacy of the admission of Red China to the UN, his proposal to ban all hydrogen-bomb tests, his readiness to attack shortcomings of the Western democracies and his reluctance to lash out against the Communist nations, they see him as a fellow-traveller and threat to UN aspirations.
Staring on TV at his sharp features and his glowing zealot’s eyes, listening to him lash gloatingly at other UN delegates in his clipped British accent, Americans hate and fear him.
He is, to them, a Mephistopheles in a Saville Row suit. Even his cane takes on a menacing aspect.
“I’m sure he keeps a sword inside it,” insists one woman who follows every Menon appearance as avidly as she does a Marlon Brando movie.
Says Ellery Sedgwick, the distinguished eighty-five year old ex-editor of The Atlantic Monthly: “Why, the man’s the devil incarnate! He’s got it written all over his face. If he isn’t that bad, don’t tell me; I have nothing left but my prejudices and I want to keep them.”
The American public, with its tendency to think of diplomacy in terms of personalities, has come to regard Krishna Menon as an object lesson of what is wrong with India. There is widespread feeling — intensified by Nehru’s visit to Washington — that Nehru is “good” and Menon is “bad” and that, if only Nehru could be parted from Menon, India would shed its unhealthy “neutralism and join the U.S. camp.
Americans were delighted by reports from high administration sources that, in the course of Nehru’s private talk with President Eisenhower at Gettysburg, the President told Nehru bluntly that Menon had proved a poor representative of his country, and had sowed mischief and resentment in the U.S.
Menon insists that Eisenhower said nothing of the kind. “I certainly would have heard about it from my Prime Minister if he had,” Menon claims.
“On the face of it, the story is ludicrous. You don’t ask a head of stale to travel across the world to visit you and then denounce one of his subordinates. By the same token, the Prime Minister could have been guilty of the same discourtesy and told the President quite truthfully that a great many Indians were extremely unhappy with John Foster Dulles. But he didn’t.”
However unpleasant the tact may be to many Americans, Menon does speak for Nehru.
Menon, who has never wavered in his loyalty to Nehru, has the Prime Minister’s complete confidence.
At one time, he lived in Nehru’s house, moving across the street in New Delhi ‘only when he became a Cabinet Minister without portfolio.
Menon felt he would be taking unfair advantage of his Cabinet colleagues if he maintained a position of such intimacy.
Incidentally, Nehru insisted when Menon set up bachelor quarters that he accept the $500 a month Cabinet Minister’s salary.
Until then, Menon, a man of Spartan tastes, had always refused to take a pay-cheque for his government assignments.
No less an authority than Kentucky Senator John Sherman Cooper, former US Ambassador to India, believes that one valid explanation of Menon’s barbed and belligerent personality is that Nehru uses him as a sounding board and as a releaser of trial balloons.
“That’s true of diplomacy the world over,” says Senator Cooper.
“Somebody has to draw the fire; and on occasions, Dulles has had precisely that role in terms of US policy, If the same thing backfires, the head of state can always smooth things over.”
Menon insists he is merely Nehru’s lieutenant: “Do you think I’m such a fool as to come to the UN and not represent my government? I assure you, the Prime Minister is much too intelligent and strong-minded to let me do his thinking for him.”
Senator Hubert Humphrey adds: “I think Menon quite sincerely thinks of himself as a compromiser working for world peace. He’ll admit that he deals with the Russians, sure: but his point is that somebody has to. Otherwise, it’s the U.S. on one side of the street and the Russians on the other, and what happens to everybody else.”
Menon himself is cryptic when asked about his political ambitions. “I think the successor to Nehru is Nehru,” he says.
Meantime, one fact is unmistakably clear: as long as Nehru is in power, Menon is an enormously significant force that must be reckoned with, not rejected out of hand, by the U.S.
As Senator Cooper says, “We have to live with Menon; we’d better get used to that and start understanding him.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phillip Schofield's dramatic hairstyle after moving out of home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When he's not presenting This Morning, Phillip Schofield is trying out a number of new hairstyles - to varying degrees of success.
The 58-year-old has been posting her new looks on social media, as his usual short spiky hair has become rather long due to lockdown.
Earlier this week, Phil revealed he was struggling with his wild hair before going live on TV.
But today he managed to tame his unruly locks, reports OK.
In one snap, the much-loved host showed off his messy silver locks while pulling a funny expression, next to a much smarter look where his hair is pushed back with gel.
Alongside the photo, he wrote: “Lockdown hair options.”
It comes after Phillip revealed how frustrated he was becoming over being unable to keep his signature hair short and stylish.
The presenter showed things are far from glamorous for him outside the set of the ITV daytime show as he posted the honest snap to his story.
Phillip’s photo is a screenshot of him on his Apple Mac computer after a Skype video call with his mum, Pat.
The snap shows Phillip wearing a blue t-shirt, and his cheeky expression reflects his amusement at his hair, which is strikingly different to how This Morning fans are used to seeing it on TV.
His silver fox locks are standing on their ends in different directions, giving a true bed head look.
He wrote above the image: “Skype’d my mum, my hair made her jump”.
Later, on Snapchat, Phillip, who was recently pictured arriving at the London flat he is staying at after moving out of family home, admitted he isn’t a fan of the messy look.
As he shared a close up photo of the unkempt do, he placed a cartoon pair of scissors, revealing his desperation for a haircut.
Phillip then revealed how fed up he was getting of his hair as he wrote above the picture: “This is getting ridiculous”.
As he shared the photo on his Instagram story, Phillip revealed his messy hairdo gave his mum quite the shock during their video call.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: We’ve the space to employ more doctors - Mahama</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Click to read all about coronavirus →
Former President John Dramani Mahama has suggested there is space to increase the number of health personnel in the country.
Mr. Mahama, in a Facebook live address on Thursday evening, disclosed a new NDC administration would look to expand training for doctors in particular at the University of Health and Allied Sciences and the University of Development Studies.
“We have the possibility and we have the plan, if we get elected, to look at the University of Health and Allied Sciences and expand the training of medical professionals in those institutions.”
According to him, his administration would “expand the numbers of doctors that we are able to train at the University of Development Studies.
Mr. Mahama also proposed fast-tracked medicine courses from biomedical students.
“We have the biomedical science students who can transition to do a medical degree in four years so if we get some of these biomedical students onto a fast-track medical degree, we can turn out several more doctors than we currently doing.”
Currently, the ratio of doctors per population in 2016 was one doctor to 8,481 persons; well below the World Health Organisation’s standards of 1 physician per 1,000 population.
On a regional basis, the Upper East Region’s ratio was one doctor to 25,878 persons.
In the Western Region, the ratio is one doctor to 20,659 persons.
But Mr. Mahama says his administration would expand the training of doctors in Ghana to address critical deficits in the country’s healthcare sector upon a return to power.

SOS from the Kids are a children' choir formed by brothers Sim and Noah Macaulay.
Pre-teen Sim wrote the self-titled track SOS From The Kids after watching David Attenborough's Climate Change – The Facts.
With a little help from his mum Dorry Macaulay, he brought together his brother, cousin Coen Baines and a group of close friends to record the song.
Before long, words soon got out about the group and Sim was inundated with requests from other children to join his group.
In November last year, the choir took to Parliament Square in London to perform at the Global Youth Strike for Climate.
Afterwards, Sir David Attenborough personally wrote a letter to Sim and Noah to thank the brothers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While live sports are at a standstill as present as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, that didn't stop 'Game of Thrones' star Hafthor Björnsson from writing his name into the record books on Saturday.
According to the ESPN website, Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka "The Mountain" on the hit show, deadlifted a record 1 104 pounds (501kg) at his Iceland home.
Björnsson, 31, beat the previous record of 1 102 pounds (500kg), set by England's Eddie Hall in 2016.
The 6-foot-9, 441-pound (200kg) Björnsson won the World's Strongest Man title in 2018 and has finished in the top three on seven other occasions.
He has also been Iceland's Strongest Man for nine straight years and won Europe's Strongest Man each of the past three years.
The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec designer launches mask line inspired by star skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a line of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of the Olympic figure skaters he dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years, including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and world silver medalist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
The profits from the mask sales go to the World Health Organization in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
"We took the same materials as the skaters’ costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks,” said Caron, who also designs dancewear, gownS and wedding dresses.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than an ordinary mask.”
The limited-edition masks are not for all budgets - the eight models cost between $150 and $300.
Japanese customers were not deterred, snatching items inspired by Uno’s costumes, which retail for $200 to $250. Initially, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
"I was surprised,” Caron said. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn’t think people had so much money to buy a mask.”
Caron says his goal was not to heighten his brand.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration,” he said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks.”
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibers. The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters’ outfits. The material is breathable, with padding to give shape and structure.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all,” Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector’s item.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks is taking a break from his daily workout show after undergoing surgery.
The 33-year-old fitness coach has helped to keep the nation in shape amid the coronavirus lockdown with his workout routines.

But as he recovers from surgery on his infected hand, Joe confirmed he'll be temporarily replaced by his wife Rosie Jones.
The TV presenter said on Instagram: "I've had to call in a supply teacher for Monday's #pewithjoe
"It's my beautiful wife Rosie (sic)"
Joe explained that Rosie will demonstrate the routines, as he continues to lead the sessions.
Joe - who is also known as The Body Coach - wrote: "She's kindly agreed to come on the live stream with me to demonstrate the moves.
"I really need to let the hand rest for a few days now I've had the wires removed.
"It's totally out of her comfort zone so I've got so much love and respect for her right now.
"She's always there for me when I need her the most and she knows how much it means to me that I don't let anyone down with these daily workouts.
"I'll still be leading the session and coaching you all but Rosie will be demonstrating the exercises for you. Let's wish her good luck on her debut PE class (sic)"
Joe - who married Rosie in June last year - underwent surgery on his hand after a persistent problem flared up.

"They gave me a general anaesthetic which was awesome so didn't feel a thing and was sparko. (sic)"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic 'becomes new face of fashion brand' while in jail</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King star Joe Exotic has reportedly become the face of a new fashion collection based on the Netflix docuseries.
The 57-year-old, who is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence for charges including murder-for-hire and animal abuse, is believed to have teamed up with fashion label owner Odain Watson from his jail cell.
TMZ has reported that Odain had asked Joe to partner with him for a limited clothing range for the fashion brand Odaingerous, and a contract is allegedly ‘closed to being signed’ as the two agree on the final financial terms.
The fashion range, which will be called the Revenge collection, includes prints of Joe’s face alongside many Tiger King references.
A t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes is set to be one of the many pieces that will be available to be purchased.
Odain appears to have already confirmed the news, as he shared pictures of some of the t-shirts on the Odaingerous Instagram page.
‘Don’t Get Mad Get Even,’ he wrote. ‘@odaingerous presents the #Revenge starring @joe_exotic #joeexotic from @netflix #tigerking coming soon.’
It comes after the UK-based online fashion retailers Missguided and In The Style launched their own Tiger King themed t-shirts.
If that wasn’t enough, there’s also plenty of other merchandise based on the series available to buy, including animal print bikinis and even condoms.
In other news, Kevin Bacon revealed that he would love to play Joe Exotic in a film about the former zoo owner.
Following on from the success of the series, there has been talk of bringing it to the big screen – and Kevin happens to be the bookmakers’ favourite to portray Joe.
During an appearance on the Today show in the US, he said: ‘I’d play Joe Exotic in a second.’
He later added that he had first throught about playing the role after his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, had asked him while he was watching the documentary.
He recalled telling her: ‘This is an amazing show. I said, “The reason that I’m watching the show is because these are the kind of characters I get asked to play.”
‘This is my type of guy, you know, so listen, fingers crossed!’
We are seriously hoping this will happen now.
Metro.co.uk has contacted a rep for Joe Exotic for further comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic becomes the face of a new fashion line from prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King 's Joe Exotic has become the face of a new streetwear collection that features printed images of backstabbing, betrayal and fake friends.
The infamous tiger handler, 57, who is currently serving a 22-year jail sentence, is believed to have hammered out the business details from his jail cell.
According to TMZ, fashion label owner Odain Watson asked Joe to partner with him on a limited collection for the brand Odaingerous.
A contract is "close to being signed" as the two parties agree on the final financial terms.
Odain appears to have confirmed the news on the brand's social media page.
The clothing range, dubbed the 'Revenge' collection, will feature prints of Joe's face as well as references from the Netflix mega-hit series.
One of the staple pieces from the collection is believed to be a print t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes.
Joe Exotic and the staff of GW Zoo in Oklahoma were propelled into the spotlight when Netflix released the bizarre Tiger King docuseries on March 20.
According to the streaming giant, over 64 million homes worldwide have tuned in to watch the shocking documentary series.
Full of twists and unusual turns, the documentary details the bitter feud between Joe and his his arch-nemesis Carole Baskin, and also sheds light on the United State's harrowing big cat trade.
The tiger handler - whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage - was eventually sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for a murder for hire plot, falsifying records and a number of animal abuse violations.
Joe has also developed somewhat of a unusual cult following after the series was aired.
Among other products that are now available, fans can buy Joe Exotic condoms and even animal print bikinis.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has proved she still looks hot even when she's sporting a BEARD.
Jesy transformed herself into an electrician named Gary and wore fake facial hear for funny sketch which she shared on Instagram to her 6.7m fans.
The singer, 28, lay on her bed wearing a skimpy crop top and silk pyjama bottoms, alongside her pal Charlotte who was posing as a plumber named Steve.
And the stunner's Insta fans were very impressed with her new look - with many rushing to the comments section to tell her she looked 'hot'.
One wrote: "Still Gorgeous @jesynelson."
Another gushed: "Still would."
A third added: "Now i love you more."
Many of Jesy's followers also praised her for posting the clip and said it had them 'cracking up'.
The pair told how they were called 'Sparky Boiz' while bigging up their handyman services.
Jesy said: "What's Going on everyone, Gary here, just thought I'd do a quick post cos me and my mate Steve are still working in lockdaaan."
Jesy has been keeping her fans entertained Instagram posts during lockdown.
Earlier this week she posted a snap of her in a very scanty outfit as she headed to Sainsbury's.
Her jeans were unzipped when she made her journey to the supermarket giant amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Quickly stopping for a photoshoot before her shop, Jesy worked all her best angles for the camera flash.
The newly-single Little Mix star, 28, donned a skimpy handkerchief top with her ripped jeans as she posed up outside her plush front door.
Jesy Nelson sent a clear message to her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes after their split earlier this month.
The singer, 28, filmed herself dancing around her plush kitchen last week to her band Little Mix's new track Break Up Song in a vido she posted to Instagram.
She passionately sang the lyrics "This is not a second chance, no, no, baby/This is not a new romance, not tonight/This is for all the nights I cried for you, baby."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Madison Lennon
Cuban-American model Neyleen Ashley sizzled in a new pic shared with her 1.9 million Instagram followers on Friday afternoon. The sexy pic showed the bombshell lounging in front of a white stucco wall while rocking an olive green multi-wear swimsuit with a high-waisted silhouette designed by Hot Miami Styles.
Her bathing suit included a large chest cutout, revealing her large breasts and plunging cleavage. The form-fitting material barely contained her ample. Her bosom threatened to pop out from the revealing outfit.
Despite her swimwear, Neyleen still wore a full face of makeup. She smoothed an even-toned foundation across her gorgeous facial features and then used bronzer to create a slimming effect and accentuate her cheekbones. To finish her expert application, she filled in her full lips with pink lipstick.
The model left her short platinum blond hair loose, and the ends brushed her collar region. Several of Neyleen’s arm tattoos were visible, along with a single red bracelet. She rested her hand on her thigh, her white fingernail polish popping against her tanned skin. She rested her other hand on the ground beside her, tugging on a pale pink ribbon attached to her bathing suit.
Blinded by sunlight, Neyleen squinted a little at the camera, but it did not make her look any less gorgeous. She made a serious facial expression at the camera.
In her caption, Neyleen added an adorable greeting and used a pleading emoji and a heart emoji to express love for her fans. She did not say where she had her picture taken, but it looked like she was outdoors in front of a building.
It didn’t take long for the stunner’s fans to pour into her comments section and shower her in praise. Many of her admirers were blown away by her incredible figure and astounding beauty. Her pic racked up almost 25,000 likes and close to 400 comments.
“Missed seeing your sweet face, hope you’re happy!” exclaimed one user.
“Uh la la Girl You Looking Like A Whole Damn Snack ily,” gushed another fan, adding several adoring emoji to their comment to emphasize their point.
“Looking Absolutely Gorgeous and Stunning Love #superstarbabe @neyleenashley stay safe and healthy,” wrote a third person.
“Lord you’re so unbelievably gorgeous,” chimed in a fourth admirer.
Last month, Neyleen shared another swimsuit pic, showing off her glorious curves in a neon pink micro bikini. She showcased her stupendous cleavage and her colorful floral stomach tattoo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julie Hesmondhalgh admits feeling intimidated on Corrie set was exciting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we return to the Lake District for the third series of this hit drama, two years have passed, but Alison (Morven Christie) and Paul (Lee Ingleby) are still learning how to handle their son Joe’s autism.
Meanwhile, the 10-year-old has a new reality to deal with, as the couple have divorced and Alison’s home is now in Manchester.
As their marriage fell apart, Paul was not in a good place, reckons Inspector George Gently star Lee.
‘He felt detached, lost, out of touch and a bit of a failure, actually,’ he says. ‘I think he was struggling in life.’
Lee reckons the show’s depiction of what having an autistic child can do to a relationship is one of its strengths.
‘It’s good to be open and honest, and we’re showing this has driven a wedge between Alison and Paul,’ he says.
‘They’ve got a family together and that’s going to keep them together anyway, so it’s how they manage that, heartaches and heartbreaks.’
With Joe’s Uncle Eddie single too, the only stable couple is grandad Maurice (Christopher Eccleston) and girlfriend Louise. Her son Ralph’s got some big news to share, though.
‘Maurice is happier than his children, which bemuses him,’ admits Christopher. ‘They’re in early middle age and splintering. Their lives are falling apart, or certainly changing.’
While Alison juggles a university course with work and Joe, there’s a hint of possible romance, after a tetchy first meeting with a single dad.
But how would Joe cope with more changes on the home front? Fans will be keen to find out – and the show’s biggest star, Christopher, says it has a special place in his heart.
‘I’m known for probably three other significant roles – Doctor Who, Our Friends in the North and Cracker,’ he says
 ‘And I’m a runner, so I’m often out and about and I get stopped a lot in the street.
‘I’m stopped just as much about The A Word as I am for those three, which has surprised me. It seems autism has impacted on every person you meet. I often get people crying and saying, “Thank you very much for doing it because we never see anything about autism on the television”.
'This show is as important to me as anything I’ve ever done.’
Julie Hesmondhalgh joins The A Word this series as Joe’s teacher Heather – and admits she is finding it nerve-racking.
‘I came in as a fangirl,’ she says. ‘This has happened from Corrie onwards, I always feel I should be at the gate with my autograph book and somehow I’ve got in!
‘I’ve had to really work at creating this persona that belongs in those environments, that isn’t, “That’s Morven Christie! It’s Chris Eccleston!"
'I’ve got to just be like, “Hi, here I am, an actor, like you, on our set.”‘
'I know, rationally, we’re all human beings with insecurities... but even at the end of Coronation Street after 16 years, I would sometimes be in the Rovers Return and be like, “What am I doing here? I’m in the Rovers. How did this happen?”
'So it was intimidating but exciting.’
– The A Word returns on Tuesday, May 5 at 9pm on BBC One

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julie Hesmondhalgh admits feeling intimidated on Corrie set was exciting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we return to the Lake District for the third series of this hit drama, two years have passed, but Alison (Morven Christie) and Paul (Lee Ingleby) are still learning how to handle their son Joe’s autism.
Meanwhile, the 10-year-old has a new reality to deal with, as the couple have divorced and Alison’s home is now in Manchester.
As their marriage fell apart, Paul was not in a good place, reckons Inspector George Gently star Lee.
‘He felt detached, lost, out of touch and a bit of a failure, actually,’ he says. ‘I think he was struggling in life.’
Lee reckons the show’s depiction of what having an autistic child can do to a relationship is one of its strengths.
‘It’s good to be open and honest, and we’re showing this has driven a wedge between Alison and Paul,’ he says.
‘They’ve got a family together and that’s going to keep them together anyway, so it’s how they manage that, heartaches and heartbreaks.’
With Joe’s Uncle Eddie single too, the only stable couple is grandad Maurice (Christopher Eccleston) and girlfriend Louise. Her son Ralph’s got some big news to share, though.
‘Maurice is happier than his children, which bemuses him,’ admits Christopher. ‘They’re in early middle age and splintering. Their lives are falling apart, or certainly changing.’
While Alison juggles a university course with work and Joe, there’s a hint of possible romance, after a tetchy first meeting with a single dad.
But how would Joe cope with more changes on the home front? Fans will be keen to find out – and the show’s biggest star, Christopher, says it has a special place in his heart.
‘I’m known for probably three other significant roles – Doctor Who, Our Friends in the North and Cracker,’ he says
‘And I’m a runner, so I’m often out and about and I get stopped a lot in the street.
‘I’m stopped just as much about The A Word as I am for those three, which has surprised me. It seems autism has impacted on every person you meet. I often get people crying and saying, “Thank you very much for doing it because we never see anything about autism on the television”.
'This show is as important to me as anything I’ve ever done.’
Julie Hesmondhalgh joins The A Word this series as Joe’s teacher Heather – and admits she is finding it nerve-racking.
‘I came in as a fangirl,’ she says. ‘This has happened from Corrie onwards, I always feel I should be at the gate with my autograph book and somehow I’ve got in!
‘I’ve had to really work at creating this persona that belongs in those environments, that isn’t, “That’s Morven Christie! It’s Chris Eccleston!"
'I’ve got to just be like, “Hi, here I am, an actor, like you, on our set.”‘
'I know, rationally, we’re all human beings with insecurities... but even at the end of Coronation Street after 16 years, I would sometimes be in the Rovers Return and be like, “What am I doing here? I’m in the Rovers. How did this happen?”
'So it was intimidating but exciting.’
– The A Word returns on Tuesday, May 5 at 9pm on BBC One

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Undefinable Something of Irrfan Khan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2015 Bollywood movie Piku is one of my family’s favorites. We watch it every Thanksgiving, and laugh at every joke. It stars Amitabh Bachchan as an irascible, Larry David–esque Bengali widower who is obsessed with his bowel movements and eventual death; Deepika Padukone as his devoted, back-talking daughter; and Irrfan Khan, as the owner of a cab company who finds himself drawn into the family’s orbit. The first two performers may as well be wax statues — so famous are their faces, so renowned are they not just for talent and status but for looks. Khan, though, is a different sort of striking.
He might be called jolie laide, to borrow the French term that means, effectively, “ugly beautiful,” and which holds special importance in the world of film. When he arrives, some five minutes into Piku, we, the viewers have already been ensconced in the shabby, glamorous world of Bhashkor Banerjee (Bachchan) and his daughter (Padukone), who goes by the family nickname Piku. Khan plays Rana Chaudhary. He stands, in his first scene, at more than six-foot high, taller than the other actors playing cab drivers, a man who might be crassly said to be better than his surroundings. An engineer by training, he lost a chance at a job in Saudi Arabia due to logistical difficulties, and so he returned home to take up the post at his dead father’s company, to live at home with a mother who harangues him regularly for not living up to masculine ideals.
In a classic, movie sense, he might be said to be a loser type. Yet, to observe him throughout the movie is to question the validity of the notion of “types” at all. Khan’s regal height, his sensuous, animalistic features, give him the air of a god among mortals. Yet, his extraordinary physicality is cut with hallmarks of normalcy. His face shows lines; his hair, in the first scene, blows in the wind to reveal patches of scalp (whereas Bhachhan’s and Padukone’s impressive manes each look so well-kept as to be artificial). “He isn’t exactly handsome,” my paternal uncle once told me, in the tone of someone struggling to understand a quality that hasn’t been defined yet. “But he has something.”
Whereas French culture opens a space for jolie laide — welcomes it, even (witness Serge Gainsbourg, Jeanne Moreau) — Bollywood has never been so fetishistic of counterintuitive appeal. Khan may have eventually developed the reputation of being a guaranteed sign of quality (one of “three easy indicators to know whether a Bollywood film is worth your time,” as the film critic Poulomi Das recently told NPR, those being: “If the film gets good reviews, if the film’s opening weekend collections are in double figures, and if the film stars Irrfan Khan.”) But in Bollywood, he was always considered a sort of outlier to the general rule of homogenous beauty standards. He changed “the idea of what an actor needs to look like in an industry where he isn’t the traditional idea of what is handsome,” to cite a recent article that quoted Aseem Chhabra, the writer, who wrote a biography of Khan.
The actor, who died this week at 53 seemingly of complications from a rare neuroendocrine disorder, has now been hailed across the internet as a study in contrasts — a master of the sublime and the quotidian, Bollywood star and Hollywood Everyman, sexy yet not fit for leading-man symbolism. “[For Americans] he’s in the realm of Jean-Paul Belmondo or Marcello Mastroianni or Omar Sharif, even,” wrote the director Mira Nair in the New York Times. (Nair gave Khan his first role, in her movie Salaam Bombay!, as well as arguably his most pivotal, as a crossover star, in her adaptation of the Jhumpa Lahiri novel The Namesake.) Her comparison to Sharif et al. is intended to probe at the curious, rare mix that Khan brought to the screen, a man who arrived in movies he wasn’t meant to be in, in roles he supposedly didn’t look right for, a man “clearly from some other culture but having great appeal to be seen as anything from an Everyman type to a very quiet and intelligent sort of sex appeal.” Khan was one of the few if only performers out of India to be treated in Bollywood as a person first, his ethnicity second.
In Piku, Khan is, as usual, positioned outside the bounds of archetypes. His sensual face — Nair calls it “extraordinary,” her description memorable: “so tall and gangly and angular — like a praying mantis. [At 18] he still had a craggy face and those hooded eyes” — bespeaks a poetic soul, however unpoetic his circumstances might be. He exudes from the first scene on, as he does in every role he ever played — and they were numerous, on both sides of the planet, a line of credits that includes Life of Pi, Jurassic World, Slumdog Millionaire, and dozens of Bollywood hits, large and small — a dualistic air, Everyman and nobleman. (It makes sense perhaps that in real life he obscured his own nobility, dropped an honorific family name that indicated royal blood.)
Khan proves an apt choice as love interest against Padukone, an actress whose star quality could hardly ever be questioned. Her second acting job ever was as the romantic lead in Om Shanti Om, a sort of meta-Bollywood spectacular, a movie about Bollywood, that plays expertly with various tropes of the industry. Padukone played across from Shah Rukh Khan, perhaps the most unambiguous star in India, and she held her own against him. The year was 2007; she was only 21 — and she won the Filmfare Award that year for Best Female Debut. In Piku, she expands her range from undeniable ingenue to an actress capable of playing a three-dimensional, difficult woman, a “strong female lead,” as the euphemistic Netflix parlance goes. She plays a 30-year-old, single Delhi–based architect who hasn’t broken off from her childhood yet. She is unmarried, and trapped — rather willingly, it becomes clear — in an endearing, combative situation with her willful father, played by another instantly annointed star, Bachchan.
In this mix, Khan is both a natural and unnatural fit. His career was hardly a smooth sail to the top. Nair wrote in the Times of how an inability to cast him as a more central character in her 1988 movie Salaam Bombay!, when Khan was an 18-year-old, hungry acting student, gave way to a difficult several years for the actor, and, eventually, a solid career in television. But Khan wasn’t satisfied. In a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Khan himself spoke of his mood at an inflection point, at the start of the new millennium, when he was primarily a TV actor. “I was bored of acting,” he said. “I wanted to quit this profession. I was losing passion.” Then came British director Asif Kapadia’s 2001 fantasy thriller The Warrior, which he “lived with for three months, and suddenly everything came,” as he put it. “I rediscovered my passion and was longing to work in film, television.” Kapadia says he knew the moment they met that “we had our guy.” As he recently told the Guardian, “[Khan] had a real presence and I knew he could carry the film,” though he “didn’t have the looks for commercial cinema.”
Khan experienced another fallow period soon after The Warrior, a slow six months in which he got no work, and yet he was not worried (though, he jokes, his wife was). That dual sense of intensity and calm comes through in every part Khan played thereafter. He appears on screen with the naturalness of a man who was born to act and doesn’t question his right to the job, who can sit for six months without a role, and not worry. In the HBO show In Treatment, for example, he unfolds the workings of the character Sunil over the course of several episodes in 2010, as a client of the show’s psychotherapist lead character, played by Gabriel Byrne. In that role, the seams of life bleed through. Khan asks at one point, in his languorous, unstudied drawl, if he can light a cigarette, and the doctor acquiesces. Not soon after, in an interview with this very publication, Khan did the same and the interviewer said yes, his actorly self seemingly merged with his regular one. He might be said to exhibit the quality once ascribed to Elizabeth Taylor, an ability to present with “absolute stillness.” His smallest movement demands attention. Even when he does nothing, for that matter, he is enchanting.
In Piku, Khan’s character, Chaudhary, orients in various parallel ways to those of his co-stars, as perhaps the actor might have in real life. Not of Bengali descent, he is deemed somewhat unworthy by Bachchan’s hyper-Bengali character, Bhashkor Banerjee. (Given the Bengali reputation for moody intellectualism, it’s no surprise perhaps that an informal running joke in Khan’s repertoire is how often he’s cast as a Bengali or if not, as a man mistaken for a Bengali.) He is a failed professional, whom Bhashkor treats as a servant. When the three embark on a long drive to Calcutta, an activity that anchors the film’s second act, Bhashkor makes a point to demean Chaudhary’s professional achievements, to make clear that whether owner or driver, he merits no special respect. “Don’t interfere in a family matter,” Bhashkor barks, at one point. Chaudhary’s claim to belonging, to authority, is challenged at every step of the way, yet, his calmness overrides all the objections to his presence. He was always meant to be precisely where he was.
One scene in particular stands out: Chaudhary has driven Bhashkor Banerjee and Piku safely to their family home in Calcutta, after a good number of digestive-inspired hijinks on the road. Along the way, it’s his ability to absorb their dysfunction with grace, and at turns talk back with clarity, that begins to endear him to the spiny father-daughter duo. Sitting around the table for a meal, he cements his claim to respect. At a tense moment, when family matters are being hashed out, he turns the mood toward a gently comic one. He launches into an indictment of American eating habits, and praises the slow chew rate of the cow. In this way, he gets Bhashkor to embrace naturalness over effort, to try to enjoy life, to return to a simpler, native way of thinking. He does so with the sweet, sly, deep intelligence that imbues his every movement on screen. At this point, my family has watched the scene nearly half a dozen times. Every year, it is as if we are watching it anew. And as he chews in the manner of a cow, as he placates an ornery old man, as he charms a headstrong young woman, he does all such work in our hearts too. I can see it as my family watches the screen. We are all falling in love with him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King’s Carole Baskin tricked into giving first interview by pranksters posing as Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TIGER King's Carole Baskin's first interview since the popular show came out on Netflix in March premiered Sunday.
The big cat activist thought she was exclusively talking to Jimmy Fallon when she was really talking to two YouTube pranksters.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners wanted to see if they could trick celebrities into giving them interviews.
They do this by telling victims that they would be talking to a late-night show host, like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon.
From this they were able to score an exclusive chat with Baskin by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon.
In the fake interview, Carole revealed she “had to let go about half of our staff” because her sanctuary’s been closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Though she said she and handful of volunteers are working “double-time” to care for the haven’s 55 exotic cats, she confessed she doesn’t know if they’ll “ever going to be able to do tours again.”
Carole, who told Us Weekly she “isn’t angry” about the “fun prank,” was also persuaded to wear her flower crown while showing pictures of herself and her third husband, Howard Baskin.
She told the outlet: “I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped, but had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank.
“It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited.”
She used the interview with the YouTubers as an opportunity to talk about a proposed law aimed at stopping the exploitation and abuse of big cats in zoos.
Josh talked to INSIDER about why he chose Carole and how he was able to get her to agree to a fake interview.
He explained: "Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show.
"And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?"
He then explained that they used a fake email address to reach Carole and tell her they were producing live segments for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
Ultimately, she agreed to the interview.
They then went through thousands of Jimmy Fallon clips where he uses the word "cat" and pieced them all together to make Carole believe she was actually talking to the late-night show host.
Josh explained: "As you'll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he's interviewed the cast of 'Cats,' and he's actually interviewed a real cat.
"So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that."
Of course, the way the two YouTubers landed the interview may seem a little shady and may have people wondering whether it's illegal or not.
The 26-year-old had previously explained their methodology in another interview: "I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong," Pieters said in a previous interview.
"We always try to give people a bit of a chance."
The interviewer admitted that they weren't really expecting it to work.
He said: "Like all of our ideas, we really didn't expect it to work, and then it did work," he said. "I guess it's that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working," he said. "And then when it does work, it's always quite fun to watch."
Baskin is a "very interesting lady," Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
"We really did not expect it to work," he said. "We still can't really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin."
As most people know, Carole is one of the main characters in the docuseries Tiger King.
She was Joe Exotic's enemy and spent years trying to shut down his zoo and cub petting operation.
It was the Tiger King himself who first alleged that Carole murdered her first husband, Don Lewis.
Carole, never officially a suspect, has vehemently protested her innocence over “lies and innuendos” in the Netflix series.
The animal activist simply claimed that he had disappeared and made for dead, but new evidence shows he was actually murdered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers trick Carole Baskin into first interview since Tiger King</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTubers Josh Pieters and Archie Manners tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first interview since Tiger King after they convinced her that she was talking to Jimmy Fallon.
The pair reassured her that they would not talk about Netflix or Tiger King and she joked that she didn't want to be referred to as 'that b**** Carole Baskin'.
They tell her that she won't see the host as she speaks into the webcam while she even breaks out her signature "hey all you cool cats and kittens" phrase.
They used a soundboard with generic questions and quotes from Fallon.
Viewers were amazed that the pair managed to pull it off, as Baskin has shunned all media and interviews since the hit docuseries dropped on Netflix.
She was unhappy with how she was portrayed and the episode which focused on the disappearance of her ex-husband Don Lewis.
Baskin realised what had happened afterwards.
Commenting on the video, she wrote: "This is the email I sent to my husband and daughter after the interview: 'Well that was weird. I couldn't see Fallon during the interview, and when they had his voice on the questions they didn't sound like it was specific to the topic.
"'He'd just say things they could have recorded from any other interview; like - what are you doing during Quarantine?
"'At the end he said: 'Miss you buddy,' so that really didn't sound like it was live from him to me.
"'They did stick to the questions they gave us, so I just can't tell. This whole thing may have been a spoof and they said they won't broadcast till next week, and will let us know before they do, but I'm not holding my breath.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first major interview since 'Tiger King' by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has given her first official interview since the binge-watching phenomenon “Tiger King” dropped on Netflix in March, and got everyone wondering whether she really did murder her husband and feed him to the big cats at her sanctuary.
But while she thought she was going to be chatting with late night host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show,” she was actually being asked questions by Josh Pieters from his home in London, in his underwear, while his YouTube partner Archie Manners chaperoned the interview.
Pieters has been posting a three-part series since Friday on his YouTube channel, which has just changed its name to “Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.”
They wanted to know whether they could trick celebrities into thinking they were being interviewed on real late night TV shows by just using a Zoom call, some sound bites from old clips, and Manners pretending to be a producer.
Spoiler alert: they could.
When watching shows like “Good Morning Britain,” Pieters and Manners wondered whether the guests could always see who was interviewing them, Pieters told Insider in an exclusive interview.
“From there came the idea of just playing the talent recordings of their interviewers and seeing if they would notice,” Pieters said.
In the first two episodes, they spoke to UK pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H,“Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein with voice clips from James Corden. But they stepped things up a gear with the third video, which will air on Sunday night.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They sent Carole Baskin an email from their trusty fake-but-also-real production company Invisible Objects, saying they were producing the live segments for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
They’d almost forgotten about it when she finally replied and agreed to the call.
Pieters and Manners are a duo who have become well known and respected on YouTube for their social experiments. So far they have fooled the world with an Ed Sheeran lookalike, presented right-wing provocateur Katie Hopkins with a fake award, and sold microwave meals on Deliveroo, which earned them a reputation of having one of the “most underrated channels” on YouTube.
Even by their standards, faking the presence of James Corden and Jimmy Fallon sounds nearly impossible. The strange times we are living through certainly helped.
“I wouldn’t say it’s thanks to lockdown,” Pieters said. “It was just really interesting seeing people like Prince William and all these people you’d never imagined to see on Zoom, and Zoom becoming such a big thing.”
Video calls are being used by talk shows all over the world right now, and there’s no real set way to do them. So as long as Manners put on a confident enough performance, there’s no reason to doubt Fallon or Corden were listening in too.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters told Insider.
“You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
The interviews all went more smoothly than expected. Pieters said he’d been having nightmares of being really stuck and having nothing to say with the few clips in front of him, because it’s so hard imagining the direction the interview will go beforehand.
“There is often a moment where there isn’t a clip that’s suitable,” he said. “But that’s luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, ‘Oh we’ve got a quick change there, Jimmy’s just doing this,’ or ‘Jimmy’s just doing his makeup,’ and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong.”
The way they prepared for Baskin’s interview was by scouring Fallon’s older videos for relevant sound bites.
“As you’ll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he’s interviewed the cast of ‘Cats,’ and he’s actually interviewed a real cat,” Pieters said.
“So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that.”
The end result was the first major interview Baskin has given since “Tiger King” aired.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
Pieters and Manners try to answer the “questions you didn’t know you had.”
They never try to completely trick anyone, because ultimately, lying and deceiving is a lot less interesting than what they actually pull off.
“I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong,” Pieters said in a previous interview.
“We always try to give people a bit of a chance.”
Pieters said their latest series was simply seeing whether playing recordings to someone could convincingly pose as a real interview.
“Like all of our ideas, we really didn’t expect it to work, and then it did work,” he said. “I guess it’s that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working,” he said. “And then when it does work, it’s always quite fun to watch.”
Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video will go live at around 3 p.m. ET.

But while she thought she was going to be chatting with late night host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show,” she was actually being asked questions by Josh Pieters from his home in London, in his underwear, while his YouTube partner Archie Manners chaperoned the interview.
Pieters has been posting a three-part series since Friday on his YouTube channel, which has just changed its name to “Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.”
They wanted to know whether they could trick celebrities into thinking they were being interviewed on real late night TV shows by just using a Zoom call, some sound bites from old clips, and Manners pretending to be a producer.
Spoiler alert: they could.
When watching shows like “Good Morning Britain,” Pieters and Manners wondered whether the guests could always see who was interviewing them, Pieters told Insider in an exclusive interview.
“From there came the idea of just playing the talent recordings of their interviewers and seeing if they would notice,” Pieters said.
In the first two episodes, they spoke to UK pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H, “Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein with voice clips from James Corden. But they stepped things up a gear with the third video, which will air on Sunday night.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They sent Carole Baskin an email from their trusty fake-but-also-real production company Invisible Objects, saying they were producing the live segments for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
They’d almost forgotten about it when she finally replied and agreed to the call.
Pieters and Manners are a duo who have become well known and respected on YouTube for their social experiments. So far they have fooled the world with an Ed Sheeran lookalike, presented right-wing provocateur Katie Hopkins with a fake award, and sold microwave meals on Deliveroo, which earned them a reputation of having one of the “most underrated channels” on YouTube.
Even by their standards, faking the presence of James Corden and Jimmy Fallon sounds nearly impossible. The strange times we are living through certainly helped.
“I wouldn’t say it’s thanks to lockdown,” Pieters said. “It was just really interesting seeing people like Prince William and all these people you’d never imagined to see on Zoom, and Zoom becoming such a big thing.”
Video calls are being used by talk shows all over the world right now, and there’s no real set way to do them. So as long as Manners put on a confident enough performance, there’s no reason to doubt Fallon or Corden were listening in too.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters told Insider.
“You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
The interviews all went more smoothly than expected. Pieters said he’d been having nightmares of being really stuck and having nothing to say with the few clips in front of him, because it’s so hard imagining the direction the interview will go beforehand.
“There is often a moment where there isn’t a clip that’s suitable,” he said. “But that’s luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, ‘Oh we’ve got a quick change there, Jimmy’s just doing this,’ or ‘Jimmy’s just doing his makeup,’ and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong.”
The way they prepared for Baskin’s interview was by scouring Fallon’s older videos for relevant sound bites.
“As you’ll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he’s interviewed the cast of ‘Cats,’ and he’s actually interviewed a real cat,” Pieters said.
“So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that.”
The end result was the first major interview Baskin has given since “Tiger King” aired.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
Pieters and Manners try to answer the “questions you didn’t know you had.”
They never try to completely trick anyone, because ultimately, lying and deceiving is a lot less interesting than what they actually pull off.
“I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong,” Pieters said in a previous interview.
“We always try to give people a bit of a chance.”
Pieters said their latest series was simply seeing whether playing recordings to someone could convincingly pose as a real interview.
“Like all of our ideas, we really didn’t expect it to work, and then it did work,” he said. “I guess it’s that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working … And then when it does work, it’s always quite fun to watch.”
Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ Oscars bodyguard accuses host of being ‘cold, sly and demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who was hired to protect Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars has criticised the host for being “kind of demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was looking after DeGeneres as well as her mother and wife Portia de Rossi in 2014, the year Ellen was hosting the awards ceremony,
In an interview with Fox News, he claimed that Ellen was the one celebrity he’s worked with “that has never taken the time to say hi to me”, adding: “And I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities.”
Majercak said that things started off well thanks to de Rossi, who he described as “very pleasant”. However, things “started going negatively” when de Rossi introduced him to DeGeneres.
“Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife, and me,’” he continued.
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
Majercak also said that celebrities had to be approved to come and talk to DeGeneres at her table during a high-profile after party.
He said that he came forward with his story after people claiming to be Ellen’s ex-employees shared some startling experiences they’re said to have had with the presenter on social media.
One story claimed that DeGeneres would send her staff at The Ellen DeGeneres Show home if they had failed to chew gum before speaking to her.
Another added: “A new staff member was told ‘every day she picks someone different to really hate. It’s not your fault, just suck it up for the day and she’ll be mean to someone else the next day.’ They didn’t believe it but it ended up being entirely true.”
“It’s bugged me for years,” Majercak said. “I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome and everybody loves her and is in awe, and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person.”
A representative for DeGeneres has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres' ex-bodyguard claims star is 'cold' and 'sly'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard claimed the star’s TV persona is a ‘false facade and bravado.’
Her former security, Tom Majercak, was assigned to protect the comedian at the 2014 Oscars and according to him, his experience felt ‘demeaning.’
Speaking to Fox News, Tom explained: ‘I’m holding their hands and walking them through individuals and large groups of people. Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to – and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities – that has never taken the time to say hi to me.
‘It started going negatively when she introduced me to Ellen and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say “hello,” or “thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.”
‘It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.’
He went on to say that he thought Ellen was ‘enlightened and positive’ when he saw her on TV, but it wasn’t the case in person.
Tom looked after her during the same Academy Award show the famous celebrity selfie was taken, which included Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Luptia Nyongo Bradley Cooper, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
‘When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado,’ he continued.  ‘You start hearing these stories and I was like, “Man, there’s got to be more to this.”
‘She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion.’
His coming forward comes after many staff members of her talk show slammed her for failing to communicate the status of their jobs and pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Beauty blogger NikkieTutorials also hit out at Ellen, saying the host ‘didn’t even say hello’ when she appeared on the show in January.
The beauty guru – real name Nikkie de Jager – came out as transgender earlier this year, with her first interview afterwards.
However, Ellen has previously slammed claims about how she treats staff, calling it an ‘outright lie.’
‘That bugs me if someone is saying that because it’s an outright lie,’ she told the New York Times in 2018.
‘The first day I said: “The one thing I want is everyone here to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don’t work here.” No one is going to raise their voice or not be grateful. That’s the rule to this day.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard has slammed her as “cold” and “demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was hired to protect the talk show host while she hosted the 2014 Oscars, and he also shadowed Ellen’s mother, and her wife Portia de Rossi.
Speaking to Fox News, Tom said it was one of the worst jobs he’s ever signed up for, in the ten years he’s worked in security.
He said: “Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to, and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities, that has never taken the time to say hi to me.”
Although Tom said Portia was “very pleasant and carried on a conversation”, he couldn’t say the same for Ellen.
He said: “[She] pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.’”
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
“It’s bugged me for years. I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome. And everybody loves her and is in awe and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person,” he said.
“When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado. You start hearing these stories and I was like, ‘Man, there’s got to be more to this.’
“She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion,” he added.
The news comes after Ellen was criticised by staff members over lack of communication about their pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Production on The Ellen Show halted in March, and Ellen has since been hosting the show from her house.
A source told Variety: “Radio silence from producers created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and, in that case, would need to explore unemployment benefits.”
Staff were also furious over Ellen hiring a non-union company to help her produce the show from her house, when her usual crew members have the same skills and are currently out of work.
The chat show host also hit headlines for all the wrong reasons last month, when YouTube star NikkieTutorials called her “cold” after she appeared on The Ellen Show earlier this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actors and musicians joined two former US presidents to try and lift morale and call for unity amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The messages were both universal and personal as the Call To Unite livestream, a 24-hour event, stretched into its second day.
Former US president Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey were among those who participated on Friday night, and Quincy Jones, Jennifer Garner, Common, Maria Shriver, Questlove, Yo-Yo Ma, were also participating in the event, being livestreamed at unite.us and on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, LinkedIn and SiriusXM Stars.
Director Lee Daniels, in an emotional message, talked about his past drug use during the Aids epidemic in the 1980s.
He talked about the pain of losing friends to the disease, which he said decimated the African-American gay community.
And he urged people not to resort to drug use during the current pandemic.
“Stay in the moment. Don’t use. Be safe.”
Eva Longoria cited the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi as she urged people to “be the change you want to see in the world”.
“We’re in a moment where we have a chance to reset and start anew,” she said.
She praised nurses and doctors especially for risking their lives to save others, and therapists donating services to tend to people’s mental health.
LeAnn Rimes sang There Will Be A Better Day.
On Friday evening, Winfrey said she keeps updated with coronavirus news, but has often focused her attention more on positive “acts of valour”.
Former president George W. Bush said: “Even at an appropriate social distance, we can find ways to be present in the lives of others to ease their anxiety and share their burdens.”
Mr Clinton delivered the message that “we can get through this together”.
Sean Combs said the pandemic was giving humanity a chance to unite.
“We don’t have to wait until the pandemic is over,” he said.
“This can come true right now.”
He urged people to “give someone an extra mask, check on an elderly neighbour”.
The event kicked off with a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.
Instead of performing collectively, each member clapped and danced individually in various places from inside their apartment, rooftop or park to the tune of Ailey’s Rocka My Soul In The Bosom Of Abraham.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Called social media sensations for trials to appear hands-on: Rijiju</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said that calling for urgent trials for social media sprint sensations, seen running with buffaloes, were decisions taken under pressure to appear hands-on in his job.
Kambala jockey Srinivas Gowda of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh’s Rameshwar Gurjar had hit national headlines last year for running in slushy and dusty fields respectively.
They were believed to have completed 100m sprints in 11 seconds, creating a flutter on social media platforms, where some dubbed them, one after another, the next Usain Bolt.
“In Madhya Pradesh, somebody had a video of a village boy’s running and posted it on social media, commented that he runs faster than Usain Bolt. When it became viral, I could have ignored it but suppose I don’t react on that time, people will say the sports minister is silent, is not taking cognizance,” he said.
In the trial though, Mr. Gurjar could not live up to the expectations and could barely complete the 100m distance in 12.9 seconds.
Mr. Rijiju added, “Shivraj Singh Chouhan also asked me to look into the matter. So I sent my SAI team to test the guy in Bhopal. I knew his capability but the country doesn’t know what is the nature of sports. People just started saying he runs faster than Bolt and that is because of lack of awareness.”
“During the test he wouldn’t even compete with the junior guys forget the seniors, he can’t run even 13 seconds flat in 100m. He never trained. He was 25-26, so age was also not on his side; he didn’t know how to wear spikes.”
Mr. Rijiju also spoke about the story around Mr. Gowda, whose exploits during a traditional buffalo race in Karnataka created a buzz on social media, forcing the Minister to call the 28-year-old for a trail at the SAI, Bengaluru centre.
This was after after video clips of him running a distance of 100 metres in just 9.55 seconds surfaced.
“Then 4-5 months back a news broke out that somebody broke Usain Bolt’s record in a bull race in Karnataka. Even some of the professional people, some of the businessmen, some of the renowned people of India stated that now this guy will bring Olympic gold in 100m,” Mr. Rijiju said.
“People must be thinking that what is the sports minister doing, he is responding to such kinds of amateur talks but I had to show sections who don’t know sports that I am hands on with Indian sports and I am there for the athletes. I will give all the opportunities to all potentials, so I had to show that,” he said.
The Minister said it’s high time people broaden their knowledge about sports other than cricket to enable India become a sporting powerhouse.
“Many people complained to me that government does not contribute enough for the development of sports in India. Let me make it very clear — knowledge about sports in India is very, very low. People know only about cricket, people don’t know about other sports,” Mr. Rijiju said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eddie Marsan recruits family to film TV scenes during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new TV series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers.
The Happy Go Lucky star and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting.
Marsan – whose career has seen him directed by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Mike Leigh – hailed his wife’s directorial debut.
He told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.”
Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom, but said she did not think she would start a new film career.
Marsan explained that he is due to appear in an episode entitled Karen, which sees him play a “heartbroken” man whose marriage has collapsed and is self-isolating at home with his two teenage sons.
His ex-partner’s father, played by actor David Threlfall, comes to his house to persuade him to let his former wife see the children.
Due to strict social-distancing rules, Threlfall had to remain in the Marsan family garden while performing his scenes.
“The whole premise is to tell stories about what’s happening in everyday people’s lives but within the context of isolation and the difficulties that that brings,” Marsan explained.
He said his children had grown up on film sets and he thought the challenge of helping film scenes at home would teach them to collaborate.
“They loved it. It was very hard work and they wanted to get off their school work, but we didn’t let them,” he said.
“So every time we said ‘cut’ and we had to change things, they had to go down and do some more work, and they wanted to just play on the Xbox or something. We didn’t let them.”
Isolation Stories airs at 9pm over four nights on ITV, starting on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eddie Marsan recruits family to film TV scenes during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new TV series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers.
The Happy Go Lucky star and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting.
Marsan – whose career has seen him directed by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Mike Leigh – hailed his wife’s directorial debut.
He told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.”
Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom, but said she did not think she would start a new film career.
Marsan explained that he is due to appear in an episode entitled Karen, which sees him play a “heartbroken” man whose marriage has collapsed and is self-isolating at home with his two teenage sons.
His ex-partner’s father, played by actor David Threlfall, comes to his house to persuade him to let his former wife see the children.
Due to strict social-distancing rules, Threlfall had to remain in the Marsan family garden while performing his scenes.
“The whole premise is to tell stories about what’s happening in everyday people’s lives but within the context of isolation and the difficulties that that brings,” Marsan explained.
He said his children had grown up on film sets and he thought the challenge of helping film scenes at home would teach them to collaborate.
“They loved it. It was very hard work and they wanted to get off their school work, but we didn’t let them,” he said.
“So every time we said ‘cut’ and we had to change things, they had to go down and do some more work, and they wanted to just play on the Xbox or something. We didn’t let them.”
Isolation Stories airs at 9pm over four nights on ITV, starting on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Monty Python star Michael Palin reveals he accidentally set fire to his house</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">He was rescued by an elderly neighbour.
Sir Michael Palin has revealed an elderly neighbour pulled him to safety after he accidentally set fire to his house while recovering from heart surgery.
The Monty Python star, 76, said he had open-heart surgery in September to repair two valves and was told by doctors to relax at home.
However, during his recovery he was doing breathing exercises and accidentally blew kitchen roll towards a naked flame and it caught fire.
Writing in Idler magazine, Sir Michael said: “I leapt up and grasped a hand towel, which briefly smothered the flames before itself catching alight.
“In some alarm now, as flames licked up towards the ceiling, I dialled the emergency services – but the moment we connected, the smoke alarm went off and I couldn’t hear a word they were saying.
“Just caught something about washing my hands which made me realise that, without my glasses on, I’d rung 111 instead of 999. But I washed my hands anyway, and by a fantastic stroke of luck, the loose tap that we never had fixed finally came apart, dousing the ceiling and partially extinguishing the fire.”
At that point, Sir Michael said, his 86-year-old neighbour – who had undergone heart surgery the previous week – wrenched open the window and pulled him to safety.
He added: “Thank God he’d been told to take it easy, otherwise he’d have been out playing golf and my house would have been a write-off.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) has went toe-to-toe with some nasty people during his time in Emmerdale, but he may well have met his match in sinister DI Malone (Mark Womack), who is determined to have him sent to prison at all costs — and it appears as if he might actually get his wish as, in the coming episodes, he sets the hard-man up.
Cain and Billy’s (Jay Kontzle) job for Malone gets underway, but Cain refuses to accept payment for the courier job, as the drug dealer finishes putting the package into his car.
Meanwhile, Will (Dean Andrews) finishes up his big job for Malone, but matters are complicated when he learns that Malone is not only intent on setting Billy and Cain up, but that he also plans to arrest them personally.
As Cain and Billy drive home on a country road, they discover a police car attempting to pull them over, and they’re all the more alarmed when they realise that Malone is in said vehicle.
Before long, they realise that the whole thing has been a set up.
Has Malone finally succeeded in teaching Cain who’s boss?
Will he put Cain behind bars?
It seems as if the dodgy detective has him exactly where he wants him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd wasn't like Ted from Scrubs - he loved his life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd may have been best known for playing beaten down lawyer Ted Buckland from Scrubs, but his character could not have been any further from the man the actor was in real life. 
Sam – also known for appearing in the likes of Seinfeld, The West Wing, Desperate Housewives, Flubber and Galaxy Quest – passed away at the age of 56, 16 months after he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.
Following the sad new of his death, his former Scrubs co-stars including Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke took to social media to share tributes to the much-loved actor, with the former saying ‘he could not have been a kinder man’.
Zach, who played JD on the show, tweeted: ‘Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
‘He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.’
A man who loved music, hugs, people and to laugh, Sam’s talent as an actor was proven by how well he could transform into someone that was so unlike himself. 
Speaking to news.com.au in September 2015, Sam admitted that playing such a downtrodden character had its pitfalls, with people on the street noticing how ‘well’ he looked out of character.
He said: ‘Very often, when people see me on the streets they would tell me it was great to see me looking so healthy.
‘Then there were people who just wanted to give me hugs because they felt so bad for me. I didn’t mind because I love hugs.’
Despite playing a character that battled depression and lived a difficult life, Sam said in an interview with the University Observer in 2013 that he ‘was able to keep a sense of humour about it, but after a while, you know, I was ready to be happy again.’
Although he found the role ‘tiring’, his optimism and enthusiasm for his career and craft meant that he still loved his job.
‘It was a blast,’ he said, ‘and you know, at the end of the day it was all for the fun, so it was great.’
While he considered himself lucky to have landed a role on such a popular and successful show, Sam also admitted that he was relieved when it was time to hang up Ted’s briefcase: ‘It was really fun, but after a few years of being sad all the time, I just wanted to be happy.’
On a GoFundMe for the actor, his friend Tim Hobert wrote that a new targeted therapy drug that the star had been taking had allowed Sam to share important moments with his family in the last year before his passing, including his only son’s first birthday. 
Tim said: ‘In the 13 months since Sam’s original diagnosis, with help from you guys (incredible people from all over the world), he has made the most of the time that he has been given. He was able to go back to his home state of Vermont and play his annual gig with his Beatles band, The Butties. He was able to do guest spots on Modern Family and American Housewife that allowed him to qualify for the Screen Actors Guild insurance policy.  
‘He was able to spend time with dear friends, help his mother in the last stages of her life, and sing for her at her funeral, and most importantly, he was able to spend time with his wife, Vanessa, and celebrate Weston’s first birthday!’
He also wrote: ‘For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment.
‘He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom’s hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, “he made music along the way.”’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd - the actor who played Ted in Scrubs - has died aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US ACTOR SAM Lloyd has died aged 56, a year and four months after he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. 
The actor was well-known for his portrayal of lawyer Ted Buckland in the long-running comedy series Scrubs.
He also appeared in a string of US shows in the past two decades, including The West Wing, Desperate Housewives, Modern Family and Malcolm in The Middle.
Away from acting, Lloyd was also an accomplished singer and musician and performed with the a cappella group The Blanks. 
Scrubs co-star Zach Braff paid tribute on Twitter, saying: “Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
Fellow Scrubs actor Robert Maschio described Lloyd as the “kindest man I ever met”.
A GoFundMe page to raise money for Sam Lloyd and his family has raised – at the time of writing – $171,000.
Lloyd was survived by his wife Vanessa and his one-year-old son Weston.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs Actor Sam Lloyd Has Died Aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd has died aged 56.
Lloyd is most well-known for playing hospital lawyer Ted Buckland in Scrubs. He appeared in 95 episodes of the series which ran from 2001 - 2009.
A career which began in the late 80s also saw him make appearances in Seinfeld, Mad About You, The West Wing, 3rd Rock From The Sun, Spin City, Desperate Housewives, Modern Family and Galaxy Quest.
He was also a member of a capella group The Blanks which appeared on Scrubs.
Entertainment Weekley reported that Llyod had been diagnosed with cancer in January 2019 when doctors discovered an inoperable brain tumour.
Actor Zach Braff, who was one of the main stars of Scrubs, paid tribute to Lloyd.
"Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with," Braff said on Twitter.
"Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence also paid tribute.
"Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today," he said.
"Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many.
"Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it - he had the biggest heart of all of us. But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"The man behind the world's first major computer virus outbreak has admitted his guilt, 20 years after his software infected millions of machines worldwide," reports the BBC: Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying. He claims he never intended it to spread globally.And he says he regrets the damage his code caused. "I didn't expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised," he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com, a forthcoming book on cyber-crime. The Love Bug pandemic began on 4 May, 2000. Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. It contained malicious code that would overwrite files, steal passwords, and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victim's Microsoft Outlook address book. Within 24 hours, it was causing major problems across the globe, reportedly infecting 45 million machines... He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims, with whom he communicated in chat rooms, because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area. However, in spring 2000 he tweaked the code, adding an auto-spreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims' Outlook contacts using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. "It's not really a virus," wrote CmdrTaco back on May 4, 2000. "It's a trojan that proclaims its love for the recipient and requests that you open its attachment. On a first date even! It then loves you so much that it sends copies of itself to everyone in your address book and starts destroying files on your drive..."Pine/Elm/Mutt users as always laugh maniacally as the trojan shuffles countless wasted packets over saturated backbones filling overworked SMTP servers everywhere. Sysadmins are seen weeping in the alleys."

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Go Buy Guns First’: John McAfee Warns Governments ‘Are Deceiving You’ About Virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government is deceiving you. The pandemic is a ploy spread by the fake-news media, and if you care about your lives, go out and buy guns now.
That was the message of John McAfee. Between evil laughs and dark chucklings, the tech guru, tax fugitive, and general wild man shared his suspect views on the “state of the world” during COVID-19 last night at Virtual Blockchain Week.
“We are living in a paradigm the world has never seen before,” the 74-year-old crypto advocate and antivirus-software pioneer said, speaking from God knows where.
(He’s kept his whereabouts a secret since fleeing Belize in 2012 after suspicions grew that he killed his neighbor.)
He was especially disturbed by a recent $2 trillion stimulus package in the US, which appears to be backed by nothing other than the good graces of the US government.
Bitcoin and blockchain were meant to “save us from financial slavery, and from the overburdened government that creates the fiat currency that we are forced to use,” McAfee said.
But he doesn’t think crypto will save us this time.
But as far as the markets go, he predicts that the price of Bitcoin will spike ahead of the halving event on May 12. He recalled that in 2016, the last halving event, there was a huge rise in the price of Bitcoin, and then a huge drop. And he believes history will repeat because the same people populate the cryptosphere, and they’re just as greedy as they were four years ago.
As far as the threat of COVID19, McAfee thinks the number of deaths are skewed because they are presented out of context. It is certainly not worth shutting down entire economies, he believes.
Repeatedly, he said more people die of diarrhea and of the flu. But both comparisons, common attempts to downplay the severity of the virus, have been widely dismissed as reckless by leading epidemiologists.
But the way McAfee, who is known for his drug use and paranoia, sees it—just before opening his talk, he jokingly commented he was getting ready to shoot up with heroin—we are being lied to by the government and stirred up by the media.
Due to the global shut down and the money printing, he believes dark times ahead for our species.
The solution?
And then McAfee, who appears to enjoy it when people think he is on edge, pulled out an AK-47 assault rifle and began praising its sturdiness.
“This sucker will always fire,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The late Bollywood icon Rishi Kapoor created a minor record even after his demise! Online search for the actor rose by 7000 per cent in India, and 6700 per cent globally after he passed away.
On April 30, a study by SEMrush found that fans posted 6,214 tweets on hashtag rishikapoor. Other hashtags, which were used included rishi_kapoor, riprishikapoor, riprishikapoorji, and riplegend. On these hashtags, fans tweeted 1,040 times, 995 times, 564 times, and 475 times respectively. A total of 14,394 tweets were posted about Rishi Kapoor on the day of his death.
The study further shared that the most used emoji was one expressing utter shock. 2,988 people used it. The second most used emoji was a broken heart. The third most used emoji was of a crying face with massive tears falling out of each eye. This emoji was used 961 times.
The fourth most used emoji was a tearful face with a single tear falling from the left eye. It was used 630 times. The fifth and sixth most used emojis were a bouquet and a broken black heart. Each emoji was used 556 and 484 times, respectively.
Speaking about the results, Mr. Fernando Angulo, Head of Communication, SEMrush said: “The news of Rishi Kapoor’s passing away was an unbelievable loss for entire Indian film industry. He was the true boy-next-door with a killer smile and dapper attire… While Rishi Kapoor will certainly be missed, his huge body of work remains and will ensure the actor continues to entertain audiences for generations to come”.
Rishi Kapoor passed away on April 30 after a two-year battle with cancer. The 67-year-old actor breathed his last at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital in Mumbai.
His death was confirmed Amitabh Bachchan, who had tweeted: “”T 3517 – He’s GONE .. ! Rishi Kapoor .. gone .. just passed away .. I am destroyed!,” Amitabh tweeted on Thursday.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Bug's creator tracked down to repair shop in Manila</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The man behind the world's first major computer virus outbreak has admitted his guilt, 20 years after his software infected millions of machines worldwide.
Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying.
He claims he never intended it to spread globally.
And he says he regrets the damage his code caused.
"I didn't expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised," he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com, a forthcoming book on cyber-crime.
The Love Bug pandemic began on 4 May, 2000.
Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. It contained malicious code that would overwrite files, steal passwords, and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victim's Microsoft Outlook address book.
Within 24 hours, it was causing major problems across the globe, reportedly infecting 45 million machines. It also overwhelmed organisations' email systems, and some IT managers disconnected parts of their infrastructure to prevent infection.
This led to estimates of damage and disruption running into billions of pounds.
In the UK, Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to protect itself, and even the Pentagon was reportedly affected.
The previous year, the Melissa bug is believed to have infected a million machines using similar tactics. However, Love Bug dwarfed previous outbreaks and exposed how vulnerable the world's increasing internet connectivity was to attack.
Investigators traced the virus to an email address registered to an apartment in Manila, capital of the Philippines.
The occupant's brother was Onel de Guzman, a computer science student at the city's AMA Computer College. He was a member of an underground hacking group called Grammersoft and quickly became the lead suspect in a police investigation.
De Guzman's lawyer organised a press conference on 11 May, at which de Guzman appeared to speak little English.
When asked whether he may have released the virus accidentally, de Guzman said: "It is possible."
At the time, the Philippines had no law covering computer hacking, and neither de Guzman nor anyone else was ever prosecuted.
Suspicion also fell on de Guzman's fellow student Michael Buen, who has been cited online as the co-author of the Love Bug.
I set out to track down Onel de Guzman and resolve the 20-year mystery of Love Bug's origin.
Online rumours claimed de Guzman had moved to Germany, Austria or the US. Some claimed he had been recruited by Microsoft following the outbreak. All proved to be wide of the mark.
On a forum dedicated to the Philippine underworld, a user claimed in 2016 that de Guzman ran a mobile phone repair shop in the Quiapo district of Manila. In April 2019, I visited the area hoping to encounter the suspect, only to find a sprawling market containing dozens of mobile phone repair shops.
I wrote Onel de Guzman's name on a piece of paper and showed it to shop workers at random in the hope that someone would recognise it. Finally an employee said he knew of de Guzman and believed he now worked in another phone repair booth at a shopping mall elsewhere in Manila.
After several hours wandering around the mall and showing de Guzman's name, I was directed to a cramped, messy stall at the very back of the building, and after waiting several hours for him to turn up, Onel de Guzman arrived.
He admitted having created Love Bug, which he said was a revamped version of an earlier virus he had coded in order to steal internet access passwords.
In the era of dial-up internet, such passwords were needed to get online, and de Guzman says he could not afford to pay for one.
He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims, with whom he communicated in chat rooms, because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area.
However, in spring 2000 he tweaked the code, adding an auto-spreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims' Outlook contacts, using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. He also created a title for the email attachment that would have global appeal, tempting people across the world to open it.
"I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that," he said.
De Guzman claims he sent the virus initially to someone in Singapore, and then went out drinking with a friend. The first he knew of the global chaos he had unleashed was when his mother told him police were hunting a hacker in Manila.
He explained that his mother hid his computer equipment. De Guzman insists Buen had nothing to do with Love Bug and that he was its sole creator.
After a period of lying low, de Guzman returned to computer work but did not go back to college. He now runs the small booth with another member of staff.
He says he regrets writing the virus, and the infamy it has brought him.
"Sometimes I get my picture on the internet," he said.
"My friends say, 'It's you!' I'm a shy person, I don't want this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby leaves Celebrity Juice after 12 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has confirmed that she has quit Celebrity Juice, saying “all good things must come to an end”.
The TV presenter, 39, has left her team captain role after 12 years on the ITV2 show.
Her friend Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series, starring Keith Lemon, 47, in 2018.
Willoughby said she had enjoyed “12 years of fantastic chaos…
“I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone,” she posted on Instagram.
“Thank you to you all for watching. We’ve always had the loudest and best audiences….
“It’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out,” the co-host of This Morning said.
“Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work…  All good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever.
“It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky, lucky person.”
She said of Lemon: “I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’. My goodness me it did.
“Three friends, you me and  Fearne Cotton … and that is what is at the heart of it, friendship. I love the bones of you Lemon!
“Thank you for making me laugh for 12 years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check.”
Lemon – real name Leigh Francis – wrote on Twitter: “I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby leaves Celebrity Juice after 12 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has confirmed that she has quit Celebrity Juice, saying “all good things must come to an end”.
The TV presenter, 39, has left her team captain role after 12 years on the ITV2 show.
Her friend Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series, starring Keith Lemon, 47, in 2018.
Willoughby said she had enjoyed “12 years of fantastic chaos…
“I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone,” she posted on Instagram.
“Thank you to you all for watching. We’ve always had the loudest and best audiences….
“It’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out,” the co-host of This Morning said.
“Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work…  All good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever.
“It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky, lucky person.”
She said of Lemon: “I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’. My goodness me it did.
“Three friends, you me and  Fearne Cotton … and that is what is at the heart of it, friendship. I love the bones of you Lemon!
“Thank you for making me laugh for 12 years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check.”
Lemon – real name Leigh Francis – wrote on Twitter: “I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Desi Girl Priyanka Chopra is now a global superstar. The actress works both in India and the US and is definitely the best of both the worlds and needless to say, Priyanka has a huge fan following across the world.
Recently, Priyanka Chopra’s fans have been shocked as a man claimed he was the first one to marry the actor, though by mistake. Brandon Schuster introduces himself as a film and TV lover and shared a throwback picture with Priyanka Chopra after he garlanded her while welcoming her at an event and realized it was one of the rituals of a Hindu wedding.
Sharing a picture of himself with Priyanka Chopra, Brandon Tweeted, “I got ‘married’ to Priyanka Chopra in 2014. I put two flower leis on her to welcome her to a ‘green carpet’ event in Tampa. Little did I know that symbolizes ‘marriage’ in Indian culture. The Indian press had a field day with it and I was giving exclusive interviews the next day.”
His reply about Priyanka Chopra being his wife came in response to American TV personality Chrissy Teigen’s tweet in which she asked, “Have you ever been famous but for like 1 minute? a talking head on an infomercial, in the background of a big movie? something u share with people at dinner parties but it’s so stupid..I would like to see it.”
Take a look at the tweets:
While a few fans laughed over the picture. A Priyanka Chopra fan wrote, “Not exactly but haha.” Another commented, “nick is shaking” with several laughing emojis.
For the unversed, Priyanka Chopra is married to American singer-actor Nick Jonas and the couple resides in Los Angeles. The two had tied the knot in a grand wedding ceremony at the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur in December 2018.
We wonder what Priyanka has to say about these bizarre claims of this man on social media!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As many businesses and activities shut down across the world in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus, Denmark has found a way to introduce live concerts without breaking the social distance regulations.
In the city of Aarhus, Denmark, hundreds of people attended a sold-out live concert with performance from Danish singer-songwriter Mads Langer. The drive-thru event was held at a newly constructed venue just outside the city.
With police and health officials giving the concert a nod of approval, the event sold 500 tickets in just minutes and went off without a hitch.
The attendees drove into the arena and parked in marked spots before the singer’s performance was streamed to vehicles through FM Radio signals. The attendees also had the chance to get up close with the singer through Zoom video conferencing.
“I’ve played many concerts in my life, but this is really a first,” Langer said, through an audio feed broadcast over very limited FM radio frequency into fans’ cars.
According to local newspaper Jyllands-Posten, a police officer confirmed that the event went smoothly :
The concert was the first in a series of performances at the space on the outskirts of the city, with the stage also doubling as a drive-in film theatre on other nights.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: B.C. halfway to goal of single-site jobs for care home staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">B.C.’s health ministry, employers and unions are past the half-way point of a massive staff reorganization that ends part-time work for senior care aides at multiple sites, Health Minister Adrian Dix says.
Staff movement has been a source of infection outbreaks in the COVID-19 pandemic, with the earliest and deadliest senior home outbreaks in North Vancouver and Vancouver traced to part-time employees. Dix announced April 9 that the policy would be imposed province-wide, with an estimated payroll cost of $10 million a month to provide stable employment for care aides.
Dix reported April 30 that the half-way point has been reached, for a task that has reached beyond senior care homes. He said it involves 45,000 employees at long-term care, assisted living, private hospitals and mental health facilities.
“Of those 45,000 employees, there are or were 7,350 employees who had jobs at multiple facilities,” Dix said, adding that there are 545 facilities that host multi-facility employees in all of B.C.’s regional health authorities.
So far 276 of those facilities have implemented their “single-site plan” for employees, Dix said, 43 in Interior Health, 40 in Fraser Health, 103 in Vancouver Coastal Health, 64 in Island Health and 26 in Northern Health.
Quebec has followed B.C.’s lead in stabilizing staff after a crisis in senior care homes, with novel coronavirus infections in more than 500 of them and some abandoned by staff. Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been called in to do cleaning and other jobs at Quebec care facilities.

Doctors, nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians continue to be allowed to work in multiple facilities, which have increased cleaning and sharply restricted visitors to prevent further infections among high-risk residents and patients.
Dix and Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie have pushed for improved working conditions for care aides, where there was a chronic shortage of skilled help before the coronavirus pandemic.
In B.C., the changes are being made “within the existing blended service delivery model of health-authority owned and operated, affiliates and private providers,” accommodating employee preferences in where they work as far as possible, Dix said April 9. “And it ensures that all of them receive an equitable wage and scheduling stability so they can work at a single site without financial hardship or patient service disruption.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anushka Sharma: One Of The Underrated Style Icons Of Bollywood- A Quick Quarantine Saturday Read</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever seen closely how Anushka Sharma carries herself? Followed her style mantra? If not, then this would be an ideal piece to read on a locked down Saturday!
I once asked singer Kanika Kapoor (Yes, the one who has become more famous for her COVID-19 case than Baby Doll Main Sone Di) during one of our chats on fashion and style, that who according to her is the most underrated actress when it comes to vogue, and she named Anushka Sharma.
Indeed, she is. Anushka Sharma's styling is carefree, effortless and very you and me. During travel, you will not see her dress up for an 'Airport Look', while chilling with her husband at home, you will not see her dressed because the picture will go on social media. On red caprets, you will not see her attempt a look because it's in trend or because she has to make a statement. 
Anushka is fierce when it comes to donning what she feels like wearing at that moment. Most of her red carpet outfits have always landed in my Best Dressed list and guess what? I realised that while writing this piece- anymore example of the actress' understated fashion icon image? 
As someone who likes to follow fashion and trends, names like Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, pop up high on my list of fashionistas, however, if you ask me about relatable styling, Anushka Sharma and Alia Bhatt are two names which top that list.
Yes, Anushka does have her own brand of clothes, Nush, yet the actress has never presented herself as the epitome of vogue. Wonder if that's got to do with the many other roles she plays in her real life- an actor, producer, wife, animal welfare woker. 
Nonetheless, when you think of Fashion icons from Bollywood, trust this lady's name to be there for sure because Anushka has made a mark for herself in the segment quietly but strongly!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Georgina breaks the internet by hanging up washing in thong!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Georgina has done it again. Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend has set social media alight by showing her behind whilst doing a daily task: hanging up washing.
Well yes, it seems that Georgina Rodríguez's buttock workouts are working. Cristiano's partner does not miss her routines to reggaetón music, either alone or in the company of the forward or one of her children, and the result is obvious. 
That the model lights up social media now isn't news, with her famous exercises or with revealing photographs in a bikini, but she has done it again and this time she surprised again, because of her clothes... or rather, lack of them.
And it's not easy to get more than 2.7 million likes on Instagram with a post doing something as routine as hanging up the washing, but if you are Georgina and do it in a thong then things change.

"Airborne wipes" Ronaldo's girlfriend wrote, who boasted an enviable figure and buttocks, along with a peach and bomb emoji.
On Saturday, the model made the most of the sunny day to go to the mountains with Ronaldo and the players' eldest son, Cristiano Jr and put it on her Instagram the same as the forward.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain’s Got Talent Judges wowed by 96-year-old singer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 96-year-old has wowed Britain’s Got Talent – getting the seal of approval from the judges.
Nora Barton, from West Yorkshire, took to the stage at the London Palladium.
Her daughter told the audience: “She’s sung for people all her life so at 96 this is a treat, this stage”.
After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and a huge cheer from the audience, Barton, who wore a flower in her hair and dressed in red, said: “Thank you very much”
Judge David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you’re full of life, laughter and joy and have entertained the nation at 96.”
Amanda Holden said it was a “very special audition” adding: “You’re a generation this country is built on.”
Simon Cowell said: “I didn’t like you very much – I loved you! I think we’ve got about 4,000 yeses Nora.”
Barton, who sang Loveliest Night of The Year, said she was “very pleased” to have been at the auditions.
The ITV show was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic and live episodes have been postponed.
Saturday’s show also featured mother and daughter duo Sammy, 43, and Honey, 14.
Honey said the pair had experienced a “tough” couple of years because “my mum got diagnosed with cancer. ”
Sammy said she is now “absolutely fine” and Honey told the judges: “I’m so grateful for everything. I never thought that when singing along in the car it would bring us to this stage.”
After Cowell told the pair to return with a different song, they impressed the judges with a “faultless” performance.
Holden pressed the golden buzzer, saying, “It was the most wonderful thing to witness”, with Cowell adding: “I’m going to remember that audition for a long, long time.”
The show also featured a children’s choir from Hampshire who performed a song about climate change.
“You are exactly what I was hoping we would find this year,” Cowell said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In Pictures: Princess Charlotte turns five</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte, known for being one of the feistiest of the Queen’s great-grandchildren, is celebrating turning five.
Charlotte has been seen in recent weeks enthusiastically clapping for carers as the Cambridge family stay at their Anmer Hall mansion in Norfolk during the coronavirus pandemic.
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Over the past year, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed that her daughter, whom she has been heard referring to by the nickname “Lottie”, was “pretty good” with spicy food, and also liked olives.
One of Charlotte’s favourite books as a toddler was Julia Donaldson’s classic The Gruffalo, and the princess loves horses, just like her great-grandmother the Queen.
William and Kate’s middle child was born at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lbs 3oz.
Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge was shown to the world the steps of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, the same day.
Since her last birthday, Charlotte has joined her family to explore Kate’s Back To Nature garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Prince George and Charlotte took off their shoes and paddled barefoot in the stream during their May excursion, with the princess shouting “Ooh la la” as she waded through the water.

When William asked Charlotte “Will you help George?”, the princess retorted “no” before skipping off.
In June, the Cambridge children gathered with their parents on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour, with Charlotte waving her arms around to greet the crowds.
The fourth in line to the throne also had fun at the King’s Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in July.
She was spotted poking her tongue out during the presentation ceremony after her mother had encouraged her to wave.
The princess’s big day came in September when she started school.
She arrived for her first day with her parents and George, looking a little nervous at first as she fiddled with her pony tail, but excited as she met her headteacher.
The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.

She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.
But the duchess confessed it was “challenging” and admitted she kept her children in class during the Easter holidays to give their days “structure”.
She said it was not all “hardcore” as she found fun activities online and the children had been baking, cooking and pitching tents in the garden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In Pictures: Princess Charlotte turns five</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young royal was born on May 2 2015 and is fourth in line to the throne.
Princess Charlotte, known for being one of the feistiest of the Queen’s great-grandchildren, is celebrating turning five.
Charlotte has been seen in recent weeks enthusiastically clapping for carers as the Cambridge family stay at their Anmer Hall mansion in Norfolk during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the past year, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed that her daughter, whom she has been heard referring to by the nickname “Lottie”,  was “pretty good” with spicy food, and also liked olives.
One of Charlotte’s favourite books as a toddler was Julia Donaldson’s classic The Gruffalo, and the princess loves horses, just like her great-grandmother the Queen.
William and Kate’s middle child was born at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lbs 3oz.
Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge made her debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, the same day.
Since her last birthday, Charlotte has joined her family to explore Kate’s Back To Nature garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Prince George and Charlotte took off their shoes and paddled barefoot in the stream during their May excursion, with the princess shouting “Ooh la la” as she waded through the water.
When William asked Charlotte “Will you help George?”, the princess retorted “no” before skipping off.
In June, the Cambridge children gathered with their parents on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour, with Charlotte waving her arms around to greet the crowds.
The fourth in line to the throne also had fun at the King’s Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in July.
She was spotted poking her tongue out during the presentation ceremony after her mother had encouraged her to wave.
The princess’s big day came in September when she started school.
She arrived for her first day with her parents and George, looking a little nervous at first as she fiddled with her pony tail, but excited as she met her headteacher.
The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.
She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby confirms she has quit ITV show after 12 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years on the ITV2 show.
The TV presenter, 39, has left her team captain role saying "all good things must come to an end".
Her friend Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series, starring Keith Lemon, 47, in 2018.
Holly said she had enjoyed "12 years of fantastic chaos...
She posted on Instagram: "I can't quite believe what we've done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching. We've always had the loudest and best audiences....
"It's never felt like work and always been to me like a night out," the co-host of This Morning said.
"Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... All good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever.
"It's time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky, lucky person."
She said of Keith: "I remember starting this journey with you and saying 'I think this might work'. My goodness me it did.
"Three friends, you me and Fearne Cotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it, friendship. I love the bones of you Lemon!
"Thank you for making me laugh for 12 years... I'll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check."
Keith - real name Leigh Francis - wrote on Twitter: "I've had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I'm lucky enough to work with you again one day."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's heartfelt message as she quits Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby's paid an emotional tribute to her co-stars and fans as she quit Celebrity Juice.
The This Morning star has been a team captain on the ITV2 show - which is fronted by Keith Lemon - since it started more than 12 years ago.
Holly, 39, said in her announcement on Instagram that "all good things must come to an end" and that "nothing lasts for ever."
Alongside a collage of photos from her time on the panel show, she wrote to her 6.6m followers: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos...
"I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences."
The mum-of-three goes on to say: "It's never felt like work and always been to me like a night out... Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever...
"It's time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person... whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest... @keithlemon ..."
Paying tribute to the show's host she continued: "Where to begin... I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’... my goodness me it did... three friends, you me and @fearnecotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship... I love the bones of you Lemon!
"Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years... I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check...
"If I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart...," she ended the post in a nod to Keith's show phrase.
Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series back in 2018.
Keith responded to the post: "I’m in tears x"
And fans are gutted she's leaving the chaotic show too.
"Won't be the same without you Holly," one said.
Another commented: "Always loved the show! Not been the same without Fearne and will be even worse without you Holly."
"Noooooooooooooooo this can’t be won’t be the same," echoed a third.
Keith had already paid tribute to Holly before her announcement with a rather sweary video clip that he shared on Instagram.
In the short clip, Keith is seen reacting in shock as Holly screamed “F***!” at the camera.
He captioned the video: "Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.
"A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at. Don't look into her eyes though, cos she can make you do anything. What a lady!"
He added: "The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of... well me I guess."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOLLY Willoughby has paid a heartfelt tribute to Celebrity Juice and its host Keith Lemon after quitting the show.
The TV star shared a collection of her best times with Keith on Instagram and wrote how "all good things must come to an end".
She said: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos... I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching.. we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.

Holly told her yet to be named successor they were in for an incredible time.

Last night The Sun exclusively revealed quit the comedy game show after 12 years.
The TV presenter, 39, who has three children with her producer husband Dan Baldwin, 45, wants to spend more time with her family.
Holly told the ITV2 show’s producers about her decision last week after filming several lockdown editions with host Leigh Francis, 47.
Since launching the panel series in 2008 Holly — mum to Harry, ten, Belle, eight, and Chester, five — has become one of the UK’s most successful female TV presenters.
She fronts ITV daytime show This Morning, alongside Phillip Schofield, 58, and filled in for Ant McPartlin, 44, two years ago on I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here.
Holly’s decision to quit Celebrity Juice comes after pal and fellow panellist Fearne Cotton, 38, left the series in 2018 to focus on new projects.
A TV source said: “Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show — it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.
“She’s still the best of pals with Leigh Francis and will continue to support the series.”
Yesterday comic Leigh posted a touching tribute to the star on his alias Keith Lemon’s Instagram page.
He wrote: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in.
“One of the boys but all woman. A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at.
“Don’t look into her eyes though, ’cos she can make you do anything. What a lady! King of the ladies!
“The queen of the milk beasts! The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of . . . well me I guess.
"Super rad! Super nice! My mate!
“I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Holly replied: “Aww . . .  what a lovely thing to say . . .  love you Lemon.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'It's just scary': Kylie Jenner says the coronavirus hits 'close to home' in the latest KUWTK trailer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” won’t be back until September, but a recently released trailer revealed some of the topics the show will be taking on next season, including the coronavirus pandemic.
The trailer, which gives a sneak peek of the show’s 19th season, broaches the topic with a voiceover of Kim who says, “The White House said that the coronavirus is serious,” over ominous music. The trailer also mentions the Los Angeles stay-at-home order, which went into effect on March 19.
It also includes a clip of Kylie Jenner telling the camera that the coronavirus pandemic hits “close to home,” though the clip doesn’t offer any more details into what the Kylie Cosmetics founder meant.
“It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive,” she said.
In recent weeks, many celebrities tested positive for COVID-19, including Tom Hanks, Pink, and Idris Elba.
It appears season 19 will touch on the ways the Kardashian family has been affected by the pandemic. One clip shows Scott Disick saying he’s going a bit stir crazy, and another shows a tearful Kris Jenner telling Khloe over the phone she wishes she could hug her.
The trailer also features non-coronavirus-related clips, including Kris and Disick pulling a prank and the family speculating about whether Khloe has hooked up with ex Tristan Thompson.
“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” will return to E! in September. You can watch the trailer for season 19 here:

    <h5 class="mb-1">'It's just scary': Kylie Jenner says the coronavirus hits 'close to home' in the latest KUWTK trailer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” won’t be back until September, but a recently released trailer revealed some of the topics the show will be taking on next season, including the coronavirus pandemic.
The trailer, which gives a sneak peek of the show’s 19th season, broaches the topic with a voiceover of Kim who says, “The White House said that the coronavirus is serious,” over ominous music. The trailer also mentions the Los Angeles stay-at-home order, which went into effect on March 19.
It also includes a clip of Kylie Jenner telling the camera that the coronavirus pandemic hits “close to home,” though the clip doesn’t offer any more details into what the Kylie Cosmetics founder meant.
“It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive,” she said.
In recent weeks, many celebrities tested positive for COVID-19, including Tom Hanks, Pink, and Idris Elba.
It appears season 19 will touch on the ways the Kardashian family has been affected by the pandemic. One clip shows Scott Disick saying he’s going a bit stir crazy, and another shows a tearful Kris Jenner telling Khloe over the phone she wishes she could hug her.
The trailer also features non-coronavirus-related clips, including Kris and Disick pulling a prank and the family speculating about whether Khloe has hooked up with ex Tristan Thompson.
“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” will return to E! in September. You can watch the trailer for season 19 here:

    <h5 class="mb-1">People are filming their DIY haircuts and showing viewers how to trim bangs during as part of a new — and nerve-wracking — TikTok beauty trend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As hair salons around the US remain closed, and with many major in-person gatherings on hold, it’s only human nature that some people are finding themselves tempted to grab the scissors and snip away at their locks – whether out of boredom, or in the name of self-care.
Celebrities like Hilary Duff and Dua Lipa have experimented with neon hair colours at home, and Bella Hadid apparently even got to the point of cutting her own bangs.
As of lately, quarantine haircuts have taken over TikTok, with many creators on the video platform documenting their at-home hair transformations. Some of the videos are purely entertaining, with users poking fun at the “trend” that has become of DIY haircuts in the midst of the pandemic.
However, other TikTok users are making instructional videos on how they have cut their own hair. Here, one user shows how they trimmed excess hair at an angle to finish their newly cut bangs.
User Marresa Kazem, who makes beauty tutorials on TikTok, showed users early in March how she gives her locks a trim with damp hair, a comb, and proper scissors.
Some creators seem to be using a twisting technique to trim their bangs, which involves gathering pieces at the front of the head, twirling them together, and carefully trimming starting at the bottom.
Insider previously spoke to hair professionals who each agreed that while a seemingly simple hair trim seems innocent, it’s best left to the experts.
Any damage done by at-home treatments, whether it’s a chemical hair dye or a trim gone wrong, could be expensive and time-consuming to reverse or fix at a future appointment, said Houston, Texas-based CHI hairstylist and colorist Joy Williams.
“Stylists can do anything with healthy hair,” Williams said, saying that even if people can’t get to a salon in the desired amount of time, there are alternatives to DIY hair trimming that are less damaging and can still make people feel like their hair has a new look or feel.
One way to give hair a refresh, Williams said, is to steer clear of permanent dye, chemical treatments, and hot tools while at home.
“Now is the perfect time to do hair masks and conditioning at home, so when you get back to your stylist, you’ll spend less time and money repairing it,” Williams said.
In other words, when it comes to taking the scissors to your hair, if you’re not a trained professional, “it can wait,” Williams said.
Nisa Anderson, a hairstylist and salon owner in Hollywood, California, said that now is the perfect time for people to embrace their natural hair through protective hairstyles and by giving their hair a break from harsh treatments.
“Whatever it takes to lay off the heat can really be beneficial for all hair types,” Anderson said.
Here, TikTok users showed fans how using headbands and bobby pins can help create the illusion of bangs, or a completely new haircut, without any trims.
Even for people at home who have their heart set on emerging from quarantine with a new hairstyle, trying one of the faux-bangs tricks from TikTok might be a good place to start.
It’s safe to say that DIY bangs and haircuts aren’t the biggest issues on anyone’s plate.
But based on the popularity of hair tutorials posted on TikTok during the past two months – some with hundreds and thousands of views and “likes” – plenty of people have qualms about overdue haircuts, and many are finding comfort and joy in an uncertain time by switching up their hair.
Of course, taking steps to feel put-together at home is not something everybody has the privilege of doing, during quarantine and otherwise. That being said, one hairstylist said that in her opinion, people should not feel guilty for thinking about their hair.
Shvonne Perkins, who leads the training and education program at Madison Reed, which specialises in at-home hair colour kits and resources, previously told Insider that people should be empowered to maintain whatever part of their beauty regimen they can at home.
“I think it sort of just comes down to a moment of taking this time for yourself,” Perkins said. “Likely, where [people] are right now is that they’re not able to access their normal beauty routines. I think it’s totally accessible and really necessary to treat yourself and do any of those things that make you feel like yourself, or feel most in touch with the best version of yourself.”
Perkins continued, saying: “Everything feels so out of control, and this is one thing where it’s like, ‘I’m going to do this for myself. I can control this element of how I look and how I feel.'”

"I think it sort of just comes down to a moment of taking this time for yourself," Perkins said. "Likely, where [people] are right now is that they're not able to access their normal beauty routines. I think it's totally accessible and really necessary to treat yourself and do any of those things that make you feel like yourself, or feel most in touch with the best version of yourself."
Perkins continued, saying: "Everything feels so out of control, and this is one thing where it's like, 'I'm going to do this for myself. I can control this element of how I look and how I feel.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte is often compared to a young Prince William, but fans are saying she looks just like one of her distant relatives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte turned 5 years old on Saturday, and with her birthday came a new round of royal photographs taken by Kate Middleton herself.
In the photos that were released to mark her birthday, Princess Charlotte is shown helping her family deliver packages of meals to people in need. The young royal also posed for a formal portrait, which was also taken by the Duchess of Cambridge.
Photos of Princess Charlotte, the middle child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are often compared to pictures of Prince William from when he was around the same age.
Prince William once even confused a childhood photo of himself for a picture of his daughter.
However, Princess Charlotte’s latest birthday portraits have brought to light another royal lookalike – one of her older cousins, Lady Sarah Chatto.
Lady Sarah Chatto is the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister. This makes Lady Sarah Chatto a niece of the Queen, and a second cousin of Princess Charlotte.
Above, a photo from around 1969 shows a young Lady Sarah Chatto (then Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones) with her brother, Viscount Linley.
Princess Charlotte looked especially similar to her cousin when she wore a similar green coat and even, ironically, had her hair styled in a similar fashion during the family’s Christmas celebrations in 2019.
Other photos of young Lady Sarah Chatto resemble Princess Charlotte’s signature cheeky facial expressions and bashful waves.
Another interesting detail about the two distant cousins is that Lady Sarah Chatto’s birthday is May 1, and Princess Charlotte’s birthday is May 2. The cousins are some 51 years apart in age, but photos of the two taken around the same time of their lives have some pretty uncanny similarities.
In addition to Lady Sarah Chatto and Prince William, pictures of Princess Charlotte have also been compared to childhood photos of her great-grandma Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana, and Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake Gyllenhaal whispered to his rising homemade bread, and people are raving about the actor's sourdough starter expertise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jake Gyllenhaal and host Stephen Colbert recently bonded over their newfound affinity for making bread from scratch.
It’s no wonder that the actor and late-night TV show host have taken to making their own bread, as it’s recently become a popular pastime. Some people are turning loaves into edible works of art, while others have gotten creative by trying bread recipes that don’t require a sourdough starter.
In an episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that was released on Wednesday, Gyllenhaal talked about how he got his start with the art of homemade bread-making, and he appeared to whisper to his rising loaf of bread.
“I’ve found myself falling in love with sourdough,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “I have a good friend who’s a baker in San Francisco . . . we were talking, and I hate this, but I was like, ‘Can you teach me how to do a sourdough starter?’ And off I went.”
Colbert then showed Gyllenhaal his container of sourdough bread starter, which was in a plastic container.
He asked Gyllenhaal for baking advice: “Now what do I do?”
Gyllenhaal responded by lifting a rising loaf of homemade bread to the camera.
“To go from that, to this, which is resting. It’s not yet fully rising, but it’s on its way,” Gyllenhaal said in a whisper.
“What I do with it, is I take the starter, and then you have to get a nicer wheat flour,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “You make what they call, in America, a pre-ferment. You let that rest for 12 to 24 hours, and then, you can start mixing it up into some other flour, and then make your dough.”
Gyllenhaal’s soothing yet serious way of tending to his rising sourdough – and the nearly five minutes of the episode he spent talking about bread – seemed to capture the hearts of fans and viewers of the show.
Gyllenhaal also spoke to Colbert about his performance in a musical tribute to Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, as well as his attempt at the T-Shirt handstand challenge after being tagged by his “Spider-Man: Far From Home” costar Tom Holland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A YouTuber tricked celebrities into thinking they were appearing on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTuber Josh Pieters has had to be inventive when coming up with his social experiments during lockdown in the UK, as everything, from formulating the plan to setting it in motion, has to be done from his home in London.
However, thanks to the sudden boom in video calling, he managed to convince celebrities they were appearing on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”
Pieters scraped many of Corden’s old interviews and video segments for sound bites and collected enough to make one side of a believable conversation. There was obviously no video feed, but the guests were told they would be chaperoned by the show’s producer, who was convincingly played by Pieters’ friend and sidekick Archie Manners.
Celebrities and their managers were none the wiser, as so many late night show hosts have been doing interviews from their own homes.
In the first of three videos in the series, British pop star Craig David and the UK’s biggest TikTok star Holly Hubert,who goes by Holly H, were interviewed. While Pieters took care of the voice notes to try and come up with a coherent flow of conversation, Manners kept things moving in his own flat across town, with the help of an imaginary assistant named “Sharon.”
They were also treated to exclusive performances. David sang one of his biggest hits, “Rise and Fall,” while Hubert demonstrated the viral TikTok dance the Renegade.
“As you know, the ‘Late Late Show with James Corden’ is on TV every night, so it’s only right that our show does the same,” Pieters said at the end of the video.
The second video featured Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” and magician Julius Dein, and was posted on Saturday.
Dein sneaked in a flogging attempt for his magic box, while the couple were asked how they were getting on in quarantine.
The grand finale will air on Sunday, which you will definitely want to tune in for.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Hemsworth said co-star Tiffany Haddish ripped apart a script because it didn't properly portray a strip club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a recent interview on The Ellen Show, “Thor” actor Chris Hemsworth talked about the upcoming movie he’s starring in with comedian Tiffany Haddish, and said that working together revealed to him Haddish’s strip-club acumen.
The movie, called “Down Under Cover,” is an action-meets-comedy about a detective duo, Hemsworth and Haddish, who are tasked with shutting down multiple casino heists. Hemsworth’s character has to go undercover as a male stripper because they believe Australian male strippers are running the heists.
“Love her work. She’s hilarious,” Hemsworth said of his co-star. “What I didn’t know was how versed she was in the world of stripping, particularly male stripping, and she’s been to many a male strip club.”
Hemsworth said that once he and Haddish were given their scripts, she immediately “ripped the script apart” because it didn’t portray male strip clubs correctly. She pointed out parts of the plot, saying “this would never happen” and explained what the experience would be like in real life, Hemsworth told Degeneres.
Degeneres said she wasn’t surprised that Haddish was well-versed in strip clubs and said that the production was lucky to have her perspective.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. — Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.
The impact left him with a gash on his head and other injuries. His agent told Variety that Pantoliano was taken to a nearby hospital.
A post on Instagram showed Pantoliano with stitches in his head and giving a thumbs-up sign. It read, “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”
Pantoliano played mobster Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series and has appeared in “The Matrix,” and other films including “Bad Boys,” “Risky Business,” “The Fugitive” and “Midnight Run.”

Pantoliano played mobster Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series and has appeared in The Matrix, and other films including Bad Boys, Risky Business, The Fugitive and Midnight Run.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. — Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.
The impact left him with a gash on his head and other injuries. His agent told Variety that Pantoliano was taken to a nearby hospital.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal drama ‘All Rise’ adapts to coronavirus pandemic for season finale | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES >> The legal drama “All Rise” has become the first U.S. scripted television series to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic by producing an episode remotely, enlisting its stars to work from home on their own makeup, set design and lighting.
The season finale, airing Monday night on CBS, finds Simone Missick’s Judge Lola Carmichael presiding over a Los Angeles Superior Court bench trial via video conference.
Missick said she was exhausted at the end of each shooting day after making her own adjustments to costume and sound, converting her living room into an office and her dining room into a court room.
“I did pick up new skills. I think that I could be a location scout-slash-set design coordinator. I don’t need to lead the department, but I could be in the background,” Missick laughed in a Zoom interview. “So if this acting stuff doesn’t work out, I could maybe pick up a career doing it virtually because that was the fun part.”
While most full-season shows cut production short due to stay-home orders, “All Rise” creator Greg Spottiswood said he realized that the dialogue-heavy nature of his show allowed for remote production. A key challenge — predicting how the legal world would adjust to the novel coronavirus, with prisons becoming outbreak hotspots and video chats replacing in-court hearings.
“The justice system needs to find a way to respond to this moment. Technology is one of the ways that they’re responding to it,” he said.
Spottiswood said producers paid the full crew, even those that weren’t able to work, for the episode. While the show could produce more episodes remotely in a second season if necessary, he’s anxious to get back to sets and real-world locations.
Missick said her mother-in-law in Atlanta had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for eight days, with symptoms serious enough to require a ventilator. She had fully recovered by the time Missick began shooting, but it brought the coronavirus crisis close to home for the 38-year-old actress.
In her downtime after production, Missick has enjoyed Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and the Netflix series “Unorthodox.” But she’s been struck by how far away from today’s reality the action on the screen can feel.
“Everything is BC. It’s ‘before coronavirus.’ You’re watching people — they’re in restaurants, they’re hugging each other. You’re like, ‘God, I remember what that was like.’ Now, I think every show that comes after is going to have to deal with what this pandemic is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vanessa Bryant posted a sweet tribute to her late daughter Gigi on what would have been her 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”
Vanessa wrote in a follow-up post that her daughter “loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures,” and wanted people to “commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She posted a picture of a red bracelet with the words Gigi’s name and her nickname, “Mambacita,” writing that it will soon be on sale, the proceeds of which would benefit the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which was started in their memory.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
captionMarty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels to 2015 in 1989’s “Back to the Future Part II.”
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson is best known for portraying 'The Mountain' in hit TV series Game of Thrones but he was not playing around on Saturday.
The 2018 World's Strongest Man winner set a world record with a 501-kilogram deadlift in front of a small gathering of people in a Reykjavik gym.
After lifting 420kg and 465kg in his first two attempts, the 6ft 9in, 200kg bodybuilder made history.
Bjornsson appeared to complete the deadlift comfortably and after locking into position the iron was thrown to the floor.
"I'm absolutely speechless. I'm just so happy and thankful that I got the opportunity to do this, even though the world is going through what it's going through," said Bjornsson.
"Everything went according to plan. I'm over the moon.
"I believe today I could've done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this, my family and friends were happy with this and I decided to call it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Believe women? Sure, say Democrats, but vet their claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — “Believe women” was never a call to believe all women automatically.
That’s what leading Democrats, including the prominent figures of the #MeToo movement, are suggesting as they stand behind former Vice-President Joe Biden and his bid to unseat President Donald Trump. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the female senators who ran for president and prominent Hollywood activists, they’re not backing down after Biden on Friday publicly denied a former aide’s accusation that he assaulted her in 1993.
“It never happened,” Biden said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “Believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward, and then vet it, look into it. That’s true in this case as well. … But in the end, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is the claims are false.”
It was largely the denial Democrats were hoping for.
Even so, there was a clear discomfort and perhaps resentment with being on defence on the issue while campaigning against a president accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct. (Trump has denied the allegations.) Especially galling to some is the charge by Republicans that Democrats are giving Biden a pass they didn’t afford Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault when they were teenagers.
Pelosi, the nation’s highest-ranking Democrat, recognized the maw and curtly stepped around it.
“I don’t need a lecture or a speech,” she said at her weekly news conference as she cut into a reporter’s question about a double standard. “With all the respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, I have the highest regard for Joe Biden. And that’s what I have to say about that.”
Others have been less succinct. Actress and leading #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano sat behind Kavanaugh during his televised confirmation hearings, a position she sought as a way to stand in “solidarity” with Blasey Ford.
But as the Reade allegations swirled around Biden and a party finally uniting around him, Milano penned an essay for Deadline.com in which she acknowledged “shades of gray” and reiterated her support for the former vice-president.
“Believing women was never about ‘Believe all women no matter what they say,’ it was about changing the culture of NOT believing women by default,” Milano wrote.
Karen Finney, a prominent Democratic strategist and message-maker who worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, rejected the Kavanaugh comparison outright.
In the context of sexual assault allegations, Finney said “believe women” doesn’t mean accepting as fact any assertion, but instead means affording women the default credibility to take claims seriously.
“If you start from the premise that this person is telling the truth, then you do the investigation and look at the facts,” she said, “and if the facts tell a different story, then that’s an important conversation to have.”
Biden’s supporters in the Senate, too, have stood by him, including some who challenged him for the nomination and are now said to be on his short list for a running mate.
But a few hours after his appearance on MSNBC, Trump’s campaign posted a video featuring many of them — Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii — saying in the past that female accusers should be believed.
The reel begins and ends with Biden and Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee whose husband, Bill Clinton, was impeached in connection with his extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Senate acquitted him, but the episode remains one of the party’s fraught chapters in its advocacy for women.
Biden appeared Friday to recognize the need to reinforce his commitment.
During an evening virtual fundraiser with hundreds of veterans from the Obama administration, he addressed the matter again, repeating his assertions that Reade’s account “didn’t happen,” but explaining that his reaction doesn’t amount to hypocrisy because of how Democrats have approached the #MeToo movement.
“My knowledge that it isn’t true does nothing to shake my belief that women have to be able to be heard and that all the claims be taken seriously,” Biden said. “It isn’t enough just to simply take my word for it and dismiss it out of hand. Frankly, that shouldn’t be enough for anyone because we know that sort of approach is how the culture of abuse has been allowed to fester for so long.”
Unreleased document troves — Biden’s at the the University of Delaware and other Senate files at the National Archives — have raised questions about what might be found in them. Reade says she filed a complaint about Biden with the Senate. Biden says such a document, if it exists, would be stored in the archives.
A dozen times on MSNBC, Biden said he knew of no complaint Reade had filed against him and got somewhat mired in the details of where such a document might be stored.
Biden was asked if he is “absolutely certain” and “absolutely positive, that there is no record of any complaint by Tara Reade” against him.
His answer was highly qualified: “I’m absolutely positive that no one that I’m aware of, ever, was —been made aware of any complaint, a formal complaint, made by or a complaint by Tara Reade against me at the time this allegedly happened, 27 years ago,” until he announced his campaign for president.
Then Biden tried again:
“I know of no one who’s aware that any complaint was made.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Outspoken Member of Parliament for Assin Central Constituency Kennedy Agyapong says with all due respect to Ghanaian celebrities, he will never date any of them. He said those who are glorified by Ghanaians as “stars and celebrities” are not the kind of ladies he likes.The well-known businessman was dismissing rumours that he is going out with actress Yvonne Nelson. “I don’t even know her and I have not seen her before,” he disclosed on Onua TV.He denied ever booking a ticket for Yvonne Nelson to any location on the planet to have a date with him, insisting: “No way!”.The maverick lawmaker admitted that his character and nature do not match any person who seems to be in the limelight.“I am loud and so I don’t like any lady who is loud,” he told host.Ken Agyapong has recently been on a warpath with the head pastor of the International God’s Way Church, Daniel Obinim, unveiling a raft of allegations against the man of God.Asked if his vitriol against Bishop Obinim is as a result of him taking his girlfriend, Ken Agyapong said no one can have any of his concubines, with whom he has a total of 19 children.He denied ever liking Benedicta Gafah, one of the celebrities he mentions as a concubine to Bishop Obinim.

The entertainment giant is bringing together a host of stars to perform some of its best known songs for a broadcast raising money for the coronavirus relief effort.
During the first show last month, Beyonce made a surprise appearance while Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato also performed.
For the next broadcast, acts announced so far include Shakira, who will be singing her hit Try Everything from 2016 animated blockbuster Zootopia.
Menzel will team up with Broadway star Ben Platt for a duet of A Whole New World from Aladdin while Glover is set to reunite with  his Lion King remake co-stars Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner for a performance of Hakuna Matata.
Other highlights from the May 10 show include Halsey singing Part Of Your World from The Little Mermaid and Rebel Wilson covering Poor Unfortunate Souls from the same film.
And following news that Disney is working on a live-action remake of 1997 animated classic Hercules, Keke Palmer will take on Zero To Hero.
Additional celebrities and performance details will be announced soon, Disney said.
The Disney Family Singalong: Volume II, hosted by Ryan Seacrest, will air in the US on May 10 and will be available to stream on Disney+ “in the days that follow,” the company said.
Money raised will go to food bank charity Feeding America and its work feeding families amid the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Board game sales surge as families turn to tech-free entertainment at home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Board game sales have surged in Ballarat since the implementation of physical distancing restrictions due to COVID-19.
GUF Games Ballarat owner Mark Carter said he and his staff were working hard to keep up with the demand for board games through their online store.
He said families were turning to board games as an alternative to electronic entertainment and a way to spend time together while at home.
"I think a lot of people are taking the opportunity to reconnect with their families on a level that does not involve devices," Mr Carter said.
"A big part of that has been sitting around the kitchen table and playing games together - games that promote teamwork and cooperation rather than competitiveness and elimination, which is what your traditional games such as Monopoly are all about.
"People are looking for ways to interact in a positive way with their family and that usually is about finding a game that is engaging for everyone, but a game that also sees people working together to meet a common goal or to solve a puzzle."
Mr Carter said it had been challenging to keep enough stock of the most popular games to keep up with consumer demand.
Top selling games are modern classics like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne.
"These are all games that have been around for a little while but have never really hit mass merchant retailers like department stores," Mr Carter said.
"They are still relatively unknown but over the last twenty years they have sold millions of copies. When people tend to start asking around about what is a good modern board game, these are the three that usually pop up."
Mr Carter said he had enjoyed playing the game Zombie Kidz with his family.
"It is a very cooperative game and very tactile for the kids because there are things they rip up, adjust and write on, which is very foreign to most people when they think about playing a game," he said.
"That is one we have been enjoying as a family."
While many people enjoy the problem solving element of board games and the opportunity to disconnect from devices, Mr Carter said he personally loved board games for the social interaction they provide.
"I just love getting together with friends or family and a lot of the time for us, the game becomes secondary to the conversation that occurs when you are sitting around a table and no one is looking at their phone," he said.
"A lot of the time the game becomes a bit of a conduit to conversation."
Mr Carter said he hoped more people would continue playing board games in the future as a result of their experience during the coronavirus pandemic.
"I do think this has been great in that it has opened up a lot of people to a different type of board games," he said.
"When people think of board games they are often thinking of mass market games that were designed in the 60s or in the case of Monopoly in the 30s.
"This recent boom in board games has changed their thinking about what a board game is and made them aware board games can be very social and they don't have to be about arguments and fighting.
"Games can be very cooperative, they don't have to be about eliminating or beating someone.
"I think there is a very good chance people will find a regular time in their lives to sit around and play board games with their family or board games after their dinner party."
GUF Games first opened in Ballarat 14 years ago. The business has opened stores around Victoria and become one of the biggest online board game retailers in Australia since.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In these most difficult and challenging times, fighting an unseen virus, we thank all the NHS staff, carers and key workers who are working tirelessly.
Coronavirus is having a massive effect on businesses and the lives of everyone in our country as we learn to adapt to a totally different way of life.
The Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution is receiving a large number of calls, Freephone 0808 281 9490, from worried farming families, needing reassurance and practical help. The farming charities have teamed together under Farming Help and a call to 03000 111999, a helpline operated by Farming Community Network, can offer confidential help and most importantly someone to listen and support.
Those working to produce our food are used to self isolating, in tractor cabs, lambing sheds, fencing, and milking. However the worries and uncertainties of the future can loom very large. Like every charity RABI has seen its income from fundraising and investments drop, and are very grateful for any donations given, contact: help@rabi.org.uk
Some words I saw recently: If you feel like you’re losing everything, remember that trees lose their leaves every year and still they stand tall and wait for better days to come.
Christine Downes, Shropshire committee member of the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution

    <h5 class="mb-1">How have you been getting on with Animal Crossing: New Horizon's recent nerfs and new events?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still very young, but it's already been through a series of ups and downs.
After folks started to hit the "endgame," some of the creamy faults started to rise to the top. That said, Nintendo has made it very clear that this is a live service game, and advancements will come over time: most notably, the recent addition of Leif and Redd.
On the flipside, those changes can be contentious. Nintendo recently nerfed monthly interest gains in a bid to defeat time-traveling players. Tarantulas, which I've seen a whopping two of total in all of my time with the game, also got a nerfed spawn rate.
As I noted earlier this week, I've "completed the game" and unlocked terraforming, and like most things New Horizons related, it's gotten a mixed reception in my household. I was under the misguided assumption that it would function a lot like the in-game house editor tool, which conveniently allows players to arrange items in a top-down fashion, with a grid to show exactly where items are placed, to boot.
Terraforming has none of those things, so my dreams of being able to remodel my island with any sort of realistic timeline have been dashed. To make matters worse, I don't get the opportunity to play very much at night, when a lot of the New Horizons magic happens, so I haven't experienced a few of the stingiest events like meteor showers. It's frustrating.
That said, I still enjoy New Horizons. I might not be playing it nearly as often as I'd like to (I hope some of the aforementioned issues are going to be fixed eventually, and let us craft multiple items and craft from storage, Nintendo!), but I am still playing. The little May Day puzzle was a brief bit of fun! I hope we get more of that sort of stuff. I also really love the new art wing in the museum: Blathers is probably my favorite Animal Crossing character in this iteraiton.
My time with New Horizons has been confusing, but what about you?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Allen, Drummer Who Created the Beat of Afrobeat, Dies at 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tony Allen, the drummer who created the steadfast, subtle beat of the Nigerian protest funk known as Afrobeat, died on Thursday in Paris. He was 79.
His manager, Eric Trosset, said the cause was an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
From 1964 to 1978, Mr. Allen worked with the bandleader Fela Ransome-Kuti, who became known worldwide simply as Fela. He was the musical director for Fela’s band Africa 70, which forged music that was both politically committed and danceable, merging West African styles with American jazz and funk.
Mr. Allen made more than three dozen albums with Fela and the band, including the indelible “Zombie” and “Gentleman,” as well as solo albums on which Mr. Allen led Africa 70. The music of Fela and Africa 70 reached listeners and emulators all over the world. On Twitter, Peter Gabriel wrote, “As a musician & aspiring drummer, it was thrilling to get lost in their new, smart, sexy & political music full of killer grooves.”
The songs that defined Afrobeat, with Mr. Allen’s drumming at their core, move at a deliberate, unhurried tempo, geared for marathon six-hour sets and dancing until dawn. On albums, many of Fela’s 1970s Afrobeat songs stretched the length of an LP side.
While Fela composed the parts for the band’s other instruments, Mr. Allen created his own drum parts. His playing was open-ended and improvisatory rather than bluntly repetitive; complex patterns drove a shifting dialogue with every element of the band. “You listen to it flowing like a river,” Mr. Allen explained in a 2016 interview with The Guardian.
After he left Africa 70 in 1979, Mr. Allen went on to an international solo career, leading his own bands and collaborating with rock, jazz, reggae, R&B and electronic musicians. The composer and producer Brian Eno, a fan since the 1970s, once called Mr. Allen “perhaps the greatest drummer who ever lived.”
Tony Oladipo Allen was born on Aug. 12, 1940, in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He was the eldest of six children of James Alabi Allen, a Nigerian auto mechanic, and Prudencia Anna (Mettle) Allen, whose family was from Ghana.
As a teenager he learned electronics and worked as a radio technician — skills that would come in handy in his early days as a touring musician, when he repaired the band’s amplifiers. He didn’t start playing drums until he was 18.
He had grown up listening to West African music, but he also immersed himself in jazz, studying the drumming of Gene Krupa, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams and others. “These guys were telling a story by playing different rhythms, and they were doing it with independent coordination,” he said in the 2013 book “Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat,” which he wrote with Michael Veal. “That’s the way the drums should be played, man.”
As he taught himself to play, Mr. Allen became particularly interested in the pedal-operated pair of cymbals known as the hi-hat, which he felt other African drummers neglected. The whoosh, rustle and ping of his hi-hats animated Mr. Allen’s drumming with an additional layer of polyrhythm.
“I’m creating different patterns with my four limbs,” Mr. Allen told The Guardian in 2014. “They are all playing something different, which means you need to split your mind into four elements with the one central idea running through.”
Martin Perna, the founder of the Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band Antibalas, which performed with Mr. Allen in the 2000s, said Mr. Allen “was the embodiment of rhythm.” He added, “What’s so magical is with all that variation, he’s somehow more hypnotic than a pattern that doesn’t change.”
Mr. Allen soon found work in Lagos highlife bands and groups that played whatever was popular. In 1964 he auditioned for Fela Ransome-Kuti, who was putting together a jazz band, beginning a 15-year musical alliance that survived chronic disputes over getting paid.
That first band’s pure jazz drew only small audiences, and Fela soon decided to combine jazz with African pop; as Fela Ransome-Kuti and His Koola Lobitos, the band played what it called “highlife jazz.”
The group toured Nigeria and neighboring Ghana. In the late 1960s a Ghanaian promoter, Raymond Aziz, came up with a new name for their musical hybrid: Afrobeat.
During a lengthy stay in Los Angeles in 1969 when the band was on tour in the United States, Fela grew politicized by the Black Power movement. When the band returned to Nigeria, Fela renamed it first Nigeria 70 and then Africa 70. His new songs were more streamlined and merged James Brown-style funk with Mr. Allen’s rolling, crackling rhythms.
“I had developed the drumming concept for Afrobeat from many things that I heard while I was growing up,” Mr. Allen said in his autobiography. “It was a fusion of beats and patterns. There was highlife, there was local Yoruba music like apala and sakara, there was jazz, and there was Western popular music like funk and R&B.”
Fela’s new songs also carried messages, at first couched in proverbs and then increasingly direct, that condemned corruption and taunted Nigeria’s military dictatorship. Although Fela and Africa 70 recorded extensively and performed regularly at his club, the Shrine, Fela was repeatedly arrested and beaten.
Africa 70 persisted, and Mr. Allen stayed on as bandleader until September 1978, when, after years of feeling musically fulfilled but financially exploited, he quit.
Mr. Allen was backed by Africa 70 on his 1979 album, “No Accommodation for Lagos,” but he struggled to start his own band in Nigeria. Eventually, after recording in London, he settled in Paris in 1985.
In 1987 he married Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him, as do their three sons and four children from an earlier relationship in Nigeria, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He lived in Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris.
Mr. Allen was frustrated with the first recordings he made in France, on which trendy-minded producers smothered his drumming with electronics. But in the 1990s he forged the blend of Afrobeat and dub electronics that he wanted on “Black Voices,” which featured guest appearances by singers from Parliament-Funkadelic. He found more compatible collaborators in the next decades.
A longtime fan, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, appeared on Mr. Allen’s 2002 album, “Home Cooking,” starting a long affiliation. Mr. Allen joined Mr. Albarn in the band the Good, the Bad and the Queen and in a project with Flea, the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist, called Rocket Juice & the Moon. He also made small-group jazz albums and recorded with the reggae guitarist Ernest Ranglin and the techno producer Jeff Mills. This year he completed “Rejoice,” an album featuring the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela that was begun at sessions in 2010. On Saturday, Gorillaz released a new song with Mr. Allen and the grime rapper Skepta, “How Far?”
“I still challenge myself every time with my playing,” Mr. Allen wrote in his autobiography. “I still want to play something impossible, something that I never played before. That’s what I’m after.”

The songs that defined Afrobeat, with Allen's drumming at their core, move at a deliberate, unhurried tempo, geared for marathon six-hour sets and dancing until dawn. On albums, many of Fela's 1970s Afrobeat songs stretched the length of an LP side.
While Fela composed the parts for the band's other instruments, Allen created his own drum parts. His playing was open-ended and improvisatory rather than bluntly repetitive; complex patterns drove a shifting dialogue with every element of the band. "You listen to it flowing like a river," Allen explained in a 2016 interview with The Guardian.
After he left Africa 70 in 1979, Allen went on to an international solo career, leading his own bands and collaborating with rock, jazz, reggae, R&B and electronic musicians. Composer and producer Brian Eno, a fan since the 1970s, once called Allen "perhaps the greatest drummer who ever lived".
Tony Oladipo Allen was born August 12, 1940, in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He was the eldest of six children of James Alabi Allen, a Nigerian auto mechanic, and Prudencia Anna (Mettle) Allen, whose family was from Ghana.
As a teenager he learned electronics and worked as a radio technician — skills that would come in handy in his early days as a touring musician, when he repaired the band's amplifiers. He didn't start playing drums until he was 18.
He had grown up listening to West African music, but he also immersed himself in jazz, studying the drumming of Gene Krupa, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams and others. "These guys were telling a story by playing different rhythms, and they were doing it with independent coordination," he said in the 2013 book Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat, which he wrote with Michael Veal. "That's the way the drums should be played, man."
As he taught himself to play, Allen became particularly interested in the pedal-operated pair of cymbals known as the hi-hat, which he felt other African drummers neglected. The whoosh, rustle and ping of his hi-hats animated Allen's drumming with an additional layer of polyrhythm.
"I'm creating different patterns with my four limbs," Allen told The Guardian in 2014. "They are all playing something different, which means you need to split your mind into four elements with the one central idea running through."
Martin Perna, the founder of the Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band Antibalas, which performed with Allen in the 2000s, said Allen "was the embodiment of rhythm." He added, "What's so magical is with all that variation, he's somehow more hypnotic than a pattern that doesn't change."
Allen soon found work in Lagos highlife bands and groups that played whatever was popular. In 1964 he auditioned for Fela Ransome-Kuti, who was putting together a jazz band, beginning a 15-year musical alliance that survived chronic disputes over getting paid.
That first band's pure jazz drew only small audiences, and Fela soon decided to combine jazz with African pop; as Fela Ransome-Kuti and His Koola Lobitos, the band played what it called "highlife jazz."
The group toured Nigeria and neighbouring Ghana. In the late 1960s a Ghanaian promoter, Raymond Aziz, came up with a new name for their musical hybrid: Afrobeat.
During a lengthy stay in Los Angeles in 1969 when the band was on tour in the United States, Fela grew politicised by the Black Power movement. When the band returned to Nigeria, Fela renamed it first Nigeria 70 and then Africa 70. His new songs were more streamlined and merged James Brown-style funk with Allen's rolling, crackling rhythms.
"I had developed the drumming concept for Afrobeat from many things that I heard while I was growing up," Allen said in his autobiography. "It was a fusion of beats and patterns. There was highlife, there was local Yoruba music like apala and sakara, there was jazz, and there was Western popular music like funk and R&B."
Fela's new songs also carried messages, at first couched in proverbs and then increasingly direct, that condemned corruption and taunted Nigeria's military dictatorship. Although Fela and Africa 70 recorded extensively and performed regularly at his club, the Shrine, Fela was repeatedly arrested and beaten.
Africa 70 persisted, and Allen stayed on as bandleader until September 1978, when, after years of feeling musically fulfilled but financially exploited, he quit.
Allen was backed by Africa 70 on his 1979 album, No Accommodation for Lagos, but he struggled to start his own band in Nigeria. Eventually, after recording in London, he settled in Paris in 1985.
In 1987 he married Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him, as do their three sons and four children from an earlier relationship in Nigeria, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He lived in Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris.
Allen was frustrated with the first recordings he made in France, on which trendy-minded producers smothered his drumming with electronics. But in the 1990s he forged the blend of Afrobeat and dub electronics that he wanted on Black Voices, which featured guest appearances by singers from Parliament-Funkadelic. He found more compatible collaborators in the next decades.
A longtime fan, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, appeared on Allen's 2002 album, Home Cooking, starting a long affiliation. Allen joined Albarn in the band the Good, the Bad and the Queen and in a project with Flea, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist, called Rocket Juice & the Moon. He also made small-group jazz albums and recorded with reggae guitarist Ernest Ranglin and techno producer Jeff Mills. This year he completed Rejoice, an album featuring South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela that was begun at sessions in 2010. On Saturday, Gorillaz released a new song with Allen and the grime rapper Skepta, How Far?
"I still challenge myself every time with my playing," Allen wrote in his autobiography. "I still want to play something impossible, something that I never played before. That's what I'm after."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Percival Everett Has a Book or Three Coming Out</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once you’ve finished “Telephone,” the latest book by Percival Everett, you may be talking about it with another reader and finding that you disagree on what happened.
That is intentional.
“There are three different versions of this novel, they’re all published identically, and you can’t know which one you’re getting,” Everett said during a video interview from his home in Los Angeles. With an apologetic chuckle, he added: “It’s going to piss a lot of people off, I’m afraid.”
The author of more than 30 novels and collections of stories and poetry over the past 30 years, Everett, 63, has cultivated a reputation for his vast, genre-defying and sometimes gleefully unhinged body of work. Consider “Erasure,” a race-in-publishing novel with a Blaxploitation parody inside, or the absurdist “I Am Not Sidney Poitier,” narrated by a man named Not Sidney Poitier.
Then there are the even weirder, wilder works like “A History of the African-American People (Proposed) by Strom Thurmond, as Told to Percival Everett and James Kincaid” and “The Book of Training by Colonel Hap Thompson of Roanoke, VA, 1843, Annotated From the Library of John C. Calhoun,” a mock slave-owning manual Everett described as “my version of a horror novel.”
“Telephone,” however, represents something new. Part campus novel, part Western adventure, it follows Zach Wells, an unhappy geologist in the Los Angeles area who explains that “the only thing most of the students would remember would be the joke ‘schist happens.’” One day he finds “Ayúdame” written on a note tucked inside the pocket of an eBay purchase, and he sets out to help the person in need. This puts into motion Everett’s gripping finale — or, rather, finales — involving armed neo-Nazis, a taciturn foreign detective and an uncharacteristically bold poetry workshop.
The differences between the editions, which begin with the colophon, include extended or altered scenes and three distinct endings. The cover designs are nearly identical, but if you look closely, you can spot the differences.
“I think Percival, when he first suggested it, wasn’t sure that we would go for it,” said Fiona McCrae, his longtime editor and publisher at Graywolf Press. “We were worried, ‘Would we try people’s patience with this?’ But all of us were more intrigued than worried as the conversations went on.”
Different versions were sent to different outlets. “For the prizes, they were just given any copy,” McCrae said. “It could be that some judges are discussing the book, but they’re not all reading the same book.” Still, she and others at Graywolf weren’t sure when to let readers in on the surprise, if at all. The coronavirus outbreak changed that discussion.
“It was a secret,” Everett said. “But with the strangeness with the Covid-19 isolation, it was a decision in the house to do the reveal earlier than later. The title” — a reference to the children’s game where relayed messages become hopelessly distorted — “can’t make sense until you understand what has happened.”
He considers the book an experiment that plays with the idea of who’s in charge when reading. “I’m interested not in the authority of the artist, but the authority of the reader,” he said, enunciating in a deep, slightly gravelly voice. “I certainly know that many people will not see what I saw. And many people will see different things from each other. That’s the thrilling thing about making it. If somebody says, ‘Did you mean this something?’ I always say, ‘Yes.’”
Everett, who grew up in Columbia, S.C., has done everything from studying Wittgenstein to performing jazz guitar, casting flies to castrating bulls. Since 1998 he has taught writing and literary theory at the University of Southern California, where he holds the rank of distinguished professor. Three years ago he took up repairing mandolins and guitars in his workshop. Back when he lived on a ranch in the Moreno Valley, he trained horses and mules. Word got out — “unfortunately,” he said — that he might take kindly to other creatures in need of care.
“People would bring me, um, ducks,” he said. “And I would say, ‘I don’t want your duck.’”
But he’d prefer all that — the personal — to not be the focus. Indeed, any prolonged discussion around the work or its creator seems, at best, a reluctant professional concession. Everett, who is married to the writer Danzy Senna, comes across as a warm and generous conversationalist. But he expressed bafflement about “people’s deference to the artist when it comes to the intention and the construction of meaning.”
“I’m just a cowboy,” he said, though right now, because of coronavirus-related cancellations, he is holed up “being a schoolmarm” to their two sons, ages 11 and 13.
“There’s always new sides to him to unwrap,” said his longtime colleague and friend James Kincaid. “One of the things that interested me about his work was his resistance to automatic pigeonholing as African-American fiction.” He recalled going to bookstores with Everett and gradually realizing he wasn’t looking to see “whether they had his work, but where it was.”
It’s this rangy quality, perhaps, that thrills Everett’s readers. While he has been regarded by some as that dreaded type, the “writer’s writer” — “lesser-known,” “underappreciated,” “underrated” are all terms employed to describe his status — this is not the case in France, where his books are featured at bookstore tables alongside best-selling thrillers, his longstanding translator Anne-Laure Tissut said.
“His ability for systematic, pungent self-derision,” she said, “won him the heart of many a French reader.”
“He’s always being discovered,” said his publisher McCrae, who has shepherded 14 of his books since 1996. “I think once you’ve discovered him, you’re like, ‘How come he isn’t better known?’” For a while, she said, people “couldn’t quite define him. But now that’s the very thing that people marvel at.” Everett’s next book — “about lynching,” he said — has already been delivered and is set for release in spring 2021.
Anthony Stewart, a founder of the Percival Everett International Society and author of “Approximate Gestures,” a scholarly monograph on Everett’s work, believes that much of it is based on a basic idea: that black people are at least as complicated as white people.
“A lot of American art seems to overlook that simple fact,” Stewart added. “He writes about the experience of being black, but he does not write about the experience of being black as a problem to be solved or a condition to be endured.”
Speaking for himself, Everett sees his iconoclastic approach to work and life as deeply ingrained. “I can’t say that my breaking the rules was so much a protest as just a natural response to something that seemed arbitrary, and not only unfair, but unseemly,” he said, laughing. “Something stupid people might do.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘I first took hydroxychloroquine’— UK-based Nigerian doctor on surviving COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moruf Adelekan, a Nigerian doctor based in the United Kingdom, has recounted his recovery from COVID-19 eight days after contracting the disease.
The consultant psychiatrist, who was confirmed to have contracted the disease on April 3, said he recovered after treatment in hospital with the aid of an oxygen.
He said before getting admitted, he got hydroxychloroquine sulphate and azithromycin which he took alongside “a lot of paracetamol and all sorts of combination” such as black seed oil and turmeric.
Adelakan, who was speaking in a video shared on Saturday by Taiwo Obe, a journalist, said he was experiencing rise in temperature, fatigue, loss of appetite and dehydration.
“At home, it could take me two hours to decide on whether or not to go to the toilet. I will get up and fall back again, sleeping,” the doctor said.
“I was not coughing but I had this bad pain if I tried to take a deep breadth. I was trying to get to the A&E (accident and emergency) but they were not admitting; I don’t think I was not meeting the threshold.”
Adelekan recalled his condition was getting worse and “my breathing was getting really bad” before he was finally admitted into the hospital.
“The treatment in the intensive care unit was generally supportive but the focus of treatment was to give me maximum oxygen over a period and they used CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure),” he said.
“They put it on your head as if you are going to the moon and you cannot come out of it for hours. It was the most essential treatment for me. I was on it for about 18 hours non-stop, I was getting oxygen full blast and that marked the beginning of my treatment.
“From the ICU, they sent me back to another ward where I spent not less than two days before I was taken off oxygen and discharged.”
On his lessons for Nigeria, the doctor said people must understand that “coronavirus is real and it is no respecter of anybody”.
“We need protocols on everything, and this should be no respecter of anybody. When I sneezed, the junior nurse who just became a manager did not spare me. She told me point blank, ‘you have to leave the ward and go home’,” he recalled.
“We need institutional support for those directly or indirectly affected. Even though I am NHS staff, then the government had identified those of us who are 60 years and above and they have given us 12 weeks of stay-at-home.
“What medications are available? It is mainly supportive treatment. In my own case, what was identified was breathing difficulty and breathing difficulty.
“The government should make available all the equipment, medications and the staff to do the work. Let us continue to mobilise support of all the communities to let people know that this is real.”

Unlike most of us, what she’d normally be doing instead of reading a book is kicking ass on screen as a stunt double for folks like Lucy Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess), Uma Thurman (Kill Bill) and Cate Blanchett (Thor: Ragnarok). The New Zealand stuntwoman and actress, who also played Janet Miller in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Six-Horse Judy in The Hateful Eight, enlisted many of her actor and stuntwomen friends for an Epic #BossBitchFightChallenge set the to KT Tunstall’s “The Healer” that you just have to watch.
Participating brawlers include Lawless, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, Rosario Dawson, Cameron Diaz, Florence Pugh, Daryl Hannah, Zoe Saldana, Rosie Perez, Thandie Newton, Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, and many others. And Tunstall has her own cameo at the end.
Bravo, Ms. Bell. We’re glad you got to play with your friends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scarlett Johansson’s Box Office History—Where Will ‘Black Widow’ Rank?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an alternate non-coronavirus universe, Black Widow would have opened yesterday to theaters everywhere. And according to box office expert predictions, the latest Marvel film would have netted anywhere between $90 million and $130 million in the United States between now and Sunday.
For Black Widow’s main star, Scarlett Johannson, that’s a pretty hefty sum. While the Oscar-nominated actress has starred in several Marvel films that have grossed more money at the box office, Black Widow could have very well become the highest-grossing movie in which Johansson owned the leading role.
Obviously, we won’t know if Black Widow will hold that achievement until the film actually releases. But based on experts’ box office estimations, we can make an educated guess about whether that prediction would have become a reality. So let’s circle back through Johansson’s box office history to see if Black Widow could have—and might still someday—become Johansson’s biggest movie to date.
Scarlett Johansson had her first starring role in a film at just the age of 10 in Just Cause. Starring Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne, the 1995 film would go on to make $35.9 million at the domestic box office—which amounts to $79.4 million after adjusting for ticket price inflation.
In total, Johansson has owned a starring role in 45 different movies. One of those movies, however, did not earn any money in the U.S. Last year, Marriage Story released on Netflix and only grossed reported box office income overseas.
Added together, those 44 movies that played in U.S. theaters earned a grand total of $5.277 billion domestically—that is, obviously, largely thanks to the Marvel films. On average, that comes to $119.9 million per film.
After we account for ticket price inflation, that total jumps to nearly $6 billion, which comes to an average of an astounding $135 million per film.
Worldwide, Johansson’s box office total stands at an insane $14.412 billion. For the 42 movies that have played internationally, her per-movie box office average comes to a ridiculous $343.1 million.
Box office experts predicted an opening weekend between $90 million and $130 million. If Black Widow had achieved at least $110 in its first three days, that would have likely led to a lifetime domestic income of about $270 million.
Using that estimation, let’s see how Black Widow would have ranked against the rest of Johansson’s filmography at the domestic box office. For the sake of saving space, we’ll focus on Johansson’s 25 highest-grossing movies:
It should be no surprise that Marvel takes up the top five spots, and eight of the top ten spots. The only one of those movies, however, that features Johansson in a leading role is Black Widow. She is obviously an important component of the Avengers films, but not the central character. And in both The Jungle Book and Sing, she serves as only a voice to a character.
That means if Black Widow hits the low end of box office expectations, then it’ll top Lucy’s $126.7 million showing in 2014 and become Johansson’s biggest movie to date—easily.
But what happens when we adjust for ticket price inflation? If Black Widow does indeed release in U.S. theaters in 2020, the average price of a movie ticket will be $9.37. Back in 1995, when Johansson’s first movie released, the average ticket price was just $4.35.
So does Black Widow have such an easy path to No. 1 after all? Here are the new adjusted rankings:
Turns out that Black Widow easily holds onto its top spot. While the film moved down one notch in the overall rankings, the box office prediction for Black Widow still positions the film as Johansson’s most lucrative leading role to date.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr ‘unheard’ track going under the hammer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unheard track by Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr recorded after the Beatles split is heading for auction.
Angel In Disguise could be the only song co-written exclusively by the band’s former bassist and drummer, according to auctioneers.
The ex-Beatles recorded the demo for Sir Ringo’s 1992 solo album Time Takes Time but it did not make the cut.
Former Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince is selling the cassette, which is expected to fetch up to £20,000.
He was asked to find artists to record alternative versions of Angel In Disguise in the 1990s, after Sir Ringo rejected the track.
The song has never been heard publicly.
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: “It’s fantastic to be able to bring to the market a previously unheard and unreleased track…
“We think the track certainly had enough about it to be included in the album and I am sure if Paul was to release this himself it would certainly prove a hit with fans.”
The cassette contains two versions of the track – a rough demo with Sir Paul  on vocals and a fuller ‘mixed’ version with musicians and backing vocals and Sir Ringo singing.
Another Sir Ringo demo, Everyone Wins, which was also shelved but later released on a compilation recording, is also included on the tape.
The tape, with other memorabilia, will go under the hammer at Omega Auctions’ online sale on May 19, with 25% of proceeds donated to the NHS Charities Together Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

The Beatles announced their split in 1970, shortly before the release of their twelfth studio album, Let It Be.
Speaking on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show in March, Sir Paul spoke candidly about the end of the world's most successful group. 
When asked why he didn't keep the band together after Lennon announced his departure, he said:  'When families break up, it's to do with the emotion and the emotional pain.
'You can't just think of a smart idea like that at the time. You're hurting too much so it wasn't going to happen.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">ITV boss confirms that I'm A Celeb 2020 is 'likely to go ahead' in Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ITV boss Kevin Lygo says that I'm a Celeb should go ahead this year despite the coronavirus pandemic playing havoc with TV schedules.
It has been feared that the popular reality showed might be shelved until the pandemic eases up alongside other TV favourites such as Emmerdale and Eastenders.
But Kevin has now told that the show looks 'likely to return this year', with filming being planned to take place in Australia during December.
The TV boss told the Edinburgh Television Festival via video link that although it is likely the show will go ahead, the show's bosses were looking for alternatives.
But the official remained tight lipped on what shows could replace I'm a Celeb.
Kevin's comments come after I'm A Celeb officials said earlier this week that they are adamant that filming will go ahead in the famous Aussie jungle as planned.
Inside sources close to the telly bosses told The Sun that 'virtual talks' are being initiated to prepare for the next series.
The insider explained that executives are determined to get the show up and running this year due to the fact that ratings are bound to sky rocket.
They also people being holed up in their homes for months on end would also boost ratings.
They told the paper:"ITV is certain lockdown will be well over by the time I’m A Celeb normally starts which is in November.
"Every year it's a ratings smash and this year will more than likely be even bigger as the public will be desperate for some fresh and uplifting TV."
According to the source ITV have already begun to advertise and hire for new crew members to join them in the Australian jungle.
There has been recent speculation about which celebrities could make an appearance if the show returns.
Charles Ingram is highly tipped to join this years list of contestants who will battle it out until the end to be crowned king or queen of the jungle.
Other celebrities whose names have been thrown into the jungle hat include former  Strictly Come Dancing  star AJ Pritchard alongside his brother's ex girlfriend and former  Love Island  siren, Maura Higgins.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here. 
"Westworld" star Evan Rachel Wood backed Rose McGowan’s most recent missive against the Democratic Party following the fallout from assault allegations against Joe Biden.
Wood, 32, on Friday directly responded to McGowan's latest tweet in which the former "Charmed" actress declared she is no longer a "proud Democrat" due to her affiliated party downplaying sexual assault allegations against Biden by Tara Reade, a former staffer from his days in the senate.
"I have to say this is...spot on," Wood tweeted in response to McGowan's lengthy post.
TARA READE'S TIMELINE: FROM 1990S BIDEN STAFFER TO CENTER OF POLITICAL FIRESTORM
Wood, a vocal gay rights advocate, previously delivered emotional testimony on Capitol Hill in 2018 to detail two instances in which she was raped and one in which she was tortured.
During a hearing for the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill, the "Westworld" star shared a five-minute statement in front of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations consisting of harrowing details of her alleged assault that involved being "tied up and beaten."
The alleged assault resulted in Wood's years-long battles with PTSD, addiction and depression, she said.
BIDEN CAMPAIGN ADAMANTLY DENIES ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
In McGowan's message from earlier this week, the outspoken Me Too advocate and victim of convicted rapist and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, said she was raised a Democrat.
The 46-year-old actress recounted a memory from her younger brother's Air Force Academy graduation where she wore a "Vote John Kerry" pin and defended herself in a few arguments with "big men who were mad" about her party affiliation.
"I thought democracy meant...I had a right to choose those who lined up with my value system," she continued. "But what if there's no one?"
WASHINGTON POST CALLS ON BIDEN TO ADDRESS TARA READE SEX-ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS, 'RELEASE RELEVANT RECORDS'
She went on to say that she had been raised on the idea that the Democratic Party “were the good guys” and that she felt “really quite a sense of loss.”
“Now I know too much,” she wrote.
McGowan publicly stood in support of Reade after a 1993 clip from "Larry King Live" resurfaced last week and appeared to include her mother alluding to "problems" her daughter faced while working for Biden.
Meanwhile, Susan Sarandon, a staunch liberal and prominent Bernie Sanders backer, shared tweets in support of Biden's sexual assault accuser.
And on Wednesday, comedian Sarah Silverman broke her silence on Reade's allegations, this time calling out Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) for voicing support for Biden after being one of the loudest voices calling for fellow Democratic senator Al Franken's resignation following accusations he jokingly groped a woman while she was asleep.
Biden broke his silence on the matter on Friday, unequivocally denying Reade's allegations by saying "the facts in this case do not exist."

“No, it is not true,” Biden said during an interview on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" in addition to releasing a written statement. “I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened and it didn’t. It never happened.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistan expresses inability to convert 'Kapoor Haveli' into museum due to lack of funds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PESHAWAR: Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor's ancestral home, dubbed as the 'Kapoor Haveli', here cannot be converted into a museum as promised by the Pakistan government due to financial constraints, sources said on Saturday.
In 2018, the Pakistan government decided to convert the 'Kapoor Haveli' in Qissa Khwani Bazar in Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province into a museum, heeding to a request by Rishi Kapoor who died this week at a hospital in Mumbai.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had assured Rishi Kapoor that the Pakistan government will convert the actor's house into a museum.
The sources in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Heritage Department told PTI that the department prepared a comprehensive plan under which the haveli's front would be preserved and its inner portion will be repaired and renovated.
However, the plan did not go ahead due to lack of financial resources, they said.
Federal Minister Shaheryar Afridi had promised to give the status of museum to the 'Kapoor Haveli' soon after the present government of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-insaaf party came into power in July 2018.
However, the announcement to this effect could not be materialised despite a lapse of around two years.
The haveli is presently the property of a private person who made three/four attempts in the past to demolish the building but could not do it as FIRs were registered against him by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa heritage department.
The owner has now assured the government that he would not dismantle the building.
However, due to frequent rains, hailstorms and earthquakes, the condition of the building has deteriorated from inside.
The 'Kapoor Haveli' was built by Basheswarnath Kapoor, the father of Bollywood icon Prithviraj Kapoor. The Kapoor family, originally from Peshawar in Pakistan, migrated to India after the partition in 1947.
In 1990, Rishi Kapoor along with brother Randhir Kapoor visited their ancestral home where his grandfather, Prithviraj and his father Raj Kapoor, were born.
The news of Rishi Kapoor's death sent a wave of sadness and grief among people in Peshawar.
A lot of people visited the 'Kapoor Haveli' to express their grief and condolence over his demise.
"We had no relation with Rishi Kapoor, but had a liking for him because of watching him as a film hero from childhood and due to his connection with a place which is also a birth place of me," said Pervaiz Ahmad, a city dweller.
"Rishi's death has saddened me a lot", Pervaiz added.
"Perhaps the feeling expressed by Pervaiz portrays sentiments of all the dwellers of Peshawar over sad demise of Rishi," said Ibrahim Zia, a historian who wrote a book titled 'Peshawar ki Funkar' (Artists of Peshawar).

The news of Rishi Kapoor's death sent a wave of sadness and grief among people in Peshawar. A lot of people visited the 'Kapoor Haveli' to express their grief and condolence over his demise.
"We had no relation with Rishi Kapoor, but had a liking for him because of watching him as a film hero from childhood and due to his connection with a place which is also a birth place of me,” said Pervaiz Ahmad, a city dweller.
"Rishi’s death has saddened me a lot”, Pervaiz added.
"Perhaps the feeling expressed by Pervaiz portrays sentiments of all the dwellers of Peshawar over sad demise of Rishi,” said Ibrahim Zia, a historian who wrote a book titled 'Peshawar ki Funkar’ (Artists of Peshawar).

People have been scrambling to better understand how the coronavirus would affect campaigns in this election year -- but it’s clear the finger-pointing has intensified.
Nobody seemed to know how the coronavirus would determine who’d show up to vote, or if voters will cast ballots by mail, a suggestion backed by most Democrats. Nobody seemed to know if red areas turned blue because of the coronavirus, or if previously blue turf turned red.
Is the electorate the same? How has it changed? Can people get to the polls? Are voters willing to get to the polls?
But, some things don’t change. President Trump’s performance on the ballot this fall certainly will dictate a lot in House and Senate contests -- and neither Democrats nor Republicans have diminished their attacks on the respective House and Senate leaders. Republicans have continued to torch House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democrats have continued to lob grenades at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Both sides have seen opportunity in demonizing those leaders -- as the opposition party in both chambers tried to wrest control from the majority.
If nothing else, the attacks have been more vitriolic than before. Besides the president, Pelosi and McConnell have remained the biggest names in politics. Both leaders have been on the air and visible. And, as the rest of the world has cascaded sideways due to the coronavirus, Democrats and Republicans have tried to simplify things for the voters, reverting to tried-and-true methods: McConnell=bad, Pelosi=bad.
McConnell is up for re-election this fall. On paper, McConnell’s race isn’t anything close to a competitive seat like the one held by Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz. It hasn’t held upset potential like races involving Georgia Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Yet, McConnell’s opponent, Democrat Amy McGrath, outraised the majority leader in the first quarter of this year. Democrats have long portrayed McConnell as a boogeyman, the groundskeeper of the Senate “graveyard” where House bills would go to die. Now, Democrats have been portraying McConnell as bringing the Senate back to session to confirm “conservative judges” – without truly addressing the coronavirus pandemic.
Democrats also have been excoriating McConnell for trying to limit coronavirus liability and suggesting that states struggling economically should go bankrupt.
“The American people are demanding answers and solutions,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Senator McConnell ought to focus the Senate’s work on the crises caused by COVID-19, not right-wing judges or fulfilling his ‘pre-existing partisan wish-list’ of protecting big business from any harm done to the American people.”
It’s unclear if these refined attacks by Democrats will help McGrath unseat McConnell. Such a scenario has been a stretch from the start. But, McConnell’s presumed dominance in the race may have softened. The coronavirus has shifted the tectonic plates in ways political geologists haven’t yet understood. And, even if McGrath doesn’t come close to defeating McConnell, targeting the majority leader could help the Democrats’ chances in other races and other states.
Republicans really don’t have any chances of toppling Pelosi in her San Francisco district. But, that’s not their goal. The key for the GOP would be to reacquaint voters with Pelosi and vilify her for impeachment, keeping the House out of session while she showed off her ice-cream collection and trying to install a system in which lawmakers could vote by proxy during the pandemic.
“This is nothing but a Democrat, Pelosi power grab,” blasted Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, when asked about proxy voting. “I don’t put it past anybody in leadership to make sure they have the votes to get their agenda passed.”
CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Republicans signaled they believed that targeting Pelosi could help them win back the House.
When Pelosi authorized the creation of a select committee on the coronavirus, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., denounced it for lacking equal representation by both Democrats and Republicans. However, Republicans, then in the majority, didn’t permit an equal number of Democrats to serve on the Select Benghazi Committee.
A McCarthy spokesperson characterized the coronavirus panel as “impeachment 2.0.” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, argued that the new panel was designed to boost the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden. That’s because the select committee chairman, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., salvaged Biden’s campaign in the South Carolina primary. Clyburn’s assistance propelled the former vice president ahead of the pack.
Democrats had first planned to reconvene the House last week. Then, party leaders backtracked after getting health advice from the Office of the Attending Physician at the Capitol. Democrats also noted it wasn’t worth bringing lawmakers back if the next coronavirus bill wasn’t ready for the floor yet. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., turned the Democrats’ decision around on them.
“Speaker Pelosi and her House majority would rather draft bills in secret than lead our country’s reopening by showing that we can safely get back to work in Congress,” Scalise said.
McConnell and McCarthy had ganged up on Pelosi in mid-April when the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) exhausted its funding. McConnell argued Democrats should have approved an additional $251 billion on the spot. But, both Republican leaders took aim at the House speaker.
“Even as the program is saving millions of American jobs, Speaker Pelosi has said she sees ‘no data as to why we need’ to keep funding it,” McConnell and McCarthy declared in a joint statement.

Politicians must navigate a new paradigm this fall. The 2020 election could unfold amid a second spike in coronavirus predicted by many epidemiologists. Candidates likely will find themselves trying to reach a distracted, fragmented electorate. Americans may be more focused on staying healthy, finding work and homeschooling their kids in fifth-grade fractions than voting.
Those on the ballot must compete with a lot of noise. And, when you’re running against the din, the best thing for politicians on both sides is to keep it simple. That would mean assailing those with whom voters are most familiar: McConnell and Pelosi.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Normal People' stars talk romance, intimacy, and this irresistible relationship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hulu's Normal People dropped on Wednesday, and within hours viewers were moved by the quiet beauty and devastation in the main characters' relationship. 
Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal) can't seem to escape each other, nor do they want to, but they struggle to find the contentment that love promises to bring. Mashable spoke to Mescal and Edgar-Jones ahead of the show's premiere about what makes a relationship like this so intriguing and what it means to be soulmates — if that's even possible.
Mashable: What attracted you to these characters? Were you were familiar with them from the book?
Daisy Edgar-Jones (Marianne): I read the book, actually, after my first self tape and before my chemistry read. Just from the [scene] alone, I really loved the character. I thought she was really funny, and a bit odd, and I really was excited to learn more about her. And then the book is, it was just the most incredible experience reading it. I really fell in love with the whole story and how simple it was, and just how Marianne was sort of flawed in many ways,
Paul Mescal (Connell): I think it's very hard not to be attracted to the character when you're reading in the context that you might be playing [him]. There's so many great scenes in the book that when I was reading it, I was imagining how fun they would be to play as an actor. A very attractive book, I think from an acting perspective.
There must be some pressure coming in to portray a relationship where there are fans, there are readers who are familiar with it. And you need leads with convincing chemistry for a show like this. It'll just fall apart without that. Were you aware of that going in? 
DEJ: Yeah, definitely. The whole of the story rests really a lot on Marianne and Connell's dynamic and it was really important to get that right. Paul and I were very lucky that that kind of was there pretty much from the start. We both had a very similar understanding of the way they interact and who those characters were with each other. And that meant that we had a very sort of easy rhythm. You can kind of see the difference, when both characters are on their own or with other people, it always feel a bit off kilter, which is really interesting.
What do you think makes a good romantic duo?
DEJ: Oh, that's a nice question.
PM: Yeah, I don't think we've had that question. I think that they find each other intellectually stimulating, which I think is the base level. I think you can absolutely fancy someone on a physical level, but ultimately, if you are intrigued by their intellectual capacity, that's going to elevate the relationship and I think that's really very present in Normal People... If I have to pick one trait that I think is essential for that kind of relationship-based drama and relationships in general, [it] will be that.
DEJ: Yeah. And I would say for some relationships in general, which I think Marianne and Connell really do on the whole, is they like bringing out the best in each other in a lot of ways. Marianne kind of encourages Connell to pursue his talent and writing, and Connell kind of allows Marianne to accept who she is and to feel that she's worthy of love. And I think even though they do miscommunicate, they sometimes aren't always the best, they on the whole bring a lot of good to each other, which I think is should be the sort of gold standard for most relationships.
And the relationship, because we follow them for so many years, goes through a lot of different stages. To someone unfamiliar with the text, how would you describe the relationship between these two characters?
DEJ: It's hard to put your finger on it. For me, the part of the novel that I really remember stuck out in my brain was — I think it's the final chapter... Marianne is thinking about what her school friends must be thinking when they see Marianne and Connell kiss on New Year's Eve at the end of the book, and what she thinks is the fact that it must be strange for them to see these two people who, for whatever reason, can't seem to leave each other alone. 
I think that's kind of perfect for them because they have such a wonderful dynamic, and as Paul said, they are both intellectually very bright and able to talk about things on such a deep level. But on the other hand, even though they can communicate so intelligently about huge, massive subjects, they seem to not be able to even do the simpler stuff sometimes of just being honest about what they feel. I think that just two characters who just are fascinated with each other and, I guess soulmates is the only way I could really think about it.
I'm so glad Daisy that you said soulmates, because I find it very fascinating in fiction, and obviously in real life too, that you don't always end up with your soulmate. And that some of those stories tend to be even more interesting. With television and books you have the opportunity to explore that relationship differently, to explore what would happen if they didn't get the timing right, or if they did get it right for a little bit. 
DEJ: I think that's precisely it, and it's precisely because they're soulmates that the ending is as it is. They love each other so much that they're able to let each other go if it's for the best, if it means the bettering of each other. Marianne, she knows that the pain of loneliness will be like nothing compared to the pain of feeling unworthy. I think she loves Connell enough that she wants to give him goodness by giving him the gift of encouraging him to go to New York because that's not something he'd be able to make the move to do on his own. And I think that's what true love is, that you can love someone enough that you can sort of move past the painfulness to give them the best.
PM: I also think that it's probably more true to life that ... to be able to actually end up with your soulmate is a rarity — even to find your soulmate, and I'm not even sure if I believe in that as a concept. But I think in the case of Marianne and Connell, I think they struggle to find somebody as well-suited to each other.
Were certain scenes that really stood out to you, that you still remember now from production as particularly interesting or challenging... One thing that comes to mind, Paul, is your scene with your therapist. That's a really intense emotional one.
PM: I think that what me and Daisy were really lucky with is that you could pick any one of those kind of big scenes where they're in [conversation], talking to each other. Both Connell and Marianne [together] and Connell and Marianne in isolation, and you'd be lucky if you get to play one of those scenes throughout a series or a film. There's normally one scene per episode that is gigantic or is like seven or eight pages long. The counselor scene was one that I really wanted to get right, because I think it's a beautiful depiction of somebody — beautiful is definitely not the right word to use, but I think it's an authentic insight into somebody suffering from depression. 
Also, I think those big scenes between Connell and Marianne are real studies in the complexities of a relationship. It's so hard to pick one because there's so many of them, but I love the scene in episode 5 when they communicate very effectively and Connell apologizes for not inviting Marianne to the debs. It's funny, I think that's one of Lenny's favorite scenes as well, because I remember in the shooting process that day was just gorgeous, like we had really lovely rehearsal of that scene and mine and Daisy's input was — you definitely feel it in the scene and it's just really nice to see that on screen.
DEJ: I think challenging-wise I definitely found all the scenes when Marianne... isn't with Connell quite challenging. Because Paul and I had such a shorthand, really, by the end of the process of doing scenes together, I think I found it very difficult when the characters were apart and and in a dark place to kind of to play that. I guess particularly in Sweden when Marianne makes certain choices, it's a tricky thing to access. 
As Paul said, there were so many big scenes that I guess are flags when you read the book, that really stand out in your mind. Doing them always felt strange when he stepped on set because it was like stepping inside the book and thinking "Oh, gosh, okay, hope we can do it as well as as the book does it." So certainly stuff like that I always find a bit daunting.
The show does a really good job with with the sex, with the scenes of physical intimacy. It's simultaneously very sexy and very just lovely. I was curious how that was emphasized throughout the script and production because that's a really difficult thing to get right.
DEJ: They so wonderfully written in the in the book, and it was really important to do them justice in the series, because I think what's great about them is they're never kind of for the sake of it. They're always carrying on a certain narrative or a story beat that's really important to those two characters. So I'm really glad that they come across the way we we wanted them to and Paul and I were very lucky that when we filmed them we had a brilliant intimacy coordinator on set who was in charge of the heavy lifting when it came to choreography and stuff like that, which meant we only ever had to worry about what exactly we were communicating acting-wise. We were very lucky to have that kind of safe environment to do so.
PM: Yeah, totally. I can't imagine doing those scenes without an intimacy coordinator because I think, ultimately, we just wouldn't do as good a job because we'd be way too self-conscious. The power of having an intimacy coordinator is that it's somebody whose job is to is to specialize in making those scenes feel as authentic and as real as possible, while still empowering both myself and Daisy to feel creatively engaged but also incredibly safe. I would just implore any production company both for the benefit of their own TV show or film, to employ intimacy coordinators, and I think, to be honest, in the next few years, it'll become a necessity rather than a choice.
Normal People is now streaming on Hulu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor's Leaked Video From ICU Enrages Bollywood Stars Arjun Kapoor, Mini Mathur And Others</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A video of late Rishi Kapoor, during his last hours from the ICU, was leaked online earlier today. Many Bollywood celebrities took to their social media handles, urging people not to share it if they come across the video. Reportedly, the video shows an intensive care unit staff sneakily recording the actor's struggles.

Many celebs bashed the video and the people who are sharing it. Arjun Kapoor without mentioning about the video wrote, "The choice is not to post something is sometimes as important as to be the first to post something. Images have a lot of power lest we forget. Sometimes humanity and empathy must prevail over being first to embrace use of sly voyeuristic material presented to you."
Actor Karan Wahi said he too came across the video and decided to delete it immediately as he found it disturbing. A report in TOI read Karan as saying, "There's a forward that a ward boy or someone from the hospital has shot of Rishi Kapoor in his hospital just before he passed. I saw it. And think it's a gross violation of his privacy. If you receive it, delete it rather than forward it further."
He added: "Actors are also human beings. Please do not forward or post them just to be the first one. Have some respect."
Mini Mathur took to her twitter page earlier today and urged fans to "stop the insensitivity". In a thread she wrote, "Just came across a disgusting, completely invasive video of Rishi sir on WhatsApp in hospital actually titled "last video of RK" obviously shot by a hospital staff member.I know humanity is at sea at the moment but can we PLEASE STOP THIS INSENSITIVITY and not be party to this?"
She later also asked Mumbai Police to find the offender, "If you see a video like this on any group can you please insist that it's taken down??? Can we stop this vicarious celeb goggling even when they are indisposed and unaware? It should be a legal offence @MumbaiPolice and met with the strictest action,"
On Thursday, only a few hours after his passing, another video of Rishi Kapoor from the hospital had gone viral. The video showed a man singing Rishi Kapoor's hit song Tere dard se dil aabaad raha from Deewana, while standing besides the late actor. Many netizens claimed the video was from the time when the actor was receiving cancer treatment in New York, and not recent.
Rishi Kapoor breathed his last at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai on Thursday, April 30, 2020, after battling cancer for two years.

Mathur urged people to “stop the insensitivity”.
She tweeted: “Just came across a disgusting, completely invasive video of Rishi sir on WhatsApp in hospital actually titled ‘last video of RK’ obviously shot by a hospital staff member. I know humanity is at sea at the moment but can we PLEASE STOP THIS INSENSITIVITY and not be party to Mathur?”
Mini also tagged Mumbai Police to take strict actions against the offender.
“If you see a video like this on any group can you please insist that it’s taken down??? Can we stop this vicarious celeb goggling even when they are indisposed and unaware? It should be a legal offence @MumbaiPolice and met with the strictest action,” Mini added.
Rishi died at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai on Thursday. He had been battling cancer since 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has taken to Instagram to show off his wildly different lockdown hair choices.
In one picture he showed off slick back and styled hairdoo, while in another his silver hair was sticking up and unkempt.
The TV personality wore a smart polo shirt in the black and white pic of his slick look while in the other he grimaced as his mop spiked in all directions.
And fans of the presenter who wrote with his snap: "Lockdown hair options" had mixed opinions about his wacky hair styles.
One wrote: "The second wild look!!."
Another said: "Silver fox, followed by two flame emojis."
A fan wrote: "Wow Phillip! Rocking them hair styles."
Another added: "I like the nutty professor look!"
While other fans were not as impressed with Phillip's lockdown hair choices.
One wrote: "Cut it all offfffffff."
Another said: "How many likes on this comment for you to shave it all off."
The This Morning host also posted his smart hair style on his Instagram stories, captioning it: "If ya can't cut it, slick it."
Philtook to his Instagram earlier this week to share the same snap of is unkempt hair.
In the pic Phil appeared to be sitting in a balcony area on on a plush grey sofa in his new place.
The pic was taken from his new bachelor pad where he moved to after moving out of the home he shared with his wife Steph when he came out as gay earlier this year.
Phillip admitted that he 'misses hugs' after moving out of the £2million family home on Monday's episode of This Morning.
He also this week opened up on how This Morning going ahead amid the coronavirus lockdown allowed him to keep positive mentally.
He said: "It's very good for the head isn't it. I think this has saved my head actually, being able to come in here and keep going."
Later on in the show, Phillip shared important advice as he encouraged one tearful viewer to remain positive during the unusual situation of lockdown.
He said: "You've got to think positive, it's a time where we are all trying to find a silver lining in what is a very dark cloud... we will all get through this."=

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Beckham has shared a heartwarming video montage to celebrate her husband David's 45th birthday today.
The fashion designer, 46, shared the clip this morning showing nostalgic unseen videos and pictures, and had The Doobie Brothers hit Long Train Runnin' playing in the background.
A clip also shows son Brooklyn, 21, surprising his dad for his 43rd birthday.
She also shared a snap in a separate post of the pair walking Rottweilers Snoop and Puffy in Manchester 23 years ago.
The former Spice Girl Victoria captioned her post: "Happy birthday @DavidBeckhamx Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago."
David was also seen in a video with his family walking through Disneyland Florida wearing Mickey Mouse ears on over his black baseball cap.
Cruz and Romeo were also shown playing guitars when they were children.
Another snap shows the Beckham family sat on the front row at one of her fashion shows.
The family were also seen in a throwback pic when they were at the Grand Canyon in the US.
She captioned her sweet montage: "Happy bday to the best daddy. Celebrating in lockdown and missing @brooklynbeckham and all our friends and family today. We all love you so much xxx', she captioned the post."
Many fans rushed to the comments section to send David well wishes.
One wrote: "Many happy returns to the most wonderful David!"
Victoria also shared a picture of a bacon and egg sandwich on her Instagram stories with "love" written in tomato ketchup, which was captioned "happy birthday David Beckham".
This week Victoria reversed her decision to furlough 30 employees at her fashion company after coming under immense criticism.
The entrepreneur, who has a combined fortune of £335 million with husband David, opted to use the government bail out scheme and use tax-payers' money to pay 80% of her staff's wages while they are at home.
However, Posh has now undergone a change of heart after being 'devastated' by the public reaction.
Her fashion brand had earlier sent letters to staff warning them that they were going to be furloughed under the Government's scheme for two months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nicola Mclean dishes the dirt on hellish stars during I'm a Celeb stint</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nicola Mclean has told how former I'm A Celeb 2008 camp mate David Van Day wound her up on the show and was an "absolute t***".
The former glamour model, 38, invited fans to take part in a Q & A session on her Instagram stories.
When asked who was her most favourite and least contestant on the eighth series of the show Nicola told how former 80s pop star, 63, infuriated her.
She said: "My least favourite was David Van Day because he was an absolute t***. Literally his sole purpose was to p*** everyone off. it worked good for him but oh my god it was hell to live with."
David Van Day has been approached by Mirror Online for comment.
Nicola invited her fans to ask her questions to 'give her some entertainment during self-isolation'.
She said: "Entertain me guys, ask me some advice, tell me some outrageous stories, ask me a question, anything you want."
When one fan asked how is she coping with lockdown, Nicola said
'she was doing alright now, but took her a while to get used to it'.
Another fan asked if she would ever get a bum job?
Nicola replied: "No I hate them, I hate big bums I want to look straight up and down with big boobs."
Nicola claimed in November 2017 that David, who rose to fame in the duo Dollar, made sexual advances towards her on camera.
Responding to the comments, David Van Day's wife, Sue Moxley, told MailOnline : "This was all a bit of harmless fun for TV. It was before I met David nine years ago. I don't know why this is being brought up now. She hasn't been in the press much recently.
"I though Nicola and I were friends. It would have been nice if she gave me the heads up. We've actually all posed together as a group at a red carpet event since the programme aired and everything was fine and friendly."
Nicola is married to footballer Tom Williams, and the couple have two sons, Rocky and Striker.
Nicola finished sixth I'm A Celebrity... and also appeared in CelebrityBig Brother

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cyntoia Brown love story: Marriage and children plans after 15 years in prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyntoia Brown's nightmare battle for justice has gone global - with a hit Netflix documentary, star backing and follow on book on the way.
But after the Netflix cameras stopped rolling the now justice campaigner Cyntoia, 32, had to begin paving a new life for herself post release with a husband, plans for children and a potential law career.
In fact, even before Cyntoia had left prison she married rapper Jamie Long - who inspired her to believe she would eventually become a free woman.
Long said he first discovered Cyntoia and her plight on a 2011 YouTube video, saying he felt compelled to watch her: "I felt God tell me, stop and write her. I told her basically, 'God told me to tell you you're getting out of prison'."
He sent the letter in 2017 and even burnt the edges to make it stand out from her other fan mail.
"There was just something about him," Cyntoia said and four months latert they met face t o face.
"When I went in to see her, I knew right then she would be my wife. I bought my wife's wedding ring while she was still in prison, and we didn't know if she was getting out," he said, recalling their romance.
They got engaged two years later and married before she was released in 2019.
They plan on starting a family, with her husband saying: "I want to settle down and start a family. I want to live for you and please you. This time I got it right, and I know I got it right."
Since her release, Brown-Long has gone on a national speaking tour and is thinking about law school.
Cyntonia was released on August 7 last year after her life sentence was commuted to 15 years.
She admitted killing Johnny Michael after he solicited her for sex - he was aged 43, she was a very young looking 16.
Since her conviction both Tennessee and American law changed significantly over the sentencing of minors for serious crimes and millions protested about the length of jail time for Cyntoia, an at-risk-child at the mercy of a series of a predatory men.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV funnyman David Walliams has branded Jamie Redknapp's mum a 'hot mama'.
The Britain's Got Talent Judge, 48, was left mighty impressed when footballer Jamie, 46, took to social media to share a tribute to his 74-year-old mother on her birthday.
Taking to Instagram, Jamie shared images of his toned mum Sandra posing in swimwear and showing off her classic good looks with her high cheekbones.
Clearly ageing like a fine wine, svelte Sandra looks incredible in the photos.
Jamie captioned the post: "Happy birthday to this incredible lady. We adore you mum. Thanks for your wisdom, love and care."
The former husband of Louise Redknapp, with whom he shares two sons, also spoke about being separated from his mother during the lockdown procedures enforced by the government as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
"You have been a rock throughout my life, given me support that I hope I can give my kids throughout their lives too. I miss you and I can’t wait to see you.
"No doubt you will be waiting on dad hand and foot today!
"But make sure he looks after you. See you soon when this is over and love you always. Your boy Jamie."
Many of Jamie's followers were loving the pics, but none more so than Mr Little Britain himself, David Walliams.
David commented on the post: "Hot Mama."
Jamie wasn't the only one who was sharing a tribute to Sandra, as it was also his father and her husband, football legend Harry Redknapp.
"Happy birthday Sandra I love you more now than the day I met you if that’s possible," wrote Harry on his Instagram account.
The couple first met in 1963 on the dancefloor of an East London pub when Sandra was 17.
Harry noted when appearing on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!: "We were only just 17 when we started going out, and we’ve never been apart since. I love her like mad – she’s my life."
He later went on to win the 2018 series of the show and was crowned King of the Jungle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island's Curtis Pritchard poses completely naked as he does gardening in the buff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Curtis Pritchard has been showing a very different side to himself during lockdown.
The former Love Island star, 24, took to Instagram to post a picture of himself completely naked on Saturday.
He decided to strip off to honour Naked Gardening Day 2020 and could be seen wearing a pair of gloves and holding a gardening fork.
In the saucy snap he had his back to the camera and flashed his bare bum as he held up the fork in the air.
He was wearing nothing but a pair of black boots and socks as he posed in his driveway.
"HAPPY INTERNATIONAL NAKED GARDENING DAY!" Curtis captioned the post.
His 1.5million Instagram followers were left in stitches by the cheeky snap.
One commented: "You're welcome to come and do my garden any time."
"Only you Curtis!!!! Love it x," another posted.
A third wrote: "I'm in urgent need of a gardener."
"You can be my gardener any day," a fourth said.
Another posted: "Well that's cheered my Saturday up no end!"
It comes after reports that Curtis' TV show The Greatest Dancer has been axed.
The decision comes comes after producers pulled out all the stops with an all star cast for the 2020 series and big name performers that sadly failed to pull in viewers.
A source told The Sun: "Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they've binned it.
"Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner names daughter Stormi her greatest achievement with adorable poolside snap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Kylie Jenner has named what she considers he greatest achievement - her daughter Stormi.
The reality star and makeup mogul shares the two year old with ex and rapper Travis Scott, and paid tribute to her beautiful girl with a cute snap by the pool.
Stormi has a mischievous grin on her face as doting mum Kylie wraps a towel about her head to dry her curls.
"The greatest thing I've ever done," Kylie captioned the snap.
Pals and fans alike were quick to gush over the iconic mother-daughter duo.
Malika Haqq, the best mate of Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian and fellow mum, wrote: "Stop the cuteness!"
Kylie's bestie Anastasia Karanikolaou commented: "sweeeeeeetest baby girl."
Yris Palmer, meanwhile, just shared a string of heart emojis.
Kylie's had a hell of a year already, not least because she was named by Forbes, at the age of 22, as the world's youngest billionaire for the second year running.
She's had fans tongue-wagging recently with a declaration of love for Stormi's dad Travis - the pair aren't together, but a loving Instagram post for his birthday has some hopeful that a reunion might be on the cards.
"DADA," she wrote, "Happy birthday to daddy of the year!
"I'm slowly but surely starting to accept the fact that Storm is a daddy's girl. But whatever. We went half on greatness!
"The most beautiful, smart, funny and loving little baby. The best gift.
"OK I'm crying. Love you forever! @travisscott."
The pair announced they would be taking a break from their relationship late last year - and while no romantic rekindling has been confirmed, they've successfully co-parented Stormi.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent 2020 viewers were left sharing their disbelief over one hopeful's age on Saturday night, as she took to the stage with her young daughter.
Singing duo Honey and Sammy wowed the judges and fans with their moving rendition of Freya Ridings’ Lost Without You.
They went on to win Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer in emotional scenes, with the judge in tears.
But before they’d even started singing, viewers watching at home were stunned over something mum Sammy said.
Asked by Simon Cowell for her age, after confirming her daughter was 14, Sammy revealed that she was 43 years old.
Stunning Sammy’s youthful looks left viewers in shock though, with many believing she was much younger.
Taking to twitter, they couldn't believe her real age and some even thought the girls were sisters.
One fan commented: "Bloody hell is that really her mum."
Another said: "43? she looks fantastic #BGT #BritainsGotTalent."
A third tweeted: "Omg they look like sisters!!"
The pair were stopped mid performance by Simon Cowell, with him asking for a different song.
A little later the mother and daughter returned, and left the judges speechless with their audition.
Amanda was moved to tears and praised the pair, before hitting her Golden Buzzer.
Sammy and Honey burst into tears, as Amanda joined them on stage.
Britain's Got Talent continues Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mystery over Rob Kardashian and stunning British influencer Kenza Boutrif's new friendship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rob Kardashian has just added stunning British model and influencer Kenza Boutrif to his Instagram following, taking the total up to 21.
The 33-year-old reality star set tongues wagging on social media after giving the UK-based model and social media star a follow over the weekend.
Rob's tiny following is usually reserved for his closest family and friends, such as his sisters Kourtney, Khloe and Kim Kardashian.
The reality star's unusual move came less than a week after he made a rare appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians to celebrate his daughter's birthday.
But what do we know about Rob's new social media friend?
Kenza Boutrif is a glamorous social media model that is represented by Wilhelmina Models.
She boasts an impressive following of 634,000 fans on Instagram and only follows 103 back - including Rob.
The well-travelled influencer boasts pictures taken in Dubai, New York and Los Angeles among her incredible collection of jet setting snaps and she was also at London Fashion Week earlier this year.
Among her stellar collection of pictures, she has also received plenty of approval from other popular UK reality stars.
Some of her pictures have been liked by Love Island stars Belle Hassan and Yewande Biala.
Kenza also has her own Depop page where she is selling plenty of designer goods such as Comme Des Garcons and a pair of Alexander McQueen trainers.
In the meantime, Rob is currently embroiled in a bitter fued with his ex-girlfriend and model Blac Chynna.
The former couple dated back in 2016 and their daughter was born just one month before their split was made official.
Since then, the volatile couple have been caught up in an ongoing and complicated custody battle over their Dream.
At the end of February 2020, a judge denied Rob's request to have primary custody over his daughter.
Both Rob and Kenza have been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mystery over Rob Kardashian and stunning British influencer Kenza Boutrif's new friendship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rob Kardashian has just added stunning British model and influencer Kenza Boutrif to his Instagram following, taking the total up to 21.
The 33-year-old reality star set tongues wagging on social media after giving the UK-based model and social media star a follow over the weekend.
Rob's tiny following is usually reserved for his closest family and friends, such as his sisters Kourtney, Khloe and Kim Kardashian.
The reality star's unusual move came less than a week after he made a rare appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians to celebrate his daughter's birthday.
But what do we know about Rob's new social media friend?
Kenza Boutrif is a glamorous social media model that is represented by Wilhelmina Models.
She boasts an impressive following of 634,000 fans on Instagram and only follows 103 back - including Rob.
The well-travelled influencer boasts pictures taken in Dubai, New York and Los Angeles among her incredible collection of jet setting snaps and she was also at London Fashion Week earlier this year.
Among her stellar collection of pictures, she has also received plenty of approval from other popular UK reality stars.
Some of her pictures have been liked by Love Island stars Belle Hassan and Yewande Biala.
Kenza also has her own Depop page where she is selling plenty of designer goods such as Comme Des Garcons and a pair of Alexander McQueen trainers.
In the meantime, Rob is currently embroiled in a bitter fued with his ex-girlfriend and model Blac Chynna.
The former couple dated back in 2016 and their daughter was born just one month before their split was made official.
Since then, the volatile couple have been caught up in an ongoing and complicated custody battle over their Dream.
At the end of February 2020, a judge denied Rob's request to have primary custody over his daughter.
Both Rob and Kenza have been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gogglebox viewers rank the stars with one group taking nearly 40% of the vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gogglebox has become beloved by millions, and everyone has their favourites.
Fans recently took part in a poll that allowed them to put forward which of the 11 groups they reckoned deserved the honour of the top spot.
The poll, conducted by The Liverpool Echo, asked fans to order the stars based on how much they make them laugh - with one even stealing 39% of the vote.
Below are all 11 groups, ranked...
London family the Vens joined the show quite late, during season 11 in 2018.
Marcus, girlfriend Mica, and her two daughters Sachelle and Shuggy have become renowned for their bubbly personalities, fits of laughter, and on point honesty.
Mica provided a priceless fan favourite moment as they sat down to watch Victoria Coren Mitchell's notoriously tricky Only Connect, laughing: "This show isn't for the hood, man."
Dad Andrew, mum Carolyne and son Louis have been Gogglebox fixtures since the show first kicked off.
Their numbers have fluctuated, as twin sisters Alex and Catheryne seem to come and go as well.
The family have become best known for Andrew's uncompromising and often scathing wit, as he kicks back in that enormous armchair.
Brighton hairdresser Stephen first appeared on the show alongside then boyfriend Chris, before the pair went their separate ways.
He's since been joined by husband Daniel, as well as mum Pat for a stint.
Stephen is responsible for one of the most iconic Gogglebox moments.
As he and Chris watched the news, the latter observed: "We all like a bad boy, don't we?"
A stunned Stephen looks around and answers: "Not a f**king terrorist though, Chris!"
Dave and Shirley have been married for a staggering 40 years, filming the show from their home in Wales.
Joining the show in 2015, fans have learned that the pair have a genuine deep love for each other - but that won't stop them having a bicker now and again.
Ellie and Izzi stirred the pot recently when they made their feelings very clear about Boris Johnson.
Still, the Yorkshire sisters are mostly a light hearted pair, most often obsessing over food.
When they first put their names down for the show, they reckoned people wouldn't be interested in what they had to say.
The poll begs to differ...
Bristol besties Mary and Marina are completely unfiltered and they hold nothing back.
Both in their 80s, they film from a retirement home and have won legions of fans as their conversations go off on tangents.
Dad Sid and sons Baasit and Umar are well known for their no nonsense slams and quick wit.
The core three are often joined by other family members, like sister Raza and their mum.
The family of four have carved out a place as firm fan favourites, as have their Rottweilers.
The dogs can be seen having a nose about the place and often trying to swipe a biscuit or two when they think the family won't notice.
In fact, their snack collection has become the stuff of Gogglebox legend, with fans not convinced they ever eat them themselves.
Probably the quirkiest couple on the list, Giles and Mary will always have a place in fans' hearts.
The posh duo's home is instantly memorable, as are their lengthy and eloquent rants about whatever they're watching.
Coming in second place with 23% of the vote, brother and sister Pete and Sophie were string contenders for the top spot despite only arriving on the show in 2018.
The Blackpool pair have become renowned for mocking each other as much as they do the telly, so it's no surprise they've proved a hit with fans.
Taking the top spot are the iconic, the legendary, the one and only Jenny and Lee.
The caravan-based pair from Hull swept up a whopping 39% of the vote, landing them as the firm victors.
They first met when Jenny was a landlady and Lee was a pub regular, and have since struck up the sweetest - and funniest friendship.
Joining in 2014, it's not difficult to see why they've managed to place themselves at the top of the list.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Apprentice star Lottie Lion apologises after Lord Sugar 'racist' comments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apprentice has had its fair share of big personalities, but you'd be hard pressed to find one who could outmatch the controversial Lottie Lion.
Lottie, who's only 20 years old, made her mark among last year's contenders and had accusations of racism levelled against her.
Now she's found herself in hot water again after her impression of Venezuelan born team mate Jemelin Artigas stoked some considerable backlash.
Jemelin, who's clashed with Lottie before, shared a video sent to her on her own Twitter, in which Lottie and contestant Ryan-Mark Parson take part in an Instagram Live.
Lottie mocks Jemelin's accent while Ryan-Mark laughs along.
She added, in her own voice: "It's like, darling, we all started from nothing - I started from nothing."
Lottie went on to say: "If we're going to talk about f**king racists, let's talk about Lord Sugar!
"He's an actual racist!"
Mirror Online have gone to Lord Sugar's rep for comment.
Lottie and Ryan-Mark have since apologised over her impersonation, telling MailOnline : "We impersonated various candidates from The Apprentice on our Instagram Live on Friday.
"We are aware one candidate has taken offence and can only apologise."
On social media she had previously defended her comments as "light entertainment" rather than anything meant to hurt.
"Doing these impressions of The Apprentice candidates last night was meant to be some light entertainment for my fans during these difficult times ," she tweeted.
"I am aware that an individual HAS taken offence, and I can only apologise."
Nor has Jemelin been silent on the matter, sharing a string of tweets explaining her position.
She branded Lottie "the biggest racist" and accused the pair of being "pathetic" after Lottie issued her apology tweet.
However, she retweeted Ryan-Mark's apology and wrote: "I will always appreciate people taking responsibility so thank you @ryanmarkparsons and even though I know some not so nice things have been said.
"I appreciate you apologising so thank you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry stripped naked for her latest social media offering as she posed in a nude selfie.
The actress, 53, told her 6.1 million followers that she was indulging in some self-care.
She added that she's been using Taraji P Henson's products, paying tribute to her pal and urging fans to give her stuff a go.
"I've known this woman since she started in the industry," Halle wrote, "And it's been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed.
"Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favourites!"
The Hollywood icon recently reminisced about her time in the industry, including her work on Die Another Day, Pierce Brosnan's last Bond film before he hung up the mantle.
Halle recalled that the Irish actor, now 66, had to give her the Heimlich Manoeuvre as she choked on a fig during a steamy sex scene.
Chatting with American talk show host Jimmy Fallon from her home, she dished: "I was supposed to be all sexy, trying to seduce him with a fig, and then I ended up choking on it and he had to get up and do the Heimlich.
"James Bond knows how to Heimlich!
"He was there for me, he will always be one of my favourite people in the world."
She was playing love interest and fellow spy Jinx, revealing that the studio had even flirted with the idea of giving her character her own spinoff flick.
She's also been battling online trolls since going into lockdown, clapping back at those who passed judgement on her for letting six year old Maceo-Robert wear high heels.
"Is this your daughter or your son?" one wrote.
She came back: "Well it's a he and he is having a ball. Tryna cope the best he can! Laughter helps a lot right now."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry stripped naked for her latest social media offering as she posed in a nude selfie.
The actress, 53, told her 6.1 million followers that she was indulging in some self-care.
She added that she's been using Taraji P Henson's products, paying tribute to her pal and urging fans to give her stuff a go.
"I've known this woman since she started in the industry," Halle wrote, "And it's been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed.

"Of course we are so excited. I'm excited to become a oma [grandmother] in September especially after I lost my mom so recently.
Gigi then confirmed the news herself in a video chat with US talk show host Jimmy Fallon.
"We're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support," she gushed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Chase fans in disbelief over contestant's likeness to Emmerdale legend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Viewers tuning into The Chase's family special on Sunday, called The Family Chase, were left stunned by one contestant.
Those watching the ITV gameshow dubbed her a lookalike of a former Emmerdale legend.
Viewers thought contestant Paula looked so much like the character in particular, that they began calling her by said character's name.
Emmerdale fans were quick to spot she looked remarkably like Val Pollard.
Val was married to Eric Pollard in the Dales, before her tragic death in 2015 during the helicopter stunt.
She was played by actress Charlie Hardwick since 2004.
As Paula appeared on The Chase on Sunday, fans spotted the huge resemblance between her and the actress who played Val.
From the hair colour to the matching style, and even the Geordie accent, fans couldn't believe their eyes.
One viewer said: "Seat 2  #TheChase," with an image of Val leading to many others agreeing.
Another fan agreed: "Val up now! #TheChase."
A third said: "Now it's Val from Emmerdale  #Thefamilychase."
Unfortunately, like her sister who went before her, Paula was caught by the Chaser, Paul Sinha, and sent home.
As her departure aired, one fan tweeted: "That was too f***ing easy. Now do one back to the Woolpack, Val."
A second fan hoped she might return for the final chase, and said: "Go low & bring Val back oot!"
Unfortunately, it was just Hannah left to play in the final round and she and the family did not win the cash prize.
The Chase airs weeknights at 5pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who will take Holly Willoughby's spot on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that Holly Willoughby had opted to leave Celebrity Juice, the show needs a new team captain.
With no official word on who will fill Holly's shoes, fans are busy speculating as to who will be baring the brunt of Keith Lemon's most outrageous gags.
Holly did just that for 12 years, having been a team captain since the show got off the ground way back in 2008 - but who will take her place?
The biggest theories are below...
The Corrie and Our Girl star is probably the front runner right now.
Both Michelle and hunky husband Mark Wright have made appearances on the show, and both were a hit with fans.
Bookies Ladbrokes are backing her too, a spokesman saying: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI: Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor's ashes were immersed in Banganga tank here on Sunday, his elder brother Randhir Kapoor said.
Rishi Kapoor died at the age of 67 on April 30 at H N Reliance hospital in south Mumbai, after a two year long battle with leukaemia.
Randhir Kapoor said a prayer meet for the actor was held on Saturday.
"We did prayer meet yesterday. Today we immersed his ashes in Banganga as we haven't received permission from the authorities to go to Haridwar," Randhir Kapoor told PTI.

A picture has gone viral on social media, where Rishi Kapoor's actor-son Ranbir and wife Neetu are seen sitting next to his photograph.
According to family sources, the actor's daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, who was unable to attend the funeral as she was travelling from Delhi by road, was present at the prayer meet.
"There were not many people, Only five-six family members," the insider said.
Rishi Kapoor had returned to India last September after undergoing treatment for cancer in the US for almost a year.
In February, he was hospitalised twice.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande team up, release song to benefit frontline workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: Pop superstars Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande are teaming up for the first time on a duet that will fund scholarships for the children of health and emergency workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.
The duet, called Stuck With U, will be released on May 8, the two singers announced on Friday on Instagram, where they jointly have some 316 million followers.
All net proceeds from streaming and sales of the duet will be donated to the First Responders Children’s Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for the children of those working during the pandemic.
Bieber, 26, and Grande, 26, two of the biggest young singers in the United States with hits like Love Yourself and Thank U, Next, have never recorded a song together.
“We hope we make a big difference with this and we hope it uplifts you and makes you feel happy,” Grande said in a statement.
The single is the first in series from Scooter Braun, who manages both singers, that will benefit charities during the year, Braun said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You could be in the music video for Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's new track</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber are teaming up for a new track, and they want fans to be a part of it.
Grande and Bieber made the announcement Friday, on their respective social media pages. The song, called "Stuck With U," is set to be released on May 8, with proceeds going to the First Responder Children's Foundation, to fund grants and scholarships for children of health care workers, EMTs, paramedics, police officers and firefighters on the frontlines, Grande said.
But wait, there's more.
Bieber and Grande went ahead and posted an instrumental version of the song, instructing their fans to tweet videos of themselves dancing to the track -- in the prom dresses or suits they didn't get to wear, with their dogs or just alone in whatever is comfy.
The fan videos will end up as a part of the music video for the track when it's released.
Grande and Bieber aren't the first artists to release new music during the pandemic, with proceeds going to frontline workers.
Internationally renowned Nigerian singer Davido released his new music video, "Dolce & Gabbana," last month, and announced all proceeds would go to the Dolce & Gabbana and Humanitas Together for Coronavirus Research fund.
U2 singer Bono also wrote a new song back in March, called "Let Your Love Be Known," dedicated to health care workers on the frontlines and anyone struggling.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Katie Price reveals she needs therapy for life after ‘slowly going off the rails for 10 years’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KATIE Price claims she needs therapy for life as she comes to terms with 'going off the reals' in a clip from her new TV show.
The 41-year-old doesn't hold back in the hour-long special of My Crazy Life, telling viewers she's been to "hell and back".
In a teaser clip, she says: "I've been slowly going off the rails for just over 10 years.
"At times I've been a mess. I've been to hell and back, but I'm starting to feel like me again.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intense therapy that will continue for the rest of my life has got me back to being me.
"It just goes to show, if I can do it, anyone can!"
Katie recently revealed to The Sun Online how she burst into tears after being reunited with children Princess and Junior after six weeks apart.
The mum-of-five has suffered a tough time being separated from her kids in lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis.
The family were forced apart after Junior, 14, showed signs of the deadly bug while staying with his dad Peter Andre.
This week she was finally able to see him and 12-year-old Princess again.
Katie told us: “I can't believe how much the kids have grown in six weeks - Pete's had them sleeping in grow bags!
"I welled up, it’s been a tough six weeks not being able to hug them.
"After five minutes together it was back to the usual fun and craziness."
Meanwhile Katie has been staying with pals at a posh pad in Surrey - just ten minutes away from Peter - as she isolates with her eldest son Harvey.
She has been shielding the disabled 17-year-old from danger because he is at high-risk from coronavirus because of his health condition.
Her youngest kids Jett and Bunny have been living with their dad Kieran Hayler and his fiancee Michelle Penticost.
Junior and Princess have spent the last six weeks with Peter and his wife Emily - who is an A&E doctor battling coronavirus on the frontline.
It has meant Katie's kids haven't been able to all be together since lockdown began.
"It’s been hardest on Harvey because he really misses the contact with his siblings," Katie added.
"Fingers crossed we’ll be a complete unit with Jett and Bunny joining us this weekend.
"My children are my perfect pieces of heaven - they have kept me strong through thick and thin.
"Unconditional love is free and means everything to me.”
The 41-year-old reality star posted a cute video last night of Harvey, Princess and Junior clapping the NHS on their doorstep.
"It’s Thursday, so let’s show our appreciation and respect for all the incredible key workers keeping our country going", she told fans.

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Beckham celebrates 45th birthday with personalised wrapping paper alongside Victoria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">David Beckham celebrated his 45th birthday by unwrapping gifts that were wrapped with paper sporting his own face.
Wife Victoria posted images on her Instagram of the pair enjoying a bacon sandwich.
She wrote the words "Love you" on the plate using tomato ketchup.
Victoria posted: "Happy birthday to the best daddy. Celebrating in lockdown and missing @brooklynbeckham and all our friends and family today. We all love you so much xxx."
A throwback image of the pair from when they met in 1997 also made it to social media.
Below the image was the caption: "Happy birthday @davidbeckham x Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago. Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much x."
Victoria celebrated her 46th birthday in April with the Beckhams currently isolating at their Cotswolds home.
The birthday messages continued to pour in from the former Manchester United star's various connections.

Current Red Devils man Marcus Rashford said "Happy birthday Becks."
He also posted an image of an old Beckham United shirt which he had got signed by the free-kick specialist back in the day.
It read: "To Marcus. Good luck and continue working hard and playing with joy and passion. Love David Beckham."
After he left United the former England skipper played from Real Madrid, LA Galaxy and AC Milan.
The latter took to their Twitter account to say: "Becks turns 45 today! Happy birthday, David Beckham."
Since retiring from football the London-born star has invested in Salford City alongside his Class of 92 team-mates.
The now football league club were promoted last term thanks to the group's support and the club said: "Happy birthday to David Beckham from everyone at Salford City.
"Have a great day, Becks."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ajith Doesn’t Celebrate His Birthday Due To This Reason, And It Will Surely Shock You!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thala Ajith rang in his 49th birthday yesterday along with his family. Unlike the previous years, the actor's birthday was not highly celebrated by the fans due to the Coronavirus lockdown and Ajith's request to fans to stay home, given the pandemic. It was also reported that there will be no updates or PR activities related to his upcoming film Valimai, directed by H Vinoth.
Well, a recent tweet on Twitter has shocked the netizens which states that Ajith stopped celebrating his birthday since 1994. The user has revealed that Ajith doesn't celebrate his birthday since the year in memory of F1 driver Ayrton Senna. He wrote, "Being an ardent Senna fan Ajith doesn't celebrate his birthdays after 1994 in memory of the great Ayrton Senna. Ajith's like a Senna biographer- knows every single detail!!"
Apparently the Brazilian racing driver Ayrton met with an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix whilst driving for William Racing. The unfortunate accident took place on Ajith's birthday, i.e. on May 1.
For the unversed, Ajith is also a race car driver who has competed in circuits around India, in places such as Mumbai, Chennai, and Delhi. He is one among the few Indians who have raced in the International arena and Formula 1 championships.
Going back to the Tweet, actor Dulquer Salmaan, who was surprised which this fact, tweeted, "Wow never knew that!! He's become a bigger hero in my eyes now!". Well, there are also a few photos of Ajith celebrating birthday going viral on the internet. But a few have tweeted that the person who tweeted the information is misleading the people with false information.
On a related note, Ajith will be resuming the shoot of Valimai, which is his second collaboration with H Vinoth after the success of Nerkonda Paarvai, post lockdown. The action-thriller bankrolled by Boney Kapoor will have the actor essaying the role of a police officer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The night Marv Albert became the Voice of Madison Square Garden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever stare at a radio? You have? But for 2½ hours?
A lot of us did just that, 50 years ago this Friday.
In 1970, Marv Albert was not yet quite Marv Albert. From 1967, when he became the kid radio voice of Knicks and Rangers home games over 1050-AM WHN, he was a rising figure hustling whatever breaks came his way. But he wasn’t yet there.
And perhaps because we had not yet developed a sense of TV entitlement, it didn’t seem like the worst thing in the world that while the rest of the country could watch Game 7 of the Lakers-Knicks Finals on ABC, the home-team market — the hamlet of New York City — under antiquated regional restrictions, could only access the game live via local radio, a game called by a kid barely out of his radio go-fer overalls.
Ah, but the telecast, called by Chris Schenkel and Jack Twyman, would not appear until 11 p.m. Eastern Time via tape delay. The game began here at 7:30.
“Things,” Albert said Friday, “were very different then.”
So Gotham anxiously hovered over radios, listening to a young man who worked alone and apparently didn’t miss a thing — starting with Willis Reed’s delayed, badly hobbled, leg-dragging appearance during warm-ups.
“As injured as he was, Willis was still the pregame guest,” Albert said Friday. “He’d just had a cortisone shot and was in terrible pain. Yet, he said, ‘No doubt, I’m going to play.’
“But players say that all the time. If you looked at the way he was walking — or trying to walk — you’d have said, ‘Forget it. He may sit on the bench, but there’s no way he’s going to play.’ He hadn’t played in Game 6 [a 22-point loss in L.A.]. He sat on the bench.
“I remember it was 7:27, the teams were warming up and the Garden was chanting, ‘We want Willis!’ And then there he comes, limping out. Everything stopped. I recall the Lakers, especially Wilt Chamberlain, looking over. They were astonished. Still, they didn’t know if he’d play.”
Reed started and hit the Knicks’ first two shots — flat-footed fall-away “jumpers” — his only points of the game, but plenty.
“Even with headsets on, I couldn’t hear myself,” Albert said. “That was the loudest crowd, before or since, I ever heard in the Garden.”
That was the night the Knicks — the best basketball team to ever represent New York — won their first NBA championship, 113-99, the night Marv Albert irrevocably became — come Jim Dolan or high water — the Voice of Madison Square Garden.
That 1969-70 Knicks team and Albert seemed a celestial blend. Albert put the game first, and the Knicks played the game best. In fact, though — or because — it had, at 60-22, the NBA’s best record, none of its players were among the leaders in offensive stats save Frazier, who finished second to Seattle’s Lenny Wilkens — in assists.
Albert’s call remains in my head. And I’m hardly alone. Walt Frazier on the give-go-and-get to drive Chamberlain dizzy and to shoot 12-for-17 with 19 assists and seven boards while Dave DeBusschere had 17 rebounds — keeping the ball unclaimed by Lakers until he elbowed rebounding position. And Albert seemed to know exactly when to build to the climax of each play, “Kept alive by DeBusschere, back outside to Frazier …”
“You know, it became more extraordinary as the weeks went by and then the years went by. You began to realize that this team was a national story. The appreciation of it all set in.
“But 7:27, when Willis limped out just below where I was, that’s the moment. That will always be the moment.”
ESPN has named TV vet Phil Dean its new producer of “Monday Night Football.” And good luck and games to him.
But there was one thing in ESPN’s announcement that read like an “Uh-oh.” It was, “Phil is an innovative and creative an event producer as we have at ESPN,” according to ESPN VP Conner Schell.
Gulp. That’s the last thing football fans need: more in-game innovation and creativity. More than ever, genuine football fans want to get back to sensible, practical coverage, which means staying on the field — and residually the game — as long and as often as possible.
ESPN’s MNF version specifically has become the carp-in-a-barrel target of discriminate viewers for its logic-defying desires to impede the view and ensnarl the good senses with any and all forms of extraneous, irrelevant jetsam and flotsam.
It’s long past time that live TV sports returned to doing what it used to do best: Provide the best seat in the house — your house, my house — by showing what we were promised — the game.
After all, what sports fan would avoid a network that vows, as a matter of deed and duty, to show games in their most uncluttered form?
Antisocial Distancing. If only Rob Manfred were a real commissioner, the kind who last ruled in 1992 as Fay Vincent, this wouldn’t have been hard.
Full refunds for virus-canceled April games would have been issued in the form of credit card give-backs or refunds as of May 1. Same for May’s canceled games as of June 1. And those make-goods would have included those dubious, “convenience fee” tack-on charges.
Manfred could have — should have — demanded an ASAP credit or refund on those tickets as a matter of good faith, fair play and good business, especially during a health crisis. But, predictably, MLB will allow the clubs to toy with and stall and financially benefit from that simple, fair-play process.
Once people are left to rationalizations, such as “It’s no worse than this” or “No worse than that” — but what’s it better than? — the debate begins to take on water.
For example, my recent lament here that MLB triples are way down from their 1980 totals has been met with the same wishful rationalization: “The ballparks are different now, they’re much smaller.”
Stop. Triples are most often the residual of running hard out of the box on impact. Consider that in 1980 few home run hitters were able to high-five or slap-hands with the first-base coach because he was well on his way to second.
Now, it’s rare when the first-base coach doesn’t await that “runner.”
And as long as baseballs continue to bounce off walls and back toward the infield, triples should not be nearing extinction.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sopranos star Joe Pantoliano was rushed to hospital with a ‘severe head injury’ after being hit by a car.
The 68-year-old actor was struck by a Porsche during a walk with his family in their neighbourhood in Connecticut on Friday.
The Memento star was sent flying several feet backward into a wooden fence by the car, which had skidded across the road after being T-boned by another vehicle, his wife Nancy Sheppard said.
He suffered a gash on his head as well as injuries on his left leg and shoulder.
EMTs arrived quickly and rushed Joe to hospital, where he was given a CT scan, TMZ reported.
Joe – who played Ralph Cifaretto on The Sopranos from 2001 till 2004 – is now recovering back at home.
A family friend posted two photos of him giving the camera a thumbs-up while revealing the wound on his head on his Instagram account on Friday night.
They explained in the caption: ‘Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.
‘He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering. Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming!
‘We’ll reading them to him to help him get better!’
Both drivers in the crash stayed at the scene and police are investigating, accordin to TMZ.
Joe posted a video of a rainbow that was filmed shortly before the accident.
He filmed the rainbow before showing his family walking in front of him and wrote: ‘Look at that rainbow! How do you like that beauty?
‘And all my little rainbows ahead of me.’ 
After shooting to fame in The Sopranos, Joe played Captain Howard in the Bad Boys films and appeared in films like The Matrix and Risky Business.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Pantoliano was reportedly rushed to a hospital after being struck by a car.
Pantoliano and his family were walking in their Connecticut neighbourhood when a skidding Porsche struck the “Sopranos” actor, according to a report from TMZ. The Porsche had been T-boned by another vehicle, the publication added, sourcing the actor’s wife Nancy Pantoliano.
“Nancy says Joe was sent flying a couple feet backward into an old wooden fence. He suffered a gash on his head, plus injuries to his left leg and a shoulder,” the report reads. “EMTs quickly arrived and rushed Joe to a hospital where he’s being treated and waiting on the results of a CT scan.”
Pantoliano is expected to pull through, local police are investigating the situation and both drivers stayed at the potential crime scene.
ET Canada reached out to a rep for the actor, who said Pantoliano “is home recovering and being monitored for a concussion and chest trauma. He is grateful for the good wishes of his fans.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Diana 'tried to kill herself four times', new documentary claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new documentary will claim Princess Diana attempted to kill herself four times and it could be aired on Netflix.
The four-parter - titled 'Being Me: Diana' - will air the struggles of the beloved royal and lay bare her mental health battles and eating disorders.
It will tell all about Diana’s troubled childhood right the way through to her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles.
It is at that point in her life where she tried to to take her own life, the show is set to claim.
The series will also reveal never-before-seen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92. It will make difficult viewing for Prince William and Harry, 23 years on from their mother's death in Paris.
DSP, the TV company behind ITV’s Torvill and Dean, are behind the controversial project, according to The Sun.
It has not yet been officially commissioned by Netflix but filming is already said to have started, sources suggest.
Mirror Online have approached Netflix for comment.
And it will especially be a blow to Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, who are said to be in talks with the streaming giant over future projects.
Harry also worked with Netflix on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special shown only this week.
A TV source told The Sun: “The royals have all refused to take part as have the Spencer family (Diana’s family).
“William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.”
Harry and Meghan are currently looking into new commercial projects as they settle down in Los Angeles, California after quitting as senior royals.
Meghan has already bagged herself a role narrating a Disney documentary, with the couple reportedly hiring an agent to bag them more big roles.
The couple and their baby son Archie are now living a financially independent life after their decisions to step down from the Royal Family means no more taxpayer funds or HRH titles.
Mirror Online has contacted Netflix for a comment.

Netflix has not yet commissioned the programme but TV company DSP has apparently started preparing the project.
Being Me: Diana will also feature claims that the late princess tried to take her own life four times, according to The Sun.
It will also reportedly include unseen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92 and interviews with people close to her.
According to a TV source, quoted in the tabloid, none of her family will take part.
They said: "The royals will refuse to take part as will the Spencer family.
"William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good."
A spokeswoman for Endemol Shine, the parent company for DSP, said: "This is a not a commissioned show and everything within the treatment is already in the public domain."
Harry collaborated with the TV streaming service on a Thomas the Tank Engine 75th anniversary special.

Harry recorded a special message for the show recalling his fond memories of watching the iconic series.
He said: "Thomas the Tank Engine has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years - entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters.
"I certainly have fond memories of growing up with Thomas & Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.
"Very proud to have been asked to take part in this special episode. I wish Thomas & Friends a very happy anniversary."
Prince Harry even carried a Thomas the Tank Engine bag on his first day at nursery school!
He and Meghan are reportedly in talks with Netflix over future projects.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has continued her lockdown ritual of showing off her huge array of stunning outfits to fans.
Sunday's offering included big white trainers, ripped blue jeans and a loose fitting beige crop top that hung off the shoulder.
The 28 year old completed her ensemble with a black and white bucket hat.
It gave Jesy the chance to show off her incredible washboard abs, with starstruck fans flooding to the comments section.
"Girl u are fire," one gushed.
Another wrote: "Oh woooowwwwwww Jess."
A third just penned: "HAWWWWWTTTT."
"You look so stunning," a fourth fawned, while another told Jesy she'd made their Sunday.
Jesy is newly single after splitting from Love Island star Chris Hughes as they self-isolated seperately.
She seems in good spirits despite the breakup, sharing her thoughts on how "the simple things make your heart happy" as she danced in the woods with BFF and new roomie Charlotte Driver.
Meanwhile, Little Mix have been forced to call off their summer tour amid the coronavirus crisis.
The girls - Jesy, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall - told on Twitter : "We are so sad to announce that following the latest government advice, we have had to cancel our upcoming summer tour.
"The health and safety of all our fans and crew is always our number one priority..."
The tour had been set for a June start date, playing across the country including in London's Hyde Park in July.
It was supposed to run into August.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Ava Bennet
Brunette bombshell Olivia Culpo shared a gorgeous throwback snap with her 4.7 million Instagram followers earlier today. She didn’t include a geotag on the post that indicated where the shot was taken, but she appeared to be on a boat jetting over a breathtaking body of water. The sky glowed with shades of pale blue and yellow, and several rock formations were visible off in the distance towards the horizon.
Olivia’s ensemble was simple yet super sexy. On top, she wore a cropped white t-shirt that clung to her curves. The t-shirt had a crew neck that covered up her cleavage, but the cropped length meant that her chiselled stomach was on full display. The top ended just below her breasts, so plenty of her sun-kissed skin remained exposed.
She paired the simple white top with some high-waisted light-wash Daisy Dukes. The photo was cropped part of the way down her legs, so only an inch or so of her toned thighs was visible. The shorts had distressed detailing along one leg, and a frayed hem that gave them a casual vibe.
Olivia finished off the ensemble with a few bold accessories to take the simple look to the next level. Around her waist, she rocked a bold red fanny pack with quilted detailing and a golden logo on the front. The bag accentuated her slim waist, and also added a pop of color to her outfit. She added a pair of sunglasses as well, and some gold hoop earrings.
Olivia’s sunglasses obscured much of her face, so not many details of her eye makeup look were visible, but she framed her eyes with bold brows and had a vibrant red shade on her lips. She rested one hand on the railing beside her while the other was up in the air. The camera captured Olivia while she was in the middle of laughing. Her brunette locks were pulled back in a braid that kept all the focus on her gorgeous face.
Her followers absolutely loved the post, which racked up over 34,200 likes within just 36 minutes. It also received 121 comments from her fans within the same time span.
“So gorgeous!!” one fan said, followed by a heart eyes emoji.
“You have my heart queen,” another follower added.
“Your smile is attractive,” one fan commented, followed by a string of flame emoji.
“So Beautiful,” another said.
Just a few days ago, as The Inquisitr reported, Olivia tantalized her fans by sharing a smoking-hot throwback shot taken for a photoshoot for Sports Illustrated. In the picture, Olivia was sprawled out across a sandy beach wearing a one-piece mesh swimsuit with a plunging neckline that put her cleavage on full display.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd, ‘Scrubs’ star, dies of brain tumour at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, an American actor renowned for his role as Ted Buckland in ‘Scrubs’, a comedy-drama television series, has died after battling a brain tumor.
In January last year, the 56-year-old singer was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor and cancer, which eventually spread to his lungs, jaw, liver, and spine.
Lloyd, however, breathed his last on Thursday, a year after Vanessa Lloyd, his wife, had given birth to their first child together.
“Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many,” Bill Lawrence, the creator of ‘Scrubs’, said while confirming his death on Friday.
“Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with,” Zach Braff, another US actor, who also played a role in ‘Scrubs’, wrote while paying tributes to the late actor.
“Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.”
Lloyd is also known for his roles in a slew of TV shows including ‘Desperate Housewives’, ‘Happy Together’, ‘Shameless’, ‘The West Wing’, and ‘Modern Family’.
He also had guest spots on ‘Spin City’ and ‘Seinfeld’ and notable credits in films like ‘Galaxy Quest’ and “Flubber’. The late actor is survived by his wife and a child.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' actor Sam Lloyd has died</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known as sad-sack lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, died Friday. He was 56.
The actor had been diagnosed with lung cancer in January 2019, per Entertainment Weekly, only weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their first child. At the time, doctors discovered an inoperable tumor in his brain. 
Lloyd, who is the nephew of Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd, had screen career spanning three decades. He jumped between TV and film, in projects as wide-ranging as Flubber, Galaxy Quest, Seinfeld, The West Wing, and Desperate Housewives. 
In addition to his work as an actor, Lloyd was an accomplished musician with the a cappella group The Blanks (which Scrubs fans might recognize as The Worthless Peons) and the Beatles cover band The Butties.
But Lloyd was probably most recognizable as Ted on Scrubs, appearing in all nine seasons and even reprising the role for a guest arc in Cougar Town. 
Some of Lloyd's former colleagues paid tribute to him on social media, including Scrubs star Zach Braff and Scrubs and Cougar Town creator Bill Lawrence.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix show tries to fix Hollywood’s history</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Golden Age film actress Anna May Wong deserves better than what she gets from Netflix’s new Ryan Murphy series, Hollywood. The Chinese-American actress was a significant onscreen presence in an era where actors of color were rare. She appeared in many early pre-Hays Code crime and mystery films, like 1931’s Daughter of the Dragon and 1937’s Daughter of Shanghai, earning particular praise for her role in 1932’s Shanghai Express, opposite Marlene Dietrich. Decades before conversations about diversity in entertainment became the norm, Wong was the first Asian-American to star in a television show, as the titular character in 1951’s The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong.
The second episode of Murphy’s new alt-history period piece introduces aspiring film director Raymond Ainsley (Darren Criss) as he’s visiting Wong (Michelle Krusiec) at her home. She wasn’t offered many jobs during World War II, and she still resents being replaced by a white actress in yellowface for an Oscar-winning role in an adaptation of Pearl S. Buck’s The Good Earth.
Sitting with her, Ainsley confides that he’s also Asian-American. Though his mother is Filipino (like Criss’ actual mother), he’s able to pass as white in Hollywood. He wants to use his privilege to get a foot in the door at the fictional Ace Studios, and make a movie starring Wong that he’s sure will rehabilitate her career.
An alternate history where Ainsley makes Wong a star, as they both navigate America’s racism through an Asian-American lens, would be fascinating, a story well worth telling. The problem is, as with so many Ryan Murphy projects, this strong idea is just one thread in an overcrowded story. By the time Hollywood gets to the Wong subplot, it’s Hollywood’s third major interesting idea. And though the miniseriesonly has seven hourlong episodes to work with, it isn’t the last great idea, either.
Hollywood’s pilot introduces Jack Castello (newcomer David Corenswet), an aspiring actor who gets a job at a gas station that turns out to be a front for a high-end prostitution ring servicing the Hollywood elite. It’s run by Ernie West (Dylan McDermott), a silver fox ex-actor with a troubling hacking cough. Jack’s most loyal client is Avis Amberg (a stunning Patti LuPone), the wife of Ace Studios head Ace Amberg (Rob Reiner). Also featured: Archie (Jeremy Pope) a Black aspiring screenwriter who’s sent Ace Studios a blind script submission about Peg Entwistle — a biopic about the young actress who died by suicide after jumping off the H of the Hollywood(land) sign after being cut from a film. Archie is one of Ernie’s escorts, but unlike Jack, Archie prefers male clients — which leads him to a serious relationship with a young actor named Roy Scherer, soon to be known as Rock Hudson.
And we haven’t even gotten to the fact that Archie’s PegEntwistle flick eventually morphs into a very different fim— a “race picture” now starring Ainsley’s beau, Camille Washington (Laura Harrier, who proved her ample talents in BlackKklansman), who pushes for the idea. As with the introduction of Anna May Wong, this story about a Black studio contract player finally getting her big Lena Horne-esque break would have made for an interesting seven episodes. But Hollywood reveals nothing about Camille, except that she’s talented and beautiful. She has no backstory or personal history, aside from being Ainsley’s girlfriend. It’s strange, given the time, that colorism is never brought up — Harrier is darker-skinned than Horne, and that would have been a definite barrier to film entry in the 1940s. So would her open relationship with a man perceived to be white. The latter is mentioned a few times in passing fashion, but the series doesn’t contend with any of this. Race is at Hollywood’s forefront, but it isn’t explored with any particular care or awareness.
Pose collaborator Janet Mock wrote two episodes of Hollywood, and her scripts’ tonal shift toward more realistic portrayals of racism is noticeable, while still adding to the show’s unevenness. Murphy and Ian Brennan wrote the rest of the show, and the single thing uniting all the threads they’re desperately weaving together is their clear desire to fix Hollywood, and write the wrongs suffered by everyone in the business who wasn’t a straight white man. In the pilot, Jack even states the show’s thesis outright: “Movies don’t just show us the way the world is, they show us how the world could be.” That’s all well and good, but fixing the problems of Hollywood’s Golden Age unfortunately requires the same things fixing Hollywood would require today; namely, getting rid of racism, sexism, and homophobia.
No worries, though — Murphy and Brennan are on it. In Hollywood, the only thing marginalised people need is the backing of a few plucky white folks willing to validate their voices and ideas, as well as their race and sexuality. But when the white characters solve absolutely every problem presented, the agency of the non-white characters disappears. They’re, essentially reduced to pawns moved around the board by more powerful people. Murphy is clearly well-meaning but he’s flirted with both tokenism and the white savior trope before. His hit high-school musical Glee never seemed to know what to do with its talented Black and Asian performers, like Amber P. Riley, Harry Schum Jr., and Jenna Ushkowitz.. Riley’s character Mercedes, for instance, had no backstory, no homelife, and no notable characteristics, aside from the powerhouse voice typically associated with a Black church sound.
Watching Lupone swan sublimely through scene after scene is wonderful, but it’s tempered by the way her character spends so much of her time in the back half of this miniseries being praised and thanked by the people of color under her. Avis and her Ace Studios coworkers, Dick Samuels (Joe Mantello) and Ellen Kinkaid (Holland Taylor), are the white-savior trope personified, but Murphy, Brennan, and their characters don’t seem to grasp this. And with so many of the storylines teasing a more nuanced look at discrimination in entertainment, the tone-deafness becomes one of Hollywood’s major failings.
And strangely, in spite of the show’s focus on discrimination, anti-Semitism is never mentioned — even though Avis, Ace, and their daughter Claire ( Samara Weaving) are revealed as Jewish in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it fashion late in the season, and even though the series takes place literally months after the end of World War II and the Holocaust. Avis and Claire are depicted as struggling purely because they’re women. (And in Claire’s case, because she’s a studio head’s daughter, poor thing.) Given the Ku Klux Klan’s place in Hollywood’s story, even the faintest mention of the group’s notoriousanti-Semetism could have given both characters more depth.
No one wants to watch a show about marginalised people who exist solely to be mired in their social struggles. The suffering-minority trope wasn’t fresh even when it showed up in the melodramas of Hollywood’s era, like in both versions of Imitation of Life. But it’s frustrating to see bigotry casually dismissed as an easy barrier to overcome. Hollywood characters come out as gay with relative ease. Studio execs’ minds are easily changed when they worry putting Camille in a lead role, and the one holdout is conveniently persuaded by Eleanor Roosevelt herself. The white executives even invent the concept of the wide release for the film’s benefit, prompting more thanks.
And when a spark of intrigue is finally introduced and it seems as though the lead players won’t get what they want with ease, the cliffhanger of one episode is miraculously erased within the first few minutes of the next. You’ll never again see Ku Klux Klan cross-burnings receive such a tepid response, or be as quickly forgotten, as they are in Hollywood.
There are ways to acknowledge the realities of bigotry being without making hardships the only things going on in the lives of marginalized characters. Murphy and his team do this incredibly well on Pose, which is perhaps why Mock’s episodes of Hollywood feel slightly more grounded in reality than the rest of the series. On Pose, Mock has pointed out that because the show’s leads are trans women, they don’t have to “defend their identities” or go above and beyond to teach cisgender people a lesson. “They are just trans women who live their lives in gritty, dirty, messy-ass 1980s New York City.” This means that while Pose certainly masterfully deals with topics like the AIDS crisis, hardship doesn’t define the characters’ entire existence. With all Hollywood’s pointed references to real-world events (the Good Earth controversy, Peg Entwistle, Vivian Leigh’s bipolar episodes, the success of films like The Wizard of Oz, and more), Murphy and company clearly aren’t making a pure movieland fantasy.
If they were, Hollywood’s mishmash of storylines and characters might be more palatable. It might be more plausible that an old white man in 1946 took it upon himself to save a “race film” from being destroyed, and aid it into a wide theatrical release. Uneven moments in the script could be overlooked, such as when Camille has to fight her way into her assigned front row seat at the Oscars ceremony (taking advice from Hattie McDaniel, played perfectly via a surprise cameo), even though Archie and Rock Hudson, who are booed as they walk the red carpet hand in hand, had no problems reaching their seats.
But it’s unclear whose story this latest Netflix offering is trying to tell, and it suffers from Murphy and company stuffing too many ideas into too little space. That problem has plagued Murphy for much of his career. His projects trend toward greatness when his involvement is minimal, and the diverse creators in the room are allowed to focushis many ideas. Perhaps the greatest example is his strong, specific miniseries, The People v. OJ Simpson,which he executive-produced without writing an episode. His hands are all over Hollywood — his writing credit is on every episode — and he brought all his usual flaws along with him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'King of Bollywood' and Will Smith in star-studded India virus benefit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI, May 4 — India's “King of Bollywood” superstar Shah Rukh Khan told jokes and sang for his adoring fans yesterday during an almost five-hour online benefit to raise funds for those affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Tens of thousands of viewers watched more than 70 of the country's biggest celebrities — including cricket captain Virat Kohli and actor Khan — as well as international names such as actor Will Smith and rock legend Mick Jagger in the I for India show broadcast on Facebook.
“I can, I will, and I must help,” Khan told fans after singing a cheerful, humourous ditty about how “everything will be alright” following the deadly crisis.
Jagger and Smith spoke about the struggles of rural migrant workers, many of whom have lost their jobs and gone hungry during an ongoing nationwide lockdown imposed from late March.
“They may have lost their jobs, they may have lost their homes. They and their families may be going hungry. So I would like to ask you to donate. Please give what you can,” Jagger said.
Bollywood's biggest names — including Indian actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas and hearthrob Hrithik Roshan — along with local choirs and children sang or spoke passionately in English and Hindi about raising money for those in need.
Other celebrities interviewed doctors and experts about the virus and how health workers were coping on the frontlines of the pandemic.
Organised by Bollywood directors Karan Johar and Zoya Akhtar, the event has so far raised 37.5 million rupees (RM2.14 million) out of a target of 60 million rupees.
The donations would be matched rupee-for-rupee by major philanthropic groups including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the organisers said yesterday.
'No work, no home'
The funds will be donated to more than 100 groups providing food and other essential services during the crisis.
Concert organisers said the money was needed “for those who have no work and no home and do not know where their next meal is coming from.”
India, the world's second-most populous nation with 1.3 billion people, late yesterday reported just over 40,000 cases of the infectious disease and 1,306 deaths.
The government has hailed the weeks-long lockdown aimed at limiting the virus's spread, but the number of new daily cases has continued to gradually rise with experts calling for more virus testing.
The lockdown was extended for two weeks on Friday, but some restrictions are set to be eased from Monday in areas with fewer virus cases.
Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of New Delhi, which has the third-highest number of virus cases among India's states and territories, said Sunday that the economic impact of the lockdown was severe in the national capital and the city needed to be reopened in non-virus “containment zones.”.
“People are facing a lot of hardships. Jobs are going. The economic infrastructure has been hit hard,” he said in an online briefing, adding that he would speak to the national government about the possibilities of opening up Delhi.
“We have to start preparations so that we can learn to live with corona. Corona has now come in our country It's not going to go anywhere.” — AFP

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known for his role as New Sacred Heart lawyer Ted Buckland on the long-running NBC-ABC medical comedy Scrubs, died Thursday night in Los Angeles, his rep, Kevin Turner, told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 56.
The Vermont native had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year, which was revealed in a GoFundMe campaign launched by Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife, Jill. The fundraiser had raised nearly $160,000.
In a family statement provided by his wife, Vanessa Lloyd, she wrote, "Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30th, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer. Our family is devastated. It doesn't feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.
"The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong," she continued. "Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston."
Scrubs star Zach Braff paid tribute to Lloyd on Twitter, writing: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence also paid his respects on social media, tweeting: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Aside from appearing on 95 episodes of Scrubs as Buckland, Lloyd reprised the role for another Lawrence series, Cougar Town. His other TV credits included Lawrence's Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. On the film side, he appeared in Galaxy Quest and Flubber.
Survivors include his wife and Weston, who was born in 2019.
May 2, 12:39 p.m. Updated to include statement from Lloyd's family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd, Actor on 'Scrubs,' Dies at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known for his role as downtrodden lawyer Ted Buckland on “Scrubs,” has died. He was 56.
Lloyd was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year, which was revealed in a GoFuneMe campaign that was launched by “Scrubs” producer Tom Hobert and his wife.
Lloyd’s agent confirmed the news of his death. Vanessa Lloyd, Sam’s wife, released a statement saying, “Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer. Our family is devastated. It doesn’t feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.”
The statement continued, “The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong. Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston.”
Lloyd appeared in 95 episodes during the long-running medical comedy’s run on NBC and ABC. He reprised the role briefly in Lawrence’s other series, “Cougar Town.”

“Scrubs” star Zach Braff paid respects as well, tweeting, “Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.”
And fellow “Scrubs” actor Robert Maschio also paid tribute to his late co-star, writing, “Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met. Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace.  ​#RIPSamLloyd”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The twelfth season of the popular game show Kaun Banega Crorepati, hosted by megastar Amitabh Bachchan, is all set to make its selection process completely digital amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the season's registration promo, Bachchan shot the video from his home, remotely directed by Dangal helmer Nitesh Tiwari.
Sony Entertainment Television announced that registrations will commence for the latest season from May 9 till May 22, where Bachchan will ask one new question every night on Sony TV, which can be answered either through SMS or through Sony LIV.
"For the first time in the history of KBC, the entire screening and selection will be managed digitally... This is the season of firsts and we are confident that this season will redefine the power of knowledge," Amit Raisinghani, Head - Business Planning and Communication, Sony Entertainment Television said in a statement.
The second step would be screening, where participants who have answered the registration questions correctly and have been shortlisted by the randomizer based on certain pre-defined reservation criteria, will be reached out to, telephonically, for further assessment.
The third step will be an online audition on a general knowledge test aided by video submission. The final round will be a personal interview with the shortlisted candidates, which will be conducted remotely via video call. The entire selection process will be verified by an independent audit firm.
The show will be produced by StudioNEXT and the selection process will be conducted digitally, through SonyLIV.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shreya Ghoshal’s singing is always on point. But not many know that there’s also a composer in her. Just before the COVID-19 lockdown in India in March, she had unveiled a single ‘Nah woh main’ in Hindi.
“I was not sure how long the lockdown would go on, so I released it on my YouTube channel. It’s co-composed by me and my brother [Soumyadeep Ghoshal],” said Shreya.
She wants to use the lockdown days to create more content for her YouTube channel: “It takes a little while to crack a good song. I am more of a singer than a composer. I do have a lot of projects that are coming to me — some nice compositions from friends — so, I am collaborating with people and I am ideating.”
“I have always wanted to create something that I want to sing. I don’t always want to depend on a film. Film songs are limited to the story or the setting of the film,” she added.
She doesn’t have a preference when it comes to the genre of songs, “The kind of music I listen to is quite versatile. I don’t limit myself. But I like slightly challenging songs,” said Shreya.
Sharing an example, she said ‘Ghar more pardesiya’ from Kalank was a tough song to sing. “It’s a dance song but all the ‘harkat’ and nuances were there. It also had to sound cinematic. It was a challenging song. I hope these kind of songs happen more. Whether it is classical or not, it should be challenging.”
She is also keeping the artiste in her alive during these tough times by doing virtual concerts. She recently participated in YouTube’s One Nation initiative that saw over 75 music artistes and Indian YouTube creators uniting for a live concert.
“Everyone is at home, their morale is down. It’s been over a month of lockdown. We needed to do something to cheer up people. Also, we are raising funds. I want to help as much as possible. A lot of underprivileged people are there who need support,” she said.
“By doing this [the virtual concert], I am also keeping myself happy. There was a time when I felt 24 hours were less in a day, now I feel there is so much time and less to do,” she added.
Shreya has also been experimenting in the kitchen and going the household chores during lockdown.
She hasn’t given much thought to what she will immediately do once the lockdown is over, but she misses travelling within India: “I want to see my country. I want to travel. I miss going to the airport,” she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Shreya Ghoshal's singing is always on point. But not many know that there's also a composer in her.
Just before the coronavirus lockdown in India in March, she had unveiled a single "Nah woh main".
"I was thinking of releasing it later but I was not sure how long the lockdown would go on, so I just released it on my YouTube channel. It's co-composed by me and my brother," Shreya told IANS.
She wants to use the lockdown days to create more content for her YouTube channel.
Watch the video here:
"I am trying to work on some stuff. It takes a little while to crack a good song. I am not a born composer, I am more of a singer than a composer. I do have a lot of projects that are coming to me -- some nice compositions from friends -- so, I am collaborating with people and I am ideating," she said.
"I have always wanted to create something that I want to sing. I don't always want to depend on a film. Film songs are limited to the story or the setting of the film," added the "Teri ore" hitmaker.
She doesn't have a preference when it comes to the genre of songs.
"I am as fluid as one can think of. The kind of music I listen to is quite versatile. I don't limit myself. But I like slightly challenging songs," said Shreya.
Sharing an example, she said: "'Ghar more pardesiya' from 'Kalank' was a tough song to sing. It's a dance song but all the 'harkat' and nuances were there. It also had to sound cinematic. It was a challenging song. I hope these kind of songs happen more. Whether it is classical or not, it should be challenging."
She is also keeping the artiste in her alive during these tough times by doing virtual concerts.

"Everyone is at home, their morale is down. It's been over a month of lockdown. We needed to do something to cheer up people. Also, we are raising funds. I want to help as much as possible. A lot of underprivileged people are there who need a lot of support. This is for that and also to bring a smile on a lot of faces," she said.
"By doing this, I am also keeping myself happy. There was a time when I felt 24 hours were less in a day, now I feel there is so much time and less to do. So doing virtual concerts keeps people positive," she added.
She has learnt a new skill too!
"I think my cooking skills have definitely improved. I have been experimenting in the kitchen. Some dishes have turned out to be very successful. So I pat my shoulder. I have made some really tasty stuff," she said with a laugh.
Household chores have been keeping her occupied, too.
"Although I am saying that I have a lot of time, the fact remains that most of the day goes in doing the household chores. And it is difficult. So from cleaning to cooking to keeping the house tidy, I am doing it all.
"Some form of home exercises keep me occupied, too. I watch news regularly, a lot of people are affected in this pandemic. I am trying to do my bit by actively trying to help out the needy through donations," said Shreya.
She hasn't given much thought to what she will immediately do once the lockdown is over, but there's one thing that she's missing a lot.
"I want to see my country. I want to travel. I miss going to the airport," she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: Filmmaker Patty Jenkins has made it clear that it wasn't her idea to have two villains in her upcoming movie "Wonder Woman 1984" and says it happened organically.
The much-awaited film is a sequel to Jenkins' 2017 blockbuster "Wonder Woman", starring Gal Gadot as the titular DC superhero.
In the sequel, which will come out in August, Gadot's Wonder Woman will face-off against Barbara Ann Minerva aka Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) as well as businessman Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal).
"It turned out that the story was the thing that gave birth to the need for both (villains)," Jenkins told Total Film in an interview.
"It wasn't that I thought I needed both. Cheetah was the villain that we were focused on having in this movie, but then Max Lord, throughout the history of Wonder Woman comics - he serves a very mechanical purpose, often," she added.
The filmmaker also explained her decision to cast Wiig opposite Gadot in the sequel.
"It doesn't have to be against expectations, I think it has to be fresh, you know? If it was just a vixen...like, Gal's a model, a full-blown model.
If we cast another full-blown model and it's a cat fight? "That felt a little dull, versus a beautiful woman who's totally different - Kristen - who's really funny but a total juxtaposition to Gal.
So they have such a different space. I thought that was an interesting way to tell the story," Jenkins said.
As for Pascal, the director said the "Narcos" star has done a "fantastic" job with his character.
"Max Lord is a great 'Wonder Woman' character. I love him serving the role he is right now. Pedro Pascal is fantastic at this role.
It's like you've never seen him before too," Jenkins added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI: One pixel at a time, Dubai will light up the facade of the world's tallest building to represent each donation made to relieve coronavirus-hit communities across the United Arab Emirates.
The Burj Khalifa, which stands 828 metres (2,717 feet) high, will be transformed into the "world's tallest donation box" as part of a campaign to provide 10 million meals to low-income people.
The appeal comes during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, a time of self-reflection, prayer and charity for the faithful.
For each 10-dirham ($2.7) donation, one of the building's 1.2 million LED lights will be illuminated -- each representing a meal.

On Sunday, less than 24 hours since the launch of the appeal, a live count on the website indicated that more than 176,000 meals had been donated.
The skyscraper regularly features displays of solidarity with crisis-stricken countries -- for Australia when bushfires ravaged parts of the country, and for China and Italy when they were hit hard by the COVID-19 respiratory disease.
"Representing donations as lights beaming on Burj Khalifa reflects the hope that small acts of kindness will bring to less fortunate communities as the country continues its battle against the pandemic," Dubai's media office said in a statement.
"They will see the impact of their contributions on the facade of the world's tallest building."

Last week, the UAE eased lockdown restrictions that were put in place to curb the spread of the disease.
Dubai, one of the seven sheikhdoms that make up the UAE, had imposed a total curfew.
The emirate depends heavily on trade, retail, tourism and real estate, and the restrictions have hit businesses hard.
It is also home to millions of foreign workers, some of whom have found themselves out of work or unpaid as the economy crumbles.
The UAE has so far reported more than 14,000 infections, including 126 deaths.
It has the second highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Gulf after Saudi Arabia, which has recorded more than 25,000 infections and 176 deaths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lea Michele has confirmed, with a new Instagram post, that she is pregnant. The former Glee star made the announcement in the form of a photo of her wearing a blue floral maternity dress. The caption below the image of her cradling her stomach says, "So grateful."
Michele, who married businessman Zandy Reich in March 2019, is now expecting her first child. Rumors about her pregnancy were already circulating last Monday, when a source for Peoplereported that the couple was expecting. Neither People nor Michele have confirmed her due date.
"They've always wanted to be parents," the People source said.
Michele and Reich started dating in July 2017, and got engaged in April of 2018. They were married in Northern California, with more than 200 guests in attendance. Michele's Glee co-stars Darren Criss and Becca Tobin were there, as well as her Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts.
"We are so excited to be married and grateful to be surrounded by our friends and family," the couple shared with People at the time. "And most of all, we’re so happy to spend the rest of our lives together."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Welcome to Ars Cardboard, our weekend look at tabletop games! Check out our complete board gaming coverage at cardboard.arstechnica.com.
Sagrada is one of the best dice-drafting games on the market. It makes excellent use of the inherent randomness of dice while still providing copious opportunities for strategic thinking and long-term planning. It’s also a visually appealing game, easy to learn but displaying more depth the more you play it—especially by making players think about how early choices may restrict their options later. And it’s about building stained-glass windows. Delightful.
Designer: Adrian Adamescu, Daryl AndrewsPublisher: Dire Wolf DigitalPlayers: 2-4Age: 10+Playing time: 20 minutesPrice: $10 on Steam (Mac/Win), $10 on iOS, $7 on Android
These days, there’s a digital version of Sagrada out from Dire Wolf Digital, maker of several of the best digital board game adaptations on the market (including 2019’s Raiders of the North Sea and Yellow & Yangtze, which were both on my list of the best board game apps of 2019).
The base game of Sagrada allows two to four players to collect dice that are then placed on their individual 4x5 grids. Some spaces show specific colors or die values (but not both) that you must match in order to place something there. The game lasts ten rounds. In each round, the start player will roll two dice per player plus one more, after which the players choose dice in a snake draft (so, with three players, the players would draft in order 1-2-3 and then 3-2-1) and place them on their boards.
There are limits, though. The first die you place must be somewhere on one of the 12 edge spaces; all dice afterwards must be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a die you've already placed. You can't place two dice of the same color or same value next to each other, and you have to match anything already printed on your screen.
There are also three Tools available in each game, each of which costs you one or two favor tokens to use (you'll probably get to use them a maximum of three times, if that). The Tools let you do something that would otherwise violate the rules—moving a die you’ve already placed, ignoring a color restriction on your screen, or flipping a die to its opposite face value, for example.
Each player gets a private objective at the start of the game, which awards points equal to the sum of the face values of all their placed dice of one specific color. Then, all players score the game’s three public objectives, which reward you for avoiding repeat colors or values in rows or columns, or for how many pairs of dice you have with specific values (1-2, 3-4, or 5-6), or for how many times you put dice of the same color diagonally adjacent to each other. You lose one point for each unfilled space on your grid.
The app gets all of the salient information on to one screen for you to see at a glance, with icons rather than text representing the various end-game bonuses and the three tools available to use in that game. You can see text descriptions on Steam by moving the cursor over each item, at which point you get the full text from the card in the physical game. Once you've played a few times, the icons for the objectives are easy to grasp at a glance. (The icons for the tools are a bit more arcane; even after multiple plays, I generally didn’t remember what those icons meant.)
The app offers local pass-and-play, local play versus AI opponents, and asynchronous online play. The AI opponents are fair, coming in three levels but with the medium players closer to “easy” and the hard AI players good but inconsistent, sometimes missing opportunities to use tools or take dice late in the game that might score an additional objective. Online play has been scant during Early Access testing but the app itself works fine, with options for private and public games and notifications when it’s your turn.
Sagrada itself is very color-centric, making the app visually appealing with its cute-but-functional animations. (The app also offers a Color-Blind Mode where each color has a unique pattern on it.) The most useful function by far is the way the app tells you when and where you have a legal play, although the key decision is really which space will be most advantageous without restricting future dice placements.
Dire Wolf’s board game apps have just about all been outstanding—the only ones I don't care for are the ones where I don't like the underlying game. Sagrada is another hit, maybe the company’s best yet because the game itself was already so good.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Billions live stream: How to watch Season 5 online from anywhere</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Showtime's hit TV series Billions is returning for its fifth season on Sunday, May 3 and we have all the details on how you can stream the show online or watch it on TV from anywhere in the world.
Billions is a fictional drama that gives viewers an inside look at the world of high finance in New York City. The series follows billionaire hedge fund king Bobby 'Axe' Axelrod (played by Damien Lewis) as he tries to tilt the capital markets in his favor. However, he is relentlessly pursued by U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades (played by Paul Giamatti) who wants to take him down.
The show was created by Brian Koppelman, David Levien and Andrew Ross Sorkin and it is loosely based on the true story of New York attorney Preet Bharara's legal battles with hedge fund manager Steve Cohen of S.A.C Capital Advisors.
Season 5 of Billions will also see some new additions to the cast with Julianna Marguiles, Corey Stoll, Roma Maffica, Daniel breaker, Frank Grillo and Rick Hoffman all joining the show.
Whether you've been watching Billions since its premiere in 2016 or are just looking for something new to watch, keep reading to find out how to watch the latest season from wherever you are in the world.
Billions debuted on Showtime back in 2016 and the show has delivered four seasons so far with its next season set to premiere on Sunday, May 3 at 9pm ET/PT. Season 5 will consist of 12 hour-long episodes that will air weekly. However, the show was forced to close production early due to the coronavirus, so the first seven episodes will air in the coming weeks with the final five airing at some point later this year.
You'll find all the details on how you can watch the latest season of Billions in the U.S., Canada, UK and Australia further down in this guide. However, if you want to watch new episodes of the show when you're away from home, then you'll run into problems as your domestic coverage online from abroad will likely be geo-blocked.
That's where a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can really come in handy. They allow you to virtually change the IP address of your laptop, tablet or mobile to one that's back in your home country which will let you watch as if you were back there.

If you live in the US and have a Showtime subscription, you'll be able to watch Season 5 of Billions every Sunday at 9pm ET/PT. You can also stream the show online through Showtime Anytime but you will need to login using the credentials from your cable provider and already have a subscription to the network.
If you've already cut the cord and still want to sign up for Showtime, the network does have its own streaming service which costs either $10.99 per month or $99 for the year. While this isn't a bad option if you just want to watch Showtime exclusively, you can also add the network as an add-on to other streaming services including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Sling.
It costs $12.99 per month to add Showtime to Amazon Prime, $4.99 to add it to Hulu and just $10 to add it to Sling. However, both Amazon Prime and Hulu offer free 30-day trials to Showtime so you can add the network to their services and watch all four seasons of Billions right now for free.
You will need to add the Showtime bundle to your Hulu subscription, but this is definitely the easiest and most affordable way to watch the new season of Billions. The base Hulu package costs $5.99 per month, and the Showtime addition is $4.99, meaning you're paying about $11 per month for access to Hulu and Showtime.
Catch the new season of Billions with ease using a Hulu subscription and adding the Showtime package
Canadian viewers that want to watch season 5 of billions can do so on the streaming service Crave. You can also catch up on past episodes of the show as the service lets you stream all four seasons right now. Crave costs $9.99 per month and while you could sign up through your cable provider, signing up directly through Crave will get you a free week. Your subscription also gives you access to Crave Originals like Letterkenny and you can watch content on a variety of devices including PC, Mac, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Samsung SmartTV, Chromecast and mobile.
If you live in the UK and have a Sky subscription, you'll be able to watch the latest season of Billions on Sky Atlantic in May as an exact premiere date and time hasn't been set yet. You can also stream the show online on Sky's website but you will need to install the Sky Go desktop app to watch on your computer or other streaming devices. A Sky subscription will run you £22 a month on an 18-month contract if you're a new subscriber, though the price does increase to £27 a month at the end of your contract.
Don't want to sign up for Sky but still want to watch Billions in the UK? Don't worry as Now TV's Entertainment Pass will let you watch the show for £8.99 per month. The service also offers a 7-day free trial so you can test it out for yourself to watch Billions.
Fans of Billions in Australia can watch the latest season of the show on the streaming service Stan. The service offers three plans in the form of Stan Basic, Stan Standard and Stan Premium with the biggest difference between them being that you'll need the Premium plan for $17 per month to watch content in 4K. However, if watching Billions in 1080p is fine with you, then the Basic plan for $10 per month should suffice. Regardless of which plan you choose, Stan offers a 30-day free trial so you can test out the service for yourself.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stranger Things season 4 will be ‘a lot scarier’: Joe Keery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stranger Things star Joe Keery has teased that fans of the hit series should expect a much darker outing in the upcoming season four.
The actor, who plays Steve Harrington in the Netflix sci-fi show, said the new chapter will follow the tone set by the last installment.
“Oh man, it’s pretty amazing the Duffer brothers have really done it again. I think that this year and I know I say this every single year but this is definitely going to be a lot scarier than prior years, because last year was pretty dark,” Keery told Total Film magazine.
The 28-year-old actor also said that he would no longer be seen wearing his iconic Scoops Ahoy outfit from season three.
“I know that costume served its purpose and I’m glad to retire it,” Keery added.
Production on Stranger Things was put on hold last month due to the coronaviruspandemic.
Keery’s co-star David Harbour recently revealed that the fourth season was eyeing for an early 2021 release before the shutdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mick Jagger, Will Smith to boost India coronavirus concert</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI, May 2 — Rock legend Mick Jagger and Hollywood’s Will Smith will be among dozens of international and Bollywood stars taking part in a four-hour concert tomorrow to raise funds for the battle against coronavirus in India, where the number of cases is surging.
The country’s cricket captain Virat Kohli, actors Priyanka Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan are some of the top domestic names set to perform or read messages from their homes.
Organised by Bollywood directors Karan Johar and Zoya Akhtar, the show will be live-streamed by Facebook and pay tribute to workers fighting the pandemic.
It aims to raise millions of dollars for more than 100 groups providing food and other essential services during the crisis.
Concert organisers said the money was needed “for those who have no work and no home and do not know where their next meal is coming from”.
India’s 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown since March 25 with the restrictions, while recently eased, set to last until at least May 17.
The shutdown has especially hit millions of migrant workers stranded in cities with little food or money. Special trains were being organised today to help thousands of labourers finally return home.
India has so far reported 37,335 coronavirus cases and 1,218 deaths, with more than 2,000 new infections in the last 24 hours.
Experts fear a lack of testing and poor reporting procedures mean the death toll is much higher.
The government has announced a string of special activities to rally support for frontline workers.
The Indian Air Force is set to stage a flypast tomorrow and military helicopters will shower petals on hospitals caring for coronavirus patients. Navy warships will also put on a special display. — AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Scrubs” Actor Sam Lloyd Dies Aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American actor Sam Lloyd, who was best known for his role as New Sacred Heart lawyer Ted Buckland on the long-running NBC-ABC medical comedy Scrubs, has died.
Lloyd died Thursday night in Los Angeles, his agent, Kevin Turner, told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 56.
In January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and cancer, which eventually spread to his lungs, jaw, liver and spine. He received the diagnosis just weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their first child.
Scrubs star Zach Braff paid tribute to Lloyd on Twitter, writing:
“Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.”
“Scrubs” creator Bill Lawrence described him as a “kind, sweet guy” who will be missed by many.
Lloyd was also a talented musician. He sang in a cappella group The Blanks – which made several appearances on “Scrubs” as The Worthless Peons.
Lloyd appeared on 95 episodes of Scrubs as Buckland, he also reprised the role for another Lawrence series, Cougar Town. His other TV credits include Lawrence’s Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. As for films, he was in Galaxy Quest and Flubber.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs actor Sam Lloyd dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON – Scrubs star Sam Lloyd has died at the age of 56, after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
The actor, who was the nephew of actor Christopher Lloyd and played lawyer Ted Buckland in the medical comedy series, died on Thursday after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife previously launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for Lloyd as he battled the disease and his death was announced on the site.
They wrote: "Our dear sweet Sammy has passed away.
"On April 30th at a respiratory facility in Los Angeles with his beautiful wife, Vanessa, at his side and his sister, Laurel, FaceTiming from New Hampshire, Samuel Lloyd Jr. left this earth and was reunited with his dad (Samuel Lloyd Sr.), his mom (Marianna McGuffin), and his brother (Jackson Lloyd).
"Sam's fight began on 17 January 2019 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer that metastasized to his brain, liver, spine, and jaw. Things did not look good. After an outpouring of love from Sam's friends and people from all over the world, Sam was put on a new targeted therapy drug and had an amazing resurgence. For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment. He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom's hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, 'he made music along the way'.
"At the end of 2019, Sam found out that the targeted therapy drug which had given him such a miraculous second chance had lost its effectiveness. Determined to live, and with so much to live for, Sam fought hard, enduring multiple brain surgeries, and endless tests and procedures. Despite all these things, Sam always mustered up the strength to say "I love you" to Vanessa, Weston, and his many close friends who came to visit him.
"Eventually the fight became more intense and Sam slipped into a coma for nearly two months.
Vanessa never stopped believing that Sam would rebound and be reunited with her and Weston and all the people who love Sam so much. She stayed by his side day in and day out - even figuring out ways to visit him during the COVID restrictions.
"But alas it was time for Sam to leave this world. A world that he made a better place every day of his life.
"Rest in peace sweet, sweet Sammy boy. We loved you more than words can tell."
_Scrubs _creator Bill Lawrence wrote on Twitter: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
And show star Zach Braff added: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
"He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Lloyd - who also appeared in Cougar Town, Desperate Housewives, The West Wing and Malcolm in the Middle - is survived by his wife Vanessa and their son Weston.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The management at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, where Rishi Kapoor breathed his last, issued a statement on Friday saying they would investigate the leak and circulation of videos featuring the actors mortal.
A Facebook post on the hospital’s official page reads: “A message from Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital’s management. #RespectForLife.
“It has come to our attention that a video of one of our patients is surfacing on digital media platforms. At Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital, patient confidentiality and privacy is of utmost importance to us and we strongly condemn such actions. The hospital management is investigating the incident and strict action will be taken against the perpetrators.”
Rishi Kapoor passed away on Thursday morning, and numerous videos featuring his mortal remains started doing the rounds on social media the afternoon onwards.
In one video, Rishi Kapoor’s son Ranbir Kapoor along with priests can be seen offering obeisance to his remains even as he lies in the hospital bed. In another, the body is being taken out on a stretcher and boarded to a van for the crematorium. Many other similar videos have mushroomed.
While a section of the netizens is circulating these videos, many have accused the hospital of irresponsible behaviour, saying this amounts to an invasion of privacy. Several netizens have questioned the morality of hospital staff, assuming they shot the videos since there is no question of outsiders amid the lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Experts hail Bosso initiative</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports ReporterLEGAL experts believe that the latest Highlanders FC targeted crowdfunding initiative is capable of wiping out the club’s perennial debt, previously said to be close to US$1 million and now equated to $1 million dollars in local currency.
A group of Highlanders members is working on helping clear the debt by targeting 1 000 people to contribute R500 or US$30 each to clear the debt, with the remainder going into the club’s coffers. Other groups of fans have separate initiatives geared towards the same objective.
Experienced commercial lawyers said the club supporters need to move with speed and harness resources to clear the debt.
They say the club must capitalise on the January landmark judgement by the Supreme Court that creditors who were owed before the enactment of Statutory Instrument 33 of 2019 should no longer be paid at the prevailing interbank rate.
Section 4 (1)(d) of SI 33 of 2019 enacted in terms of Section 2 of the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act (Chapter 10:20) states;
“That, for accounting and other purposes, all assets and liabilities that were, immediately before the effective date, valued and expressed in US dollars (other than assets and liabilities referred to in section 44C (2) of the principal Act) shall on and after the effective date be deemed to be values in RTGS dollars at a rate of one to one,” according to the statutory instrument.
This position was later confirmed in section 22 of the Finance Act No. 2 of 2019.
The experts warned Bosso that delaying clearing the debt might see it ballooning should there be a return of US dollars.
“Evidently from 2016 to date the Reserve Bank and the Ministry of Finance have been coming up with various monetary and currency changes. In SI 42/19 the Zimbabwe dollar was basically made the sole currency of trade in Zimbabwe in domestic transactions except for certain limited transactions. The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has seen the relaxation of the ban on trading in other currencies. This may signal a return to the use of the US dollar as the currency of trade or reporting currency again. It is best that the club clears its debts now before this happens as the value of its debts in Zimbabwe dollars is insignificant, especially if its supporters can raise foreign currency with which to pay off the debts after conversion,” said the expert.
According to the expert, capitalising on SI 33/19 means that the debt Highlanders had, which was expressed in US dollars was converted to Zimbabwe dollars on a one to one basis.
In other words, if the club owed US$10 000 to a creditor with effect from February 22, 2019, the debt became RTGS$10 000.
This,however, will not apply to loans or debts owed to foreign parties as SI 33/19 excluded those from the conversion.
Donald Ndebele, the Highlanders’ treasurer, said the club appreciates the supporters’ initiatives.
“It is quite pleasing to note that supporters are taking a lead in drumming up funding for the club. Together as Highlanders we can clear the debt. Our financials are always there for all to see and our members know the financial situation of the club,” said Ndebele. – @ZililoR

    <h5 class="mb-1">First trailer for HBO’s Lovecraft Country blends eldritch horrors and racism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">H.P. Lovecraft is having a moment. January brought us Richard Stanley's surreal film, Color Out of Space, an adaptation of the short story of the same name, in which a family on a farm encounters a glowing purple meteorite with typically horrific Lovecraftian consequences. Stanley's film adaptation of The Dunwich Horror is rumored to be in development, the second in a planned trilogy. And now HBO has dropped the first trailer for a new series partly inspired by the works of the Cthulhu-loving horror master, called Lovecraft Country.
The series is based on the 2016 dark fantasy/horror novel, Lovecraft Country, by Matt Ruff, who also found inspiration in a 2006 essay by Pam Noles describing what it was like growing up being both black and, well, a hardcore nerd. The protagonist is a black veteran of the Korean War and science fiction fan named Atticus, who embarks on a perilous road trip from his home on Chicago's South Side to a small town in rural Massachusetts. He's looking for his estranged father, who purportedly vanished after encountering a well-dressed man driving a silver Cadillac.
Atticus' Uncle George and childhood friend/fellow sci-fi buff, Leti, come along for the ride. This being inspired by Lovecraft, naturally they encounter all kinds of arcane rituals, magic, shape-shifters, monsters, and an alternate reality or two along the way.
What makes Ruff's novel so ingeniously subversive is how it reflects the horrors of racism in the United States in the supernatural horrors conjured by a novelist famous for his extreme racist views. As Ars' Peter Opaskar noted in his review of Color out of Space, one reason Lovecraft has proven so difficult to adapt for modern audiences is "because he was super-racist. Like, even other racists at the time would say, 'Jesus, dude, chill.'" As Cory Doctorow observed at Boing Boing, "These characters... don't need Elder Gods to experience horror. They live it in their daily lives, through harassment, violence, expropriation, and the legacy of slavery that is anything but ancient history for them."
HBO's 10-episode adaptation seems to be hewing pretty closely to those themes. Per the official synopsis:
The trailer opens with Atticus on a bus, returning home to Chicago, where he's welcomed with open arms. We see him reunite with Leti and then discover that his father, Montrose (Michael K. Williams, aka Omar from The Wire), has gone missing. But Atticus receives a letter from his father asking to meet him in a remote location deep in "Lovecraft Country." It's a dangerous place, and not just because of the rampant racism, courtesy of a secret order known as the Sons of Adam. We are treated to dimly lit scenes of monsters on the attack, along with Jim Crow-era scenes of escalating racially charged violence. One might conclude, along with Leti: "I thought the world was one way and found out it isn't."
Lovecraft Country premieres on HBO in August 2020.

Floor Plan Croissant is a project directed by Boryana Ilieva founded to examine cinematographic spaces and bring the spatial language of the director to her own architectural understanding. However, later these translations took a social turn: as an architect and cinema lover, Boryana perceives a general gap between cinema and architecture, or in other words, a space that allows architects to explore beyond the screen. With this in mind, her work is based on extracting the plans from the main protagonist places in outstanding films, since she believes that a movie theater plan forms a phantom matrix around which the directors not only construct arguments, but rather they also place hidden messages.
The following is a compilation of the most outstanding plans of new movies, including the recently awarded four Oscars: Parasites for Bong Joon-ho.
Parasites (2019)Bong Joon-ho
Jojo Rabbit (2019)Taika Waitit
Pain & Glory (2019)Pedro Almodóvar
The Souvenir (2019)Joanna Hogg con Tom Burke

    <h5 class="mb-1">Broadway star Nick Cordero taken off ventilator, his wife says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Broadway star Nick Cordero has been taken off a ventilator after undergoing a successful procedure to insert a breathing tube, his wife said.
Tony Award-nominated Cordero was placed in intensive care shortly after being admitted to a Los Angeles hospital in March suffering with coronavirus.
Last month the 41-year-old had his leg amputated due to complications from the illness and he had been on a ventilator after his lungs were left “severely damaged”.
His wife, Amanda Kloots, has been sharing updates with fans on social media and on Friday revealed a tracheostomy tube had been successfully inserted into his neck, allowing him to come off the ventilator.
Kloots said on Instagram: “We have been trying to do this for Nick for so many weeks now and it just kept getting stalled and pushed back because of his health and now he was finally healthy enough today to get the trach and the ventilator is out.
“This is just amazing news because we really needed this to happen to get him off that ventilator. I think he will be feeling better, even subconsciously feeling better.
“I hope this is just a great sign for some good recovery days ahead and for him to wake up and just have that pressure relief from his throat. Thank God.”
Cordero, a father of one, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles after testing positive for Covid-19.
His wife has been leading the #WakeUpNick campaign, which has been backed by several celebrities, including his close friend the actor Zach Braff.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Broadway star Nick Cordero taken off ventilator, his wife says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Broadway star Nick Cordero has been taken off a ventilator after undergoing a successful procedure to insert a breathing tube, his wife said.
Tony Award-nominated Cordero was placed in intensive care shortly after being admitted to a Los Angeles hospital in March suffering with coronavirus.
Last month the 41-year-old had his leg amputated due to complications from the illness and he had been on a ventilator after his lungs were left “severely damaged”.
His wife, Amanda Kloots, has been sharing updates with fans on social media and on Friday revealed a tracheostomy tube had been successfully inserted into his neck, allowing him to come off the ventilator.
Kloots said on Instagram: “We have been trying to do this for Nick for so many weeks now and it just kept getting stalled and pushed back because of his health and now he was finally healthy enough today to get the trach and the ventilator is out.
“This is just amazing news because we really needed this to happen to get him off that ventilator. I think he will be feeling better, even subconsciously feeling better.
“I hope this is just a great sign for some good recovery days ahead and for him to wake up and just have that pressure relief from his throat. Thank God.”
Cordero, a father of one, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles after testing positive for Covid-19.
His wife has been leading the #WakeUpNick campaign, which has been backed by several celebrities, including his close friend the actor Zach Braff.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Reportedly Agree to Tell-All Biography</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget about the adorable elephant documentary, this is the juicy stuff we’ve been waiting for. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who are now more than a month into their unceremonious exit from the British royal family, have reportedly cooperated with journalists who penned a tell-all biography about their new life. Deadline reports that Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, secured an interview with the couple just before they left the United Kingdom for sunnier pastures in Canada (and now Los Angeles). The book, set for an August 20 release, is teased as going “beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together,” in addition to getting participation “of those closest to the couple.” Our hearts say it’s a cooing baby Archie, but our minds say Meghan’s yogi momma.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thanks to royal family photographer Samir Hussein, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have a new favorite photo.
In a new interview with Us Weekly, Hussein shares that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were "really happy" with the now-iconic snapshot the photographer captured of the royal couple back in March. The photo in question was from the 2020 Endeavour Fund Awards in London—one of the last public appearances from the couple as active working royals— where Hussein captured the pair beaming at each other whilst under an umbrella as they arrived to the event.
"The picture that I took of Harry and Meghan in the rain recently, I’ve never had a reaction to a picture like that one. In terms of the reaction I’ve had from people, that’s got to be the most iconic from that point of view," Hussein told Us Weekly. "I spoke to some of their team and they were really happy about it and talking about it."
The photographer—who had spent time photographing the couple all around the world over the past few years, including locations such as Australia, Fiji and Africa—expressed how he'll miss being able to capture images of the pair due to their recent relocation to Los Angeles this spring.
"I’m really disappointed that I won’t get to photograph them so much anymore," admitted Hussein. "I hope to get to photograph them [again]."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Huge and very creepy': Vancouver Island woman stumbles upon rarely seen spider</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER -- Krysten Leigh was walking her dog in Langford when she spotted something that made her do a double-take.
"He was pulling at something and it got my attention and when I looked over there was a spider," Leigh said. "I definitely had to take a second look because it was huge and very creepy-looking."
The arachnid on the pavement in front of her was like nothing she'd ever seen before. She wondered if it was someone's pet. She also wondered if it was poisonous. Mostly, she knew she had to take a picture.
"It wasn't as big as a tarantula, but it definitely looked like a miniature version of one," Leigh said.
Experts say the spider she spotted is a Pacific folding trap-door spider. It's not a tarantula, but it is a "tarantuloid" - a related type of arachnid - according to Jaymie Chudiak, general manager of the Victoria Bug Zoo.
"It is the closest thing we have to a tarantula," Chudiak said. "They are incredibly beautiful, but also very large, so people who do see them go, 'Oh my gosh, what is that? It's enormous.' But they're actually extremely docile and timid."
Pacific folding trap-door spiders typically grow to between three and five centimetres in length, considerably smaller than tarantulas, but larger than most species commonly seen in B.C.
"They do have venom, but it's incredibly mild," Chudiak added.
Asked what she did after she took the photo, Leigh said she "ran away."
"I was terrified," she said. "I'm definitely not a spider person."
She shared the photo she had taken with her mother, and then with a pest control company, which was eventually able to confirm the spider was a native species and not an escaped pet.
Leigh then shared the photo on Facebook, where it generated much more attention than she expected. In the first 24 hours, her post was shared more than 200 times, she said.
Chudiak said Pacific folding trap-door spiders are "absolutely everywhere" on Vancouver Island, but people rarely see them because they spend most of their lives hidden away inside their burrows.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘BIP’s Ashley & Jared Say Clare Crawley Will Be A Great Bachelorette: ‘She Knows What She Wants’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bachelor Nation fan-favorites Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon spoke to HollywoodLife exclusively, while social distancing together amid the coronavirus pandemic. The pair revealed why they believe Clare Crawley will be a great Bachelorette star. “She stands up for herself like no other. She believes that she deserves love. She is very confident in herself and I think she’s going to call out guys when they’re not treating her right,” Ashely told us. Jared then added it will make for “great” television. “She also knows what she wants and she’s going to go after what she wants,” he said.
When asked how Clare was doing, amid filming for her season of The Bachelorette being put on-hold, Ashley said she was hopeful. “She’s doing well! I didn’t talk to her specifically about the wait but I think she’s just excited and hopes that they have a lot of good quality men for her when she does get there,” she dished. It comes as Clare seemingly threw shade at Matt James, a contestant on her upcoming season of the reality show. The hunky 28-year-old is well known as former Bachie star Tyler Cameron‘s BFF and an active member of the “Quarantine Crew,” however he also runs a charity called ABC Food Tours.
While giving interviews about the organization, which takes kids from underserved elementary schools to restaurants in their local communities, Matt opened up about his thoughts on Clare — and she wasn’t happy. “If you are doing interviews and creating Cameo accounts before you are even on my season,’ she wrote. ‘You are in it for the wrong reasons… #dontwasteyourtime,” the 39-year-old tweeted on April 25. She also added, “Respect the opportunity you’ve been given. Respect the rules. Respect me.”
Matt’s fans were quick to jump to his defense, however Jared told HL he doesn’t believe Clare was criticizing Matt directly. “To be fair, I’m not sure if she was just shading Matt. From what I heard, there were a few of the guys that were going on Cameo,” he said. “Clare is old school so of course it’s going to bother her if a guy is on there doing interviews.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a new interview for HollywoodLife, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon shared their opinions on Clare Crawley becoming the newest Bachelorette and more! Here’s what they had to say!
While in quarantine together, the happy couple had a chat with the site and among other things, revealed they think Clare will make an amazing Bachelorette!
Not only that but they even went into detail explaining why they believe that is, pretty much gushing over her!
Ashley dished that ‘She stands up for herself like no other. She believes that she deserves love. She is very confident in herself and I think she’s going to call out guys when they’re not treating her right.’
Jared thought about the audience side of things as well, adding that it will make for ‘great television.’
‘She also knows what she wants and she’s going to go after what she wants,’ the man also explained about the future Bachelorette.
Of course, Clare’s season on the dating show has actually been put on hold because of the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic so Ashley was asked how she’s been doing amid all of it.
Ashely stressed that she is hopeful, adding that ‘She’s doing well! I didn’t talk to her specifically about the wait but I think she’s just excited and hopes that they have a lot of good quality men for her when she does get there.’
This comes after Clare seemed to slam one of the contestants competing for her heart – Matt James!
As you may know, he is Tyler Cameron‘s best friend who also runs the ABC Food Tours charity.
That being said, during an interview in which he was promoting the charity, he also opened up about Clare and what he thought about her, something she was seemingly not too happy about.
While she never mentioned his name, her tweet that followed really seemed to be a reaction to his interview.
It reads: ‘If you are doing interviews and creating Cameo accounts before you are even on my season. You are in it for the wrong reasons… #dontwasteyourtime.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Michelle McGahan
Stassie Karanikolaou stunned in Skims on Sunday, May 3, sharing an Instagram photo of herself posing in two pieces from Kim Kardashian’s clothing line.
Stassie, Kylie Jenner‘s best friend, bared her toned midriff in the Skims Cozy Collection ensemble. She wore a toasted brown crop top and shorts, the fuzzy items emphasizing her curves.
She leaned against a cream-colored wall in the image, bending one knee and resting her hands behind her head. Shadows danced behind her, her body reflected on the wall. The picture appeared to be taken at the golden hour, during which the sun starts to set and all objects glimmer with light. Sunlight streamed across Stassie’s face.
The sleeveless crop top was made out of a furry material that seemed to maximize comfort. Though it sported a scoop neckline, Stassie’s chest was entirely covered, no cleavage to be seen. Still, the top accentuated and flattered her buxom bust.
The tiny shorts rode up high on her hips, making her hourglass figure take center stage. The bottoms were made out of the same fabric as the top, and showed off Stassie’s ample assets.
The model’s platinum blond locks slid down her back in straight strands, several stray pieces falling over one shoulder.
She paired the ensemble with two pieces of gold jewelry: A dainty gold cross necklace and her ever-present gold Cartier “Love” bracelet.
Stassie’s arctic blue eyes sparkled in the sun. Her dark brown brows were shaped and arched high over her eyes. She wore a soft orange shadow on her lids, matching her makeup palette with the golden hue of the light. Her lashes were swiped with black mascara.
Her contoured cheeks were brushed with bronzer, making her already sun-kissed skin look even tanner. Her plump pout was filled in with a dusty rose matte shade.
Stassie’s 7.8 million Instagram followers flocked to the comments section of the post in droves, idolizing her beauty and admiring her latest look.
“Gorgeous,” wrote one fan, punctuating their comment with two heart-eye emoji.
“W o w,” gushed another follower.
“Queen,” shared a third social media user, adding two orange hearts.
“Imagine looking like this,” a fourth person wrote.
Others replied with rows of heart-eye, heart, and flame emoji.
As of press time, the image racked up 251,000 likes and over 950 comments.
As Stassie Karanikolaou fans and The Inquisitr readers know, Kylie Jenner recently shared a photo on her own account wearing a pair of Skims that looked seriously similar to these, though the makeup mogul wore pants instead of shorts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">18 Hottest Photos Of KarJenners In Bikinis: Kim, Kylie & More</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The KarJenner sisters have slayed in so many sexy swimsuits over the years, and we rounded up their best of the best. The ladies are often sharing their bikini pics on Instagram, but they’ve also been caught by paparazzi while soaking up the sun on their lavish vacations over the years, as well. During a trip to Miami, Kim Kardashian rocked a number of sexy swimsuits and posed for pics by the pool of her friend’s mansion. She was photographed wearing a white swimsuit while sunbathing, and she also hit the beach in a black bathing suit.
Kendall Jenner is often taking fun vacations with her pals, and they often involve excursions on yachts — which means lots of bikini pics of the gorgeous supermodel. One time, she went jetskiing, and then showered off on the boat while wearing her one-shouldered, polka-dotted bathing suit. Another time, she laid out on a boat in Miami while wearing a skimpy orange two-piece. Pictures surfaced of Kendall with her toned figure on full display as she soaked up the sun on the front of the boat.
We’ve also seen Kourtney Kardashian strip down to her bikini quite a bit over the years. Whether it’s on a boat in Italy with her kids, or hanging out on the beach in Mexico with friends, Kourtney always looks super sexy in her swimsuits.
There are plenty of KarJenner bikini pics to look back at as we gear up for the warm weather and summertime. Click through the gallery above to check out the sisters’ best bathing suit pics over the years to check them out!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Busy's swimsuit had a plunging neckline.
Busy Philipps looked sophisticated and sexy in a stunning floral-print bathing suit, but the garment’s low neckline caused her to suffer a wardrobe malfunction shortly before she shared a photo of her stylish swimwear with her 2.1 million Instagram followers.
The 40-year-old Dawson’s Creek star uploaded the snapshot to her account on Saturday. Busy was pictured soaking up some sun and sipping on a bright red drink. She was clad in a dark blue one-piece that featured a pretty floral print. It was covered with depictions of tiny yellow flowers and green leaves.
The swimsuit had a plunging V-neck that almost reached Busy’s bellybutton. The daring neckline was wide up top, so the actress was leaving little of her perky chest to the imagination. Busy’s bathing suit was an adjustable halter design with thick ties that were secured behind her neck in a big bow. The garment also had high-cut leg openings that showed off the actress’ shapely thighs.
Busy accessorized her swimwear with three puka shell necklaces in white, purple, and turquoise. She was also wearing two long gold chains that had crystals dangling from them. Her array of stacked necklaces included a pair of triangle pendants. One of the stone triangles was pearly white, and the other was turquoise.
The actress was sporting a tiny stud earring shaped like a pink flower in her right ear, and she was rocking a gold watch on her left wrist. She was also sporting a pair of cat-eye sunglasses with metallic blue frames.
Busy was barefaced, and she had her blond hair pulled up in a high topknot. In the caption of her post, she expressed some surprise over just how blond her roots naturally are. Like many women, Busy has seemingly decided to let her roots grow out instead of trying to touch them up herself while beauty salons remain closed.
Busy also recounted how she suffered a wardrobe malfunction before she snapped her selfie. She wrote that it was “funny” that she didn’t notice that her right breast was completely exposed for a full two minutes, and she revealed that she really doesn’t care who sees her bare chest anymore.
Busy’s followers rewarded her photo, her entertaining caption, and her amazing accessory game with over 53,000 likes and hundreds of comments.
“I needed all of this. Thank u,” wrote actress Michelle Monaghan in response to her post.
“Watta godddesss,” Vanessa Hudgens gushed.
“You are so real… I love it,” wrote one of Busy’s non-famous admirers.
“Love the swimsuit! You look amazing!!!” another fan remarked.
As reported by The Inquisitr, Busy also impressed her fans with her choice of swimwear last year when she celebrated her 40th birthday in a tiny yellow bikini.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gabrielle Union, 47, Shows Off Her Natural Beauty & Fans Think She’s ‘Glowing’ — See Pics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Category is… looking absolutely flawless! Gabrielle Union, 47, appeared half her age in a set of Instagram photos posted on Friday, May 1, during her time in self-isolation. Each pic was totally different from the rest where her radiant beauty was seen throughout. In one snap she cracked a shy smirk which was then followed by her putting her pearly whites on display. A cute smile was seen in the next upload which ended with an adorable photo with her stepdaughter Zaya Wade, 12. “OK y’all so I’ve been working on improving my skin during quarantine (ill share those deets soon) and I feel pretty good about where I’m at but (I) wanted to pop my skin with a little something for these zoom calls without putting on a full face of makeup,” she revealed.
Gabrielle then gave props to none other than Rihanna, 32, for helping her out with her skin issue! “I saw someone online say they only use concealer and bronzer and I was like BUT I tried it and didn’t even use concealer just my @fentybeauty bronzer (Caramel Cutie) and BISHHHH this was the result!!!!” she wrote. “Now, I found my light of course but… okkkkkkkkkk also NOT AN AD, just sharing what I learned. Happy Friday folks!!! Zoom innnnnn on this skinnnnnnnnnnnn.”
The Fenty bronzer and Gabrielle’s already beautiful face was a lethal weapon of gorgeousness that clearly worked. “Thought this was a throwback. Skin is glowing yo!”, host Desus Nice, 38, wrote in the comments section. “Ok, how do you do this? This thing, called aging backwards?!!,” another wrote. “How? Incredible!”
Gabrielle’s also enjoyed some romantic moments with her husband Dwyane Wade, 38, while they remain in self-isolation. They cozied up in their pool on Friday, April 17, where the former Bring It On star sizzled in a sexy blue bikini.

The mother of 2 stated this during the week as a guest on Gbenga Adeyinka’s Instagram Live chat.

The fashion goddess also stated that before she got into the industry, she admired Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. She said,

Actress, Mercy Aigbe, has revealed that for a long time, she had a crush on ‘African Queen’ singer, 2baba (formerly 2face Idibia).
Aigbe stated this during the week as a guest on Gbenga Adeyinka’s Instagram Live chat. After Adeyinka played ‘African Queen’ while on the video call, Aigbe said with a broad smile, “Don’t tell anybody o. For a very long time, I had a crush on 2baba.”
The fashionable role interpreter also stated that before she got into the industry, she admired Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. She said, “Coming into the industry, there were two people I admired a lot— Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. Liz Benson was just so beautiful and she still is. I absolutely loved her back then. I also loved the way Sola Sobowale interpreted her roles. She inspires me whenever I see her on a movie set.”
Recounting the first encounter she had with Sobowale, Aigbe said, “Before I got into the industry, I admired Sola Sobowale because she knows her onions. One day, I got a call to come on set for a movie titled, ‘Ohun Oko So Mi Da’.
“The movie was produced by Aunty Sola and I was shivering when I got to the set. I asked myself, ‘Would I be able to act in the presence of my role model?’ I went to a corner and prayed to God and told myself, ‘This is my opportunity. I shouldn’t allow Aunty Sola overshadow me. I should let my star shine.’
“Unfortunately for me, in that particular scene, I wasn’t meant to talk at all. I acted the role of her husband’s secretary and was dating her husband. She came to my character’s house to warn her. I was not supposed to say anything but I thought that as an up-and-coming actress, she would just kill my ‘star’ if I didn’t say anything. Guess what I did. I gave myself lines. As she was ranting, I was reacting to her rants. When she held me, I put my hands inside her brassiere. She just told the director to end the scene at that point, asking where they found ‘this kind of girl’.”
The ‘77 Bullets’ actress also maintained that she learnt consistency and doggedness from her mother. She added, “I learnt being dogged from my mum. She is a very strong woman, who never gives up. She is very consistent and hardworking. I believe that whatever one wants to do, one has to keep at it until one succeeds.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A dress famously worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, remains stuck in lockdown before it can be displayed to the public.
Diana wore the midnight-blue velvet gown by Victor Edelstein when she danced with Hollywood star John Travolta during a 1985 state banquet at the White House.
Purchased in December for £220,000 by Historic Royal Palaces, it was due to join the royal ceremonial dress collection at Hampton Court Palace.
The dress was being prepared for display when lockdown began, and remains in a workroom, described as an “isolation room”.
Newly acquired garments undergo freezing or heat treatment, to remove moths and their eggs, before joining the collection.
The collection’s curator Eleri Lynn told Hello! magazine: “The dress is basically still in isolation.
“The dress had been frozen and then we left it to thaw out for a few weeks to make sure we were not cracking any fibres or anything like that.
“We would then repack it for more permanent storage within the collection stores. But we hadn’t quite finished that process, so it’s still sitting in the isolation room.
“Without a doubt it will be on display again. It is a perfect marriage of form and function and was the perfect dress for that evening.”
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Ms Lynn added: “It’s such a momentous acquisition. It’s the perfect blend of celebrity and royalty, so it’s really special that it’s now part of a designated national collection because we will preserve it for posterity.
“We exist to tell the story of our palaces and their people, and Diana is one of them. There is still such interest in Diana and the charity work that she did, so she is still hugely relevant.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How museums move fragile art from one museum to the next</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORFOLK, Va. — The nymphs were invited to visit Italy this spring, but they are way too important to travel alone.
Curator Lindsay Neal would have to escort them.
The nymphs, or rather, the 1902 painting “The Cave of Storm Nymphs” by Sir Edward John Poynter, is a favourite at the Hermitage Museum and Gardens in Norfolk.
The Musei San Domenico in Forli wanted to borrow the piece for its spring exhibition. Since it would be the first international loan for the Hermitage, Neal wanted to tag along. One can’t just plop a Poynter in a package and pop it in the mail.
Moving a masterpiece is much more complex.
The Hermitage hired a Philadelphia fine arts shipping company to design and build a crate for the painting. In early February, Neal monitored the packing and its placement in a climate-controlled truck for the first stop in Philadelphia. The painting went through special TSA pre-screening, then went on to New York where Neal eyed the crate until it was stowed carefully on a plane. Once in Rome, the process was reversed for a secured six-hour drive across Italy.
Before patrons get to gawk at art in museums, teams of curators, museum directors, shipping companies and art registrars create an orchestrated dance of sorts to move the fragile, the huge, the rare, from one museum to the next. Not only are the pieces often irreplaceable, they also are valued in the hundreds of thousands, if not, millions of dollars.
It involves a white-gloved treatment (cotton, please, or powder-free nitrile) in controlled environments that are monitored for temperature and humidity under lights that are doused to the just-right brilliance. The lighting requirements differ depending on if the art is a 5,000-year-old ceramic sculpture or 15th-century watercolour.
“It’s always a fun proposition,” Allen Hoilman, curator at the Hampton History Museum, said of planning an exhibition.
“People think you just bring things in, put them in a case and lock it. Most times, it’s not like that at all.”
In mid-March, Heather Hakimzadeh, curator at the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art in Virginia Beach, and two assistants were slowly unwrapping a large framed canvas for its “New Waves 2020” show.
It was tightly bounded in clear wrap.
“Do you want me to hold the plastic up?” Hakimzadeh asked. Tight wrappings pressed against a canvas can pull paint off of the art.
“Yes,” Eliot Hicks said. “Yes, as much as possible.”
The framed image was placed on a padded table underneath soft lights to examine in what is called condition reporting. The art piece is compared to photos and notes that were made prior to shipping and sent with the piece to make sure there was no damage in transit.
This show is an exhibition of Virginia artists and most of these pieces were packaged and hand-delivered by the artists themselves.
Typically, when MOCA receives art, curators let it to rest untouched for at least 24 hours for acclimation to the new environment. Humidity, especially in Hampton Roads, can warp a frame and image or both.
The pieces the trio looked at now had come from Richmond and didn’t need to wait.
Preparator Hicks and gallery technician Becca Bollman, like Hakimzadeh, wore white gloves. They didn’t want the oil in their hands to transfer to the work.
They also wore fitted clothes because they didn’t want loose sleeves to touch or lasso a piece of work and knock it over. They all wore their hair pulled back and no jewelry or makeup, nothing that could leave a speck or scratch.
Hicks first took photos of the image and then used the flashlight on the phone and hovered over the frame.
He called out if he noticed something on top of the glass that could be gently swept away like thread or if there were marks on the canvas itself.
“Dog hair,” he said, brushing at a wayward line. “If it isn’t dog hair, it’s usually cat hair. If it isn’t cat or dog hair, it’s usually their own. … In the upper left quadrant, it looks like a pencil mark.”
He and Bollman then held the framed piece high, turning it over and examined the back.
Each piece gets deliberate care. It can take days or weeks to set up an exhibition.
“The art is the number one thing,” Hakimzadeh said.
Old and delicate treasures are the specialty of Jeanne Willoz-Egnor at The Mariners’ Museum and Park in Newport News.
As director of collections management and curator of scientific instruments, Willoz-Egnor manages pieces that date back to ancient Egypt and that are as exceptional as silverware pulled from the Civil War-era USS Monitor.
The museum’s object collection has about 32,000 pieces ranging from smaller than a thumbnail to more than 90 feet. Its library holds more than 2 million books, vessel plans, maps, charts and photographs. The museum is often tapped for loans.
“It’s a huge collection and each piece means a different kind of care,” Willoz-Egnor.
One of her more recent acquisitions is a gut-skin parka that she discovered online at a tribal arts auction company in Germany.
The Mariners’ has images and boats of Inuit indigenous people from Alaska. However, the clothing of the people would add more depth to the collection.
“We’re not just boats,” Willoz-Egnor said. “We’re mariners. We’re people who recreate on the water.”
The museum successfully bid for the parka last fall for about $3,250 and then had to figure out how to get it here.
Logistics weren’t the problem.
She needed special permits to import it, and she needed to know the genus and species of the animal guts in the coat. She started her research. Could it be made of the intestines of a spotted, ringed or bearded seal or maybe a walrus or beluga whale?
“Being a protected species, you have to get particular permits,” she said. “The rarer it is, the more permits it would require.”
She also had to know the coat’s country of origin and its age.
She ruled out whale and walrus after studying the width of the bands on the coat. Using information from the auction house, Willoz-Egnor learned that the coat had been acquired in June 1964 in Point Hope, Alaska by a geologist. Someone on her staff found the geologist and talked to him. They decided that the parka probably dates to 1950-1960.
She also contacted a museum in Alaska and a gut-skin specialist there who told her she was sure the coat was made from a bearded seal.
Willoz-Egnor then found an international shipping company that specializes in artifacts.
“They aren’t going to call Mailbox Etc. to pick this up,” she said.
After three months of research and getting permits, the parka arrived in Newport News in mid-February, packed securely in soft foam and Tyvek.

Allen Hoilman was planning a Hampton One exhibition to open last June at the Hampton History Museum to display all things about the popular racing vessel.
He learned that a museum in Maryland had an unfinished hull and he wanted to borrow it as showstopper for the show.
“I like building exhibits with a centerpiece,” he said, “so that when people walk by they stop and think, ‘Oh, what is it?’ That sometimes can be a small, spectacular thing, but I’ve found big, inexplicable things can draw attention.”
The gallery space, however, is on the second floor and there was no way to get a boat on an elevator.
The museum was going through a renovation and having its windows replaced. Hoilman asked if the one in the exhibition space could be built 6 feet by 6 feet and could open and close.
The day the hull arrived, the street behind the museum was closed and a crane hoisted the boat up to the second floor. It wouldn’t fit in the window. The hull was 3 inches too wide. Workers tilted the hull and eased it in.
“We will be faced with the opposite process in about a year,” Hoilman said.
Hoilman had experience in moving chunky stuff. He worked at the North Carolina Museum of History and had to get a racing car into a third-floor space for an exhibition.
“I like large artifacts,” he said. “It’s a lot of fun figuring out where they are going to go.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The ray-traced worlds of Minecraft RTX shine new light on a beloved classic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">My first attempt at Minecraft’s Survival Mode was a glorious disaster. It took me most of the first day’s fleeting light to realize that all I needed to do to harvest wood was to walk up to a tree and punch it. I got as far as making a crafting table, but the sheer number of possibilities it presented intimidated me, so I went off exploring. Nightfall came, and zombies and creepers with it. I died. Several times, actually.
I persisted, and found a world that surprised and delighted me at every corner. I plumbed the depths of endless caverns, hunting for precious gems and minerals. I built the treehouse of my childhood dreams and then learned to defend it against the creatures of the night. I uncovered an alternate dimension of darkness and flame and built up my armor and weapons to go toe-to-toe with the monsters there.
I still play Minecraft with my kids. The game is an old friend, a familiar playground. I’m continually astonished at the creations of the modding community and enjoy checking in on their work, but it’s been a little while since I really dug into a creation of my own.
All of that has changed with the recent Minecraft RTX beta. Ray tracing brings new life to those familiar cubic worlds. The shadowy depths of caves and mines drip with a new sense of danger, and the overworld shines with unexpected radiance. Light plays around blocks in a deeply satisfying way as you mine them. The RTX update gives you an opportunity too rare to be wasted: a chance to play a game for the first time all over again.
What’s more, the physically based materials pipeline this update includes gives the talented creators in the Minecraft community a wealth of new tools for their projects. Some of those talented folks have already put together a set of showcase worlds, and if their early efforts are any indication of what’s to come, there are tons of stunning adventures, puzzles, and landscapes headed to Minecraft’s Marketplace in the near future.
Minecraft RTX is still in beta, so the experience isn’t totally complete or polished yet. Even so, there are many questions that we’re now able to answer. What do ray tracing and physically-based materials bring to the game? What kind of a workload do these effects put on your GPU? What settings can you adjust to improve performance?
Armed with the ROG Strix GA35, a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti inside, I went hands-on with the Minecraft RTX beta to gather some first impressions and answer these questions.
Enthusiasts have talked about using ray tracing to render video game worlds for years, but it’s a computationally complex process that’s difficult to achieve in real time. With its Turing  GPUs, NVIDIA has made real-time ray-traced effects a reality. Its GeForce RTX cards have specialized RT cores dedicated to accelerating ray tracing operations, and it’s working with developers to help them bring these effects into the rendering pipelines of their games.
The Minecraft RTX beta gives owners of the Bedrock Edition an opportunity to take a first look at what ray tracing brings to the game. The beta only works on systems with GeForce RTX GPUs, and it requires you to sign up for the free Xbox Insider program. Once you’ve loaded up the beta, head into the Marketplace. Mojang hasn’t yet enabled an option to generate your own Survival or Creative worlds with RTX on. For now, you’ll need to check out the new tech inside one of six free showcase worlds made by luminaries in the Minecraft creative community.
Take one step into Color, Light, and Shadow RTX, created by PearlescentMoon, and you’ll immediately see what ray tracing brings to the table. On a curved wall in front of you, the word “Minecraft” glows in giant letters. The light from those blocks diffuses realistically on the walls and the ceiling, blending appropriately with other colors and casting shadows perfectly across the blocky surfaces of the room. This natural diffusion of light is called global illumination, and it’s directly enabled by the engine’s accurate model of how light should bounce off of surfaces in the scene.
My jaw dropped when I first saw the reflection of those letters on the floor. A screenshot doesn’t quite do justice to how the reflection is perfectly rendered no matter where you move in the room. This effect is the fruit of NVIDIA and Mojang’s work implementing physically based textures into the game. Blocks can now be assigned a degree of reflectivity so that objects like metal, marble, and mirrors will all interact with light exactly as you think they should.
These new lighting effects are particularly striking in and around water. The surfaces of oceans and lakes reflect light and scenery to gorgeous effect, especially as the light of the rising or setting sun illuminates the surfaces of clouds over the water.
Underwater, these effects are even more breathtaking. The Aquatic Adventure RTX world created by Dr_Bond showcases the new suite of tools that bring the lakes and oceans in Minecraft RTX to life. Light refracts appropriately as it passes into the water, recreating the Snell’s Window effect and limiting your view of the world above the waves to a 96° cone. Around the rippled edges of that circle, the surface of the water murkily reflects the environment below.
The new physically based materials toolkit gives creators a wealth of options. As you explore BlockWorks’ Imagination Island RTX, you’ll find a dazzling variety of updated textures and light-emitting blocks. Catch the sun setting over the ice palace for a look at how the new lighting and materials work together to dazzling effect. And if nearby clouds catch and reflect that rosy light? It’ll stop you in your tracks.
As much as I enjoyed exploring the detailed creations of expert builders, my time with Minecraft RTX made me hungry to go back to the basics, to the first experiences that made me fall in love with the game. I went off the beaten path in the Crystal Palace RTX world to find a cave and start from scratch. I gathered some wood blocks, made a crafting table, and started caving.
It’s here, mining into an unknown cave, that I became convinced that Minecraft RTX is something special. It’s in the details. When you place a torch on a wall, there’s this extremely rewarding split second where the light diffuses out. That light only goes as far as a reasonable bounce or two will take it, though. The shadows loom, hiding the secrets of the caves. I found myself placing more torches than I ordinarily would as I fought off creatures and hunted for materials.
It’s when you start mining that you realize just how far NVIDIA’s RTX magic permeates the game. Every time you mine a block, the light adjusts naturally and immediately. The warm glow of the last torch behind you fades into shadow the farther you mine away from it. It’s satisfying in a way that’s uniquely Minecraft.
What kind of hardware do you need to play the Minecraft RTX beta? Right now, the game is limited to PCs running one of NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX GPUs. As noted, these cards are equipped with unique RT cores specially designed to accelerate the intense workloads that real-time ray tracing presents..
We plan to publish a full performance guide for Minecraft RTX down the road when the game emerges from beta. For today, I’ve gathered some first impressions of in-game performance using the ROG Strix GA35. This beast of a desktop is equipped with the range-topping GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and AMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X. The beta presents a unique rendering challenge, so this is the perfect opportunity to deploy the best gaming graphics card on the market.
As of right now, there are only a handful of ways to adjust in-game performance. Ray tracing is simply an on/off toggle, as is the upscaling option. That second toggle controls NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 2.0 tech. With DLSS activated, the game renders at a lower resolution and then harnesses the Tensor cores in GeForce RTX GPUs to upscale the image using a neural network model. The image quality of DLSS 2.0 is so good and the performance gains are so pronounced that I recommend leaving this setting enabled at all times.
In other titles with DLSS 2.0, you may be given the option to select from quality, balanced, or performance presets. Here, that automatically happens under the hood. If you load the game with resolutions of 1920x1080 or below, DLSS will load with its quality preset. At 2560x1440, it’ll use the balanced preset, while at 3840x2160 it’ll use the performance preset. That arrangement makes sure that DLSS 2.0 is increasingly optimized for smooth frame rates as users push resolution higher.
A brief side note: Vsync is enabled by default in Minecraft RTX. If you want to disable it, perhaps to do some performance testing of your own, you’ll need to do so through the NVIDIA Control Panel.
A quick look at the RTX 2080 Ti’s performance in the Aquatic Adventure RTX world is sufficient to explain why it’s best to just let DLSS 2.0 perform its upscaling magic. I loaded the level at a 1920x1080 resolution, leaving all settings alone except for disabling upscaling.
50 FPS is a fine result, considering the workout that this game gives to the graphics card, but it might not be the kind of performance that you expect to see from NVIDIA’s top-end graphics card at 1920x1080. Thankfully, a solution is ready to hand with DLSS 2.0.
Now that’s more like it. Enabling DLSS increased average FPS by 61% in this scenario. That’s a remarkable increase, especially considering that the quality difference between the two modes was minimal if not imperceptible. That increase in frame rates was readily apparent as I swam along the seafloor alongside some tall strands of kelp, which slid smoothly past my view without any distracting stutter or blur.
I unequivocally recommend leaving DLSS 2.0 enabled, but there is one performance setting in the advanced video menu that’s worth a little experimentation. That’s the ray tracing render distance slider. From my in-game experience, the slider first affects how close you need to be to an object in order to see it at all, then secondly how close you need to get to it in order for its textures to be affected by the snazzy new lighting effects.
Take, for example, the lovely scene that greets you when you open Crystal Palace RTX by GeminiTay. You start in the cabin of a ship on the sea. The wood grain of the planks and the textures of the cloth sails interact beautifully with the light, and there’s a nice shimmer on the water. But there’s so much more that we could be seeing here.
When you increase the ray tracing render distance to maximum, the full landscape comes into view and the new RTX effects are really given the chance to shine. The towers of the level’s namesake palace loom in the distance, and their reflection stretches across the murky green waters. The scene perfectly sets the tone for the survival adventure designed by the world’s creator.
The different render distance settings are measured in “chunks,” or 16x16 cubes of Minecraft blocks. By default, the game will be set at the lowest possible distance: 8 chunks. You can increase this setting in increments of 4 up to a maximum of 24 chunks. If your GPU can handle the workload, you definitely want to increase the render distance at least a notch so that you can enjoy a full view of the landscape around you.
How much does ray tracing render distance affect performance? I benchmarked each setting in the Crystal Palace RTX world at 1920x1080 to find out.
Although the RTX 2080 Ti delivered excellent frame rates even with the ray tracing render distance maxed out, the performance differential between 8 chunks and 24 chunks is pretty steep. A couple of the showcase worlds are more difficult to render than the others, and pushing this setting too far in these worlds is a quick way to make the game unplayable. The performance penalty for 16 chunks isn’t nearly so expensive, however. This setting gives you a decent view of the wide landscapes around you at a fairly light cost. If your GPU offers you the headroom, as the RTX 2080 Ti does, take advantage of it.
There’s one last option for optimizing performance and quality: adjusting resolution. Right now, this is the only way to improve performance beyond the default settings, so if you’re scrounging for frames in the beta, try playing at 1280x720. It feels a bit odd in 2020 to suggest that folks play at 1280x720, but many people don’t even play Minecraft in full screen. The game’s cubic worlds display vividly at lower resolutions when you’re in windowed mode and multitasking. You can’t manage resolution in-game, but if you lower the Windows desktop resolution to 1280x720 or play the game in windowed mode, the results inside Minecraft can be quite dramatic.
There’s no need to drop down to 720p to get smooth frame rates when you’re rocking an RTX 2080 Ti, though. With this beefy graphics card, I’m always looking for opportunities to do the opposite: to enjoy the sharper images provided by higher resolutions. The showcase world Color, Light, and Shadow RTX definitely gave me this opportunity. It gives you a close-up look at the new ray traced lighting and physically-based materials. Since this world consists entirely of a series of enclosed rooms, I left ray tracing render distance at the default 8 chunks.
Maybe I should just smile and enjoy the 90 FPS experience that the RTX 2080 Ti offered in this title at 1920x1080. Maybe I’d be a happier person if I could just enjoy the sea turtles swimming over my head in the aquarium room without relentlessly searching for optimal graphics settings. But that’s just not my way. I just can’t look at this graph without thinking that I could push the resolution higher.
As it turns out, I can bump the resolution to 2560x1440 while still enjoying high frame rates. Throughout my testing, the RTX 2080 Ti never slipped below 60 FPS. The increased pixel count lended greater clarity to the many reflections and refractions in the scene, and made the custom textures really pop.
The RTX 2080 Ti even proves itself up to the challenge of rendering Minecraft RTX at 4K. That resolution can prove quite a challenge for GPUs, even without tasking them with calculating countless rays of light in real time. Serving up 46 FPS on average under these conditions is no small feat. You’d want a variable-refresh-rate monitor to enjoy the best experience at these settings, to be sure, but the fact that it’s even possible to begin with is pretty incredible.
Color, Light and Shadow RTX gives you an up-close-and-personal look at the new ray tracing technologies, but it only does so in relatively small rooms. Minecraft is famous for the startlingly beautiful vistas it offers when you step back from your creations, so I did another round of testing on Imagination Island RTX, where I could record some long-distance looks that take advantage of increasing the render distance to 16 chunks.
The average FPS turned out to be quite similar to what I recorded in Color, Light, and Shadow RTX. Even when I double the distance that I can see objects, bringing into view much more of the diverse and colorful creations on the island, the RTX 2080 Ti faithfully maintains high frame rates. How about at a higher resolution?
Once again, the RTX 2080 Ti proves itself more than capable of rendering at 2560x1440 in this game. Frame rates averaged right around 70 FPS and often landed closer to 80 FPS. If you have a high-refresh-rate monitor with G-SYNC, that technology will match the refresh rate of your display with the frame rate of the GPU to ensure a smooth experience even as the frame rate varies like it does in the above graph.
Chalk this one up as another victory for the RTX 2080 Ti on the 4K gaming battlefield. This resolution brings a level of image quality and clarity that amplifies the next-level lighting effects in the Minecraft RTX beta.
Minecraft has long been held up as the premier example of why gameplay matters more than gorgeous graphics. The game’s chunky, cubic landscapes have withstood the test of time thanks to its rewarding gameplay loop and endlessly inventive modding community. But now, with the addition of RTX magic, Minecraft is suddenly one of the most unique looking games on the market. Its signature cubes are still there, as are its barebones textures, but the interplay of realistically-traced light throughout its spaces is nothing short of transformative.
The price of admission to this new world of ray-traced gaming is one of NVIDIA’s Turing-based GPUs, starting with the battle-proven GeForce RTX 2060. We’re planning to produce a full performance guide as Minecraft RTX moves out of beta, but even today, we can say that NVIDIA’s DLSS 2.0 upscaling magic makes sure that you can enjoy a playable experience with any RTX-series card.
There’s definitely value to be gained by opting for one of the RTX 2060’s more-powerful brethren, though. You’ll want to increase the ray trace render distance as high as you can in order to appreciate Minecraft’s broad vistas and witness the new creator worlds as they were intended to be seen. One of the GeForce RTX SUPER cards will show their mettle in this regard, as will the top-of-the-line RTX 2080 Ti.
All told, the showcase worlds in the Minecraft RTX beta give a tantalizing teaser of the popular sandbox game’s future. If these worlds are the appetizer, then I’m already excited for the main course. It’s time for a new series of showcase worlds, exotic hangouts, and creative puzzles. It’s time to tackle the challenges of Survival mode once more, the lush Overworld, dimly-lit caverns, and fiery Nether, all as immersive and awe-inspiring as when you first encountered them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Promises to Collab With Lil Wayne on New Music</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's been a minute since we got a Lil Wayne and Drake collab. That could change soon.
On Friday (May 1), Drizzy joined Tunechi on Young Money Radio to discuss his new mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes,among other topics. During the talk, the conversation came up as to why Wayne and Drake do not collaborate on songs as much as they used to and as much as fans would like to see.
Both artists said they were down, but apparently it's not that simple.
"Let me explain to the people though. Now, something about me and Drizzy songs that we do together, we are both perfectionists," Wayne revealed around the one-hour mark. "So, it's not like, you send me a joint, I'm going to throw a verse on there and…We got a standard we got to live up to and we got a track record and a legacy we got to always protect. And then on top of that, it's like we have this thing where it's like, well, if I'm a send you a joint and I'm going to go first, first of all, I already know, it's like, all right, I know this man's about to go crazy on me. And I feel like it's like...These are moments where we truly..."
"In rap there's no score to define a winner or there's no championship game," Drake chimed in. "So, these are the moments of competition that we truly enjoy. Oh yeah."
Drizzy promised to get to work on a couple of collabs with this Young Money brother A.S.A.P.
"Well look, on that note, you have my word as a man and Mack [Maine], you can hold me to this when we get off the phone, I'm going to be in the studio," Drake confirmed. "What's today? Friday? I'm going to be in the studio all weekend. By midweek or maybe Monday night, you will have at least two joints."
With no touring to be done due to the coronavirus, both Wayne and Drake have been working on new music. Tune recently revealed he has something special coming soon. After announcing his new mixtape, Drake revealed his upcoming sixth album will be coming out this summer.
See Lil Wayne Albums Worth Listening to and Those You Need to Skip
After appearing on the Hot Boys' first two albums, Get It How U Live! and Guerrilla Warfare, and various other Cash Money Records releases, Lil Wayne unveiled his solo debut, Tha Block Is Hot, on Nov. 2, 1999. This project was Weezy's time to shine in the solo spotlight, allowing him to bring his lyrical talents and Down South energy to the mainstream. The LP, led by the hit title track, debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 with 229,500 units sold in its first week of release. Tha Block Is Hot features collaborations from the Cash Money roster including B.G., Turk, Juvenile and Mannie Fresh, and includes standout selections like "Loud Pipes," "Kisha" and "Fuck the World," which makes it an essential listen in Wayne's catalog.
In 2013, Lil Wayne looked to build on his success with sequel releases with I Am Not a Human Being II, the follow-up album to his acclaimed eighth studio LP of the same name, released three years earlier in 2010. However, unlike his first sequel effort with Tha Carter II, which saw Weezy take a creative leap, I Am Not a Human Being II doesn't have the same polished consistency. This album is much looser in its delivery, though it finds Weezy in top lyrical form. With a production lineup including Cool & Dre, Mike Will Made-It, David Banner, T-Minus, Diplo, Juicy J and StreetRunner, and features from Drake, Future, 2 Chainz, Juicy J, Soulja Boy, Trina, Gunplay, and others, I Am Not A Human Being was a commercial success, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, with 217,000 units sold in its first week. However, lackluster songs like "Curtains," "Back to You," "Beat the Shit" and "Trippy" outweigh the album's finer moments like "No Worries" and "Rich as Fuck," making it a more pedestrian offering compared to his greater projects.
After releasing three solo albums prior to Tha Carter, there were the Wayne stans that loved everything he delivered and then the critics who questioned if he could become the franchise artist on a record label. Lil Wayne bounced back to prove everyone he could in a big way in 2004, with his fourth studio album, Tha Carter. Largely produced by Mannie Fresh, the album recaptured the synergy the pair had built over the years, with the singles "Bring It Back" and "Go D.J." carrying on the duo's tradition of delivering amped-up bangers. In addition to those hits, deep cuts like "BM J.R." and "I Miss My Dawgs" are also lauded by fans. Aside from Tha Carter coming in at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, and ushering in a new era for the Young Money millionaire, he proved once again why he deserves to be in the running for best rapper alive.
The departure of Juvenile, B.G. and Turk from Cash Money Records left the label on shaky ground, with many unsure if Lil Wayne would be able to shoulder the load moving forward. The release of Wayne's 500 Degreez on July 23, 2002, was the first project from the label not to include any contributions from the other Hot Boys members, and considered a critical and commercial disappointment in comparison to the rapper's previous offerings. The album's lead single, "Way of Life," failed to recapture the magic of hits like "Tha Block Is Hot" and "Get Off The Corner." Titled as a jab at Juvenile, who dropped his 400 Degreez album in 1998, 500 Degreez was intended to one-up Wayne's former groupmate, however, it failed to live up to that billing and remains on the lower spectrum of Wayne's most solid solo releases.
The creative tandem of Lil Wayne and Mannie Fresh was broken up following the latter's exit from Cash Money Records prior to the release of Tha Carter II, the first Wayne album devoid of any contributions from the producer. Released in 2005, Tha Carter II came on the heels of the first installment in Weezy's The Dedication mixtape series, and further showcased his improved lyrical ability and elite delivery. With a mix of radio-friendly singles ("Fireman," "Hustler Musik," "Shooter) and captivating fan-favorites ("Tha Mobb," "Money on My Mind," "Best Rapper Alive"), Tha Carter II marked Wayne's ascension into the upper echelon of the rap food chain and marked a pivotal turning point in his evolution as an esteemed lyricist.
Attaining rock star status during the latter half of the aughts, Lil Wayne decided to fully embrace the role by recording what was billed as a rock album titled Rebirth, which was released on Feb. 2, 2010. Powered by production from Cool & Dre, DJ Infamous, DJ Nasty & LVM, Kevin Rudolf, and J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Rebirth features Weezy crooning in Auto-Tune over electric guitar riffs and drum loops for much of the album, a recipe that largely proved to be hit or miss. While selections like the Eminem-assisted highlight "Drop the World" were met with rave reviews, songs like "Prom Queen," "On Fire" and "Knockout" felt a bit contrived in the eyes of longtime Wayne fans. Wayne's witty flair and sharp lyricism are still found throughout Rebirth, but overall, the long player finds him trying his best at a stylistic change that doesn't suit his most lauded attributes.
Embarking on what many consider the most prolific and memorable mixtape run in rap history, Lil Wayne staked his claim for the title of "Best Rapper Alive" on the verge of the release of Tha Carter III in 2008. Debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with over 1 million copies sold in its first week, Tha Carter III marks the apex of the rapper's starpower and creativity. Giving fans a dose of mixtape Weezy on "A Milli," and crooning to the ladies on the chart-topping smash "Lollipop," all grounds are covered on this LP, which took home the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. This opus is Weezy's most successful album to date as well as the most beloved.
After being extricated from his contract with Cash Money Records in 2018, following an end to his feud with Birdman, Lil Wayne finally delivered his long-awaited Tha Carter V album, in Sept. 28 of that same year. Seemingly eager prove that he had not lost a step and was still worthy of elite lyrical status, Weezy came with a renewed vigor this go-round, delivering one of the most buzzworthy cuts of the year with "Uproar" featuring Swizz Beatz, which inspired a viral dance craze and became his biggest solo hit in recent memory. In addition to that heater, joint efforts with the likes of XXXTentacion ("Don't Cry"), Kendrick Lamar ( "Mona Lisa") and Snoop Dogg ("Dope Niggaz") helped Tha Carter V live up to the hype and restored rap fan's faith that the Hollygrove-bred rapper was still on his game.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KOPAVOGUR, Iceland — The Mountain is at the top of the deadlift world.
“Game of Thrones” actor Hafthor Bjornsson, who played Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane in the HBO series, set a deadlift world record by lifting 501 kilograms (1,104 pounds) on Saturday.
Bjornsson, the 2018 World’s Strongest Man, made the successful attempt at Thor’s Power Gym in his native Iceland.
“I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” the 31-year-old Bjornsson told ESPN. “I’m happy with this.”
Eddie Hall set the previous record in 2016 at the World Deadlift Championships, with the Englishman lifting 500 kilos (1,102 pounds).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gil Schwartz, aka humorist Stanley Bing, has died at 68</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gil Schwartz, the longtime CBS communications executive who wrote humorous novels and columns under the pen name Stanley Bing, has died. He was 68.
CBS representatives said Sunday that Schwartz died Saturday at his home in Santa Monica, California. His death, they said, was unexpected, but due to natural causes.
Schwartz had a distinguished nearly 40-year career in corporate America with CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse Broadcasting. He retired in 2018 from his post as senior executive vice president and chief communications officer of CBS Corporation.
But unlike most of his peers, Schwartz had a once-secret and then public side career as a lauded humorist and writer of 13 books who satirized the business world he was part of. Under the pseudonym Stanley Bing, Schwartz wrote a column in Esquire for 13 years and then in Fortune. One, “Executive Summary: Stanley Bing,” from 1991, describes an unwelcome 40th birthday in the style of a corporate presentation.
“You’ll have to excuse me if I sound a little morose. I am morose,” he wrote. “This corporation recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary of operations. Quite a few parties were held in its honor, and they succeeded in getting this speaker somewhat depressed in the way that only enforced merriment truly can.”
Although he was able to hold the dual identities in secret for a while, in the 1990s, it became “the most poorly held secret in the media business.”

“Bing’s” books included “Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them,” “You Look Nice Today,” “Lloyd: What Happened,” and “Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story.”
Born in New York City in 1951, Schwartz studied theater arts and English at Brandeis University. He was a renaissance man: A poet, playwright, actor, guitarist and photographer of birds, food and travel.
Schwartz is survived by his wife of 14 years, Laura Svienty, two children, two step children and two grandchildren. The statement says a memorial service will take place in the fall. In lieu of flowers, the family requests anyone seeking to honor Schwartz donate to lafoodbank.org, foodbanknyc.org or sfmfoodbank.org.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bolshoi ballet soloists limber up in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moscow, Russia | AFP |  In the middle of their bedroom, Bolshoi ballet dancers Margarita Shrainer and Igor Tsvirko have placed a linoleum mat and a barre.
Since the start of the lockdown, the couple, both soloists in the legendary troupe, have largely used their own initiative to keep up their dance skills at home.
The Bolshoi held its first online classes only this week, more than a month after lockdown began.
Yet Tsvirko and Shrainer still look toned and Tsvirko pulls at his waistband.
“I don’t think I’ve got fat, that’s the main thing,” says the 30-year-old dancer, a leading soloist at the Bolshoi who has performed lead roles in “Ivan the Terrible” and “Nureyev”.
Shrainer, a first soloist who has performed major roles in “Coppelia” and “Carmen Suite”, massages her leg with a tennis ball and moves into the splits.
Together for more than a year, they are living in a studio flat owned by the theatre.
The same block is home to several other dancers and it was outside this building that the notorious acid attack on then-artistic director Sergei Filin took place in 2013.
Their Zoom class is led by a teacher doing steps in his bedroom to a piano accompaniment.
There are leaps and energetic dance routines. At the end, Shrainer sits with her legs stretched out in front of her.
“We got some cardio,” the 26-year-old says.
Afterwards they goof around, Tsvirko performing lifts with Shrainer.
“As for dancing as a duo, yes we probably are lucky that we can keep up this form,” Shrainer says.
The dancers had to find their own ways to create a lockdown routine and find equipment.
– ‘Only stronger’ –
As lockdown began, “the Bolshoi gave very important and worthwhile advice: keep yourself fit and find a way to do ballet in self-isolation,” says Tsvirko.
“That’s what we performers are doing: finding linoleum, barres.”
Normally dancers do not train at home so do not have such equipment, Tsvirko says.
As they spoke, the theatre brought round rolls of black dance linoleum, a special type with a strong grip.
Even their ballet shoes are “wearing out” as they cannot collect new supplies, Tsvirko says.
The theatre’s general director Vladimir Urin told Kommersant daily in early April that it was unfeasible to hold online classes for the 250-strong troupe.
Tsvirko suggests the management did not initially see how online video conferences could be used.
“I think it’s primarily due to the fact that some people weren’t familiar with technical innovations that exist now.”
General director Urin has said his “good” scenario is for the theatre to reopen for the new season in September and Tsvirko says he anticipates such a timeframe.
“I doubt anyone will start working before September or anything will open so I’ve steeled myself for such long holidays.”
Meanwhile both are developing hobbies.
Tsvirko is learning to play the guitar while Shrainer has got into cooking, pilates and learning English.
She says she misses the bustle of the theatre: “There’s not the usual pace, rhythm, constant rehearsals, meeting colleagues, sitting in the cafeteria.”
Tsvirko says he misses the anticipation ahead of going on stage.
“That atmosphere when you come in and warm up and you talk to your favourite wardrobe masters, your makeup artists — that process of going in, the slight butterflies, that’s probably what I miss most.”
Going back will not be easy, they acknowledge.
“After such a long time of strict precautionary measures, how will men even shake hands? I think everyone will be keeping their distance a bit,” predicts Shrainer.
Physically there will also be “a tough comeback period for the performers, of regaining strength,” she says.
Theatre-goers will be changed too, says Tsvirko. “Audiences will definitely observe precautions: probably they’ll sit in masks and gloves.”
Beyond the virus, the economic realities have changed, he adds.
“Russia for sure is also in an economic crisis, like the whole world basically, so the question is the cost of tickets.”
Urin told Kommersant that he fears opening later than September could mean financial disaster due to planned premieres.
But the dancers are ultimately optimistic the revered troupe will return with renewed energy.
“I hope people won’t get weaker over this time but only stronger,” says Tsvirko.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Martin Luther King's traffic ticket changed history's course</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DECATUR, Ga. — On this day 60 years ago, a black man driving a white woman was pulled over in a traffic stop that would change the course of American history.
The incident was unknown to most at the time and has been largely forgotten. The man was Martin Luther King Jr., and his citation on May 4, 1960, led to him being sentenced, illegally, to a chain gang.
Georgia’s segregationist politicians sought to silence King before he could mobilize great masses of people. But it backfired as the mistreatment rocked the 1960 presidential race, prompting blacks to vote Democrat and help end Jim Crow laws in the Deep South.
Today, there’s still a lot at stake for blacks, who are still urging presidential candidates to earn their votes while fighting against new ballot restrictions.
King’s “willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice” proved to be the catalyst for change, said Maurice C. Daniels, who wrote a biography of King’s lawyer, “Saving the Soul of Georgia: Donald L. Hollowell and the Struggle for Civil Rights.”
“Here we are in 2020 and we see there are systemic, institutionalized mechanisms, just as there were in 1960, to stall, derail and to deny citizens their franchise,” Daniels said.
Alicia Garza, whose Black Futures Lab is promoting a Black Agenda 2020, sees lessons for today’s activists in how King responded to the traffic stop as he challenged the powerful to provide decent jobs and affordable housing and health care for minorities.
“That story means everything,” Garza said. “Yes we do need to put it all on the line, but bigger than that we need to change the rules that are rigged. I think we will have a rude awakening in November 2020 if we do not get very intentional” about Democratic priorities.
King and his wife, Coretta, hosted the writer Lillian Smith for dinner and he was driving her back to Emory University for her cancer treatments when they were pulled over in DeKalb County, just outside Atlanta.
Smith later wrote that they were stopped because the officer saw her white face with a black man. But King may have been followed: The Associated Press had reported that Georgia’s segregationist Gov. Ernest Vandiver vowed to keep the Montgomery bus boycott leader “under surveillance at all times.”
King paid a $25 fine that September to settle the false charge of driving without a license, but said he wasn’t aware that he was put on probation, threatening prison if he broke any laws.
Days later, King joined the Atlanta Student Movement ’s sit-ins campaign, and was charged with trespassing in a whites-only restaurant at Rich’s Department store.
Atlanta’s leaders soon buckled as Fulton County’s jails filled, agreeing to desegregate in exchange for ending the boycotts crippling white-owned businesses. Charges were dropped and everyone was freed — except King.
The AP reported on Oct. 25, 1960, that over 300 people crowded into the Decatur courtroom to watch Judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentence King to four months, even though King’s Alabama license was valid until 1962.
“I watched in horror as Martin was immediately taken from the courtroom, his hands in metal cuffs behind his back,” Coretta Scott King recalled in her autobiography. “Martin later told me that the terrors of southern justice, wherein scores of black men were plucked from their cells and never seen again, ran through his mind.”
King urged his wife to be strong in a letter from a Georgia prison. Three years before “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” he wrote: “this is the cross that we must bear for the freedom of our people.”
With days left in the race, the campaigns of Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy sought to downplay civil rights issues for fear of losing southern white votes.
Blacks had mostly voted Republican, since Abraham Lincoln. Nixon had just been endorsed by Martin Luther King Sr., the leader of Ebenezer Baptist Church.
But Nixon ignored their pleas for help, while Kennedy called Coretta to express his sympathy.
Historians Taylor Branch and David Garrow wrote that Robert F. Kennedy threw a fit, telling aides who fed her number to his brother that they cost him the presidency, but he called Mitchell, who reversed his denial of bond, immediately freeing King.
King’s father switched his endorsement, saying Kennedy had “the moral courage to stand up for what’s right.” That quote, and others, appeared in a blue-papered pamphlet titled “No Comment Nixon Versus a Candidate with a Heart, Senator Kennedy.” Unnoticed by the national media, Kennedy aides and King supporters distributed the pamphlet in black churches around the nation the Sunday before Election Day.
Blacks had voted 60-40 Republican just four years earlier; this time they voted 70-30 for the Democrat, providing more than enough for Kennedy to win the electoral college and the popular vote by a narrow 113,000 margin nationwide, according to Theodore H. White in “The Making of the Presidency 1960.”
“It’s a really interesting and nuanced history,” said political organizer Mary Hooks, co-director of Southerners on New Ground. “The booby traps that Dr. King was experiencing during that time are the same ones that are still trapping up our people every day.”
Michael Warren is an editor on the AP’s South Desk and a contributor to the Race and Ethnicity team. Warren also has been a volunteer mentor to Decatur High School students as they prepare to apply for a historical marker at the site where King was sentenced.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A SCOTS dad has compared his newborn daughter to a hoagie after a takeaway dash before she was born.
Sam Murdoch, 20, made the hilarious comparison with an adorable picture of tot Savannah Allison Murdoch next to his favourite takeaway meal.
New mum Ellis Lee, 19, shared the snap on Twitter where it racked up thousands of likes.
And the reason behind the snap comes from the dramatic rush to the hospital as Ellis was going into labour.
But before she could be driven to Wishaw Hospital partner Sam, a digital technician, decided to order a hoagie and savour the treat - despite Ellis going into labour.
Speaking to The Scottish Sun, Ellis said: "I had to wait for ten minutes when I was going into labour because Sam had a hoagie delivered.
"He calls her his lil' hoagie because of the story.
"When she was all wrapped up in hospital after she was born he said she looked like a wee hoagie.
"Sam's always up to something, I walked in and thought 'What's going on?' when I saw him taking the picture.
"But that's just Sam, he always makes people laugh."
Posting on Twitter, Ellis wrote: "Honestly I’ve carried a child for 9 months for Sam to size compare her to a hoagie"
The cute picture of the week-old tot has already passed 35,000 likes on Twitter, with 1,500 retweets.
And the doting parents had no idea the post would bring out such a positive reaction.
Ellis revealed: "We didn't expect the reaction it got.
"Sam doesn't use Twitter so he was asking if it was a lot.
"It just kept going up and up, and hasn't stopped."
Earlier we told how an Ayrshire postie became a superhero after dressing up as caped crusaders while doing her local round.
And a Scots lad, 13, armed with 'Bucky' penned a hilarious 500 miles-inspired lockdown song.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was an incredible response to our poll to find Dundalk's favourite pub - and it went right down to the wire in the end with the voting spread far and wide across the 42 pubs nominated.
The voting really showed just how much Dundalk people appreciate their locals.
However, we can now reveal that the winner of the title of Dundalk's Favourite Pub is.... The Bartender!!
Congratulations to The Bartender which claimed 8 percent of the overall vote - narrowly edging out Russell's Gin Emporium, which scooped 6 percent.
The battle for third place saw seven pubs claim the bronze medal on 5 percent - The Spirit Store, The Neptune, Courtneys, Kehoe's Bar, Tom Clarkes, The Bodhran, The Vinegarmans.
Well done to all 42 pubs - let's hope we get a chance to return to each one for a tipple very soon.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2 (UPI) -- Michael Sheen and David Tennant reunited for a 3 1/2-minute lockdown edition of their Amazon/BBC fantasy-comedy series, Good Omens.
The mini-episode features audio of Sheen as the angel Aziraphale and Tennant as the demon Crowley, talking on the phone while social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.
The clip has gotten more than 350,000 hits since it was posted on YouTube on Friday in honor of the 30th anniversary of the publication of the Good Omens book by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.
Gaiman wrote the dialogue for the episode in which Crowley declares he is "transcendentally bored" and plans to to take a nap until July when the health crisis keeping everyone at home will, hopefully, be over.
Aziraphale confesses he has been enjoying the solitude, catching up on his reading, and baking and eating cake.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Vanessa and Stella jumped up and down on a cement divider.
Vanessa Hudgens rocked a skimpy bikini and risked taking a spill to participate in a TikTok challenge. On Sunday, the 31-year-old High School Musical star took to Instagram to share her attempt at the viral splash challenge with her 39.2 million followers. Her younger sister, 24-year-old Players actress Stella Hudgens, performed the somewhat dangerous stunt with her.
The challenge could have ended with the two sisters getting wet, so they both wore bathing suits to give it a shot. Vanessa was rocking an eye-catching string bikini from model Emily Ratajkowski’s swimwear line, Inamorata. Her top was dark blue, and it featured a small polka-dot print. The garment had scanty triangle cups that left little of the actress’ pert cleavage to the imagination.
The top also had halter ties around the neck and extremely long back ties that wrapped around Vanessa’s toned and tan tummy multiple times. She was wearing the strings tied in front so that they trailed down her lean torso.
Vanessa’s bathing suit bottoms were white with dark blue polka dots. They had high-cut leg openings and a low front. The design highlighted her shapely hips and made her slender legs appear slightly longer. Vanessa was also wearing a shiny black bucket hat on her head.
Stella was rocking an off-white bikini that featured a tiny floral print. She was also wearing a black baseball cap. Both sisters appeared to be wet, but they weren’t in the water when their video was filmed. Instead, they were standing on a thin concrete barrier separating a pool from a hot tub. The barefoot siblings were holding hands.
Stella was shown leaping up and kicking both feet behind her, and Vanessa immediately followed her lead. The sisters both laughed hysterically when they managed to land back on the barrier without slipping and falling in the water.
According to The Daily Mail, the object of the splash challenge is to stand near a body of water and to touch both toes on the water’s surface at the same time without falling in. This involves kicking the feet back while keeping them down low and quickly bringing them back forward to land safely on land.
Stella appeared to skim the water with one foot, while Vanessa seemingly didn’t touch it at all. However, the actress’ fans didn’t seem to mind watching her fail. As of this writing, her video has received over 329,000 likes.
“Jiggles on fleek,” read one response to her post.
“Two perfect beautiful goddess thank god,” another fan wrote.
However, a few commenters suggested that what the sisters were doing was dangerous.
“Looks like the break your neck challenge smh,” read a third remark.
Vanessa isn’t the only High School Musical star filming wacky pool videos. On Saturday, Ashley Tisdale uploaded a goofy mini music video costarring her inflatable llama float. For her performance, Ashley wore a pink bikini and mouthed the words to the song “I Want It All.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">January Jones Risks Wardrobe Malfunction in New Quarantine Bikini Photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">January Jones is heating things up while at home for quarantine! The Mad Men and Last Man on Earth actress shared a series of selfies on Saturday that show herself wearing a tiny teal bikini while swimming. She revealed one in her main feed, while sharing two others in her Instagram Story. The photos served two purposes: they both wished her mom a happy birthday, and showed off her swimsuit look.
In her Story, she first shared a photo of her mom in a one-piece bikini with the caption, "Happy birthday hot mama!" before repeating a similar sentiment in her main photo's caption. She then shared two more pictures, adding the captions "Laps?" and "Don't forget your Flotation devices," swiping a cheeky comment her Spinning Out co-star Will Kemp left on her own photo. Elsewhere in the main photo's comments, the star, who also appeared in X-Men: First Class and The Politician, caught flak for wearing jewelry in the photos. Jones pointed out that "gold doesn’t rust" and she was doing "water aerobics," regardless.
The flirty photos earned a lot of praise in the comments, especially from Jones' famous peers. Mad Men co-star Kiernan Shipka wrote "[Oh my f—ing god]," and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills personality Lisa Rinna wrote "BODY." Resident Evil and Dazed and Confused actress Milla Jovovich also added, "Happy Birthday beautiful!!"
The bikini shots showed off Jones' figure, which she has been working on keeping in optimal shape. In February, the 42-year-old star opened up to Shape about her past ideas of fitness, which were lax to say the least.
“My dad was a trainer, so in my 20s and 30s, I didn’t work out, because he was always pushing my sisters, my mom, and me to exercise. We would rebel and not do it,” she she said. “It’s not that I wasn’t active. As kids, my two sisters were runners, I played tennis, and we all swam. But on a regular basis I wouldn’t work out, ever. Even when I was filming X-Men and they had trainers for all of us, I would lie and say I was exercising in my hotel room, when actually I was watching Friends and having full tea service."
However, her attitude soon changed, as she later added, "After I had my son, Xander, I wanted to feel strong because my body had changed so much. As he got bigger and I was hauling around a 20- or 30-pound toddler, my lower back gave out and I saw my shoulders starting to curl and hunch. I wanted to do something for my posture and core strength. Two or three years ago I started doing barre classes, and after that I took regular private Pilates lessons. Then a friend told me about Lagree Pilates. I’ve been doing it two to four times a week for the past year now, and I’ve gained weight because I’ve put on muscle. I’ve gone up a size in clothes, but I feel like I look better naked."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The War On Drugs performed during a special livestream on Sunday night called Love From Philly Live, which was a fundraiser for members of the city’s entertainment community — proceeds from the event went to 30 Amp Circuit.
Separated in cities around the country, the band got together for a socially distant performance of a couple songs: A Deeper Understanding’s “Pain” and Lost In The Dream’s “Under The Pressure,” the latter of which they dedicated to Philly venue Johnny Brenda’s.
Bandleader Adam Granduciel previewed their at-home performance like this: “Did I wear the same clothes for three days just to get a halfway decent version of ‘under the pressure?’ If DI guitars sound this good then why do I have all these stupid amps? Or is Anthony in a “’chotchke-off’ with lee Sklar? Are midi cables the only thing buried in robbie’s basement? The answers to these questions and more.”
Watch it starting at the 5hr42m mark in the stream below.
Last month, Granduciel went on Instagram live to debut some new TWOD music.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">John Lafia, best known for co-writing 1988 horror film classic “Child’s Play,” and co-writing and directing “Child’s Play 2,” died on April 29 in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his family. He was 63.
Although a cause of death was not shared, the family offered information about the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which we’ve included at the bottom.
“Child’s Play” creator and screenwriter Don Mancini confirmed the news of Lafia’s passing in a Facebook post, writing:
Lafia was credited with coming up with the name “Chucky” for the freckle-faced doll, who was possessed by the soul of a serial killer and contributing the cinematic classic line, “Hi. I’m Chucky, wanna play?”
“Child’s Play” film went on to perform well at the box office and won a Saturn Award for best horror film along with a nomination for best writing. Lafia received a writing credit on the 2019 “Child’s Play” remake.
Lafia made his feature film directorial debut with 1988’s “The Blue Iguana,” which he wrote, directed and produced the soundtrack. In 2004, he wrote, directed and produced the NBC earthquake disaster miniseries “10.5,” which became the highest-rated miniseries of the year, garnering 20 million viewers over two nights. “10.5: Apocalypse,” a sequel created by Lafia, followed in 2006.
In 2012, he independently released his passion project, a musical drama called “The Ballad of Frank and Cora,” which he wrote, directed, shot and edited, as well as co-produced the soundtrack with musician Bill Jones. The film featured lead vocals from Lafia and Michele Rene. It was Lafia’s final film.
Lafia is survived by his children, Tess and Kane, and his former wife Beverly.
If you or someone you know might be at risk of suicide, please call 1-800-273-8255 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You Have To Use Cheats To See The Only Hidden Watermelon In Half-Life: Alyx</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Watermelons could be found hidden in a few spots throughout Half-Life 2. But for whatever reason only one melon is hidden in Half-Life: Alyx and it can’t even be seen unless players use console commands.
As documented in a recent video by Half-Life superfan MarphitimusBlackimus, there is a single melon in Half-Life: Alyx. It is hiding in a box early on in the game, in a section where Alyx is exploring a basement while Combine soldiers walk around outside the windows. However, this melon is actually hidden from the player’s sight unless they use “noclip” to leave the basement. Then and only then can you see the lone melon.
Things were much different back in Half-Life 2. In that game, released back in 2004, dedicated melon hunters could find six watermelons throughout the game. And a few more in deathmatch levels. MarphitimusBlackimus made a whole video about these melons too.
The new melon model seen in Alyx sports a brand new texture, looking better than the melons seen in Half-Life 2. Sadly, it can’t be broken into melon gibs. When shot it just poofs out of existence.
It seems in 2020 the budget for melons has been slashed. Maybe one day Valve will update Half-Life: Alyx to bring back the melons and right this wrong. They went back and patched the original Half-Life last year, 20 years after the game was first released.
I just don’t want to wait that long for my VR watermelons.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actress Lea Michele confirmed pregnancy rumors by sharing an Instagram photo on Saturday, where she displayed her first foray into maternity fashion, showing her baby bump while wearing a flowing blue dress.
“So grateful,” she wrote.
The 33-year-old actress played the lead role of Rachel Berry in the musical TV series “Glee” from 2009 until 2015. She also played as antagonist Hester Ulrich in the series “Scream Queens” until 2016.
The former “Glee” star has been married to Zandy Reich since March 2019, and this will be their first child together. Michele first met Reich at her best friend’s wedding, and they made their relationship status public in July 2017.
Reich is the president of AYR, a clothing company that stands for “All Year Round” and focuses on sustainable style.
Many of Michele’s celebrity friends celebrated the exciting news in the comments section of her Saturday Instagram post.
Emma Roberts, Michele’s “Scream Queens” co-star, congratulated her in a comment on her Instagram post, writing: “Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NI Executive set to discuss ‘phased’ pathway out of lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Communities minister Deirdre Hargey said the executive will hold intensive discussions this week.
The Northern Ireland Executive is expected to hold discussions on a phased pathway to recovery this week.
Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said last week that the pathway out of the coronavirus lockdown will be “criteria-led”, not “calendar-led”.
On Sunday, communities minister Deirdre Hargey said it would be a “phased approach”.
Sunday also saw the department of health announce another five confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19.
This brings the total number of deaths in the region to 381, according to department figures.
However, the true total is expected to be higher when deaths in the community are added.
Ms Hargey said the executive will meet on Monday, Wednesday and likely Thursday as part of intensive work evaluating lockdown restrictions.
She said details will be published within the next two weeks.
“As we start to ease those restrictions it’s important that we don’t do that too quick in that you reverse the good work that has been done up until now,” she told the BBC.
“We have to gradually introduce those slowly, adhering to the medical advice and looking at the modelling as we start to move through an easement process and indeed that has to be planned and managed.”
She said the lockdown will not be completely lifted and there will still be a “level of social distancing” to guard against a potential second wave of the virus.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The former England captain was due to coach Southern Brave this year.
Former England captain Charlotte Edwards rues the potential impact the postponement of The Hundred will have on the women’s game.
The launch season of the new tournament has been delayed until 2021 as a result of ongoing uncertainty around coronavirus.
The eight city-based franchises were the same across both the men’s and women’s editions and there were high hopes it would lead to a major boost in exposure for the latter.
Equal prize pots offered a step towards parity and, even though the size of the lowest men’s contract (£30,000) was higher than the top women’s deal (£15,000), for some players it was due to be the only payday of the summer.
Edwards, who was signed up as head coach of Southern Brave, told BBC World Service: “A lot of people are out of work.
“A lot of players were hoping to have contracts for the Hundred, which were quite lucrative for some of them, and everyone’s going to miss out which is so unfortunate and at such an important time for women’s cricket.
“For the players, it’s a worrying time. But we have been guaranteed that the ECB will still go ahead with their £20million investment into the women’s game, which is something that is obviously keeping us all going at the moment.
“This year was going to be hugely exciting for the game and important, and it’s good that it will go ahead – but it is it being delayed that is going to prove to be a problem for some of the players.
“It’s not ideal, but everyone’s health and well-being is more important at this time.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Classic Corrie episodes unlocked after filming halted</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The broadcaster is putting ‘vintage’ episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale on its on-demand platform.
ITV is unlocking classic episodes of its soaps after production on new instalments was halted.
“Vintage” episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale will be placed on its on-demand platform, ITV Hub.
It comes as filming of both soaps has been stopped and transmission reduced to make the episodes which have already been recorded last longer.
Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May, while Coronation Street will last until after June.
The episodes, airing every weekday on ITV Hub from Monday, will give “soap fans a trip down memory lane and a chance to relive some of soapland’s most iconic characters,” ITV said.
Coronation Street episodes from 1995, featuring Weatherfield characters Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough), Mavis Wilton (Thelma Barlow), Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), will go on the platform.
Emmerdale will go back to December 1995, ahead of villainous Chris Tate’s (Peter Amory) wedding, and in the midst of Kim Tate’s (Claire King) affair.
The broadcaster is already screening classic episodes on ITV3.
It comes after ITV bosses said that Coronation Street and Emmerdale could return to screens with older cast members absent and actors six feet apart.
ITV Hub will also feature previous episodes of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and Gemma Collins’ fly on the wall show Diva Forever.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020

A pregnant Katherine Schwarzenegger showed off her baby bump yesterday while taking a walk through a Los Angeles neighborhood with her dog, Maverick, reports People. She is expecting her first child with husband Chris Pratt. While the baby is Katherine’s first, Chris already has one son, Jack, with his ex-wife Anna Faris.
The 30-year-old stepped out in form-fitting black leggings that accentuated her growing belly and a casual black T-shirt. She also wore a pair of sunglasses and a black baseball cap. She finished the look with black tennis shoes. Katherine tied a black jacket around her waist while she walked.
In the picture shared in the article, Katherine appears to be talking to someone on the phone. Around her wrist was a doggie waste bag dispenser to clean up after her dog if need be. It did not appear like she was wearing much makeup, but her skin had a healthy glow.
Harpers Bazaar claims the photographs of the author walking with her dog were taken in the Brentwood neighborhood of L.A. The pics showed Katherine walking by a row of hedges, with Maverick looking excited while trotting ahead of her.
On social media, several fans expressed their happiness for Katherine. A few users congratulated her.
“After they got married, they couldn’t wait to grow their family. Jack will be a great big brother. Katherine always says that he is the sweetest, most caring boy,” a source told People.
The two are reportedly very excited about giving Jack a sibling.
The Inquisitr previously reported that the couple is hoping to celebrate the news of the pregnancy “privately,” but they are supposedly thrilled by the news. However, they did not keep the news of Katherine’s pregnancy hidden from her family.
“Family is everything to them and it’s a very exciting time. The baby is due early fall. Katherine shared the news with her family very early on,” a source shared with E! News.
Katherine and her mother, Maria Shriver, are very close, and her mother was one of the first people she told.
“Maria is especially thrilled with the news and can’t wait to be a grandma,” said the article.
Last month, Katherine and Chris chatted with a few of Katherine’s family members during an Instagram live session. The family bonded while watching Chris’ new Disney film Onward.
In the Instagram live video, Maria told the couple they would soon “have another beautiful family member.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lea Michele has finally confirmed rumours that she is pregnant with her first child.
The former Glee star, 33, took to Instagram on Saturday to post a stunning picture in which she cradles her baby bump.
It comes after reports emerged that Lea and her husband Zandy Reich were expecting a child together.
And her post was the first time she had commented on the news as she posed with her growing bump on show while wearing a beautiful blue maxi dress.
In the photo Lea had a big grin on her face as she looked down at her belly.
Lea wore her brown locks loose around her shoulders and appeared to have minimal makeup on.
She posed in her garden with beautiful plants making up the scenery behind her.
To add to the natural feel of the picture, she appeared to be going barefoot in the grass.
"So grateful," Lea captioned the photo alongside a yellow love heart.
The picture was quickly flooded with well wishes from her celebrity friends.
Emma Roberts commented: "Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!"
"OMG OMG," Ashley Tishdale said with a string of pink love heart emojis.
Her Glee co-star Naya Rivera wrote: "Aww congrats! I love this. You're going to be a great mommy!"
Lea and Zandy met in 2017 and got married last year.
Rumours about her pregnancy sparked a bizarre conspiracy theory about Lea and her Glee character Rachel.

    <h5 class="mb-1">John Wick 4, Spiral And More Receive New Release Dates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionsgate has put together a new theatrical calendar compensating for the disruption in distribution schedules and production caused by the novel coronavirus. While these are very much still subject to change, it looks like we’ve got some new dates for a lot of interesting stuff.
The biggest is John Wick 4, which is being delayed an entire year. Pushed back from its original May 21, 2021 date, it will now release on May 27, 2022. But something from Lionsgate will be releasing on that date: Chris Rock’s Spiral, the next entry in the Saw franchise.
As for other genre fare, the embattled Chaos Walking starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland will keep its current release date, premiering at theatres in our post-apocalyptic future of January 22, 2021. The sci-fi film Voyagers, starring Colin Farrel, Tye Sheridan, and Lily-Rose Depp, will come out November 25, 2020. And The Devil’s Light, a supernatural thriller set to be directed by James Hawes (Black Mirror, Penny Dreadful), will come out January 8, 2021.
As a fan of the ongoing and forever in our hearts Keanussaince, the delay of the next John Wick movie is both the most notable and the most painful item on this list, and I call on Warner Bros. to follow suit by delaying the next Matrix film so that we can continue to have the double Keanu holiday we all deserve and will, frankly, need. 
Editor's Note: This article has the US release date. We will update this article as soon as possible with an Australian release date, if available.

    <h5 class="mb-1">John Wick 4, Spiral and More Receive New Release Dates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionsgate has put together a new theatrical calendar compensating for the disruption in distribution schedules and production caused by the novel coronavirus. While these are very much still subject to change, it looks like we’ve got some new dates for a lot of interesting stuff.
The biggest is John Wick 4, which is being delayed an entire year. Pushed back from its original May 21, 2021 date, it will now release on May 27, 2022. But something from Lionsgate will be releasing on that date: Chris Rock’s Spiral, the next entry in the Saw franchise.
As for other genre fare, the embattled Chaos Walking starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland will keep its current release date, premiering at cinemas in our post-apocalyptic future of January 22, 2021. The sci-fi film Voyagers, starring Colin Farrel, Tye Sheridan, and Lily-Rose Depp, will come out November 25, 2020. And The Devil’s Light, a supernatural thriller set to be directed by James Hawes (Black Mirror, Penny Dreadful), will come out January 8, 2021.
As a fan of the ongoing and forever in our hearts Keanussaince, the delay of the next John Wick movie is both the most notable and the most painful item on this list, and I call on Warner Bros. to follow suit by delaying the next Matrix film so that we can continue to have the double Keanu holiday we all deserve and will, frankly, need.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Miss you so much: Riddhima Kapoor Sahni remembers happy times with dad Rishi Kapoor as she shares throwback family photo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Late actor Rishi Kapoor’s daughter, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni arrived in Mumbai from New Delhi on Saturday night by road to be with her grieving mother Neetu Kapoor and brother Ranbir Kapoor. The ace designer, who reportedly did not get permission to fly down due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, could not be in Mumbai on time to attend her father's last rites.
These past days, Riddhima has been taking to social media to fondly remember the happy days she spent with her doting dad. In her latest posts, the star spoke her heart when she shared a throwback family photo with her late father, mom, Ranbir and her daughter Samara. She captioned the post saying, “Miss you so much!”
The photo happens to be from one of the Kapoor’s family dinner date nights at one of their favourite restaurants in the city. Every time Riddhima was in the city, the family was seen heading out for at least one dinner date at one of the plush restaurants in the city.

On Thursday, Riddhima shared a tear-jerking post, remembering her darling dad, saying, " Papa I love you I will always love you-RIP my strongest warrior I will miss you every day I will miss your FaceTime calls every day."
"I wish I could be there to say goodbye to you ! Until we meet again papa I love you - your Mushk forever," she concluded with a heart and distraught emoji.
Rishi Kapoor breathed his last on Thursday morning after a two-year battle with cancer. The last rites were performed at around 4 pm in the city's Chandanwadi crematorium.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor's daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni has finally arrived in Mumbai from Delhi. As per the latest reports, Riddhima Kapoor reached Mumbai with her daughter Samara Sahni, to be with her mother Neetu Kapoor and brother Ranbir Kapoor. Rishi Kapoor had passed away on April 30, 2020, after a long battle with cancer.
Unfortunately, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni was unable to attend the funeral of her father due to the lockdown restrictions. But later, she was granted permission to travel by road, to be with her family during this tough time. However, Riddhima witnessed the last rites of her father by Facetiming Alia Bhatt, who attended the funeral.

After the demise of Rishi Kapoor, Riddhima had shared a selfie with her father on her official Instagram page and expressed her deep grief. 'Papa I love you I will always love you - RIP my strongest warrior I will miss you everyday I will miss your FaceTime calls everyday! I wish I could be there to say goodbye to you ! Until we meet again papa I love you - your Mushk forever.', wrote the doting daughter.
Riddhima Kapoor's husband Bharath Sahni, who had shared a close bond with Rishi Kapoor, penned down an emotional note on his Instagram page and mourned his beloved father-in-law's demise. 'Will never forget the love you gave me. You taught me so much in the little time I had with you. Simply broken today. Lost for words. Love you and will miss you a lot. R.I.P. Papa 🙏❤️🌺', wrote Bharath.
For the uninitiated, Rishi Kapoor was diagnosed with cancer in 2018. The actor underwent treatment in New York for over a year and later returned to Mumbai. He was later admitted to Sir. HN Reliance Foundation Hospital on April 29, 2020, where he breathed his last.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alberta parks partnership rules to be released, critics call for consultation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EDMONTON - Albertans are expected to learn Monday how they can take up to 164 provincial parks and recreation sites off the hands of a government that no longer wants them.
The decision, announced in March, comes despite concern from thousands of people, including parks users, businesses, rural municipalities and opposition politicians.
"The lash back from Albertans on this has been unprecedented," said Katie Morrison of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, or CPAWS. "It's quite unbelievable their concerns are being ignored."
Environment Minister Jason Nixon has said the United Conservative government plans to fully or partially close 20 provincial parks and hand off another 164 to third-party managers. Sites for which no manager can be found will lose park status and revert to general Crown land, which can be sold.
That's about 16,000 hectares — small compared with the province's total park system, but about one-third the number of sites the province manages. Budget documents suggest the move would save about $5 million.
Alberta Environment has promised to release guidelines Monday on how the parks "partnerships" would work.
Thousands have signed petitions and written letters in protest.
One online petition had more than 8,000 signatures within days of the announcement. At least 5,000 Albertans have written Nixon through the CPAWS website.
Hundreds have attended town halls and rallies, held online because of COVID-19, said Morrison. Environmentalists, hunters and anglers lined up against it.
Managers of several outdoor retailers have also protested.
"Hundreds of Alberta businesses depend on the economic benefits that access to Alberta parks and natural spaces create," they wrote in an open letter.
"We urge (the government) to reverse this decision and undertake a comprehensive good faith public consultation."
The head of Alberta Rural Municipalities said Friday some of his initial concerns have been allayed after meeting with Nixon, but he still wants assurances his members won't be out of pocket.
"Our municipalities should not end up seeing a cost," said Al Kemmere.
A Leger poll commissioned by CPAWS of 1,002 Albertans in mid-March, considered accurate within three per cent 19 times out of 20, found two-thirds opposed closing parks or removing them from the system. That result was consistent across the province.
A slight majority opposed transferring parks to third-party management.
Nixon has said the move is to save money, modernize parks and focus spending on the province's marquee natural areas.
Critics say he has refused to discuss the plans at all.
"I wouldn't characterize our relationship as collegial in any way," said Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for the Opposition New Democrats.
He said his office has received more letters about parks than any issue other than the pandemic.
"There's been no indication whatsoever the government is reconsidering its plan."
Schmidt said Albertans deserve a say in such a large change to their parks system — especially since the pandemic has trimmed so much spending capacity.
"We really don't think there's anybody else positioned to take over these parks right now."
Morrison said her group wrote Nixon expressing concerns and received what she called a "boilerplate" response.
The group noted the government changed the rules for parks consultation last February, softening previous requirements to read "the public may be engaged or notified."
Kemmere said a handful of municipalities are interested in running a park, charging enough to break even. That interest was expressed before the pandemic, he added.
"It'll all depend on the value (the government) puts on these and what they're willing to invest. But we're hoping this will not come as a mechanism of handing the costs from one level of government to another."
Partnerships in managing public parks may not be a bad thing, said Morrison. But the public should have some input into the rules and parks should not lose their status.
Nixon has said no former parks will be sold.
"In the short term, I believe that statement," Morrison said. "But this government has indicated they are willing to sell public lands."

Every Sunday for the next six weeks, the Stones will share rare footage from “special past performances,” beginning with outtakes from the band’s 2016 concert film Olé Olé Olé!: A Trip Across Latin America.
“Available digitally for the first time, this six-part weekly series will feature bonus footage from some of the band’s most memorable concerts around the world,” a YouTube description reads.  Aside from Olé Olé Olé, the series will also include footage from their 1994 Voodoo Lounge Tour, as well as four other tours.
“Extra Licks” premieres today at 12 pm PT/3 pm ET/8 pm BST. Watch the stream below.
Last month, the Stones released “Living in a Ghost Town” — their first new music since 2012.
“So the Stones were in the studio recording some new material before the lockdown and there was one song we thought would resonate through the times that we’re living in right now. We’ve worked on it in isolation. And here it is,” Mick Jagger said about the song in a statement.
“So, let’s cut a long story short. We cut this track well over a year ago in L.A. for part of a new album, an ongoing thing, and then shit hit the fan Mick and I decided this one really needed to go to work right now and so here you have it,” Keith Richards added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Metallica is one of many bands forced to put summer tour plans on ice due to the coronavirus, but the heavy metal veterans haven’t been staying idol while quarantining.
On Friday, the band unveiled a new video on YouTube, a brand-new version of their track “Blackened” from their classic 1988 album …And Justice for All.
This stripped-down version of the track — now renamed “Blackened 2020” — features band members James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich and Robert Trujillo performing their parts while playing their respective instruments in their individual homes.
“Here’s a little something we cooked up over the last few days,” the band wrote in a caption accompanying the video. “Hope you’re all safe & sound. Have a great weekend.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Kristine Lofgren
Carole Baskin gave her first major interview since the Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” hit televisions across the country. While the big cat advocate thought she was speaking with Jimmy Fallon, it turned out that she was actually chatting with two YouTubers who tricked her into spilling details about her experience filming the show.
As Business Insider reports, Josh Pieters and Archie Manners reached out to Baskin to see if they could trick her into appearing in their video. Pieters conducted the interview, while Manners acted as a producer. They played clips of old television episodes of Jimmy Fallon’s show, The Tonight Show.
With so many interviews taking place remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two saw an opportunity to trick celebrities into conducting interviews.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters said. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
To their surprise, Baskins agreed. They compiled a bunch of clips of Fallon talking about cats in order to prepare for their interview.
Baskin opened up about the challenges they’ve been facing at her big cat rescue in Citrus Park, Florida. She told them that she has been forced to lay off half her staff since they can no longer allow people to visit the park. She also talked about her choice of headwear – a type of lei – and urged people not to pay to see tiger cubs.
Since the news of the fake interview hit the media outlets, Baskins opened up about being tricked into giving an interview.
“I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited,” she told Us Weekly magazine.
In the past, Baskins has said that she was upset with the way she was portrayed on the show, which spent an entire episode focused on the disappearance of her husband. She says that people who are focused on finding out what happened to her late husband missed the point.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Tiger King’ Star Carole Baskin Duped Into Interview By YouTubers Playing Clips Of Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin is the latest celeb to be hoaxed by YouTube tricksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.
The British duo recently tested a theory: would celebrities agree to an interview when played recorded soundbites of James Corden taken from “The Late Late Show”?
It worked like a charm, with the pair easily tricking U.K. pop star Craig David, TikTok performer Holly H, “Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein into believing they were having conversations with the actual James Corden, when in reality they were playing clips from his talk show.
For their next stunt, the duo tried the same thing with Carole Baskin of “Tiger King” fame, using clips of Jimmy Fallon from “The Tonight Show”.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high-level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They decided to reach out to Baskin, never expecting she’d actually take them up on it — until she did. The result is Baskin’s first major interview since the debut of “Tiger King”.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
According to Pieters, celebrities are given a false sense of security when they hear the familiar voices such as Fallon and Corden.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters explained. “You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
According to Pieters, Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” although he admitted he never expected she’d actually go through with it.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video of the interview is scheduled to go live on their YouTube channel at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thursday night NBC aired A Parks and Recreation Special, a new episode of the series that reunited pretty much the entire cast of the beloved sitcom…albeit via everyone’s homes, Zoom style. (It was not Zoom but similar tech from Gryzzl, the company that figures into the final season of the show.) Written by showrunner Mike Schur and other producers/writers from the series, it was warm and funny — even though there wasn’t much of a plot —  and well done given the constraints everyone is under currently. Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) and a wordless surprise cameo from a featured player kinda steal the show if you ask me.
The special was also created to help raise money for Feeding America’s COVID-19 Response Fund, and it’s collected $3 million as of Friday, and is continuing to accept donations through May 21. With that, NBC has made A Parks and Recreation Special free to watch on YouTube and you can do so below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TV Rewind | Quantico: Priyanka Chopra saves the day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">2015 marked Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra’s foray into the West as she played the lead role of Alex Parrish in American television show Quantico.
What is Quantico about?
Quantico is about Alex (Chopra), a trainee FBI agent who somehow gets embroiled in a case and is ultimately labelled as a fugitive. Over the three seasons of the show, Alex gets involved in so many storylines that it’s hard to think of her character’s life chronologically.
Alex is the star of the show and it’s evident from the start. She drives the narrative and even though we see other characters having their mini-arcs, it’s all about Alex. This is not necessarily a bad thing if the makers know where they are going with it, which in this case, they didn’t.
What works and doesn’t work for Quantico?
The best part about Quantico is Priyanka Chopra. While Indians have seen her do a lot on screen, this was the first time that the West got a chance to see her in action. And PeeCee didn’t disappoint as she was the only face in the show that anyone could remember.
I always felt that Quantico could have seen better days had it been made by Shonda Rhimes (How To Get Away With Murder, Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal) because the show had scope for ample human drama with its rich characters, but it was more focused on serving its overcomplicated plotline. Alex was mysterious, and with characters like Ryan, Shelby, Nimah/Raina and Caleb, there was so much interpersonal drama that the show did not really need the heavy Grand Central plot in the first season. The mid-season finale here offered the worst possible cliffhanger that I have seen in the last decade.
In the second season too, the plot with the President of the United States was something that could have taken a leaf out of Scandal’s book since they did the saucy POTUS drama so well. And the third season’s plot was so off the rails that it’s best to remember it for its picturesque locations.
Quantico mattered because it starred Priyanka Chopra in the lead role. Had it not been for her, the series would not have made the small dent that it did in the global television landscape. I say small because apart from giving the gift of Priyanka Chopra to the West, Quantico didn’t do much.
What happened to Quantico?
The show was cancelled after three seasons, which isn’t good in television speak. The declining ratings of the show is said to be the reason for its cancellation despite the fact that Chopra left no stone unturned in promoting the show. The plug was pulled so fast that the third season turned out to be a mini-season.
Honestly, I would like to soon see Priyanka Chopra in another television show that celebrates her just like Quantico did. But this time, let her have some fun with a better script.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec fashion designer Mathieu Caron launches line of masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a limited edition of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of professional figure skaters he typically dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champ Tessa Virtue and world silver medallist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, that material is being used to create designer masks — with profits going to the World Health Organization.
"We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks," said Caron, a Longueuil, Que.-based skatewear, dancewear, gown and wedding dress designer.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask."
The unique masks are not for all budgets — with the eight models costing between $150 and $300.
It hasn't stymied interest in the masks. Japanese customers snatched up the items inspired by Uno's costumes, which retailed for $200 to $250.
"I was surprised," Caron admitted. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn't think people had so much money to buy a mask."
Caron said at the beginning, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
In three hours, 245 masks were sold, giving birth to the hashtag #Shomask in Japan, with stocks of the three models flying off the shelves.
When the items were first made available, a few masks were ready to ship. But given the demand, Caron had to move quickly to fill orders.
The goal wasn't a big marketing campaign, Caron said.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration," Caron said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks."
The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters' outfits and are very breathable material, with padding included to give them shape and structure.
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibres.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all," Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec fashion designer Mathieu Caron launches line of masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL — A Quebec fashion designer has launched a limited edition of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of professional figure skaters he typically dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champ Tessa Virtue and world silver medallist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, that material is being used to create designer masks — with profits going to the World Health Organization.
"We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks," said Caron, a Longueuil, Que.-based skatewear, dancewear, gown and wedding dress designer. 
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask."
The unique masks are not for all budgets — with the eight models costing between $150 and $300.
It hasn't stymied interest in the masks. Japanese customers snatched up the items inspired by Uno's costumes, which retailed for $200 to $250.
"I was surprised," Caron admitted. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn't think people had so much money to buy a mask."
Caron said at the beginning, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
In three hours, 245 masks were sold, giving birth to the hashtag #Shomask in Japan, with stocks of the three models flying off the shelves.
When the items were first made available, a few masks were ready to ship. But given the demand, Caron had to move quickly to fill orders.
The goal wasn't a big marketing campaign, Caron said.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration," Caron said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks."
The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters' outfits and are very breathable material, with padding included to give them shape and structure. 
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibres.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all," Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020

Canadian bombshell Francesca Farago sent hearts racing around the world after she posted a very sexy new photo of herself bikini-clad on social media on Sunday, May 3. The model posted the image for her 3.5 million followers on her Instagram account, and it caught the attention of thousands instantly.
The 27-year-old model — who is most famously known for starring in Netflix’s latest reality show Too Hot To Handle — was photographed inside of her kitchen. She took center stage as she stood directly in front of the camera, exuding a sultry vibe. Francesca’s hands rested on the stove behind her as she shared a pout and stared directly into the camera’s lens. Her long brunette hair was styled in loose waves and as it cascaded behind her and over her right shoulder.
She further added a touch of glamour to the look by sporting a full application of makeup that complemented her tanned skin-tone. The look included foundation, dark eyeliner, filled-in eyebrows, eyeshadow, a nude lipstick, bronzer, and blush. However, it was her killer figure that stole the show, as she proudly flaunted her curves in a skimpy two-piece bikini.
The beauty’s dainty bikini top, which was black, featured versatile ties that went over her shoulders and down her back, and ruffles along the bottom of the cups. The top’s triangular cups struggled to contain her voluptuous assets as it exposed an ample amount of cleavage.
Francesca combined the top with a pair of off-white bikini bottoms that left very little to the imagination as they were designed with a classic Brazilian-style cut. The tiny thong featured high-waisted side strings, which the model had tied into bows, that both highlighted her curvaceous figure and drew attention to her slim core.
Francesca finished the look off with a black and white bandana that she tied around her hair.
The beauty did not indicate where she was snapped in the post, but in the caption, revealed that the swimwear was actually designed by herself and available through her label Farago.
The sexy image was met with a large amount of support from many of Francesca’s followers, garnering more than 612,000 likes since going live on Sunday afternoon. Additionally, more than 6,000 fans took to the comments section to overload her with praise on her body, her looks, and her bikini.
“Stop, you’re so hot,” one fan commented.
“Literally perfection,” a second follower added.
“You are gorgeous,” chimed in a third follower.
“You are beautiful,” a fourth admirer proclaimed.
The influencer has seen her fanbase blow up on social media since Netflix premiered Too Hot To Handle. Furthermore, her relationship with fellow cast-mate Harry Jowsey has been of particular interest to fans, perThe Inquisitr.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lea Michele Looks Radiant In Her First Baby Bump Pic After Previous Pregnancy Reports – It’s Confirmed!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Glee actress took to social media to share a wonderful piece of news with her many followers! As it turns out, Lea Michele is expecting her first child and she posted her very first baby bump picture on her Instagram account as proof!
That being said, it’s safe to say that the star looked radiant as she posed from a side angle to show off the belly better while in a maxi dress and wearing the most beautiful accessory – a bright smile.
This comes days after reports that she is pregnant broke out and fans were definitely very happy to see the bump for the first time.
The blue dress she had on made her look like a total goddess and people could not help but gush over her beauty in addition to congratulating her for being pregnant.
As she looked down at her bump while holding it with her hands for the pose, Lea smiled, her long hair cascading down her back.
That picture was already telling the world in a thousand words just how excited and happy she was but she still used two actual words in the caption to make it even more clear: ‘So grateful.’
As you can imagine, a lot of fellow celeb friends were really happy for her and freaked out over the news, including former Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts, who commented: ‘Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!’
Furthermore, she also received good wishes from Maren Morris who also became a mom just last month!
The news first broke out earlier this week after a source shared with People that Lea was expecting, mentioning that she and her husband Zandy Reich ‘always wanted to be parents.’
This will be the very first time becoming parents for either of them.
Lea and Zandy were engaged for nearly a year before they tied the knot in March of 2019 and seem very happy and in love as they make this huge new step in their lives and relationship.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People: the adaptation is sublime, like Sally Rooney's novel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week, I’ve watched half of the 12-part television adaptation of Normal People, and so this column is an appreciation of Sally Rooney. I remember vividly how I felt when I first read her debut novel, Conversations With Friends, and then the exact emotions Normal People forced to the surface. When I turned its final page I was almost overwhelmed with a fear that somehow she had accessed the parts of my brain that even my friends are spared from.
I don’t think that she requires or demands anything from us as a writer, only that we accept that her characters are, at base level, versions of the people we all are. It was by reading Rooney that I was able to accept the overthinking, analytical, just-trying-to-get-through-the-day-carrying-a-load-of-emotions parts of myself that I didn’t know other people had.
The adaptation is sublime. You know that worry you have that a film or TV version won’t do a book justice? I didn’t have that, because Rooney herself has written the script, along with playwright and screenwriter Alice Birch. And I’ve sort of been broken by it, but in a way that I know we’re all a little bit broken when someone holds a mirror up to the fact that we are all just normal people, with fragile hearts that we do anything we can to protect.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tracee Ellis Ross: 'As a kid, singing was too scary a dream'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is a strange noise coming from Tracee Ellis Ross’s Los Angeles garden. Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. “I’m just going to go check that out. Stand by!”
If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn’t a horror movie, it’s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom Black-ish, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I’m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch.
In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow “Bow” Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a cultural phenomenon. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not.
A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we’re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. “I think we’re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It’s like the fear is just waiting right there.” She gestures towards the window.
The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross’s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she’s wearing a floral, Georgia O’Keeffe-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through – a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once put it, Ross “can do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10”.
But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is Diana Ross, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with Andy Warhol when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat?
“I’ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,” Ross says. “My mom always joked: ‘I’m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I’ll make sure there’s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that…’ I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, ‘If you want to keep buying those clothes, you’re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.’ There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.”
Ross speaks fondly of her family, to whom she is extremely close. Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross’s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross’s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome.
“My mom always put us in bed, then she’d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She’d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.” Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. “I nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn’t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.”
But being her mother’s daughter didn’t necessarily help when it came to work. “When I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,” Ross says. “It might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: ‘OK, is she as good as her mom?’”
She got her first big break as a comic on MTV’s The Lyricist Lounge Show in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom Girlfriends, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a “black show”.
“The landscape of television was not the same as it is now,” Ross says. “It was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.” Despite the size of Girlfriends’ audience, she didn’t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. “It wasn’t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,” she says. “It was a matter of which eyeballs were watching.”
Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and “everything started to happen”. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when Debbie Allen won for Fame). Her proud family had already taken out a full-page ad in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination.
Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre “Dre” Johnson, that isn’t always evident in sitcoms. “Often the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,” she says. “I’ve never enjoyed that.
“There’s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,” she continues. “While the story is told through the eyes of the man, I’m not just the wife. I’m not just a doctor. I’m not just a mom. I’m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre’s – it’s based in my experience and my life.”
Sometimes, Ross says, Bow’s autonomy was “naturally written into the script” and sometimes she pushed for it. “I’m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,” she explains. “In a scene, if they have written that I’m doing ‘lady-chores’ such as the cooking, I’m like: why? It’s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I’ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.”
Some of that “other imagery” is the experience of being mixed race, which we don’t always see on mainstream TV. “I had never, ever played that in my career,” Ross says. “Even though [being half black and half Jewish], that’s what I live.” While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn’t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow’s identity. “It ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,” Ross says. “As a mixed person, you’re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, ‘Are you this, or are you that?’ which is the least interesting part of being mixed…” She trails off for a second, losing her thread. “You know when you haven’t been talking a lot?” she says. “It’s like you lose access to words.”
She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice™ enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create Mixed-ish, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow’s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow’s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show’s politics too simplistic, and it’s not clear whether it will be back for a second season.
Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a TED talk (on the power of women’s fury) and signed up as an ambassador for Time’s Up. She has appeared in music videos for Drake and Kanye West, a former neighbour. She runs her own company, Pattern, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. “I have wanted to sing since I was a kid,” she tells me. “But it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.” There was, after all, a lot to live up to.
A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by Nisha Ganatra (who worked on Amazon’s Transparent), The High Note sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by Dakota Johnson) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she’s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when.
A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. “This is a very small disappointment.” But still, it stings. “At 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work… it was life-changing for me.”
Did she really wait until 47 to start? “Pretty much. In high school, I took choir – it was one of the required courses – and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster’s office: ‘Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it’s fair to force somebody who doesn’t want to sing and who doesn’t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.’ And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.”
Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add “a flare of comedy or hide behind a character”. So it wasn’t until very recently that she decided “to face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn’t do it small – I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.”
A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. “I had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,” she says. She wasn’t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice.
On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don’t even know how inappropriate they’re being when they ask why she’s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn’t “mind any more. It no longer stings. It’s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody’s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don’t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.”
She remains “happily and gloriously single”, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t men in the background. When I ask whether she’s had texts from exes during lockdown – something of a pandemic phenomenon – she grins. “Oh, that’s definitely come up,” she says coyly, but won’t go into detail. “I have a heart that is very open and available to find the right man,” she continues. “But, you know, the old expression ‘sweep me off my feet’ seems ridiculous. I want to find a man who will meet me where I am. Because, actually, I like my feet. I like them grounded on the floor.”
Our conversation is interrupted by the ping of a text message from a special man in her life. It’s her dad, wishing her a happy Passover. Ross has been doing regular group calls with her family since lockdown began. “FaceTime with my dad is like this,” she says with a laugh, manoeuvring the computer under her armpit. “I’m like: ‘I can’t see you!’ And he’s like: ‘I can see you!’ And I’m like: ‘I know, I can’t see you!’”
What does she miss most about normal life? “I really miss smelling the people that I love,” Ross says. “Being able to nestle my head in my mom’s neck, or in my best friend’s. When I hug my best friend, it’s a full body hug. And I know what her scent is – not just her perfume, but just what she smells like. I don’t think I realised how important that is.”
The hardest moments of lockdown, Ross says, seem to be between 10.30pm and 1am. It’s then that the “collective trauma and bizarre nature” of what we’re going through really hits her. “I just want something to distract me and it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s just me. Oh hi again! Hey you!’”
There has been some solace, she says, in the fiddle-leaf fig she’s sitting next to. “I’ve been doing a lot of talking to her. She was a little upset to begin with because I forgot to water her for the first few weeks – a lot of leaves started to fall off. But this last week has given me some encouragement that maybe my father’s green thumb got genetically passed down, after all.” She looks at the plant with a quiet expression of satisfaction. “You know, I think she’s back to a joyful state.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NK Jemisin: 'It’s easier to get a book set in black Africa published if you're white'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In 2018, NK Jemisin became the first writer ever to win three consecutive Hugo best novel awards for science fiction and fantasy. Her first award had been in 2016, for her novel The Fifth Season, and its two sequels,The Obelisk Gate and The Stone Sky, won in the following years. Yet speaking on the phone from her home in coronavirus-hit Brooklyn, Jemisin says she never thought she’d be published. “I honestly didn’t think I had a chance. You just didn’t see characters like me in fiction,” she says.
Growing up in Mobile, Alabama and New York, Jemisin was an avid reader, making up her own stories from the age of eight, but the lack of black women writing science fiction and fantasy, the genre she loved, made her believe it wasn’t for her. “We were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction, occasionally young white women fiction, and if that’s how you’ve grown up, then that is what is normal.”
Occasionally black characters would make their way into those stories written by white men. Jemisin recalls Arthur C Clarke’s Childhood’s End, in which Jan Rodricks, a black man, is the last human on Earth. “There’s a paragraph when the black male character is introduced where Clarke pauses the story to basically explain to the audience that, you know, this character is black, but it doesn’t really matter anymore in the future. And so for all intents and purposes, he’s basically a white guy who just happens to have black skin. Not really the ideal way to handle it.” She discovered Octavia Butler in the 80s, and that “helped a great deal, but she was one person”.
Jemisin trained as a psychologist and worked in universities, in a branch of counselling psychology specific to late adolescents. She carried on writing but gave up on any idea of publishing – she’d been to graduate school, she had student loans, it didn’t make sense to change careers. Then she hit 30, and had a “mini midlife crisis”. She’d written a novel – an early take on what would become The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms – and sent it out to publishers, also taking science fiction and fantasy writing workshop Viable Paradise, where she gave short stories a try for the first time, and began selling her work. The novel didn’t get picked up, “probably because it wasn’t very good”.
She wrote another, The Killing Moon, which got her an agent. Set in a world based on ancient Egypt, it had an almost exclusively black cast – and didn’t find her a publisher. “It was the mid 2000s, and at that time science fiction and fantasy publishers were not super interested in stories with black casts by black writers. They had done some stories with black casts by white writers, but they were not interested in those stories coming from people who actually were black.” Rejection letters would say things like, “we like this, but we’re not sure how to market it. We like this but we’re not sure who its audience would be”– the implication from publishers being “that fantasy readers don’t want to read about black people. Black people don’t want to read fantasy. So what do we do?”
Jemisin decided to rewrite The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, making nearly the entire cast white. “All of them were horrible people. They’d shank each other for, like, nothing. And I wrote this angry story about this lone brown girl going into this place full of mean white people,” she says. It went to auction, with three different publishers fighting over it. “And I’m like, this is what you want?” she says. “I was pretty bitter … I’d taken such care in [The Killing Moon] to include sympathetic white people, but that wasn’t what they wanted.”
Telling of Yeine Darr, an outcast from the barbarian north who is summoned to the city of Sky, where she is named one of the potential heirs to the king (whose family has enslaved the gods), The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms won Jemisin the Locus award for best first novel in 2011. Two more novels in the Inheritance trilogy followed in an astonishingly prolific 18 months. The books were selling steadily, if not meteorically, and her publishers were hungry for more: luckily, she had held on to The Killing Moon. Set in the ancient city-state of Gujaareh, where the Gatherers’ role is to harvest the magic of sleeping minds to use it for good, until the dreamers start dying, it was nominated for a Nebula award.
By now Jemisin was back in her day job as a counsellor. She had a dream, of “an angry woman coming towards me with a mountain floating behind her”. It gelled with ideas she’d had since going on a Nasa-sponsored workshop for writers about astronomy, and she began to write The Fifth Season. Taking place on a planet with “one vast, unbroken continent”, the earthquake-racked Stillness, the novel opens with the “end of the world” as one man – a despised and enslaved “orogene”, who can manipulate the earth – tears a great rift through the heart of the world. Jemisin has said in the past that “it’s pretty obvious that I’m drawing on the human history of structural oppression, as well as my feelings about this moment in American history”. It won Jemisin astonishing plaudits, as well as a deal for a television series. Accepting her third Hugo, she told her audience in a winner’s speech that went viral: “This has been a hard year, hasn’t it? A hard few years. A hard century. For some of us, things have always been hard.”
Writing the trilogy while working almost full time hadn’t been easy, particularly as Jemisin’s mother had fallen ill in 2015. In the middle of writing the third book, she decided to launch a Patreon, an online subscriber platform, to fund her work. She didn’t have high hopes, but “I got a lot more money than I was expecting, so I went ahead and quit the day job” .
That was 2016. After a number of years in which a group of writers – mostly male, white, and overwhelmingly rightwing – attempted to thwart the increasing diversity of the Hugos by block voting for their approved titles, Jemisin’s triple whammy felt like a turning of the tide. As she put it in her blistering winner’s speech: “This is the year in which I get to smile at all of those naysayers – every single mediocre insecure wannabe who fixes their mouth to suggest that I do not belong on this stage, that people like me cannot possibly have earned such an honour, that when they win it it’s meritocracy but when we win it it’s ‘identity politics’ –… I get to smile at those people, and lift a massive, shining, rocket-shaped middle finger in their direction.”
She’s gone on to raise that middle finger at them in her writing. The enemy in her new novel, The City We Became, is a huge, tentacled, Lovecraftian horror, an evil out to destroy cities. But this villain is no homage to the master of eldritch horror. In Jemisin’s story – “a glorious fantasy,” says Neil Gaiman – the greatest of cities become living entities. New York has just awoken, and a “beast from the deeps” is out to take it down. “When you experience walking through any city at the right time, when the light is right, and it feels like it’s you and the city communing. I wanted to put some words to that feeling, as artists do, and that’s what I came up with,” says Jemisin.
HP Lovecraft, she says, also wanted to put words to a feeling: the feeling he had, however, was a vicious xenophobia. “When you read things like The Horror at Red Hook he’s blatant both about the racism and the fact that the racism is the inspiration for his feeling that these people are evil.” Until 2015, a bust of Lovecraft was given to winners of the World Fantasy awards. This changed when Nnedi Okorafor – the first black person to win the prize since its inception in 1975 – took the award in 2011. “She received the award and was like, do you understand exactly what Lovecraft represents to someone like me?” says Jemisin. “There’s a sort of running thread in science fiction to ‘engage with the art and not the artist’, probably because so many science fiction writers are problematic people. But in Lovecraft’s case doing that is not just egregious but dishonest, because Lovecraft’s fiction is so rooted in his xenophobia.”
The evil in The City We Became is, Jemisin has said, “basically Cthulhu” (Lovecraft’s octopoid monster), with a group of diverse characters facing off against it – and against, pointedly, the man-bunned alt-right trolls it recruits to fight for it. “I was choosing to engage with Lovecraft’s fear of the city – his sense that these diverse people brought a bad energy to it,” she says. “My take was: of course they bring an energy to the city, all people do. He perceived it as evil, but really it’s just life.”
Does she feel that Lovecraft, and the tentacles of racism that have wound through science fiction and fantasy for decades, are vanquished these days? It’s around 15 years, after all, since The Killing Moon was rejected across the board. Perhaps a little, she says. Editors and publishers are now aware of the demand for inclusive, representative fiction, but – as a recent survey highlighted – US publishing is still blindingly white in terms of staffing. “And so there’s a strange and nasty tendency that’s developed for publishers to be perfectly OK with novels about certain groups of people written by white folks, but not written by members of that group,” she says. “It’s still easier for a white person to write a book with an all-black cast set in fantasy Africa and get it published than for a black person.”
Still, with her clutch of Hugos, Jemisin is having the last laugh. Looking back on that record-breaking night in 2018 she says, “There are detractors in the science fiction community who feel that was an inappropriate speech to make. They are welcome to that opinion,” she tells me, with extreme dryness. “I felt like I needed a little catharsis.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holst: The Cloud Messenger review – ravishing late romanticism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Written just before The Planets, Holst’s choral epic, The Cloud Messenger, Op 30, has been neglected since its dud premiere in 1913 (the same year as Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring. It couldn’t be more different). A ravishing outpouring of late romanticism, it sets words by the Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa: an exiled yaksa, or nature spirit, persuades a passing cloud to send a love message to his wife in the distant Himalayas. Conductor Joseph Fort has made a lean but faithful chamber version – in part to make the work better known – expertly played by the Strand Ensemble and warmly sung by the well-blended choir of King’s College, London. They also excel in Holst’s a cappella Five Partsongs, Op 12.
Has British choral singing ever been as rich as now? Among other must-have new releases: the ace De Profundis (conductor Eamonn Dougan) singing Spanish Renaissance music by Juan Esquivel; the Gesualdo Six (director Owain Park) exploring early and contemporary music in their stunning album Fading; the Sixteen in two new releases spanning the centuries from Allegri’s Miserere to James MacMillan’s Symphony No 5. Support these wonderful vocal ensembles if you can.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gears Tactics review – think chess with chainsaws</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One unexpected side effect of the current pandemic has been a plummet in the appeal of alien-related fiction. When our lives and those of our beloved are threatened by submicroscopic killers, the idea of extraterrestrial body snatchers, triffids or xenomorphs – yes, even the allegorical ones – seems extraneous. Our species is, it turns out, more vulnerable on a molecular rather than a galactic level. Still, in Gears Tactics, a spin-off strategy game to Microsoft’s multimillion-selling Gears of War series, the opportunity to take on an invading force of humanoid alien attackers that can be repelled by bullets and teamwork is reassuringly refreshing.
Gears Tactics is a distant descendant of chess and, more overtly, the kind of table-top war games that were played by Prussian generals in the 19th century as a way to practise and refine their tactics on actual battlefields. Similarly, here you command a tight squadron of combatants, directing their movements from a bird’s eye perspective above various fields of play. You take turns with an unseen alien commander to move your units from cover to cover, coordinating attacks, feints and retreats in a series of drawn-out but often exhilarating skirmishes.
Each individual in your team has a class – sniper, healer, attacker and so on – a name and a customisable wardrobe. (And, look, if the idea of dressing your units in, say, bright pink armour seems childish, remember that since at least the 12th century, when a craftsperson carved the Lewis chessmen into walrus ivory, bespoke designs for game pieces have been popular.) Each unit, typically, has three “action points”, which can be spent on moving position, reloading weapons, chainsawing through alien limbs, applying first aid or setting up “overwatch” mode, whereby they cover a sector, firing their gun if anything crosses their line of sight.
Gears Tactics offers tremendous freedom to its armchair general: you can switch between units before you’ve spent all of their designated points, and in this way build a uniquely individual response to every tactical situation. Missions evolve in ways that demand flexibility, too. Sink holes will open up, capriciously, then spew forth enemies, turn by turn, until you manage to throw a grenade into the opening to close up the ground. Alien reinforcements are dropped from passing transports, rendering a position previously considered safe comprehensively flanked.
You must adapt to these changes in circumstance with care and caution. A unit that is left alone is vulnerable. Yet risk-taking is often rewarded, especially when attempting to complete the mission’s optional objectives, which earn rare pieces of armour or stat-improving attachments for your weapons.
Clearing a mission without losing a soldier is immensely satisfying, a feeling compounded by the fact that each individual on your team earns experience points for their performance, unlocking new skills and abilities that, over the course of the campaign, represent the cumulative fruits of your journey. It’s as if you had the ability to upgrade your chess pieces across multiple matches: a victory against a Kasparov might enable you to fit one of your pawns with a helmet that enabled them to evade a lunge from an attacking rook. As your tactical nous improves through experience, so your units advance materially. The better your performance, the greater the chance of future success.
Along with the obvious benefits to the design comes one drawback: the question of balance. There is a purity to chess, Go and other traditional tactical board games that is lost when past performance dictates future capabilities. Still, it’s an inevitable side effect in a game with an overarching storythat keeps pleasingly in step with one’s progress.
That story shares its themes of comradeship, loyalty and the mortal need for togetherness in the crucible of combat with much military-themed fiction, but here it’s lightened by the fact your opponents are drooling aliens and not, say, lurking insurgents. A game that, for all its sci-fi excess, delivers a delightfully tuned tactical arena.
Final Fantasy Tactics(Square-Enix; PlayStation, iOS)It’s testament to the coherence of its fantastical world, strategic depths and refined storytelling that, almost 25 years after the game’s original release, Final Fantasy Tactics remains as beguiling as ever. Unlike Gears Tactics, battles take place on a uniform grid, lending the strategy a more straightforwardly board game-like feel. But the ability to change each character’s class, while carrying over previously learned abilities, opens up strategic depths that have, arguably, yet to be matched.
Unexpectedly, this tinkering is couched in an unusually compelling and, at times, even affecting story of knights, castles and political and religious intrigue. Each unit becomes more than a pawn as you come to care for their plight, not only in the moment-by-moment thrust of battle, but also the sweeping arc of their fleeting lives.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neil Morrissey: ’I hated the press making me out to be a love rat’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I was taken into care when I was 10. I’m the third of four boys and we were slightly feral, left to our own devices, getting into loads of trouble, burgling and vandalising stuff in Stafford. The court put me and my next oldest brother, Stephen, into care. My parents were a bit crap, there wasn’t that much of a bond going on. Eventually, I pretty much lost touch with my family. When Stephen was found dead, in 1997, it was awful, but I hadn’t seen him for a decade.
I was constantly getting caned at school, sometimes three times a day. But I couldn’t help my gob. When I was 11, a drama teacher, Sheila Steele, put me up against the wall and said: “You’re in the school play.” I loved it and I was in every school play from then on. I learned a lot of lessons about discipline and hard work. I’m a total grafter. When I’m on a job I’m 100% committed to it.
Men Behaving Badly forced me to up my game. Martin Clunes and Caroline Quentin were such consummate comedians and genuinely really funny people that I first thought, “Oh my God.” We really gelled as a foursome [with Leslie Ash]. But being the new big thing was like being shot out of a catapult. It was great for getting into restaurants, but I couldn’t go on the tube for 10 years.
I’ve had a little breakthrough in recent years. I’m getting more drama roles. Jed Mercurio took a chance on me in Line of Duty in 2012 and from there I got other parts. It’s been great, but I never watch TV and think, “Ooh, I wish I’d been in that.” Except for Peaky Blinders. They’re running out of Brummies, so they need to get me in it soon.
I hated the press making me out to be a womanising love rat. Maybe those relationships would have been different had they not been all over the papers, but no matter what happened, the press shouldn’t have been hacking my phone or having private detectives follow me. I turned into a mistrusting, quieter, reticent person. You start looking at people around you, thinking, where is this information coming from? And who knows what effect it all had on producers who might have hired me. You take the papers to court and you get money, but you don’t get your life back.
My partner Emma [Killick] keeps my feet on the ground. I’ve always got big ideas: “We’re going to take the roof off and build a viewing platform!” And she’s like, “Neil, we’re not doing that.” She’s a lot of fun and very organised and she accepts all my madness and quirks and hangovers from childhood that may manifest themselves, like not opening letters because it might be bad news.
My first pub business went bust. Things went wrong that I can’t talk about. I had about five years of austerity while I paid back hundreds of thousands to creditors, but I managed to keep my beer company alive and now I have two pubs and a fantastic business partner. Even when the first business failed, I wasn’t that downhearted. I thought, get back on the horse. Anyone can be positive about things. I’m a glass-half-full person.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rainbow tees and NHS streetwear– the new wave of altruistic fashion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest collection from one of the world’s biggest streetwear brands has seen the NHS become one of the most coveted names in fashion. At 11am on Friday, London’s cult streetwear brand Palace launched an online collection entitled “NHS Tri To Help”, the Palace of its signature triangle logo replaced by the words National Health Service. Two minutes later it was sold out, with profits going to NHS Charities Together.
Palace aren’t the only ones making Nye Bevan, creator of the NHS, covetable. As a result of the pandemic, bootleg label Sports Banger has relaunched its now famous 2015 NHS Nike swoosh T-shirts. Founder Jonny Banger has raised “about £100,000 over three Friday nights, selling from 7pm till 7.30pm.” On the advice of a nurse friend, proceeds from the T-shirts are going towards the delivery of fresh juices and healthy food to ICU teams at five London hospitals: Mortimer Market sexual health clinic, and St Joseph’s Hospice in Hackney. “I wanted to make sure my work was attached to action,” he said.
Celebrities have also embraced a vivid “thank you” T-shirt created by the social-enterprise shopping app Kindred, featuring the rainbow logo used to signal appreciation for frontline care workers, with proceeds again going to charity.
Beyond the UK, the cult New York streetwear label Supreme launched a Covid-19 relief T-shirt last week, its signature box logo decorated with work by longtime collaborator, the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. It sold out almost immediately. The NYC streetwear brand Noah, founded by Supreme’s former creative director Brendon Babenzian, released a Thank You Core Logo T-shirt this week, with all proceeds going to Direct Relief, a charity that is helping frontline healthcare workers. It also sold out.
If the idea of hyped NHS hoodies seems unlikely, think again. “Streetwear is really more about community than anything else, so it’s not surprising that ‘drops’ [limited edition ranges] around social issues are common,” said streetwear analyst Justin Gage.
Nicolaus Li, an editor at lifestyle magazine Hypebeast, thinks these “altruistic drops” are worthwhile: “Consumption will always be tied to fashion, but if there is a way to make consumption meaningful, why not?” he said. “These products really help to spotlight what is important and I hope they serve to maintain that sentiment after the pandemic is over.”
These collections often score well when it comes to the all-important modern measure of popularity: resale. According to Gage, there is some evidence that “altruistic streetwear is more popular on average in terms of resale than your typical streetwear item”. For example, “the Supreme Covid-19 relief tee is selling for around $850 on StockX, good for a 14x resale premium, which is higher than average for box logo tees.”
Part of this is down to design. Gage thinks it’s no coincidence that the “two highest profile ‘social’ drops from Supreme – the Covid-19 relief tee and the Japanese earthquake relief tee – are box logo tees”, the brand’s bread and butter. “Altruistic streetwear needs to be more than just altruism,” he said. “It needs to be exciting and interesting, in and of itself. That combines hype and social conscience, and that’s when things get really cool.”
Banger hopes these efforts go deeper than T-shirts. “Katharine Hamnett said it best: ‘T-shirts don’t change the world – and they can even cause inaction.’ What we need is action.” As he puts it: “I just look forward to meeting all these people and everyone clapping on the next [NHS] protest march. Whenever and wherever that is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">For introverts, lockdown is a chance to play to our strengths</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday morning I spent an hour doing a jigsaw puzzle, followed by a game of Scrabble, fortified by tea and scones. For once, there was no one I had to see and nowhere I had to be. The way we live now has split us in two. For introverts, it’s largely business as usual. But for my more extroverted friends, who are clamouring for Zoom calls to fill the gaping hole the pub has left in their lives, it’s a deeply testing time.
I’m an introvert, which means I need time alone to recharge. This doesn’t mean I hate socialising, but it may well mean I will feel stressed and fatigued if I’m not left on my own for a while afterwards.
On the flipside, extroverts are energised by time spent with other people and are often, though not always, more outgoing. In the 1960s the German psychologist Hans Eysenck suggested the reason behind this difference lies in our environmental sensitivity. Introverts need lower levels of stimulation to reach their “set point” of social arousal than extroverts, leading them to seek an escape into quiet solitude sooner.
So it makes sense that we introverts are finding lockdown easier than our extroverted counterparts. They are struggling to reverse their behaviour, which I sympathise with – I can’t imagine what it would feel like to suddenly have to live life the other way round, with the government forcing me to socialise relentlessly. The thought of having to meet and talk to new people day and night without the possibility of withdrawing alone to recharge my batteries makes me feel nauseous.
Natasha Tiwari, a psychologist with a practice in London, agrees that self-isolation plays to an introvert’s strengths, but notes the importance of recognising that introversion and extroversion exist on a fluid scale. It’s natural to find things tough, however you identify. “Introversion and extroversion are not binary concepts,” she says. “Many of us flick between them depending on our mood, environment and the people surrounding us. The key is to work out how to attain the right balance in your lifestyle to support your mental health.”
In his 2011 paper on introversion, the American psychologist Jonathan Cheek argued that there are four main types of introvert: anxious, restrained, thinking and social – though overlap is normal. Anxious introverts struggle with shyness, often avoiding other people. Restrained introverts can enjoy socialising, but will stay in their shell until they feel comfortable. Thinking introverts are happy around others but are prone to daydreaming, and social introverts enjoy meeting friends but prefer to do so in intimate groups.
I fall mostly into the last camp and always have done. I socialise one-on-one where possible. I relish a deep and meaningful conversation, but find the small-talk element of big gatherings tedious. You’ll find me on the dancefloor, but I won’t be asking 20 different people, “How’s work?” Being a social introvert means I am missing the injections of real-life connection that I carefully thread through my diary every few days. Technology isn’t quite doing it for me; it feels too frenetic.
I’m living with my extroverted mum who has been enjoying regular “prosecco hours” on Zoom, the soundtrack to which goes like this: “Where are you? Turn your camera on! Oh, there you are! Cheers darling! Oh, you’ve gone again! Unmute! Unmute!”
I downloaded the Houseparty app, opened it up and immediately a friend’s face popped up to say hi, entirely unannounced. The horror has stayed with me.
Cat Archer Underwood, 36, a brand consultant from Hampshire and an introvert, is learning more about herself. “I’ve had moments of utter peace, watching my husband and four-year-old daughter pottering about in the garden,” she says. “But I have been surprised at how I am feeling about the prospect of more weeks of this. I am dreaming of hosting barbecues, having a house full of laughing children and seeing people who aren’t quite friends but are more than strangers. I may be choosier about the events I force upon myself in the future, but I’ve learned that this introvert needs to party sometimes, too.”
Others further along the introversion scale are finding their daily life has barely changed. English teacher Ellie Grout, 29, from Bristol, is one of them. “Self-isolation is similar to my normal experience,” she says. “The difference is that, for once, there is no pressure to arrange social events and no guilt about cancelling plans when I realise I want to stay at home.”
Hardcore introvert Jessica Pan, 34, spent a year living like an extrovert while writing her 2019 book, Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come. She lives with her husband Ian, a “solid ambivert”. Both are working from home and appreciating the slower pace of lockdown life. “I don’t believe any introvert actively enjoys being locked in their home at this time of anxiety,” she says. “But I am finding pleasure in the small things, such as reading more, cooking slowly and doing pilates. I’m trying to embrace this new normal and live in the moment.”
Jemma Broadstock, 24, a virtual assistant from Derbyshire, is hopeful this lockdown will reveal the often overlooked strengths of introverts and help erode what Susan Cain, author of the 2012 bestseller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, dubs “the extroverted ideal”.
“Business is thriving for me,” she says. “The idea of networking events has always felt overwhelming, but now people are holding them online and I’ve been finding new clients. When everything goes back to normal, I hope employers will offer more remote-working opportunities, as I feel much more confident in my own space. I am able to make valuable input when I would normally stay quiet.”
Cain, a former Wall Street lawyer, went some way in challenging misconceptions that introverts are always shy, serious and aloof with nothing much to offer. In her book she extols “the man of contemplation” in a society that has “always favoured the man of action”. Yet nearly a decade after its publication, extroversion is still considered a model of success, especially in the workplace where what Cain describes as “the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight” prevails.
Working in an open-plan office, taking part in daily meetings, public speaking and networking are all activities that are geared towards the extrovert’s need for stimulation, while introverts struggle to make themselves seen and maintain their energy reserves.
Our response to the coronavirus pandemic means that society has changed overnight, reshaped to suit a more introverted way of being – one that is rarely permitted – of thriving in a quiet setting, having time to think and be creative, and having control over how much socialising you do. No social experiment could have gone this far in modelling a way of living designed almost exclusively for introverts. It may just show employers that, as Cain says in her 2012 Ted talk, “when it comes to creativity and leadership, we need introverts doing what they do best.”
“There is zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas,” she says. “And I mean zero. We could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often.”
Tiwari hopes that this episode of upheaval will cause a long-term shift in working culture that could not come soon enough for introverts. “Introverts often enjoy having their own space to process ideas and work undistracted,” she says. “The lockdown is proving that working from home and being in one’s own space is not to the detriment of wider business interests and can, in fact, lead to a boost in productivity and wellbeing.”
Tiwari believes that extroverts and introverts can cope with this strange time together, so long as they respect their differences. “Being one or the other doesn’t preclude you from sharing interests and being cosy together,” she says. “It just means that you may need to be extra conscious of each other’s needs. Extroverts may be surprised at how much they enjoy this quieter time, while introverts may find themselves craving the company of others. Don’t overthink how you label yourself. Follow your intuitive sense for what you need right now.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chloë Sevigny: unafraid of going her own way over lockdown etiquette</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is a famous scene in the first episode of Friends in which Ross says: “I just want to be married again” and Rachel runs into Central Perk, right at that moment, wearing a wedding dress. “And I just want a million dollars,” Chandler quips, holding out his hands.
A few weeks ago, before the lockdown, I wrote about how I had tried to revive the old-fashioned phone call, wondering if ringing people for a chat might make a comeback. I missed the human connection of talking and when texting became our primary mode of communication, I felt the absence of a simple natter keenly.
And I just want a million dollars. Six weeks in and here we are. We phone, we FaceTime, we Zoom, we Houseparty. I even did a Skype. In the absence of face-to-face human connection, the videocall is king. In her cover interview with The Cut last week, Chloë Sevigny admitted that she had not previously been a fan of videocalling. “It’s always so terribly unflattering,” she said. Still, needs must and Sevigny admitted that under lockdown she now FaceTimes her friends.
The necessary shift from the total remove of texting to seeing people during almost every communication is like popping out for one quiet drink and returning home several nights later with a buttock tattoo and a new nickname that ends in “dawg”. It is a sensory overload, a 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds. Before social distancing, I tended to FaceTime only children, because it is hard to pull faces at kids using just audio. Now, almost everyone expects a videocall, no matter how old. (The face pulling is less in demand.)
It requires some adjustment, not so much because it’s unflattering, but because the usual rules of communication no longer apply. How does a conversation between more than two people suddenly seem like a finals-week-of-Strictly manoeuvre? In real life, it just sort of flows. On screen, it’s a “no, after you” comedy of manners. Where does one angle the camera? Up, it seems: recently, a judge in Florida had to remind lawyers to dress appropriately during virtual hearings; one man appeared topless, a woman while still in bed, under the sheets.
More importantly, how does anyone manage to end a videocall without seeming rude? Ordinarily, I’d go for a “sorry, reception’s bad”, but that’s impossible to pull off when your bad acting is right there on display. Even Sevigny knows where to draw the line. “I’m not doing any Zoom parties,” she said.
Over the last few weeks, watching a series all about travelling prodigious distances and exploring the wonders of this planet should have seemed as appealing as squeezing lemon juice into a paper cut, but Race Across the World has been one of the loveliest television shows in ages.
During the first of the BBC Two series, five teams had to make their way from London to Singapore by land, without smartphones, using only the cash equivalent of the airfare. This time, the teams had to travel the length of South America, from Mexico City to Ushuaia at the tail end of Argentina.
The finale was astoundingly tense, but when uncle and nephew team Emon and Jamiul Choudhury signed their names in the book first – 20 seconds ahead of the runners-up – it was hard to deny they deserved the win. They pulled it off by bartering MP3 players and ditching their bags before running up the final hill. But what made it the most life-affirming show I’ve seen all year was that the winners were so affected by seeing children sleeping rough in the streets in Brazil’s São Paulo that they donated half of their £20,000 prize fund to charity. They have since pledged another £5,000 to an orphanage in Bangladesh. I already thought it was Hunted for nice people and then they hit us with that.
In the chaos of our present lives, watching people become more self-sufficient than they thought possible was almost as joyful as watching how much strangers can be willing to support each other when they really need to. As a series, this was a convincing advert for fundamental human decency. I thought University Challenge ending would be the biggest blow but now that Race Across the World is gone, too, I don’t know how I’ll manage.
I imagine that one day there will be a corner of the internet that caters to everyone’s wildest dreams, no matter how niche. Last week, my corner appeared. During Take Me to the World, the online celebrations for Stephen Sondheim’s 90th birthday, a title card appeared, reading “The Ladies Who Lunch/Company”. The musical Company is having a bit of a moment – not only was the gender-flipped West End revival, which turned Bobby into Bobbie, a deserved smash in 2018, but Adam Driver gave new breath to Being Alive in the film Marriage Story, belting out an intense rendition that could only be described as very dedicated.
This performance of The Ladies Who Lunch began with the inimitable Christine Baranski pouring herself a glass of red and it only got better: on a Zoom call, Baranski’s Mamma Mia! co-star Meryl Streep appeared, mixing herself a martini, then Baranski’s The Good Fight co-star Audra McDonald joined in the fun. I thought Britney Spears casually letting it be known via Instagram that she had burned down her gym (“I had some candles, and, yeah, one thing led to another”) would be the best thing on the internet last week, but no, it was three icons, singing the line “another vodka stinger”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Studios bypass cinemas with lucrative lockdown premieres</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls may turn out to be the most important film in recent Hollywood history. Trolls World Tour, which has become a lockdown hit, notching up digital sales of $100m (£80m) in three weeks, has become the focal point of a battle that could forever change moviegoing habits in the Netflix era.
With cinemas closed, Hollywood studios are challenging the sacrosanct tradition that multiplexes air films first for up to three months, before their release on other platforms such as pay-TV, DVD and streaming. Instead, they are pushing new films straight to fans at home.
Universal Pictures has been the most aggressive of the Hollywood studios with its strategy for Trolls World Tour. The film had been due for a global cinema release on 10 April, but instead became the most high-profile movie to be made available solely on digital services such as Amazon’s Prime Video at £15.99 ($19.99).
Universal gets a greater cut of revenue from digital services than at the box office, which means the film has made the same amount of profit in its first three weeks as the first Trolls film did during its entire five-month run in US cinemas.
Emboldened by its success, last week the company indicated that it would collapse the cinema release window by releasing films digitally at the same time. “As soon as theatres reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats,” said Jeff Shell, the chief executive of parent company NBCUniversal.
Those comments immediately prompted the world’s two biggest cinema operators – AMC, which owns the Odeon chain in the UK, and Cineworld – to issue a global ban on screenings of all films from the maker of the Fast & Furious and Jurassic World franchises when business restarts. The operators accused Universal of “breaking the business model” that has underpinned the Hollywood movie system for generations.
“Universal has cast the first stone,” said Jeff Bock, an analyst at research firm Exhibitor Relations. “This is exactly what the theatrical exhibition world had always feared – proof that bypassing theatres could be a viable model of distribution for studios. Like it or not, the floodgates have opened. This is just the beginning, and the longer it takes for theatres to open on a worldwide scale, we’re going to see the PVOD [premium video on demand] schedule become more and more populated.”
That schedule is now filling up. Universal announced last week that Judd Apatow’s new comedy The King of Staten Island would scrap its planned cinema release on 19 June and premiere on-demand instead. And Warner Bros is doing the same with Scoob!, the first full-length animated Scooby-Doo film, which was meant to hit cinemas on 15 May.
However, when it comes to true blockbusters, Hollywood studios, including Universal, are so far choosing to keep them in cinemas and reschedule their releases. The straight-to-digital strategy is only considered to be viable for mid- and lower-budget films forecast to earn at most a few hundred million at the global box office. The first Trolls film made $346m worldwide.
Disney’s Mulan and Black Widow, the James Bond film No Time To Die, Warner Bros’s Wonder Woman 1984and Universal’s Minionssequel – all potential $1bn-plus hits – are just some of the titles that have been shifted to later this year with a cinema release still firmly in mind.
Global box-office revenues hit an all-time record of $42bn last year, dominated by blockbusters including Avengers: Endgame. Theatrical release represents a huge slice of income that is difficult for studios to ignore. When a film’s big-screen run is finished, there is a second wave of income from digital and on-demand services; this double-window revenue stream would disappear if multiplexes were taken out of the equation.
“Studios are not releasing ‘tier one’ titles on PVOD,” said Richard Broughton, analyst at research firm Ampere. “It’s unlikely that PVOD will be able to replace theatrical revenues for these titles. PVOD releases would also likely cannibalise secondary windows. If you rent a film for £15.99, you’re not then going to rent it again for £5.99 a few months later. But you might do that if you had seen it at the cinema first.”
There are also other issues making a total shift away from cinemas unlikely, for now at least. China, for example, along with many developing countries, has a tiny digital-video rental market, which would severely limit income from direct digital releases, whereas it boasts the world’s second-biggest cinema box office market, at $9bn a year.
And with PVOD releases such as Trolls priced at $19.99, it is unlikely that the strategy will work outside high-income markets such as the US and the UK.
However, coronavirus has sideswiped cinema chains, which means direct-to-digital successes such as Trolls give studios more leverage. “Trolls is operating under optimal conditions – lockdown, kids at home and limited competing media,” says Broughton. “Having said this, the success of Trolls does offer studios leverage with cinema owners for a greater share of box office income for secondary titles. The option of the PVOD window improves their positioning.”
Unless Covid-19 causes longer-term closures or serious attendance issues in cinemas, the chains remain confident they will return to the top of the pecking order for film releases.
“These circumstances will not persist and should not be taken by anyone as a sign of lasting change,” said Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, the national trade body for cinema operators.
“We are absolutely confident that when cinemas are able to reopen safely, the public will once again respond to the unsurpassable big-screen experience. After people have been required to spend weeks and sometimes months in lockdown, it seems unlikely, to say the least, that the first response of many will be ‘let’s stay in and watch a film.’”
But if audiences do decide to bypass cinemas and stay in, Hollywood studios will have to follow them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Show your mettle: Victoria Cross not made of captured Russian guns after all</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Victoria Cross, or VC as it is popularly known, is the most cherished award in the British armed forces, awarded since 1857 for courage displayed “in the presence of the enemy”.
Its long history is filled with true stories of great bravery. But one long-held belief – that Victoria Cross medals were made from enemy guns captured during the Crimean war against Russia – is unlikely to be true, and originated instead from speculation in the press, according to new research.
Instituted by Queen Victoria, the Victoria Cross is Britain’s highest award for valour in war and has been awarded 1,358 times.
Dr Andrew Marriott, a retired lieutenant colonel and visiting researcher at Newcastle University, has concluded that it is “highly implausible” that the medals came from Russian guns after the victory at the siege of Sevastapol in 1855. His research led him to a newspaper report at the time, asserting that they did come from the captured guns. He also found a letter in the Times from a Crimean veteran suggesting the same thing, and so, he says, the myth was born.
Using x-ray fluorescence scans to examine the composition of Victoria Cross medals from 1856 to 2013, the research showed that part-way through the first world war, and again during the second world war, there were noticeable changes in composition, when compared with the 19th-century medals.
“Although we know that Queen Victoria decreed that the new honour be cast from bronze, there is no evidence to suggest that she wanted captured weapons from Sevastopol to be used for this purpose,” Marriott said.
“Like many at the time, the Queen saw little to celebrate from the victory at Sevastopol, and had displayed little interest in the captured Russian ordnance. The only contemporary record of a Sevastopol connection is a newspaper report of the medal ceremony in Hyde Park in 1857. The correspondent most likely conflated various stories circulating about the redistribution and recycling of captured Crimean guns.”
The 64-year-old, who spent 30 years in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, explained that Hancocks Jewellers in London has been the sole producer of the medal since its inception.
But during the first world war, Hancocks was forced to ask the War Office for a resupply of metal and, believing the myth that had been created, they turned to captured guns.
Marriott said: “Hancocks were running out of metal so asked the War Office for a resupply and it’s probable that staff in the War Office, who were probably thinking about other things than the Victoria Cross, looked at each other and asked, where do you get this metal from? By then there would have been a tradition about Sevastopol guns, so a delegation would have been sent to cut off bits of guns to supply to Hancocks.”
The current source of Victoria Cross metal is thought to be a cascabel – the round protrusion at the back of a cannon – stored at a Ministry of Defence depot in Donnington, Shropshire. Published in Post-Medieval Archaeology, the research found historical evidence that this cascabel may have been taken from a gun captured during the second Anglo-Chinese war of 1860, three years after the first Victoria Cross awards were made.
“While it’s unlikely that even the earliest medals came from the ordnance captured at Sevastopol, it is clear that most of the VCs awarded since the first world war have plausibly been sourced from the cascabels of captured guns – an important and symbolic fact for those who have received the honour in recognition of their bravery,” Marriott said.
The medal was awarded to 627 recipients in the first world war and to 181 in the second world war. The most recent person to receive it was Joshua Leakey from the Parachute Regiment for his involvement in a raid in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.
•Jack Cornwell was posthumously awarded the VC after he died aged 16 following the Battle of Jutland in the first world war.
•Sir Philip Neame, who was awarded a Victoria Cross during fighting in France in the first world war, would go on to win an Olympic gold medal in the Running Deer competition before serving again in the second world war.
•Andrew Fitzgibbon was an Irish soldier and thought to be the youngest recipient after being awarded it aged 15 during the third China war in 1860.
•Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse was the only double recipient from the first world war after rescuing men in no-man’s land during the Battle of Guillemont and then again in the offensive at Passchendaele.
The Lord Ashcroft gallery in the Imperial War Museum has over 200 Victoria Cross medals on display

    <h5 class="mb-1">Richard Francis Burton … dashing explorer of the exotic and erotic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Passport detailsSir Richard Francis Burton, geographer, translator, writer, soldier, orientalist, cartographer, ethnologist, spy, linguist, poet, fencer and diplomat.
Claim to fameIt says something about the shallowness of celebrity that a polylingual, dashing, brave, randy scholar who travelled through East Africa to try to find the source of Nile, translated The Arabian Nights into English and had the chutzpah to visit Mecca is overshadowed by a Welsh actor of the same name (with an admittedly nice speaking voice) who married Elizabeth Taylor a lot.
Supporting documentationBurton, who was born in Torquay in 1821, lived a life of barely credible derring-do, which he recorded in dozens of books and articles. He was particularly interested in the contrast between Victorian prudery and the attitudes of other cultures towards sex and sexual morality. He translated various books of erotica into English. This and his general irascibility made him a controversial figure and hampered his subsequent career as a diplomat. However, a series of army postings gave him the chance for more travel and the time to work on his literary endeavours: the most famous of which is his multi-volume translation of One Thousand And One Nights.
His most noteworthy expeditions were the ill-fated trips to the Horn of Africa (his team was set upon by Somali nomads and Burton’s face was impaled by a javelin); the failed attempt to discover the source of the Nile — Burton ended up too sick to continue; and the insanely risky visit to Mecca, which he undertook in disguise: “a hasty action, a misjudged word … And my bones would have whitened the desert sand”. He also visited Iceland and lived for spells in Brazil, Damascus and Trieste.
Distinguishing markWith his lush facial hair and stern physiognomy, Burton was the physical archetype of the Victorian explorer. Yet, he seems to have been sceptical about the British imperial project. His undoubted superpower was an ability to learn languages. He claimed to have developed a system that enabled him to master most languages in a couple of weeks and could speak dozens, including German, Urdu, Marathi, Greek and Arabic. However, he admitted defeat in his attempts to learn Russian.
Last sightedIn death, Burton even managed to bring a whiff of orientalism to the buttoned-up London cemetery in Mortlake. The mausoleum he shares with his wife Isabel is a marble tent with a ladder in the back that leads up to a small window. Through it, you can see the great explorer’s dusty coffin surrounded by knick-knacks brought back from his trips overseas.
Intrepidness ratingThe trip along the Nile almost killed him and the trip to Mecca would have led to his execution if his true identity had been discovered. So 9/10.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Assistant review – eloquent sexual harassment drama</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A performance of few words but immense physical eloquence by Julia Garner anchors this impressively chilling #MeToo-era drama about workplace harassment and abuse. Following a day in the life of a young woman with dreams of making her mark in the film and television industry, it’s a sobering portrait of a dirty little secret that was brought into the news spotlight by the Harvey Weinstein scandal. All the more powerful for its understated tone, this low-key piece packs a hefty punch as it exposes the web of silence that enabled a very modern horror story.
Garner (who won an Emmy for her work on TV’s Ozark) is Jane, a high-achieving college graduate who finds herself on the bottom rung of the ladder as a junior assistant to an unnamed entertainment mogul in New York. The appointment may hold promises of great opportunities ahead, but for now it’s fairly soul destroying. An opening sequence, played out to the lonely strains of Tamar-kali’s sparse score, finds Jane being driven to the office before dawn, turning on the lights above her colleagues’ desks – first in, last out. Her tasks are menial yet weirdly demanding: making coffee, changing the paper in the photocopier, ordering lunch, and arranging travel and accommodation for an ever-changing roster of offhand executives and needy clients.
When her boss is out of the office Jane discreetly cleans his lair, sweeping powdered detritus from his desk, removing used syringes from his waste bin, picking suspiciously abandoned earrings out of the carpet, even scrubbing stains off the couch – a subject of ribald office banter. It’s clear from the outset that he’s a grotesque philanderer (and worse), leaving Jane to field increasingly irate calls from his wife (“I’m not going to lie for him”), then getting yelled at down the phone for “interfering” in his “personal affairs”. During the course of a single day in which she does nothing but pander to his needs, we watch Jane write two separate apologetic emails, both of which include the humiliating assurance that she will not “let you down again”.
The demoralising effect of such Kafkaesque torment is, of course, entirely deliberate, deployed with practised ease to wrongfoot and disorientate. While the sight of Jane being yelled at on the phone may be distressing, even more sinister is the email that follows, assuring her that she’s being treated harshly because she’s “good”, but could be “great”. Later, when a driver tells Jane that her boss thinks she’s “smart”, this downtrodden assistant is almost pathetically grateful for the secondhand compliment. Crucially, both the abuse and the praise are forms of attack, working in tandem to undermine Jane’s self-confidence, ensuring that she remains in her place, eager to please and placate.
Originally envisaged as a work of “scripted nonfiction”, this insightful film by Kitty Green (who made the documentaries Ukraine Is Not a Brotheland Casting JonBenet) mutated into a drama inspired by the real-life stories of women working in the film and TV industry. The result may be fiction, but everything about it rings true, from the slight shabbiness of the office, which has no hint of old-school movie glamour, to the day-to-day bullying practised by Jane’s workmates, who know that this is what’s needed to succeed. Within this toxic ecosystem, no one is interested in Jane’s tentatively voiced concerns for a vulnerable young girl who’s just been flown in from Boise, Idaho, and who seems primed to become her predatory boss’s next victim. In a scene of skin-crawling smarminess, Jane’s tentative complaints are sideswiped by the slimy HR exec Wilcock (Matthew Macfadyen), who implies that she’s motivated by jealousy and hysteria but offhandedly reassures Jane that she’s safe because “you’re not his type”.
Brilliantly, Green opts to keep the monster at the centre of this labyrinth off screen, the presence of Jane’s faceless boss registered mainly by the sound of his laughter and screams seeping through closed doors and down telephone lines. It’s an astute choice that lends a universality to this unseen spectre, focusing our attention instead on the trickle-down toxicity of his regime, enabling his crimes, silencing his enemies, turning his underlings into de facto accomplices. Astutely, Green shows us how the boss’s behavioural mantle has been adopted by everyone in this workplace, creating a culture in which covert aggression and harassment are just business as usual.
It’s a credit to Garner that, as a character who effectively has no voice, she manages to say so much about Jane’s predicament through posture, pose and gesture; the way she seems constantly uneasy in her office chair; the fleeting glimpse of alarm in her eyes at the sound of a ringing phone; the slump of exhausted defeat that accompanies her lonely late-night sandwich. The weight of the world is on her shoulders, and thanks to Garner’s nuanced performance and Green’s skilful direction, we feel it upon ours too.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antony & CleopatraA tremendous cast ensured that the huge Olivier was sold out for Simon Godwin’s modern-dress production two years ago. Ralph Fiennes and Sophie Okonedo star as the lovers, with strong support from Katy Stephens as Agrippa and Tim McMullan as a revelatory Enobarbus. Available to stream for seven days from Thursday, 7pm on the National Theatre’s YouTube channel. Susannah Clapp
What the Butler Saw“Society is presented as a madhouse controlled by lunatics” – the late, great theatre scholar Christopher Innescould be describing today’s news programmes. In fact, he’s referring to Joe Orton’s wild farces, with their outrageous humour and anarchic energy. This 2017 production, from Curve, Leicester and Theatre Royal Bath, marked the 50th anniversary of the playwright’s death. The subtitled recording, available at curveonline.co.uk for the duration of lockdown, captures a live performance, using a single, static camera: simple, but so effective. Clare Brennan
Hayley Williams’ albumParamore’s erstwhile frontwoman embraces left-field pop on her “very necessary” solo debut, Petals for Armor, in which she tackles depression and accountability. Out on Friday (8 May). Kitty Empire
The Listening Service: Talking in MusicTom Service dives deep into the place where talking and singing meet. Crossing genres, the programme flits from Mozart to hip-hop via the timeless swagger of Sprechgesang (“speech-singing”) and how minimalist composer Steve Reich co-opts spoken words into melodies. Today, Radio 3, 5pm. KE
Sound Walk to Hay-on-WyeTake a screen break with a four-hour Bank Holiday virtual ramble: 10 miles along Offa’s Dyke and the Black Mountain ridge, with orchestral music by Welsh composers William Mathias and Alun Hoddinott, plus poetry and folk song, presented by Horatio Clare. Slow radio at its best. Friday 8 May, BBC Radio 3, from 1pm. Fiona Maddocks

James Acaster’s Perfect SoundsOn this new podcast, comedian James Acaster tries to convince other invited comedians that 2016 was the best year for music. Echoing sentiments from his book Perfect Sound Whatever, which he wrote after a breakup rekindled his love of pop music, each episode looks at a different album, from Beyoncé’s Lemonade to David Bowie’s Black Star. Friday, BBC Sounds. Kadish Morris

    <h5 class="mb-1">It's boom time for podcasts – but will going mainstream kill the magic?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hello friends! Do you fancy listening to “a new type of time-shifted amateur radio”? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do.
Fifteen years ago, Macworld, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence Macworld’s “time-shifted radio” definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are – well, that wasn’t quite happening. So Apple’s move didn’t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added “podcast” to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of In Our Time). Podcasts were new. It takes time for the new to become everyday.
Podcasts were mostly unheard of, except by the tech savvy. They were either downloadableversions of existing radio shows or they were chatty riffs, made by amateurs who knew how to upload their aural blogs online. Still, they were interesting. At least to me. Soon after podcasts’ iTunes debut, I started a new job as the Observer’s radio critic. Great job – except there was a limited choice of programmes for me to review. Radio schedules rarely changed. Presenters stayed in their jobs for years. The BBC dominated speech radio, aside from phone-ins; hardly any other broadcaster had the money to make documentaries or drama.
Podcasts rescued me from aural monotony; I wrote my first piece about them in the summer of 2006. Apparently Coke Machine Glow and The Dawn and Drew Show were the ones to look out for (me neither, now). The podcast I do recall from then is The Ricky Gervais Show; this dominated the brand new iTunes podcast chart for weeks. Initially free, in early 2006 it switched to a pay-per-listen model and proved both a forerunner and an outlier: since then, much podcast uptake has been driven by comedy, but most shows are still free to listeners, paid for by adverts that appear during episodes.
Today, the iTunes podcast chart is bustling with old hands and new kids on the block. Here are No Such Thing As a Fish, Fearne Cotton’s Happy Place, That Peter Crouch Podcast, Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything. Here are sections for new and noteworthy, cultivating calm, keeping the kids busy. There are lists of the top 10 episodes, top 10 shows; all aside from the 19 other regular categories: news, arts, true crime… So many podcasts! There are oodles of shows, too many to ever get through.
This is podcasting’s boom time. There are now more than 900,000 podcasts to choose from. In the US, 22% of the population listens to at least one podcast every week and 51% to at least one podcast in their life (roughly 168 million people). In the UK, 12.5% of us (about 7.1 million people) listen to podcasts weekly, up 58% in the past two years.And on average, those UK podcast fans are hoovering up approximately seven podcasts a week. Even throughout lockdown, when other art forms closed or stopped producing, podcasts have continued to grow. The big shows just got bigger.
Podcasts have taken off across the world. In South Korea, 58% of the population has listened to a podcast in the past month –more than 30 million people – while in Spain the figure is 40% (more than 18.5million). And there’s evidence that our ever-expanding love of listening is part of a wider shift to audio. Recently, a media analyst gave a talk about about current and upcoming trends. He noted that car radios are digital, speakers can be blue-toothed, in-ear headphones are more and more popular (Apple sold an estimated 60 million pairs of its wireless AirPods last year), as are home AI systems with Alexa and Google Home. We’re absorbing more content through our ears than ever before, he said, because we can do other things as we listen and in the future, as smart headphones get smarter, our ears, rather than our eyes, may well become the main way we connect to the internet.
Still, that’s the future. For now, perhaps the biggest indicator that podcasts are having their moment is the way big players are moving in, whether brands or celebrities.In 2019, Spotify made an eye-watering financial investment, buying Gimlet Media and Parcast (which make podcasts), as well as Anchor (which provides tools for podcast makers), for a combined stake of more than £320m. Universal has done a deal with Wondery, the American true-crime specialist that produced Dirty John. Sony has a similar deal with Somethin’ Else, which makes David Tennant Does a Podcast With… The BBC, now relieved by its regulatorof previous restrictions around podcasts, is throwing all efforts at BBC Sounds, its audio app and podcast platform. Going where Jessie Ware, Fearne Cotton and George Ezra have successfully gone before, Sue Perkins, Bradley Wiggins, Matt Lucas and the two doctors from Scrubshave all got new podcasts. The Obamas signed up to produce exclusive podcasts for Spotify. Even Kim Kardashian is dropping hints.
“Yes, I would say we’re in the podcast gold rush years,” says Matt Deegan, who co-runs the British Podcast awards, as well as overseeing shows such as the Fun Kids’podcasts. “But it can definitely get even bigger. Compared with the millions who use TV, or YouTube, or Instagram, podcasting’s numbers are small…”
For quite some time, podcast fans have been of a type: educated Apple users who want to be entertained, but intelligently. (Observer readers, essentially.) There is a massive mainstream audience as yet untapped, though some shows are making inroads; podcasts that discuss popular TV programmes, old and new, are a burgeoning area. So, room for expansion. The questions are: how big can podcasting get? And which shows will get left behind?
Helen Zaltzman, who hosts and produces The Allusionist – and, since 2007, the immensely popular Answer Me This! with Olly Mann – thinks that big companies could bring some more trust to the medium. “Their investment demonstrates that podcasting isn’t just made by amateurs in a garage,” she says.
But the independence of podcasting, the wild and wonderfulness of its offerings, its glorious niche-ness, where someone with a great idea or mad obsession can make a small show that turns into a roaring success… Zaltzman worries that this will be “steamrollered by big, bland chat series with enormous marketing budgets”. This would be, at the very least, galling. After all, without 99% Invisible there would be no Impaulsive with Logan Paul; without Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review, no Gemma Collins Podcast. Outliers light the way for the popular.
Today, in the UK, we mostly get our aural hits via Apple, BBC Sounds, Spotify and – this may sound weird to some – YouTube. Listeners under 35 use YouTube more than any other platform to get their podcasts, often listening while doing other things, such as playing computer games (Joe Rogan, one of the world’s most successful podcasters, with 8 million subscribers, is most often accessed on YouTube). YouTubers are moving into podcasting, by the way: football YouTube sensation Miniminter has a new podcast, as does JaackMaate.
Some podcasting history. For quite a few years, like many others, I found my podcasts via websites and through iTunes. This required me to be near my laptop, though I could download shows on to my creaky iPod (iPhones didn’t come along until 2007; I got my first in 2011). Podcasting’s accessibility was a problem: there were great shows out there, but most people had no idea how to get them.
It’s unusual to have brilliant content without a convenient platform – it’s like a great chef without a restaurant – and it’s this mismatch that has long held podcasting back. Usually, the platform exists, the content grows to fill it and then both grow together. But podcasts existed for ages before they were truly easy to hear. It wasn’t until 2012, when Apple put a standalone podcast app on its iPhones, that podcasts became easily accessible (for iPhone users) and podcasting started to take off in the UK. Soon after, 4G and more widespread wifi made it possible to hear a podcast wherever you were.
Then, in 2014, Serial came out. This who-really-dunnit re-examination of a cold case murder, led by This American Life veteran Sarah Koenig, massively boosted podcasting’s profile. In every English-speaking country, there is evidence of “the Serial effect” and the show also gave podcasting an identifiable style for a few years, one where the presenter showed their workings in their commentary (what we might call the “I get that. But I still wanted to know…” style). In 2015, My Dad Wrote a Porno became another enormous UK hit and advertisers – other than early adopters Squarespace – started to take note. Brexitcast brought in a lot of new listeners in 2017, as did That Peter Crouch Podcast in 2018 and Shagged Married Annoyed last year.
But still, if we’re honest, podcasts have been The Next Big Thing ever since I’ve been writing about them and their reaching the mainstream has been a stop-start process. Even now, there are plenty of people who don’t listen and many who have only just started. Why? Access. The problem – still – is how podcasts are delivered.
“There’s no perfect app for podcasts,” says Zaltzman. “They are all a bit clunky, because they’re free, so there’s no real reason to make them great. The people who make the apps don’t make their own podcasts, they just host other people’s work.”
This is changing. After Spotify’s splashy podcasting entrance, Gimlet is now busily making shows for the streaming service. BBC Sounds hosts BBC podcasts, but has promised to expand to hosting other shows in the future. (During the coronavirus pandemic, it has agreed to host Fun Kids’ excellent Stuck@Home.) In the US, Luminary, which hoped to be the Netflix of podcasting (ie a subscription model), had a bumpy launch in 2019, with several established shows pulling out from being on the network. But it undoubtedly made some big signings, including Russell Brand’s Under the Skin,The Receipts Podcast and Love + Radio, and it makes its own shows with celebrities such as Trevor Noah and Karamo Brown from Queer Eye. (The subscription model might seem an obvious way for podcasts to go, but faces reluctance from listeners used to getting podcasts for free while suffering the adverts that pay for them.)
Matt Hartman, who works for Betaworks, an American startup studio and venture capitalist company that invested in Gimlet in 2014, points out that most podcast apps just do the same thing: “Let people search for and subscribe to shows and that’s it.” He says, diplomatically, that he is “looking forward” to app innovation, mentioning Breaker as an app that’s different: it’s well laid out, has social functions, lets you search for individual episodes and automatically imports all your existing podcast subscriptions. (Breaker is also easy for podcasters to use and gives more listening information, which apps have previously been reluctant to hand out.)
But at the moment, Apple’s basic Podcast app dominates in the UK. This is despite the fact that most people don’t own iPhones. Android phone users have various ways to get podcasts, though it took until 2018 for Google to put out Google Podcasts (before that, you had to go via Google Play). Now, Google Podcasts can be used on iPhones too and you can search for individual phrases within shows. There are other apps: Podcast Player, Pocket Casts (which charges a one-off fee), Stitcher, Castbox. So many, but unless Google Podcasts catches on, Spotify seems to be the most likely to threaten Apple’s dominance.
And the iTunes podcast chart, with its incomprehensible algorithms, is still where podcasters want to be, though the chart doesn’t work in quite the same way as the UK’s Top 40. Instead, says Deegan, “it’s about momentum”. Momentum means a new show can make a splash and enter the iTunes top 10. The real talent is in making that show stick and, of course, making money from it. Such mainstream hits as The High Low, Peter Crouch, The Receipts, David Tennant…, The Adam Buxton Podcast and My Dad Wrote a Porno act as starter programmes. Once people listen and love them, they are more likely to try others.
Yet our podcasting industry is a couple of years behind the US. Partly, this is because of our thriving radio sector; as Zaltzman points out, given the choice between a regular paid job at BBC radio and the uncertain economics of podcasting, many producers opt for the former. Things are changing, though: the BBC is losing its audio dominance, at least among young people. Other broadcasters have been quick to launch podcasts, or their own app (Global’s is good), and Deegan knows of many podcasters, “brilliant broadcasters”, who have never worked in radio.
Andrew Harrison, who runs a small podcasting company, Podmasters, is one of those. Having worked for nearly 30 years in magazines, he started making podcasts in 2016. One of them – Remainiacs, an anti-Brexit show that pulls in several big players, including Tony Blair – became a hit, and, from that, the company has launched political show The Bunker and started producing other people’s podcasts. What Harrison likes, he says, is the direct nature of podcasting. All the investment is in the show, he explains: there are no printing or distribution costs, no investment in drama scripts and in building sets. “We put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows,” he says. “And then we just wind them up, let them go, record and edit and get the show out to listeners.”
A simple process: idea, execution, direct delivery to consumer. Several podcast producers and presenters I talk to contrast this with the traditional teeth-pulling procedure of making shows for the BBC. There, you “sit down in front of a Rupert and listen as your great idea is tweaked to within an inch of its life and then proposed as a vehicle for Sue Perkins or Romesh Ranganathan,” says one producer. “Why bother?”
Presenters don’t have it easy, either: one high-profile BBC host has been promised a podcast for the past two years, yet every suggestion they make for a show is rejected. No wonder BBC regulars such as Clara Amfo, Annie Mac and Clare Balding have recently brought out podcasts independently.
So, we’re getting more British podcasts. Perhaps we’ll catch up to the US soon? Deegan isn’t so sure. He says the main reason UK podcasts don’t smash the American market is that “Britain doesn’t have celebrities that Americans have heard of. David Tennant’s podcast has done well, because Americans know who he is.” No doubt if Tom Holland or Idris Elba decided to make a podcast, it would go down brilliantly. But as podcasts move into the mainstream, they need mainstream stars to move with them.
There is an argument, though, that niche is where it’s at, especially when niche goes big. The most popular podcasts in the UK are made by enthusiasts, from Kermode and Mayo to My Dad Wrote a Porno. Jamie Morton, with his other MDWAP hosts, James Cooper and Alice Levine, has now done a full world tour twice, selling out the Sydney Opera House and New York’s Radio City Music Hall. Still, he says that when he moved into a new house recently, he had to explain to his neighbour what he did, “which was embarrassing. They didn’t know what a podcast was and the title was a bit… suspect.”
This combination of being under the radar for most people, but popular enough to sell out the Albert Hall, demonstrates the Big Niche appeal of podcasting. Morton describes MDWAP events as being “like Comic Con: fans dress up as characters, they come by themselves and make friends when they’re at the show”. Podcasting appears to be going through the same arc as YouTube, in that its oldest stars have grown themselves by getting in early and posting regularly on an untested platform. Like YouTubers, the most popular podcasters, who draw huge audiences to their live shows, are able to walk around unnoticed by the vast majority of the population. Real celebrities – film stars, singers, chatshow hosts – come in later.
So, can Big Niche go Big Big? Perhaps not. First, podcasts don’t really do music very well, due to rights issues. And second, they have always been about individual listening, on headphones. It’s emphatically not a shared experience, listening to a podcast. Which is why many people find it hard to convert. They want a voice chuntering in the background, not someone whispering in their ear. Headphones can feel oppressive and podcasts are too intimate (or sweary!) to blast out to everyone in the room.
Podcasts, in the end, are just too personal. Too niche, whether small niche or big. Which is, of course, why we fans love them. They’re ours.

Perhaps, by now, all Rooney can do is quote Beyoncé: “You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation.” Now, with this stunning adaptation of Normal People, Rooney (who executive-produced, and worked on the script alongside Alice Birch and Mark O’Rowe) gets to pop another feather in her cap.
In 12 half-hour parts, directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald, the series (released as a boxset on iPlayer) comprised the slow, bumpy unfolding of the love story, from school to young adulthood, between privileged, intellectual outsider Marianne, with her poisonous homelife (a revelatory Daisy Edgar-Jones from Cold Feet), and jock-with-hinterland Connell (Paul Mescal, making a dazzling TV debut).
Early scenes in County Sligo capture the suffocating aspects of small-town life, with Sarah Greene superb as Connell’s mum (who is Marianne’s mother’s cleaner). While Connell at first hides his sexual relationship with Marianne from friends (Marianne’s pitiful acquiescence reeking of deep damage), the tables turn as he struggles and she thrives at Trinity College Dublin.
Some elements jarred. Marianne’s supposed transformation from Plain Jane to University Goddess was hampered by Edgar-Jones’s obvious gorgeousness. Marianne’s sexual masochism (hands tied half-heartedly with a scarf) was less than convincing. Elsewhere, elements of Connell’s working-class background felt more boxticked than credible, while Marianne’s absurdly luxuriant Trinity lifestyle made you question how she ended up going to the same school as Connell.
Nevertheless, Normal People emerged as a naturalistic masterclass in emotional depth and cerebral elegance. While there were too many overextended sex scenes, they were true to the book, and, with an intimacy coordinator on board, both respectful and realistic.
Moreover, the leads were heart-stopping. In their hands, you believed in Marianne and Connell’s on-off bond, but also how that gravitational pull wrecked their other (good and bad) relationships. You were convinced by their myriad problems, from the dark (Connell’s refusal to hit Marianne in bed), to the mundane mix-up over him leaving Dublin. Just as with the book, this was a story about barriers (class, social, emotional, intellectual, sexual), and how young love batters itself like a trapped bird against them. It was also about how sometimes people arrive to relationships broken, and then stay broken, and that just has to be OK.
The first series of another Irish drama, Blood, written by Sophie Petzal, was an engrossing whodunnit about whether a doctor, Jim (Adrian Dunbar), murdered his terminally ill wife. The second series, directed by Maurice Sweeney and Laura Way, and aired over five consecutive nights, opened with a bang, or more specifically a splash, as Jim’s daughter, Fiona (Gráinne Keenan) careered out of control in a car into a lake. When her husband (Ian Lloyd Anderson) was discovered dead in the boot of the car, suspicion immediately fell upon her, and others… including Jim.
As with his role as Ted Hastings in Line of Duty, Dunbar is a genius at ambiguous characters (you root for him, even as you wonder what the shifty-looking sod is up to). Elsewhere, in a stellar cast bristling with secrets and lies, Keenan and Anderson convinced as a couple hopelessly mired in irrevocable toxicity. At times, the show’s constant hurtling between different timezones left one feeling a tad dizzy. Still, once again Petzal proved herself undeniably adept at weaving together a complex knot of murder, family dysfunction, domestic violence, drug-dealing, lesbian love, shattered futures and more.
Other Line of Duty alumni, Stephen Graham and Daniel Mays, star in the comedy-drama Code 404, written by Daniel Peak, directed by Al Campbell. They play detective partners, one of whom, John Major (Mays) was killed in action, but then resurrected by artificial intelligence. It emerges that not only has DI Roy Carver (Graham) been involved with Major’s wife (Anna Maxwell Martin), but now, if his revitalised partner makes too many mistakes, he can be “switched off”.
As these are the kinds of roles that Mays and Graham excel in playing straight, it took a while to adjust my perceptions. It was delivered as a classic funny/straight double act, with May hurling himself into the comedy and Graham anxiously trying to contain the fallout. While Code 404 didn’t always hit the mark in this opener, the energy and enthusiasm were infectious, and with this level of talent on board I will be sticking with it.
Oh dear. US showrunner Ryan Murphy has produced some huge series – Glee, American Crime Story, Pose, The Politician, Feud: Bette and Joan. Sadly, his latest, Hollywood, is a bewildering tonal hot mess – unfunny, but not serious – despite a hardworking cast including Darren Criss, Queen Latifah, David Corenswet, Patti LuPone, Mira Sorvino, Jim Parsons, Laura Harrier, and Joe Mantello.
The series strives to be a hyperreal reimagining of postwar Hollywood – one where “baddies” (racism, homophobia, sexism) are vanquished. However, it feels glib, particularly when sexual exploitation is played for giggles, albeit mainly happening to male victims. (Maybe to fend off #MeToo criticism? Particularly with Sorvino, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, in the cast.) Hollywood looks sublime (think: NetflixLa La Land), and it’s not short of vision, with real-life figures such as Rock Hudson, Anna May Wong, and Hattie McDaniel mingling with fictional characters. A shame, then, that the ambitious production ends up dissolving in a huge foaming bath of sentimentality and schmaltz.
The opening episode of the new four-part series Museums in Quarantine saw Alistair Sooke looking around Tate Modern’s Andy Warhol retrospective, when it had just been closed by the lockdown days after it opened (subsequent episodes – still on iPlayer – include Simon Schama on the Ashmolean’s Young Rembrandt exhibition and Dr Janina Ramirez at the British Museum). The Warhol show looks fascinating, illustrating how the artist, who died in 1987, wasn’t just about his 1960s pop art and Factory period, but also a multifaceted visionary who sensed the modern world developing, and remains a truly contemporary artist today.
Certainly, with his famous quote: “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes,” Warhol has long come across as the godfather of the selfie. However, another story was playing out during this documentary: the stilled escalators, the eerie empty halls… this wasn’t about just one museum exhibition, this was about a country in quarantine, and the cultural world we’re still hungry to see.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Instagram changed our world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One day in the autumn of 2015, a small but significant change was implemented at the Instagram offices in Menlo Park, California. Employees arrived at work to discover the rubbish bins under each desk had disappeared. The bins had allowed people to work efficiently – no one had to stand up to throw away a coconut water carton or wasabi pea wrapper after they’d enjoyed the company’s free food. But the bins weren’t really Instagram’s – they were installed by Facebook, which had purchased the photo-sharing app for $1bn in 2012.
Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, didn’t like the bins. He didn’t like the cardboard boxes employees used to file papers and paraphernalia. He hated old, sagging birthday balloons. Instagram’s offices, he explained, after removing the bins, should represent its ethos. They should be beautiful, simple, pristine – much like the app itself.
Tech reporter Sarah Frier, author of No Filter: The Inside Story of How Instagram Transformed Business, Celebrity and Our Culture, explains this story is significant for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Systrom’s aesthetic sensibilities. Second, it is indicative of his frustration with Facebook. (A year earlier he had torn down motivational posters belonging to the parent company, one of which said: “Done is Better than Perfect.”) And third, while the incident obviously affected Instagram employees – they dubbed it #trashcangate – it also represented an issue facing its users, who were, Frier says, “intimidated about posting because they thought Instagram warranted perfection”.
In the decade since the invention of Instagram, social media has dramatically changed our lives. This pursuit of perfection has led to a rise in filter-inspired plastic surgery and a boom in oversized desserts that don’t fit in your mouth, but fit perfectly into a little square posted online. How did this simple photo-sharing service get 1bn users in eight years? Does Instagram create or reflect our values? And, if the former, shouldn’t we know a little more about the mindset and motivations of the men behind the app?
Frier and I talk on the phone a week before her book is published. No Filter, she says, is an omniscient narration of Instagram’s birth and growth, cobbled together from insiders’ memories. Frier interviewed a different person each day for a year after getting the book deal in 2018. Many spoke without Facebook’s permission, and the majority of her sources remain anonymous. “I realised that there was so much uncharted territory,” she says. “My editor told me a book is ready to be written when you have 100 things in your pocket that nobody else has published.” Frier surpassed this benchmark.
One anecdote recalls Systrom saving actor Ashton Kutcher from a 4am fire in a log cabin. In return, Kutcher helped Instagram grow credibility with celebs. (He hosted a party to introduce Systrom to superstars like Ariana Grande, who the Instagram CEO didn’t recognise.) Then there’s the time the Instagram team celebrated the sale to Facebook with an all-expenses trip to the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, where they were greeted with personal congratulatory notes from Ivanka Trump.
But gossip isn’t at the heart of Frier’s book and it’s the mundane stories about Systrom that are most revealing. A Stanford alumnus who, at 25, worked in marketing at Google, he founded his company with software engineer and friend Mike Krieger in 2009. His original idea was a website called Burbn, which showed people where their friends were partying in real time. The name was inspired by Systrom’s love of the whiskey. Throughout the book, Frier reveals his passion for prestige. Systrom enjoys fine drinks and bespoke bicycles – he snubbed Facebook’s free coffee by importing beans that he only used at their “peak point” (four days after roasting).
“I think that products are ultimately a reflection of their leaders,” Frier says. “He wants everything to be at a level of quality because he believes in that quality.” Systrom turned Burbn into Instagram when he realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones. But there was another problem he hoped to solve: back then, phone cameras were shoddy and took unattractive pictures. When Instagram launched, it offered filters that people could use to make their photos – and by extension, their lives – look more appealing.
From the outset, his demand for quality shifted our reality. “A filter on Instagram was like if Twitter had a button to make you more clever,” Frier says. Instagram was heavily curated in its early days. Because there are no mechanisms to go viral on the app (users can’t share posts), Instagram employees manually chose photos to push on its “Popular” page. “Instagram had a hand in it in a way none of us on the outside would ever necessarily realise,” Frier says.
For example, in 2013, one Instagram employee dedicated his time to “discovering pets”. He tracked adorable dogs, birds and lizards in a spreadsheet before highlighting them on the official @instagram page. Frier chronicles how these decisions changed real lives. Courtney Dasher, for example, was a dog owner with a cute-looking pet named Tuna. She quit her job and earned money via Instagram thanks to the decision of that employee. Dasher tells Frier that pictures of her dog helped fans cope with anxiety and depression. “The tastes of one Instagram employee directly affected the habits of the 2m people who now follow that dog,” Frier says.
How else have we been influenced by Instagram? Frier’s examples range from how we organise bookshelves by cover colour to how once rarely visited tourist destinations are now trampled underfoot. “By constantly serving users images of visually appealing lives and hobbies,” she says, Instagram forced people to “make their lives more worthy of posting about.” She notes how leisure time became a status symbol – how Instagram gradually affected the economy, as people began to value experiences over things. More of us now “pursue vacations in more picturesque settings,” Frier says, in part because pictures taken in those locations look great on the ’gram. (She links the app with nine major retailers filing for bankruptcy in the US in 2017).
And it’s not just our lives that have to look interesting on Instagram – our faces do, too. Photo-editing apps, like Facetune, have boomed in popularity. Teens slim their noses, enhance their waists and hide their spots with the help of digital editing tools. One plastic surgeon told Frier that his clients now seek impossible-to-achieve adjustments inspired by the app. Kim Kardashian, owner of the seventh most popular Instagram account (and a famously large behind) can arguably be linked to the 20,000 people in the US who had a Brazilian bum lift in 2017.
This isn’t something Systrom actually wanted. Frier says that selfies and bikini shots were against the CEO’s “artistic sensibilities”. These posts became popular despite the fact they were ignored by the official @instagram account. Yet Frier says that Instagram incentivised selfies and surgery through its metrics, if not its values. The choice to display numbers of followers and likes turned the app “into a game one could win”. In 2017 a study by the Royal Society for Public Health found that Instagram was the worst app for teens’ mental health. Was this an inevitable outcome?
Frier starts her final chapter with a quote from an anonymous Instagram executive: “Everything breaks at a billion.” Instagram reached 1bn active monthly users for the first time in June 2018. “I think at a certain point you lose control of something when it gets that big,” she says, noting that 6m accounts on Instagram now have over 1m followers. “They wanted to build a better community, but they just didn’t have the resources to do that, which is such a silly thing to say about a product that is part of a gigantic, well-sourced company, like Facebook.”
Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram in April 2012, when the app had just 13 employees and hadn’t made a single penny in profit. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for Frier’s book, sending over a single emailed quote via a PR person. “It’s simple,” he wrote, when asked why he both purchased Instagram and committed to keeping the company independent, “it was a great service and we wanted to help it grow.” Despite the fact he refused to take part in Frier’s reporting, No Filter is as much about Zuckerberg and Facebook as it is about Systrom and Instagram. (The word “Facebook” appears 1,179 times in the book, while “Instagram” appears 1,673.)
“A lot of times we think when a company has been acquired that their business story is over,” Frier says. She argues this isn’t the case here. The book chronicles the power struggles between Systrom and Zuckerberg. Frier believes Zuckerberg acquired Instagram due to his paranoia about competition. Consequently, Zuckerberg occasionally held Instagram back – after it reached 1bn users, the Facebook founder deleted a feature that automatically linked Facebook users to their friends’ Instagram pages. He also prevented the company from hiring more staff and prioritised Facebook’s content moderation over Instagram’s. Ineffective moderation allowed troubling practices – such as the sale of opioids and the proliferation of self-harm – to flourish on Instagram.
For every banal coffee bean anecdote about Systrom, there is a story that makes Zuckerberg look equally weird. In 2012, on the night the Instagram deal was finalised, the Facebook founder’s sheepdog, Beast, bit the leg of Facebook deals director Amin Zoufonoun. He later joked that Zuckerberg showed more concern for the dog than the man. On a separate occasion, Zuckerberg lost a game of Scrabble to a teenager on a corporate jet and “was so frustrated he built a computer program to find him all the word options for his letters”. He ended every staff meeting by shouting: “Domination!”
Both men have had a profound impact on our lives and yet when we criticise Instagram, we often criticise women. Articles condemning beautiful influencers for earning millions on Instagram are viral fodder. “Those stories take the airwaves and we don’t think, ‘How did we end up valuing this?’” Frier says. Though influencers are often denounced for not disclosing when they’ve been paid to promote a product, Frier traces this issue back to Systrom. The founder was so dedicated to keeping Instagram aesthetically pleasing that he didn’t want ads on the app to look like ads. (Once he even edited a brand’s picture of French fries so they looked less soggy.)
While we’re busy criticising influencers, Instagram has also avoided scrutiny in other ways. Zuckerberg was called before Congress in 2018 to answer questions about how Facebook allowed user data to be processed by the political firm Cambridge Analytica. Much was made of Facebook’s role in helping Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election after Russian troll farms targeted divisive ads at Americans. And yet, six months after Zuckerberg’s hearing, a Senate research group discovered that Russian ads had actually received more likes and comments on Instagram than Facebook. “The media spent a day writing about it, and then moved on,” Frier says.
It’s easy (and perhaps enjoyable) to think that bikini shots and Brazilian bum lifts are Instagram’s biggest impact on society – the reality is more complex. Because Zuckerberg allowed Instagram to maintain its independence, the app isn’t tainted by Facebook’s scandals. Yet ultimately, Zuckerberg still owns it – Systrom stepped down as CEO in 2018, partly because of contrasting values, partly because he wanted to return to his “creative roots”. Now, one man controls Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, a global network of 2.5bn users.
What next for Instagram? Frier says the site will continue to face moderation issues as Facebook is prioritised. She also believes advertising on Instagram will increase as Zuckerberg seeks a return on his investment. Frier also notes that the current coronavirus crisis may change the app. While some influencers are seeing their businesses crumble, others are becoming more creative by releasing books, video tutorials, workout classes and even their own filters. These changes might stick once lockdown is over.
But is this really revolutionary? “People still know the way to win at Instagram is to do something visually arresting,” Frier says. “I don’t think that’s going to go away.” From the moment Instagram introduced us to reality-adjusting filters, it changed the way we presented ourselves to the world. A striking observation in No Filter is that Instagram wanted to build a community that valued art and creativity. Instead, “they built a mall”. While much is made of beautiful influencers flogging diet pills and luxury travel on the app, everyone on Instagram is selling their life in some way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Allen obituary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Masterful drummer and co-creator of Afrobeat, the fusion of funk, jazz and African styles that he pioneered with Fela Kuti
On 12 and 13 March there were two concerts in the Church of Sound series at St James the Great Church in Clapton, east London. They were staged in the round, with both the audience and the small band of brass, keyboards and guitar circled around the star player, arguably the finest drummer on the planet.
As ever, Tony Allen looked cool and relaxed, sporting a hat and dark glasses, sitting upright with the rest of his body hardly moving as his hands and feet beat out the thrilling, complex rhythms, or “patterns” as he called them. The music came from his latest album, Rejoice, recorded with his friend Hugh Masekela, and these were to be his last shows.
Allen, who has died aged 79 of an aortic aneurysm, was the co-creator of Afrobeat, the fusion of funk, jazz and African styles that he pioneered in Nigeria alongside Fela Kuti in the late 1960s and 70s. But he had never stopped experimenting, fusing Afrobeat with dub, electronica, hip- hop or dance styles, and constantly exploring new projects, several of which involved his friend Damon Albarn. As Allen told me: “I just don’t want to be stagnant and bored. You can’t keep doing the same things.”
Born in Lagos, Nigeria, he became a musician despite much opposition from his Nigerian father, James Alabi Allen, a motor mechanic, and Ghanaian mother, Prudentia (nee Mettle), because, as he once explained, “back then, musicians were more or less thought of as beggars, or worse”.
He took up a position as a radio technician, but at night he was playing the claves with a highlife band, Sir Victor Olaiya and the Cool Cats. “It was tedious,” he said. “For three months I would finish playing and then go to work – so I was sleeping at work.”
He longed to be a drummer, and when the band’s drummer left, he had his chance “and that was it”.
He was a huge admirer of the great American jazz drummers Art Blakey and Max Roach, but was determined to create his own style. “From the beginning I was searching for my own way of playing. My beats are my beats. I never learned them from anywhere. I create them.”
He developed his style while playing with a series of highlife bands, and in 1964 he was invited to an audition by Fela, a fellow jazz fan who had been studying in London. They began playing together in the Koola Lobitos, a band that fused jazz and highlife, with the music driven by Allen’s innovative drum patterns. After touring the US they added funk to the mix and Fela began writing increasingly angry and political lyrics. Afrobeat was born.
Fela now named the band Africa 70, and Allen, who Fela said “sounded like four drummers”, was their musical director. Whether he was drumming for hours at Fela’s all-night shows at his club, The Shrine, or performing on Africa 70’s stream of classic albums, including Roforofo Fight, Yellow Fever and Kalakuta Show, he was crucial to their success.
One of Allen’s earliest and most devoted British fans was the musician and producer Brian Eno, who called him “perhaps the best drummer in the world”. He first heard his playing when he bought the Afrodisiac album (1973) “because I had never heard an African big band. I took the record home and was bowled over, and it was a while before it became clear that what was at the centre of it was Tony Allen’s drumming. I told everyone ‘You have to listen to this drummer, this is something completely new in music.’”
Allen quit the band in late 1978, angry at Fela’s increasingly chaotic lifestyle and lack of organisation, and deciding that “two captains can’t be in one ship”. He had already recorded a series of solo albums with help from Fela and Africa 70, but now he formed Afrobeat bands of his own, including the Afro Messengers, with whom he recorded No Discrimination (1979).
In 1984 he left Lagos for London, where he recorded N.E.P.A. (Never Expect Power Always), a sardonic comment on the erratic power supplies of the Nigerian National Electric Power Authority, and played with King Sunny Ade, the finest exponent of Nigerian juju styles. But Allen decided to leave Britain “because the Home Office wouldn’t give me a work permit ... it was dangerous for me to stay here”.
He moved to Paris at the end of 1985, helped by the producer Martin Meissonnier, “who arranged French papers and a contract with Barclay Records”. It would be his base for the rest of his life, and he became a French citizen with French and Nigerian passports.
The 80s proved to be a difficult period for Allen. In a Guardian interview in 2016 he described his four-year reliance on heroin. But by the 90s his life had dramatically changed for the better. Afrobeat had acquired a global popularity, and after Fela’s death in 1997 Allen was seen as the music’s torchbearer, just as he was demonstrating his enthusiasm for embracing new styles.
His 1999 album Black Voices, produced by the DJ Doctor L, mixed Afrobeat with dub and electronica, and helped Allen win over a new young following. He was helped by Albarn, who sang “Tony Allen ... really got me dancing”, on the 2000 Blur hit Music Is My Radar. Allen returned the compliment when he invited Albarn (along with the rapper Ty) to appear on his album Home Cooking (2002).
Allen continued to collaborate with Albarn for the rest of his life. In 2006 he joined Albarn in The Good, the Bad & the Queen, the band that also included Paul Simonon of the Clash, and played on their eponymous debut album (2007) and Merrie Land (2018).
When in 2007 Albarn launched his Africa Express project, bringing western and African musicians together to play at Glastonbury, Allen transformed the show, forcing the DJ Fatboy Slim to make one of his shortest appearances. When he began playing a Fela track, Allen joined in, playing live, joined by Albarn, Baaba Maal and others and the set was transformed into a glorious jam session.
The following year Africa Express were in Lagos, where Allen played with Fela’s son Femi, along with Albarn and Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and in 2012 he was part of the Africa Express team that travelled around Britain by train, performing along the route.
He was always keen to experiment and collaborate, recording with both veteran musicians and those just starting out in Nigeria on Lagos No Shaking (2006), or exploring his early jazz influences with his Tribute to Art Blakey (2017), His collaborations included work with Grace Jones, Charlotte Gainsbourg and the French trio The JazzBastards.
After finishing his tour promoting Rejoice, he had planned to record with young musicians in Nigeria, Paris, London and the US “because I want to take care of youngsters – they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat”.
And there were to be more recordings with Albarn. While he was in London in March Allen played on a new song, How Far?, by Albarn’s band Gorillaz, which has been released as a tribute. Albarn recalled Allen as having “magic in his feet and hands, joy in his heart, and genius in his mind”.
In 1987 Allen married his second wife, Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him along with their three sons, and four children from his first marriage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor obituary</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishi Kapoor, who has died aged 67 of bone marrow cancer, starred as a leading man in almost 100 Bollywood films and was a member of the remarkable Kapoor family of actors and film-makers.
The son of the great director, producer and actor Raj Kapoor, Rishi started as a child actor, aged three, in his father’s hugely popular film Shree 420 (1955). But his proper debut came in Raj’s 1970 film Mera Naam Joker, playing the younger version of his father’s leading role. Rishi said that his father only gave him the part as he was unable to pay for a recognised star, and the film was not a commercial success in any case. The movie that gave Rishi stardom was his next, Bobby (1973), the story of a love affair between Raja, a rich Bombay teenager, and a poor girl, Bobby, from the wrong side of the tracks, played by Dimple Kapadia. In the story, also directed by Raj, he was Hindu and she was Catholic, which was in itself a bold move.
Despite this the film was a sensation, becoming hugely successful at the Indian box office and earning vast sums of money in the Soviet Union. It was said that more than 60 million people saw Bobby in the USSR and the film is regarded as one of the all-time Bollywood greats, regularly shown in cinemas and on television.Rishi, who won the Hindi film industry’s Filmfare award for best actor for the role, was always a modest man and complained that the award was all very well but that it had cost him a considerable bribe to get it. Latterly he explained that he was never quite sure whether the money (30,000 rupees) was paid to the right person or whether it was a giant con. Nonetheless, he was now a major star and through the 1970s and 80s he appeared in dozens of films, including Kabhi Kabhie (1976), a romantic drama noted for its award-wining soundtrack, Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), a comedy that makes a case for religious tolerance, and the reincarnation thriller Karz (1980), with its chart-topping, disco-inspired soundtrack. These were often shot simultaneously, which meant that, arriving on the set, Rishi had to enquire exactly who he was playing and what were the lines and songs he had to accomplish.
At the turn of the century he played character roles to acclaim in another series of successful films. He was honoured with the Filmfare lifetime achievement award in 2008, and went on to win the Filmfare critics’ award as best actor for Do Dooni Chaar (2010) and best supporting actor for Kapoor & Sons (2016). His last film appearance was in The Body (2019).
Born in Bombay (now Mumbai), to Raj and Krishna (nee Malhotra), Rishi, who attended Campion school in the city, and Mayo College, in Ajmer, Rajasthan, was destined for the movies. His grandfather Prithviraj Kapoor was a pioneer of Indian theatre and early cinema, and the father of the Bollywood greats Shammi and Shashi Kapoor, as well as Raj. Rishi’s uncles on his mother’s side, including Prem Nath and Prem Chopra, were actors, as are his brothers, Randhir and Rajiv. In 1974, while shooting the film Zehreela Insaan, he began dating his co-star, Neetu Singh, and they married in 1980.
If Rishi had the advantage of being from a glamorous family that commanded immense respect in the entertainment world over three generations, he made his way without expecting any favours. In recent years he was often in considerable pain from his illness, but retained his good humour. He was also never afraid to be controversial, often saying that religion and eating were separate from each other, which was why he was “a beef-eating Hindu”. This caused considerable outrage in some quarters. But he was a charming man and, though not a great actor, possessed charisma that almost always carried him through.
In a way, Rishi was representative of the old Bollywood that has now virtually disappeared in favour of an industry that espouses new techniques and more relevant themes. Yet nobody could claim him as an old-fashioned star. His progression from male leads to character studies was remarkable for a range that not only kept him his fans but constantly broadened his appeal. And it has to be said that few Bollywood stars were regarded with more affection.
He is survived by Neetu, their son, Ranbir, who is also an actor, and daughter, Riddhima, a granddaughter, and Randhir and Rajiv.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The New Great Depression Is Coming. Will There Be a New New Deal?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Until very recently, Andrew Yang thought that the need for a universal basic income would be a big issue in the 2024 election, as “many of the trends that I campaigned on were going to become completely clear to more and more Americans” over the next four years. He was arguing, for example, that between now and then, “30 percent of our stores and malls were going to close because of Amazon.”
After more than a month of coronavirus lockdowns, Yang’s prediction looks quaintly optimistic. “That obviously happened not in four years, it happened in four weeks,” he told me. “And it wasn’t 30 percent, it was virtually 100 percent.”
Many of those stores will come back — some have already — but analysts predict that thousands won’t. Jobs lost to automation during this time — in warehouses and supermarkets, among other places — are especially unlikely to return. Americans, increasingly desperate in lockdown, are going to emerge from this period into a transformed and blighted world.
Yang used to believe that we were five or 10 years away from seeing some version of his signature policy enacted. “Now I believe this is very immediate and could happen this year,” he said. Representative Justin Amash, who’s exploring running for president as a libertarian, is calling for a U.B.I. for the next three months. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, recently said a guaranteed minimum income is “perhaps” worthy of attention. Last month Pope Francis spoke warmly of the idea.
Several candidates campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination on what Senator Elizabeth Warren called “big structural change,” and lost. Yet in a hideous historical irony, the end of the primaries has coincided with a calamity that necessitates an enormous federal response.
Covid-19 has killed more Americans than died in the Vietnam War and led to unemployment numbers that are likely worse than those during the Great Depression. Implicit in Joe Biden’s campaign was a promise of a return to normalcy. That may have always been illusory, but now it’s been revealed as an impossibility.
As we approach this year’s election, we’re looking at an abyss. The question is what will fill it. Societal disaster can have horrific political consequences: Around the world, despots are using the pandemic as an excuse to grab ever more power. But the need to rebuild the country comes with opportunities.
At this point, even many Republicans acknowledge that the era of small government is over. (“Big-Government Conservatives Mount Takeover of G.O.P.,” said a recent Politico headline.) In such an environment, ambitious progressive ideas that once seemed implausible, at least in the short term, start to become more imaginable.
“I do think there’s an F.D.R. moment,” said Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and co-author of the Green New Deal resolution, which calls for a huge new public works program to build environmentally sustainable infrastructure. “Like 1933 — which would be 2021 — we can see that it is now time to discuss universal child care, universal sick leave and a guaranteed income for everyone in our society.”
Unsurprisingly, mass unemployment — a particular catastrophe in a system in which most people’s health insurance is tied to their jobs — seems to have made Americans more supportive of New Deal-like policies. Figures from the left-leaning polling firm Data for Progress show that support for a Green New Deal has risen from 48 percent last May to 59 percent this spring. Backing for “Medicare for all” went from 47 percent in November to 53 percent in March, when coronavirus layoffs were just starting.
“I’ve had people in my district, Silicon Valley, tech professionals who’ve lost their jobs,” Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, told me. “People who were doing well at small businesses who have either lost their jobs or faced extraordinary hardship, and suddenly they are now having to confront the difficulties of being uninsured. They’re having to confront the challenges of the private health system.” Khanna sees a much broader awareness “of how uncertain economic life can be,” he said, which creates a bigger coalition for progressive ideas to improve the social safety net.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, American culture lionized soldiers, firefighters and police officers. The political corollaries of this worship could be negative; it was part of an atmosphere of militarization at home and abroad, where dissent was repeatedly shut down in the name of “supporting the troops.” But looking back, you can see how quickly national priorities changed, and how the stories America told itself about its heroes shaped policy.
Now the people celebrated as heroes are “essential workers” — doctors and nurses, but also grocery store clerks, bus drivers, meatpackers and mail carriers. There’s no guarantee that America will reward their sacrifice; even Sept. 11 emergency workers had to struggle to get the health care funding they needed.
But cultural shifts pave the way for political reform. “When little children are making signs that say, ‘Thank You,’ and taping them up in the window for the mail carriers and UPS delivery folks, the world has changed,” Elizabeth Warren told me. (Disclosure: my husband consulted on Warren’s presidential campaign.)
Warren and Khanna recently released a proposal for what they’re calling an “Essential Workers Bill of Rights,” which folds many longtime progressive labor priorities into a plan to address our current emergency. The proposal includes a mandate for free adequate personal protective equipment, hazard pay, universal paid sick leave and paid family leave, a crackdown on employers that misclassify full-time employees as independent contractors, and protections for union organizing.
That last part is important, because Warren believes we’re on the cusp of a new wave of labor mobilization. There have already been strikes, walkouts and other demonstrations across the country by workers forced to expose themselves to potential infection, including bus drivers, Amazon warehouse workers and employees at fast-food restaurants. Nurses have taken to the streets. “Whether it is slog-it-out bargaining over safety measures or bold legislative moves, unions see their coronavirus activism as the beginning of a new era for the labor movement,” said a Los Angeles Times article.
If so, it will echo what happened during the Great Depression. “This is what shocked everyone,” Warren said. “All of the economists thought the Great Depression in the 1930s would be the end of unions because so many people were unemployed and there was such a large labor supply, and unionization was going down during the 1920s. But that’s not what happened. In a time of great stress, more workers decided their only chance of survival was to come together and exercise their power through a union.”
Mass unemployment also makes some version of a Green New Deal seem like more of a near-term possibility, at least if Biden wins the presidency. During the primaries, Biden’s environmental proposals were generally more modest than his rivals’, but with the pandemic ravaging the economy he’s called for a trillion-dollar infrastructure program focused on green jobs. That’s a lot less than what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who co-sponsored the Green New Deal in the House, has demanded — but it’s more than the entire cost of the stimulus bill President Barack Obama signed at the height of the Great Recession.
“In lots of ways I do think we’re closer to a Green New Deal than we were before, because the necessity of one has become more apparent,” said Rhiana Gunn-Wright, director of climate policy at the Roosevelt Institute and one of the thinkers who first conceptualized the Green New Deal. “It’s very difficult to talk about needing an economic transformation when the official metrics are saying this is a good economy.”
The economy was always more fragile than the top-line numbers suggested; in some surveys a majority of Americans said they were living paycheck to paycheck before the coronavirus hit. But now the economy’s weakness is no longer a matter of debate.
Obviously, that doesn’t make progressive reform of any kind inevitable. “It’s a question of what lessons are we learning from this, and I don’t think that that’s clear,” said Gunn-Wright. She added, “We don’t make policy decisions based on just, ‘What is the best choice?’ It’s a political process. It’s not a science fair.”
Gunn-Wright is interested in systems thinking; she talks about how paradigm shifts occur. At certain moments of crisis, dominant beliefs about how the world works can no longer explain what is happening. You can see this, she said, in the 1970s with stagflation, which was viewed as discrediting Keynesian economics. “That moment opened up the space for the neoliberalism that we have now,” she said.
Conservative economists in the United States had been developing the sort of ultra-free-market ideas championed by Ronald Reagan for decades. The era’s economic crisis allowed them to break through. As Wright-Gunn said, “There’s no answer for what’s happening, and here come these folks with an answer.”
Now, with so many of our assumptions about the way our country works collapsing around us, it’s progressives stepping forward with a set of answers they’ve been refining for years.
“We are going to be faced with a national rebuilding project at a scale that has never existed in our lifetimes,” said Yang. The biggest battle in politics now is over who will control that project, and whom it will prioritize.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd, ‘Scrubs’ Actor, Dies at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, a longtime television and film actor who appeared in the television shows “Scrubs” and “Desperate Housewives,” died on Thursday at the Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 56.
The cause was complications of lung cancer, his family said in a statement.
In January 2019, Mr. Lloyd began experiencing headaches and sought medical attention, according to a GoFundMe set up for the actor.
A scan revealed a mass on his brain, and he soon underwent surgery, but the tumor was “too intertwined” to be removed, the website said. Mr. Lloyd was told that the cancer in his brain had metastasized from his lungs. Additional scans showed that the cancer had spread to his liver, spine and jaw.
Mr. Lloyd acted in dozens of television shows and films, including 95 episodes of “Scrubs” as Ted Buckland, a sad-sack lawyer with a hangdog look and low self-esteem.
Zach Braff, one of the stars of “Scrubs,” said on Twitter on Friday that Mr. Lloyd was one of the funniest actors he had worked with.
“Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together,” he said.
Mr. Lloyd also appeared in several episodes of “Desperate Housewives” as Dr. Albert Goldfine, and in episodes of “Seinfeld,” “Modern Family,” “The West Wing,” “Cougar Town” and “Malcolm in the Middle”; and in the films “Flubber” (1997) and “Galaxy Quest” (1999).
Samuel Lloyd Jr. was born on Nov. 12, 1963, in Springfield, Vt., to Marianna McGuffin and Samuel Lloyd Sr.
The son of two aspiring actors, Mr. Lloyd spent his life in theater and in music, said his sister Laurel Lloyd.
In Vermont, he was a part of their mother’s children’s theater group, the Green Mountain Trolls, and later a member of the Weston Playhouse, where he continued to act on the stage as recently as 2017.
Mr. Lloyd’s sister said the actor had had an innate sense of humor that he honed over time. His deadpan comedy and pratfalls were Mr. Lloyd’s craft, his wife, Vanessa Villalovos, said, but the man she knew “was just a tender, genuine soul.”
On Saturday, she praised her husband’s looks: “If he had hair,” she said, he would rival some of the most handsome actors in Hollywood.
Mr. Lloyd was also a musician. He sang in the Blanks, an a cappella group that made several appearances on “Scrubs” as the Worthless Peons. He also played bass guitar in the Butties, a Beatles tribute band.
In addition to his wife and his sister Laurel, Mr. Lloyd is survived by his son, Weston; his stepmother, Barbara Lloyd; his sisters Robin Lloyd and Sandy Yaple; and his uncle, the actor Christopher Lloyd.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Race, Loyalty and Transparency in an Artist’s Lawsuit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For many African-American artists looking for gallery representation in the 1980s, George N’Namdi was the only game in town. One of the few black art dealers, then and now, Mr. N’Namdi opened his first gallery in Detroit in 1981 and focused on black artists working in abstraction. They had been largely ignored by the mainstream art world and marginalized, as well, within black communities that expected their artists to make socially and politically oriented work.
“We were basically considered traitors if we didn’t do specifically didactic work,” said Howardena Pindell, 77, a graduate of Yale, who took her pioneering abstractions to the Studio Museum in Harlem only to be told, she said, by the director in the 1970s to “go show your work with the white boys.” They weren’t knocking on her door, either.
Mr. N’Namdi offered opportunity. Ms. Pindell had eight solo exhibitions at his galleries in Michigan, Illinois and New York from 1987 to 2006. But by 2009, she had hired a lawyer to request the return of original works lent to the N’Namdi galleries for exhibition, with a long trail of correspondence over the next decade seeking information on the whereabouts and sales of her art. She now is claiming that Mr. N’Namdi, his son Jumaane and their related companies cheated her and profited off her vulnerability.
In a lawsuit touching on issues of race, loyalty and a lack of transparency in the art world, Ms. Pindell is seeking the return of 20 works of art from the N’Namdis, along with three works from a Texas-based collector, Arthur Primas, and punitive damages of “no less than” $500,000.
The lawsuit, filed in January in the Southern District of New York and amended April 21, alleges that “accounts of sales and inventory, if provided at all, were willfully misleading and inaccurate, payments were not timely if received at all, and the identity of purchasers, as required by law, was not provided.” The three works sold to Mr. Primas, according to the lawsuit, were “heavily discounted by the N’Namdi Defendants without the knowledge or authorization” of Ms. Pindell.
George and Jumaane N’Namdi said through their lawyer, Peter Raymond, “It is our intention to move to dismiss the claims.” Mr. Raymond repeated a statement published in ARTnews, which first reported the suit: “Our clients have great respect for Ms. Pindell as an artist and are proud to have been able to help her with her career.” However, he added, “they believe the claims in this lawsuit are meritless.”
Ms. Pindell is one of a growing number of black artists, including Jack Whitten, Al Loving, Ed Clark, Robert Colescott and Frank Bowling, who have lately seen a surge of attention from museums, collectors and critics after decades of neglect. They all exhibited early on with George N’Namdi. The complaint by Ms. Pindell intends to establish a long pattern of manipulation by the N’Namdis. In a case that could strengthen protections for artists, it alleges that Al Loving,Herbert Gentry and their estates also “publicly expressed their difficulties” with their galleries.
Ms. Pindell’s lawsuit asserts that similar complaints were made against the N’Namdi organization by Mr. Loving’s widow, Mara, after the artist’s death in 2005. (Ms. Loving settled her lawsuit in 2008.) Mr. Gentry died in 2003; his widow, Mary Anne Rose, declined to comment on the estate’s relationship with the N’Namdis.
Last week, two African-American artists who were represented by the N’Namdis in the past, James Little and Richard Mayhew, stepped forward to tell The New York Times about their own issues with the gallery.
Mr. Mayhew, who is 96, and the last living artist from the Spiral Group, a New York-based African-American artist collective formed during the civil rights struggle, described being approached by collectors who said they owned paintings by him. “And I had no idea,” he said, adding he was “shocked” to learn that the N’Namdi galleries had sold these works without his knowledge. “I wasn’t being paid for the paintings that were sold.”
“I wanted to sue,” Mr. Mayhew said, allowing that he could not afford to do so. “Many artists were reluctant to sue or didn’t know how to do it,” he added.
Mr. Mayhew finally severed his relationship with the gallery a decade ago.
According to Ms. Pindell’s complaint, “Discrimination in the art world prevented the recognition that these artists deserved until the last several years.” It alleges that “the N’Namdis took advantage of this situation by egregiously and systematically breaching their fiduciary obligations to [the plaintiff] and others.”
Ms. Pindell, Mr. Loving and other artists working with the N’Namdis did not have formal contracts, not unusual at the time; business in the art world was often done on a handshake. But Ms. Pindell’s lawyer, Barbara Hoffman, said in an interview that statutes in many states protect consigned works of art and “impose obligations on the dealer, including prompt payment, even if there is not a written contract.”
Ms. Pindell, whose work ranges from highly experimental mixed-media abstractions to figurative canvases dealing with autobiographical and political themes, was celebrated in a traveling retrospective that opened in 2018 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. She has been represented since 2014 by Garth Greenan in New York, and now shows with Victoria Miro in London as well. The artist’s work today sells for up to $1 million, according to Mr. Greenan.
Several of the works she’s trying to get back in the lawsuit have “increased in value tremendously,” Ms. Hoffman said.
Declining to comment specifically on the lawsuit, Ms. Pindell said she preferred to have her dealer, Mr. Greenan, speak for her.
“Howardena would say it’s particularly depressing because George N’Namdi was taking advantage of his own people, already in precarious positions,” Mr. Greenan said. “Justice would make her feel like she wasn’t taken for a ride for 20 years.”
“If Howardena prevails,” he added, “I think you’re going to see a lot of other people feel like they can do it.”
George N’Namdi did do a service for African-American artists early on, Mara Loving said in an interview, adding that it was her husband’s only gallery in the late 1980s when he started showing there. Mr. Loving, also from Detroit, advised Mr. N’Namdi on other artists to bring into the gallery. (The Loving estate is now represented by Garth Greenan.)
James Little, 67, a New York-based abstract artist, was close friends with Mr. Loving and Ed Clark, an acclaimed abstract painter who died last fall. Mr. Little had one exhibition at the N’Namdi branch in New York in 2005 but quickly broke ties because of his discomfort with the bookkeeping. (He now shows through the June Kelly gallery.)
“I saw how he was treating Al and working with Ed,” Mr. Little said, explaining that he heard from the artists that Mr. N’Namdi promised monthly stipends but would often pay less or skip payments entirely. “We used to share information about this guy,” he said.
Hauser & Wirth, which now represents the Clark estate, said his daughter, Melanca, did not want to be interviewed. Mr. Primas, the collector, could not be reached for comment after several attempts to contact him.
Asked to respond to the issues raised by Mr. Little and Mr. Mayhew, Mr. Raymond said George and Jumaane N’Namdi confirmed that they had one exhibition for each of the artists. But the N’Namdis “are not aware of having ever sold any painting by either of the artists that they owe a commission on,” Mr. Raymond said, adding that sometimes galleries acquire works through a third party, rather than by consignment from an artist, and therefore wouldn’t owe the artist on a sale.
Ronald Ollie, a collector and retired engineer who is African-American, credits George N’Namdi with jump-starting his collection focused on black abstract artists. Connected to the dealer by Herbert Gentry, his artist friend, Mr. Ollie described Mr. N’Namdi’s unusual sales pitch in their first meeting in the early 1990s. It took place at a McDonald’s near the campus of Howard University, where the dealer was dropping off his daughter.
“N’Namdi said, ‘If you start buying from me, you’re not just going to buy one piece, it will be a group of paintings; you give me a down payment and you’ll have a monthly art bill,’” recalled Mr. Ollie, who purchased numerous works by artists including Mr. Clark, Mr. Loving, Mr. Whitten, Allie McGhee and Nanette Carter from the dealer in this fashion throughout the 1990s. (In 2017, Mr. Ollie made a gift of 81 pieces from his collection to the Saint Louis Art Museum, where they were recently on view.)
Through the years, Mr. Ollie said he heard grumblings from artists about the dealer. Mr. Gentry, he recalled, would complain about late payments from Mr. N’Namdi. But Mr. Ollie said he personally found the dealer to be fair. “I think he’s made some mistakes, but he’s tried to make a decent name for himself in the art world,” he said.
The Pindell lawsuit is seeking to underscore artists’ rights under the law, according to Ms. Hoffman, Ms. Pindell’s lawyer.
She pointed to states that have enacted statutes, including New York, Illinois and Michigan, to protect works of art created by living artists, saying such protections could be important for artists in the current economic crisis, when many galleries face financial difficulties and the possibility of bankruptcy.
A key provision of those statutes is that a fiduciary relationship — one of trust — is created when an artist consigns a work to a gallery. “That’s very different than if you give your grandmother’s clock to a pawnshop and they don’t pay you,” she said. “A trust relationship has a much higher standard of loyalty. An artist has to be paid first.”
Ms. Hoffman said in her experience, artists are “averse to bringing lawsuits against galleries except in very egregious cases” for fear of being blackballed.
Ms. Pindell’s newfound clout in the art world now puts her in a less tenuous position.
Mr. Little said that her lawsuit “sends a strong message about the seriousness that we take in our work and legacy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Bug's creator tracked down to repair shop in Manila</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The man behind the world's first major computer virus outbreak has admitted his guilt, 20 years after his software infected millions of machines worldwide.
Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying.
He claims he never intended it to spread globally.
And he says he regrets the damage his code caused.
"I didn't expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised," he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com, a forthcoming book on cyber-crime.
The Love Bug pandemic began on 4 May, 2000.
Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. It contained malicious code that would overwrite files, steal passwords, and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victim's Microsoft Outlook address book.
Within 24 hours, it was causing major problems across the globe, reportedly infecting 45 million machines. It also overwhelmed organisations' email systems, and some IT managers disconnected parts of their infrastructure to prevent infection.
This led to estimates of damage and disruption running into billions of pounds.
In the UK, Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to protect itself, and even the Pentagon was reportedly affected.
The previous year, the Melissa bug is believed to have infected a million machines using similar tactics. However, Love Bug dwarfed previous outbreaks and exposed how vulnerable the world's increasing internet connectivity was to attack.
Investigators traced the virus to an email address registered to an apartment in Manila, capital of the Philippines.
The occupant's brother was Onel de Guzman, a computer science student at the city's AMA Computer College. He was a member of an underground hacking group called Grammersoft and quickly became the lead suspect in a police investigation.
De Guzman's lawyer organised a press conference on 11 May, at which de Guzman appeared to speak little English.
When asked whether he may have released the virus accidentally, de Guzman said: "It is possible."
At the time, the Philippines had no law covering computer hacking, and neither de Guzman nor anyone else was ever prosecuted.
Suspicion also fell on de Guzman's fellow student Michael Buen, who has been cited online as the co-author of the Love Bug.
I set out to track down Onel de Guzman and resolve the 20-year mystery of Love Bug's origin.
Online rumours claimed de Guzman had moved to Germany, Austria or the US. Some claimed he had been recruited by Microsoft following the outbreak. All proved to be wide of the mark.
On a forum dedicated to the Philippine underworld, a user claimed in 2016 that de Guzman ran a mobile phone repair shop in the Quiapo district of Manila. In April 2019, I visited the area hoping to encounter the suspect, only to find a sprawling market containing dozens of mobile phone repair shops.
I wrote Onel de Guzman's name on a piece of paper and showed it to shop workers at random in the hope that someone would recognise it. Finally an employee said he knew of de Guzman and believed he now worked in another phone repair booth at a shopping mall elsewhere in Manila.
After several hours wandering around the mall and showing de Guzman's name, I was directed to a cramped, messy stall at the very back of the building, and after waiting several hours for him to turn up, Onel de Guzman arrived.
He admitted having created Love Bug, which he said was a revamped version of an earlier virus he had coded in order to steal internet access passwords.
In the era of dial-up internet, such passwords were needed to get online, and de Guzman says he could not afford to pay for one.
He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims, with whom he communicated in chat rooms, because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area.
However, in spring 2000 he tweaked the code, adding an auto-spreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims' Outlook contacts, using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. He also created a title for the email attachment that would have global appeal, tempting people across the world to open it.
"I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that," he said.
De Guzman claims he sent the virus initially to someone in Singapore, and then went out drinking with a friend. The first he knew of the global chaos he had unleashed was when his mother told him police were hunting a hacker in Manila.
He explained that his mother hid his computer equipment. De Guzman insists Buen had nothing to do with Love Bug and that he was its sole creator.
After a period of lying low, de Guzman returned to computer work but did not go back to college. He now runs the small booth with another member of staff.
He says he regrets writing the virus, and the infamy it has brought him.
"Sometimes I get my picture on the internet," he said.
"My friends say, 'It's you!' I'm a shy person, I don't want this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Violinist Benedetti offering free online music sessions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti has assembled a team of musicians to offer three weeks of free music classes online.
Beginning on 11 May, they will culminate in a huge online concert at the end of the month.
The Ayrshire-born musician already offered online music classes through her own Benedetti Foundation.
But the lockdown made her wonder whether they could reach an even wider audience on social media platforms.
Although the sessions are free, donations are welcome.
Nearly 800 people have signed up so far to teach or play, including fellow musicians The Ayoub Sisters.
Ms Benedetti says she's been passionate about sharing her music since winning BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2004, at the age of just 16.
"I feel like I can do it well," she said. "I have the capability of being a galvanising type of person, I can convince a lot of people to get involved with something and I'm really serious about getting a message across to young people.
"I think if you have the chance to do something well, you have a responsibility to society to at least try and put some time and effort into the thing you have some talent for."
The violinist is patron of a number of musical organisations including Sistema Scotland, the National Children's Orchestra, Music in Secondary Schools Trust, The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and the European String Teachers' Association.
Her new album, a collection of pieces by Elgar, will be released digitally on 15 May. It includes Salut D'amour, the first piece of music she recalls making her cry at the age of six. It was around then that she and her sister Stephanie first persuaded their mother to allow them to learn violin.
She still teaches it to young musicians online, and says it often produces the same emotions.
The supporting concert tour to promote the album won't happen, and she's worried about how long it will be before she can perform in concert halls again.
"The reality for me is of four months of concerts, gone in a heartbeat," she said. "We have an arrogant sense of control - not everyone, but in the professional world I inhabit. We think we can determine what happens next year, that's the attitude and something like this is humbling, it's very humbling."
She added: "Our business requires bringing great groups of people together. The margins for concert halls, they're that size for a reason, you want as many people as possible and if you cut that number in half, things don't add up so well. You won't even cover your costs, never mind make a profit.
"When budgets don't stand up, there's only so much you can expect people to do for free or for less. Revenue has to come from somewhere and if the loss is too great, concerts can't go ahead. It's a simple equation.
"As much as the will is so intense, and people are desperate to get back to playing, there may be an economic reality to that which makes it last longer than we are realising."

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Waco’ Deserves The Spotlight A Netflix Feature Is Giving It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While most of the shows in Netflix’s daily top 10 list are its own originals, sometimes something slips through. And no, it’s not The Office, which everyone is watching for the dozenth time in quarantine. For the past week or so it’s been Waco.
The show is originally from the Paramount Network, which is what SpikeTV turned into after it was a killed, and it’s been trying to turn into a “prestige” channel like FX and AMC. While you may not have heard much about it (I didn’t even know it existed before this week), it has found some success. First with Yellowstone (hopefully that comes to Netflix soon), but also with this Waco miniseries.
Waco has held onto its top 10 spot on Netflix since its debut, right now sneaking it at number 10 itself, and I watched the entire thing in one sitting a day ago and can report back that yes, it’s absolutely worth your time.
Waco tells the real-life story of the standoff between the ATF/FBI and David Koresh’s Branch Davidians cult in Waco, Texas in 1993. As you may know, it did not end well with 76 members of the cult killed, including over two dozen children, all burned when the compound erupted in flames at the end of the siege.
Waco is a “both sides” look at the story, based on two different books, one by a surviving member of the cult, the other by an FBI hostage negotiator who was there. And while Koresh clearly did some gross things like marrying a 14 year old and fathering a child with her, the main thrust of the story is that of the overreaction by the US government that escalated the situation and got everyone inside killed. Waco makes it pretty clear that tear gas inserted into the building got ignited, causing the fire, while the government claims the fire was set on purpose as part of a mass suicide. The story told here makes that narrative pretty much impossible to believe.
Far and away, the best asset Waco has going for it is its cast. It’s led by Taylor Kitsch as David Koresh, who charmed us as Tim Riggins all those years ago on Friday Night Lights, but couldn’t live down his turn as John Carter as Hollywood tried and failed to turn him into a blockbuster draw. But he’s excellent here as Koresh and anchors a stacked cast.
Probably the best aspect of the roster is the Boardwalk Empire trio of Michael Shannon, Shea Whigham and Paul Sparks playing an FBI negotiator, an FBI unit commander and David’s right hand respectively. All put forth powerful performances in their own right, each a talented actor. Supergirl’s Melissa Benoist is excellent as David’s “main” wife, though Ozark’s Julia Garner shines in a smaller role as her sister…also David’s (underage) wife. The odd man out may be a surprisingly large role for Rory Culkin as one of the only survivors of the fire. He does well, but among so much other talent, it’s a little hard for him to stand out.
This is a haunting, horrifying, sometimes surreal show, as I imagine it was to live through 50 days of this back in the ‘90s when it was all over TV. Things go from wacky, David performing a rock show in the middle of the siege, to terrifying, as women and children suffocate trapped in the house by debris as debris and smoke consume them.
Waco is sympathetic to most of the members of the cult, other than perhaps David himself, who, despite the government’s overreaction, probably could have saved everyone’s lives were he not so wrapped up in his own mythology.
But the over-arching narrative is that we should not trust the government’s record of events, as we see them destroy evidence that they fired first on the cult when the initially got there and they were responsible for the fire that killed everyone, despite that not being the official narrative.
It’s a powerful miniseries, and a story that needed to be told. I’d highly recommend giving it a shot, given that it’s just six episodes with certainly no “Waco season 2” on the way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">House Of Hackney Founder Shares Her Favorite Home Décor Selects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brought to you by husband and wife duo Frieda Gormley and Javvy M Royle, is the thoroughly East London homeware label, House of Hackney.
With backgrounds in fashion and product design, they established their brand in 2011 in ode to rich pattern, color and texture. They're influenced by traditional British print houses, and so, the brand offers a range of eclectic furnishings, fabrics, and accessories for a very maximalist aesthetic, and not to mention distinctive - you can spot a HoH cushion from a mile away!
Bring HoH into your house, from beautifully intricate wallpapers and statement lamps, to sumptuous curtains to ornamental bookends. Mi casa es su casa.
Frieda offers up her top 10 home décor selects from House of Hackney.
ARTEMIS Wallpaper in ‘Black’: One of my all-time favourite motifs, ARTEMIS is also one of the most iconic and beloved House of Hackney prints. It’s intricately painted with Victorian-inspired wildflowers in homage to the maverick 19th century designer William Morris, who is a hero of ours. I love its beguiling depiction of feral flowers and connotations of psychedelia.
BAMBUSA Wallpaper in ‘Antique-White’: We’ve been collaborating with Zuber, the historic French wallpaper house, for a few seasons now – delving deep into their archives and reimagining centuries-old prints for a new generation. BAMBUSA is a beautiful example. It captures our whole ethos about bringing the outdoors in, while its creamy backdrop works wonders in brightening and enlivening any corner of the home.
ANACONDA Cut-Velvet in ‘Olive-Green’: While most of our fabrics are printed in the UK, ANACONDA is crafted by a little family-run business in Italy. The provenance of our products is really important to us – since our inception we have championed small businesses and traditional methods of craftsmanship. On a true-to-nature shade of green, this cut-velvet uses an elevated technique based on classic damask fabrics – its decadent feel makes for the most luxurious curtains.
TIGRIS Large Velvet Cushion in ‘Blush’: The colour pink is really having a moment, and a cushion like this is an effortless way to invite a pop of pink into your home. TIGRIS is the big sister to our much-loved SABER the tiger – I feel the pink background brings out the softer side of this fierce feline! For each one sold, we make a donation to Panthera, the charity devoted to protecting the world’s wild cats.
TRIPLICITY Medium Velvet Cushion in ‘Fire’: In our House, we’ve long been fascinated with astrology, so star signs are a recurring theme for us. There are four TRIPLICITY cushions in total, each studded with illustrations of the signs grouped by element: earth, air, fire and water. I’m a Sagittarius, so fall under the element of ‘Fire’ – and just like me, this statement cushion is sure to command attention wherever you put it!
PEGASUS Bookends in ‘Onyx & Ecru’: Ancient mythology is another of our preoccupations – many of our designs draw inspiration from the Greek gods and goddesses. These ceramic bookends take the form of PEGASUS, the divine winged horse. Although they’re designed to lend an opulent finishing touch to a bookshelf or mantelpiece, they’re also proof that you don’t have to completely redecorate – something as small as rearranging your bookshelves can have a wonderfully transformative effect. 
GAIA Lampshade with the Ananas Pineapple Lampstand: Our ‘Ananas’ pineapple lampstand is a true House icon. In many cultures, pineapples are a traditional symbol of warmth and welcoming – so we defy anyone not to be charmed by it. For this season, we paired it with the GAIA lampshade, which is hand-made in Britain and painted with flowers, birds and swirling vines in tribute to our eternal muse, Mother Nature. 
SERPENTIS Mirror in ‘Verdigris’: Intertwining snakes are our House symbol of transformation, renewal, creative life force and immortality. This mirror has quickly become one of our most coveted designs – the green and gold scales of each snake are painted by hand, making each piece totally unique. It’s seductive, subversive and utterly spellbinding – placed on a wall, it really is the fairest of them all!
WILD CARD Bottoman in ‘Butterscotch’: We’re notorious for our Bottomans, which are House of Hackney’s typically irreverent take on the traditional ottoman. WILD CARD is a perfectly proportioned leopard print that we see as a neutral – it works really well with any other pattern or shade of paint. Although it’s luxurious with the gold-toned fringing, this is a very practical piece for when you have guests around – or for when you just want to put your feet up after a long day.
SABER Bloomsbury Loveseat in ‘Midnight’: This loveseat is a House of Hackney calling card – full of character and grandeur, it’s a real showstopper in any interior. Like all our furniture it’s made in Britain by the country’s finest craftsmen, then upholstered in luxurious velvet bearing SABER, which is inspired by traditional Tibetan tiger motifs. We call our designs ‘Future Heirlooms’ as they’re built to last and be passed down to the next generation – and this is no exception.

At Lafaurie-Peyraguey, we are experts in the making of the greatest fine white wines in the world. At Lalique, one of the crown jewels of the French crystal industry and an international lifestyle icon, we have high-end skills in crystal production. This is our savoir-faire. The Lalique Hotel & Restaurant in Sauternes represents the use, consumption and enjoyment of all these products thanks to the hospitality. It engages all the senses and is a place to enjoy design, food and wine, where conviviality is a must. This is what we call “art de vivre” (art of living).
When Silvio Denz acquired Lalique in 2008, why was it important for him to diversify into hospitality and to establish partnerships between his vineyards and the Lalique crystal works?
Silvio Denz is a great wine connoisseur and especially knowledgeable in Bordeaux fine wines. He has been the owner of Château Faugères Saint Emilion, a Grand Cru Classé vineyard, since 2005. When he acquired Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey in Sauternes, he became part of a very select club as an owner of wines first classified as Premiers Grands Crus Classés (first growths) in 1855 by Napoleon III. Only 17 chateaux in the world can claim that they belong to this exclusive club. It was a good terroir, a magical place to start a collaboration with Lalique and is a natural fit where four worlds converge all combining to serve the senses: wine, crystal, gastronomy and hospitality.
Describe the design of the Lalique Hotel & Restaurant and the overarching idea you tried to achieve. Which are the customized furniture or special design elements that stand out in particular?
This fabulous setting offers three suites and 10 rooms. Each piece of furniture has been made bespoke and with color inspiration taken from the surrounding vineyards – earthy tones combined with red and gold – lit up with crystal and an unwavering attention to detail and sensitivity to the original building. Original features such as beams, shutters and individual nooks in the rooms have been enhanced and retained to give a timeless elegance. The alterations and improvements give a contemporary esthetic, but are true to the spirit of the original building. It is the attention to detail and sensitive renovation that sings out. The glass restaurant overlooks the vineyards so guests can watch the sunset and the table settings display a thousand subtleties: a symphony of crystal and porcelain featuring bespoke Lalique collaborations with Christofle, Peugeot and Furstenberg.
How does the Lalique Hotel & Restaurant showcase the best of Lalique crystal and René Lalique’s passion for vines, grapes and wine?
René Lalique was born in the Champagne region and came from wine culture, so he was very familiar with this world. He was known as a creator and was passionate about three things: women, fauna and flora. During his Art Deco period, especially the late 1920s, he was inspired by the area, and many of his best-known designs feature grapes. The Lalique Hotel & Restaurant in the middle of the Sauternes wine area was destined to be the place to display Lalique’s timeless creations.
Why were Lady Tina Green and Pietro Mingarelli commissioned once again to create the interior design?
Like all our partnerships, it is born out of shared passions, standards of excellence and quality. In 2011, Green & Mingarelli created the interior decoration and furniture collection, Lalique Maison, which is inspired by René Lalique and the Art Deco style he favored, and was used to adorn ocean liners, trains such as the Orient Express, buildings and private homes – just as Green & Mingarelli do today.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The ‘Borderlands 3’ Mayhem 10 Guns To Farm For When Yellowcake Gets Nerfed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Right now Borderlands 3 has a lot of issues with Mayhem 10 in which there are very, very few viable builds or weapons to use there because of crazy enemy health scaling (a 12,500% increase).
There is a single exception to that in a big way, the new Cartel event Yellowcake launcher, specifically when it rolls with an anointment that gives it 300% damage to enemies over 90% health. And considering you’re using it to one-shot most enemies, that’s almost all the time.
Yellowcake is simply in a league of its own in Mayhem 10. It works best on Moze, but you can use it with anyone, and as such, I do believe that it is probably heading for a nerf. So before you spend too much time farming for it, I wanted to make you aware of other weapons that are powerful in Mayhem 10 that you also may want to farm in case Yellowcake ends up neutered pretty soon, which I imagine it will be.
There are five that I am pursuing right now in particular, most of them new. They all can hang in Mayhem 10 with the right anointments, so I’ll start with those:
The Anointments: These are the ones you’re going to be looking for as the “best” drops for all five of these. Some of them work better on different characters.
For Moze: 1% damage per consecutive hit, the 200% damage while an action skill is active if you have an Auto Bear build. Moze needs better gun anointments, frankly.
For Amara: 250% damage after Phasecast, 300% damage after Phaseslam
For Zane: 200% damage while an action skill is active, 100% cryo damage when SNTL is active
For FL4K: 200% damage when an action skill is active for a Gamma Burst build, 115% damage during Gamma Burst, 100% damage to enemies damaged by Rakks.
The 300% damage to enemies over 90% health one is good for all four, but that may get nerfed soon, as right now it only applies to red health bars, not armor or shields, so you’re doing 300% damage to those the entire time. Like Yellowcake, we may see this hamstrung soon.
The Guns
OPQ – This is an AR that drops from Cartel minibosses Josie Byte and Franco Firewall or Joey Ultraviolent himself. For some reason, this simply does way, way more damage than any other assault rifle in its class, and if anything on this list may end up nerfed alongside Yellowcake, it may be this. But I would farm one all the same just in case, particularly since these Cartel weapons may be time-limited just for this month.
Sand Hawk – This is the return of a Borderlands 2 sniper rifle that is a huge boss killer, especially in the hands of Moze or FL4K. The only problem is ammo, I’ve found. It drops from Katagawa in Atlas HQ, and only him.
Hellshock – This pistol is the only old gun on this list, but after recent buffs, just does absolutely insane damage, especially to shields with the 300% anoint on it. It outclasses every other pistol I’ve seen by a wide margin and is a must for any elemental build or any shield-based boss fight. Gigamind drops it, though you can also farm the Loot the Universe event in whatever the pistol location is when you’re reading this (right now it’s Athenas).
Monarch – I have always loved the bipod-based ARs in Borderlands 3, but this Mayhem 6+ gun is just incredible, especially on Moze or FL4K, though I am using a 200% damage one on Zane as my main boss farm. It drops from Killavolt, very, very rarely, and only him.
Kaoson – This is a DAHL SMG that fires Torgue-like stickies that explode on reload. As a fun bonus for this, the new grenade anointment that does 150% increased grenade damage when an action skill is active works for those sticky bombs. I’ve mostly been using Kaoson on Moze for a Splash damage build, or an electric one on Amara with a 250% phasecast anointment. It drops from Captain Traunt in Athenas only.
Those are my picks, though there are probably more to consider. Let me know what’s working for you in Mayhem 10.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘John Wick 4’ Moves Away From ‘Matrix 4,’ Avoiding The Great Keanu Reeves Box Office Showdown Of Summer 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alas, Keanu Reeves' John Wick: Chapter 4 and Keanu Reeves' The Matrix 4 are no longer scheduled to open on the same day.
Lionsgate dropped a ridiculous number of new release dates yesterday. Since they did this while I was on extended “dad duty,” consider this a “yesterday’s news today” post. Yes, Antebellum is now slated for August 21, 2020, just a week after Wonder Woman 1984. And yes, as feared, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard has been moved from August 28, 2020 to August 21, 2020. Meanwhile, Lionsgate lacked the courage to move Spiral: From the Book of Saw to October 30, 2020 and will instead schedule it for May 21, 2021 instead. To be fair, they placed Deon Taylor’s new thriller Fatale (starring Michael Ealy and Hillary Swank) into that Halloween weekend, so that’s a relative win. Alas, since Spiral is now slated for next May, John Wick: Chapter 4 has been moved to May 27, 2022.
The bad news is we now have to wait an additional year for the next John Wick installment. The good news is that, presuming it too is not delayed from the May 21, 2021 slot, Warner Bros.’ The Matrix 4 is no longer playing chicken with Lionsgate’s John Wick 4. Yes, Warner Bros. dropped the Lana Wachowki-directed sequel into the same pre-Memorial Day weekend frame already occupied by John Wick 4. It made sense for both franchises. The Matrix Reloaded broke records in 2003 with a $91 million Fri-Sun/$134 million Thurs-Sun debut in that prime release date. John Wick: Chapter 3 opened with $56 million last May in the same frame before legging out to $171 million domestic. Needless to say, we weren’t actually going to get two prime Keanu Reeves “part fours” opening on the same day.
The notion of The Matrix 4 and John Wick 4 opening on the same day was about as likely as Batman v Superman opening concurrently with Captain America: Civil War in May of 2016. And since The Matrix 4 was in the middle of production when the coronavirus pandemic caused and industry-wide production shutdown, while John Wick 4 was (at best) in early development, the sci-fi franchise was always going to open before the action franchise. Of course, it’s always possible that Warner Bros. will have to delay The Matrix 4 and move that big-budget sequel to May 27, 2022 as well. Or, maybe Matrix 4 will stick to its summer 2021 slot while Orion moves Bill and Ted Face the Music to May 21, 2021. Okay, now I’m just being annoying just to entertain myself.
I will note that Lionsgate’s big release date shuffle sadly leaves Aneesh Chaganty’s Run undated, which is bad news for folks eagerly awaiting the next movie from the guy who directed the dynamite Searching, but c’est la vie. Heck, at this rate of delay and rescheduling (bye bye The Batman and Spider-Man 3), The Matrix 4 may end up being one of the very biggest movies of the summer by default, alongside Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Illumination’s Minions 2 and (if it stays the course) Universal’s Jurassic World: Dominion. But the great Keanu Reeves vs. Keanu Reeves showdown is not to be, to the extent that it ever was. We’re going to have to wait until 2022 until the next John Wick movie. Let’s hope we still get a Matrix movie next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why My Fashion Contest Win Shows That ‘Destiny 2’ Needs Transmog</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week, I did something that I probably consider to be my crowning Destiny achievement, never to be topped. I finally, finally won a Bungie Guardian fashion contest.
For the last year or so, Bungie has been periodically having fashion contests where they ask for submissions of your best-dressed Guardians. This last week, they’ve done Warlock, Hunter and Titan submissions separately, with three winners for each. And my bird-themed Warlock managed to snag one of those spots after I’ve entered quite literally every other fashion contest to date. I could cry.
Amidst the congratulations, I did hear one complaint about my win repeated pretty frequently, and I’ve heard it about others in the past. I was wearing almost all Eververse ornaments to achieve my look.
This is true. Of the six visible piece of my ensemble, only two were non-Eververse, my Claws of Ahamkara gauntlets and the Guardian Games bond. But my helmet was Eververse Dawning from a few years ago. My coat and boots were Eververse from Season of the Worthy. And my Vigilance Wing was a paid ornament.
In truth, in almost all the fashion contests I’ve entered, most of my gear ends up being coated in Eververse-earned ornaments, or at best, battle pass ones. And while sometimes I may sub in piece of non-Eververse gear from raids or activities like EP or Forges, it’s painfully old and useless stuff I would never actually wear.
A fundamental problem with Destiny remains. Players really cannot be both as powerful as they want and look exactly how they want on any given occasion. There are too many limits in place for this to happen.
“Dresstiny” is an important part of the game for many people. These fashion contests will spawn thousands of entries with their first hour, and for many players, looking good is the endgame in many ways, but Destiny can make it very difficult, and far too reliant on the Eververse.
I use Eververse items for fashion because quite simply, it’s the easiest way to switch looks around, because I can just reskin my powerful gear with different styles in seconds. But the way armor drops work in Destiny, there are dozens and dozens of sets that I literally have no reason to use because their stats aren’t high enough and there’s no dedicated way to farm them. Past that, there’s simply no way to even store the sheer number of armor sets in the game with our current vault space limitations. Try to keep even one copy of every set for all three classes for fashion purposes, to say nothing of power, and you’ll run out of space almost immediately, between that and your gun collection.
There remains pretty much no way to get proper use out of some of my favorite sets in the game. I cannot realistically form a Forge set or an EP set or a Braytech set that competes with the 65+ stat set I got from the battle pass each season. I can wear those items, but it will cost me in some way, either through stats or the lack of a proper seasonal mod slot, which has been more and more vital as time goes on.
The solution here is obvious, but one that Bungie seems very afraid to implement: transmogrification.
That weird word has a simple purpose, the ability to reskin an item to look like another item. A game like Diablo 3 has full transmog. As in, any piece of armor you find has the ability to look like any other piece of armor.
Bungie is doing a half-hearted version of this system, and one that serves Eververse and the season pass model only. Eververse and battle pass ornaments are the only universal ornaments in the game that can override the looks of any legendary piece of armor.
What I am proposing is that Bungie open up a way to allow every legendary armor set in the game to become a part of the transmog ornament system.
This could work a few different ways. The easy way is just that when you get any armor drop, that transmog skin goes in the pool. If you wanted to make it more of an “activity,” maybe each armor piece has a mini-quest attached to it. Ie. 200 precision kills while wearing X helmet unlocks it as an ornament. Mindless content maybe, but content all the same, and you can bet that I would be doing this for as many pieces of armor as I could to unlock the full spectrum of transmog.
I will pre-push back on two counter-arguments to this idea.
No, I do not think this would “kill” Eververse, and could work perfectly well within the current system. Yes, it would make Eververse ornaments somewhat less valuable given that all armor can now function as an ornament, and yet it’s not fair that it works the way it does now.
Rather, Eververse ornaments could still be a coveted purchase if the armor set is good enough. Even with a transmog system in place, I absolutely would have bought the Warlock fur coat I won the contest with because it’s sick.
Past that, Eververse can still sell all the exotic armor ornaments it wants, and both legendary and exotic gun ornaments the way it does now. I do think some of those could slide into an “earned” system (the Trials ones from this season, for instance), but I have no problem with most of that stuff continuing to be silver purchases.
The other argument is that this would kill the armor chase.
Well guess what? The armor chase already sucks. Yes, once you got an ornament for a specific piece of armor you technically wouldn’t need to find it again. But the current system means that chasing dozens of sets of old armor is entirely useless. I don’t even bother going for so many sets because I know they will not be relevant to my current builds either with no seasonal slots or bad stats. The “Prime engrams have gear with better stats” problem was a tiny step in the right direction but again, you really cannot reasonably farm an amazing full, single set of armor from that method. For things like raid armor, you can’t even farm it effectively with only one chance to clear it per character per week. But change it into an ornament? And those single drops become instantly, immensely valuable.
The armor chase would remain to some extent, because Bungie’s “seasonal mod slots expire” system would be in place, so you would need to pursue different elemental sets with high stats in different seasons. Transmog wouldn’t kill that, it would just mean you’re not locked into that one look from whatever armor is dropping with the correct slot that season.
I have been thinking about this for a long, long time, and I do not think Bungie puts enough weight into giving players the freedom of making their best builds look exactly how they want them to. Eververse has mucked up a potential transmog system so far, but I think Bungie needs to realize that both can function together at the same time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New ‘Transformers’ And ‘G.I. Joe’ Reboots Signify That Paramount May Be Doomed To Chase Relics Of Its Former Glories</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With no Marvel, DreamWorks or Indiana Jones, Paramount has little choice but to revive the franchises (Transformers, G.I. Joe, Paranormal Activity and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) that made it a powerhouse from 2007 to 2014.
This was supposed to be/might still be Paramount’s comeback year. It still could be if A) theaters are able to safely open by Labor Day and B) the likes of A Quiet Place Part II, Top Gun: Maverick and Spongebob 3 (currently slated for August 7, but we’ll see if that becomes the latest kid-targeted toon to go straight to PVOD) pull in good-to-great business following the surprisingly good Sonic the Hedgehog ($306 million worldwide). As such, the news about new Transformers movies and new G.I. Joe movies inspire not mockery but empathy. They are arguably chasing nostalgia for their own prior glories, specifically a period of tentpole/franchise domination that lasted from Transformers in 2007 to Transformers: Age of Extinction in 2014. And since launching new franchises is almost impossible today, they are trying to resurrect past triumphs.
Yes, the Henry Golding-starring Snake Eyes: G.I. Joe Origins is still scheduled for October 23, 2020, but now we have word of a new G.I. Joe movie which will allegedly built upon Snake Eyes as a kind of (my words, not theirs) backdoor pilot for an ensemble G.I. Joe movie which will serve as the start of a new franchise. I’d joke about how that didn’t quite work for Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, but, those films led to Wonder Woman ($821 million), Aquaman ($1.148 billion) and Joker ($1.074 billion). Of course, G.I. Joe is not the Super Friends, as Stephen Sommers’ (painfully underrated) G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra “only” earned $150 million domestic and $300 million worldwide on a $150 million budget in a far more theatrically-friendly environment 11 summers ago.
That summer was right in the middle of Paramount’s eight-year-long winning streak when it came to tentpoles and franchise fare. They launched Transformers ($654 million worldwide)in 2007 as that summer’s “the one you’ve been waiting for” blockbuster after commercially successful but indifferently received Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3 and Shrek 3. They launched the MCU 12 years ago today with Iron Man ($585 million)in the same summer as Dreamworks’ Kung Fu Panda ($630 million) and Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ($790 million). Transformers: Age of the Fallen earned $409 million domestic and $854 million global in summer 2009 alongside the aforementioned G.I. Joe movie. Oh, and they rebooted Star Trek that summer to $256 million domestic and $385 million worldwide. Months later, they turned a glorified home movie, Paranormal Activity, into a six-movie horror franchise.
Summer 2010 saw Iron Man 2 and The Last Airbender both post solid opening weekends ($128 million and a $69 million Thurs-Mon debut) despite divisive receptions while Shrek Forever After earned $752 million. While Disney DIS was banking on a fourth Pirates movie and Cars 2 amid otherwise underperforming live-action and animated (Mars Needs Moms) fare in 2011, Paramount had the Oscar-winning Rango, Super 8, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (which topped $1 billion right alongside WB’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II), Kung Fu Panda 2 ($665 million worldwide), Puss in Boots ($555 million) and the $53 million opening for Paranormal Activity 3. They turned Thor into a hit ($449 million in 2011) and helped sell Captain America: The First Avenger to both cynical domestic audiences ($176 million) and potentially unfriendly overseas moviegoers ($371 million worldwide).
How dominant was Paramount in 2011? So dominant that they sold J.J. Abrams’ Amblin throwback Super 8 (which had the best commercial at that year’s Super Bowl) as an original, character-centric, “just a damn good movie” piece of counter-programming to the conventional summer franchise fare like Transformers 3, Thor, Kung Fu Panda 2 and Captain America. If Paramount’s summer blockbusters were a disease (they weren’t but humor me), then they pitched Paramount’s Super 8 as the cure. Oh, and Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol revived the Tom Cruise franchise with a sky-high $692 million global gross. It’s a cruel irony that Disney’s The Avengers would capitalize on the work done by pre-Disney MCU movies. They lost Marvel to Disney’s purchase of the company in 2009. They eventually lost DreamWorks Animation to Fox (and eventually Universal UHS ).
Still, the next few years offered Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted ($752 million in June of 2012), Brad Pitt’s World War Z ($550 million in 2013 despite months of bad press) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ($491 million in 2014). Intertwined with those were Star Trek Into Darkness ($467 million in 2013), G.I. Joe: Retaliation ($375 million in 2013), Transformers: Age of Extinction ($1.1 billion in 2014) and Sponge Out of Water ($325 million in 2015). The success of Rogue Nation was contrasted with failure of Terminator: Genisys ($441 million on a $155 million budget). The success of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg’s original and star-driven Daddy’s Home ($240 million worldwide over Christmas alongside Star Wars: The Force Awakens) would mark the end of an era.
2016 onward would see a deluge of failed franchise titles (Star Trek Beyond, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ghost in the Shell) and the downturn of the once invincible Transformers series ($605 million for The Last Knight in 2017 and $467 million for the $130 million Bumblebee in 2018). Yes, there were a few bright spots (A Quiet Place, Mission: Impossible - Fallout), but the death of the star-driven studio programmer meant that the studio that made its mark via Tom Cruise dramas, Eddie Murphy comedies, Harrison Ford actioners and Sam Jackson/Tommy Lee Jones thrillers was at an impasse. Stars mattered far less than IP and marquee characters. The franchises they still had (Transformers, Star Trek, TMNT) or tried to launch (Ghost in the Shell, Baywatch) weren’t measuring up. So now, we’re seeing the studio retreating into former glories.
They are trying to revive G.I. Joe. They’re planning another Paranormal Activity movie for 2021. Platinum Dunes is doing another reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. And, now, Paramount has two new Transformers movies on tap. We’re allegedly getting an animated prequel from Toy Story 4 director Josh Cooley and we’re getting a new live-action Transformers movie on June 24, 2022. I don’t know which of the two “in-development” Transformers projects this is, either the Bumblebee sequel or a Beast Wars movie, but the franchise faces the same problem it has since 2017. Transformers is no longer the biggest (in terms of scale, spectacle and bang for your buck) franchise around and at least some of the fandom was not from the IP but from Michael Bay’s specific interpretation of the property. I hope these films work out, commercially at least.
That Bumblebee and Star Trek Beyond were well-received didn’t prevent a lower-than-hoped-for box office gross, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows was the best TMNT movie since the first one in 1990. Nonetheless, these franchise revivals are all cut from the same cloth as Paramount and Fox/Disney’s doomed Terminator: Dark Fate, by which they exist/will exist not because audiences demand it but because studio executives do. I don’t know what will become of Star Trek as a theatrical property, although both the Noah Hawley’s revamp and the Quentin Tarantino flick seem less-than-likely. Marvel, DreamWorks and Indiana Jones are lost to them. Meanwhile, launching new “big” franchises is almost impossible today. Paramount has little choice to try to resurrect the franchises that soared highest during that 2007-2014 period where Paramount was the Disney of its day. Good luck.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Six Years After ‘Amazing Spider-Man 2’ Stumbled, Sony’s New Marvel Universe Gets A Terrible New Name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six years ago, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed and put a temporary end to Sony's hopes of an MCU-like Spidey franchise.
We got word yesterday that Sony has settled on a new name for their official universe/franchise/brand of Spider-Man and Spider-Man-related Marvel flicks. Following Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far from Home, both of which are technically part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Venom, Sony is on the brink of the very thing they sought six years ago on this day. They may just get their own Marvel cinematic universe, one which may or may not be loosely included in Disney DIS ’s current MCU. That’s the good news. The bad news is that the name is, frankly, kinda terrible. Instead of referring to this collection of movies as “the Spider-Verse” or maybe not giving it a name at all, the collection of Sony Spidey pictures will be called, uh, the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.
But first, a history lesson...
Today, May 2, is the sixth anniversary of the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The second of two Andrew Garfield/Marc Webb Peter Parker passion plays opened amid mixed reviews to a $93 million domestic launch, following a slow overseas roll-out beginning as early as April 17. The film’s reception is a complicated one. It crashed and burned in North America, earning just $202 million domestic compared to the $262 million cume of Amazing Spider-Man and the $336-$403 million cumes (sans inflation) of the previous Sam Raimi-directed trilogy. It performed slightly better than the previous Amazing Spider-Man movie overseas, earning $506 million compared to its 2012 predecessor’s $496 million cume. The $709 million global finish was considered a disappointment, both due to a $255 million budget and (more importantly) in terms of plans for a Sony-specific universe of Spider-Man movies and spin-offs.
While the movie itself was mostly stand-alone, save for a needless subplot involving Peter’s dead parents and a mid-credits tease for a potential Sinister Six movie down the road, the marketing and in-studio expectations set the film up as a backdoor pilot for a whole new world of Spider-Man heroes and Spider-Man villains. Moreover, the film pandered to the hardcore fan base by killing off its female lead (Emma Stone’s Gwen Stacey) which also removed both the new franchise’s most popular character and the new series’ most unique element (the romantic chemistry between Garfield and Stone). Alas, when the film was met with mediocre reviews and shockingly poor domestic legs, it meant that A) audiences were not jazzed for The Amazing Spider-Man 3 and B) audiences were certainly not jazzed for various spin-off movies (Venom, a young Aunt May spy flick, etc.).
Six years later, Sony seems to have discovered the gold at the end of the rainbow which they were pursuing with Marc Webb’s doomed Spider-Man reboot. Spider-Man: Homecoming, featuring Tom Holland as a young Peter Parker palling around with Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and the rest of the MCU,earned solid reviews and $334 million domestic/$881 million worldwide on a $175 million budget, which is frankly what the Amazing Spider-Man movies should have cost. That’s one reason why Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a “flop” at $709 million but the $170 million-budgeted Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a “blockbuster” at $714 million in the same year. Spider-Man: Far From Home was sold as an epilogue to Avengers: Endgame and earned $390 million/$1.128 billion on a $165 million budget, passing Skyfall ($1.108 billion) as Sony’s biggest global grosser.
More importantly, Tom Hardy’s Venom overcame years of dismissal to score an $80 million domestic debut on its way to $214 million domestic, $279 million in China and $854 million worldwide on a mere $90 million budget. Jared Leto’s Morbius was supposed to open this July but will now debut in March of next year. Oh, and Sony’s animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse brought Miles Morales into the fold, earned rave reviews, earned $190 million domestic/$375 million worldwide (great for a superhero toon) and won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature over Pixar’s $1.2 billion-grossing Incredibles 2. A sequel has now been slated for October 23, 2022. Venom: Let There Be Carnage (starring Woody Harrelson as Carnage) will now open on June 25, 2021.
So the good news is that Sony may just get the “Spider-Man cinematic universe” they’ve been chasing for years. The bad news is that they’ve settled on an inexplicably terrible title for their franchise/brand. To be fair, a dumb name for a cinematic universe isn’t going to be a deal breaker if the movies work on a case-by-case basis. Shock of shocks, Reuben Fleischer’s Venom turned out to be an entirely stand-alone superhero origin story with only a standard mid-credit sequel tease, so it seems that Sony is learning the Iron Man lesson (happy 12th birthday to the first Iron Man, which opened May 2, 2008) of making stand-alone movies that work on their own terms. Nonetheless, why the hell they didn’t just call this the “Spider-Verse” is beyond me. That’s what we’ve all been calling it for the last year or two anyway.
It rolls off the tongue and it reminds folks of one of the best superhero movies ever made. The “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” feels like a name created by an algorithm meant to clog headlines and never be spoken by anyone outside of the industry or the media. I don’t think folks are going to be using “SPUMC” either. As Iron Man taught us 12 years ago, a ridiculous word salad (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) only works when it can be shortened to something snappy (S.H.I.E.L.D.). Yes, Into the Spider-Verse was a singular franchise and the Sony Marvel flicks won’t just be about Spider-Man, but heck, calling it “Sony Pictures’ Marvel Characters Universe” would at least get folks to (unofficially) call it “Sony’s MCU.” Which, especially if Michael Keaton’s Vulture is showing up in Morbius, is probably an accurate assessment.
This can only be an issue because Sony was successful in launching four well-received, commercially-successful and (save for Venom) well-reviewed Spider-Man or Spider-Man-ish comic book superhero flicks. The deal Disney and Sony reached in early 2015 allowed for a new Spider-Man series within the MCU, while also turning Andrew Garfield into the George Lazenby of the series. Yes, Holland is Roger Moore compared to Toby Maguire’s Sean Connery, and that’s not an insult to any of them. Even Venom shows that spin-offs can work. A really silly franchise name is A) mere trivia if the movies score and B) indicative of the kind of executive overthinking that turned Amazing Spider-Man from a cheap “Twilight with webs” into a $235 million “Spidey does Batman Begins” remake of Spider-Man and forced Amazing Spider-Man 2 to be a backdoor pilot for Sinister Six. Let’s hope I’m just overthinking it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Best Ways To Get A Nintendo Switch Right Now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We’re now two-ish months into quarantine, depending on where you are, and the Nintendo Switch hasn’t gotten any easier to find. The hybrid portable/living room console became a smash hit early on as people both sought new activities to while away quarantined hours for both themselves and their children and to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo’s surprising smash hit life simulator. While the company is reported to be increasing production and has said that more stock is on the way, the console remains difficult to find.
Here’s the truth: the Nintendo Switch is unlikely to be easy to find at MSRP for a long time now. That’s both because of the aforementioned demand and because price-gougers have taken over the marketplace using bots to snag any online availability and then shipping them over to Amazon and eBay at an inflated price point that seems to hover around $500. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that phyiscal retail is closed nearly everywhere right now, so you can’t expect to get around the bots by showing up in-person.
If you live in a state where restrictions are starting to ease, there’s a chance that a retailer selling Switches might open up. Some, like Target and Walmart, have been open throughout the crisis as essential businesses, but even then stock has been near-impossible to find. As things ease up, physical retail will be an easier place to find new consoles than online, but remember to be safe, to wear a mask, and to practice social distancing.
If you absolutely want a new console right now, you likely have no choice than to get one from a reseller at a significant markup.
You should be reminded, however, that the base model Switch is not the only machine in this console family. Nintendo released the Switch Lite last fall, and it’s a capable little handheld. You can’t play it on the TV, and the side controllers don’t come off for multiplayer action. It’s less than ideal if you want to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the family, but it’s great if you’re trying to get your kid something to do.
Switch Lite comes in and out of stock from time to time, but it’s available right now at Amazon.
Even if you’re remiss to get the “budget” console, it’s worth considering either for a child or for yourself. It’s more portable for anyone with a public transit commute, for one thing, and it plays everything that the Switch plays. Other than that, you’ll need to wait or shell out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Big Plot Twist Of ‘Final Fantasy VII Remake’ Is Brilliant - But I Hate It</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Final Fantasy VII fans have been waiting for a remake for a very, very long time. This particular remake, however, might not be what fans of the original had in mind.
Spoilers Ahead 
If you played Final Fantasy VII when it first came out, you knew you were experiencing something special; it changed players' expectations of what games could be, what kind of stories they were capable of telling. 
I think the game has aged (relatively) well; the developers were incredibly inventive, despite the limitations of the Playstation. But there are certain aspects to the game that haven’t really aged badly - they’ve always been intolerable. 
Randomized battles, the dull drudgery of leveling up, the sparse amount of save points, the weird dialogue and pixelated graphics (although I'll defend that beautiful background art to the death). Sometimes, I replay the original game for a dose of nostalgia, but I can’t deny that vast stretches of it are mind-numbingly frustrating. 
Not long after release, fans wanted a remake, just to see Cloud and co look … well, human, closer to the way Squall and his friends were depicted in Final Fantasy VIII, or the cutesy, retro character designs of Final Fantasy IX; anything but those blocky, lego-like models.
Time went on, and talk of a potential remake kept getting shut down, but the rumors never really went away. I’m still surprised it actually happened; that first tech demo was fifteen years ago.   It's been so long that, to be perfectly frank, by the time Final Fantasy VII Remake finally rolled around, I’d stopped caring. But I figured I’d give it a go, as opposed to obsessively revisiting the original classic. 
There’s a lot to admire about Final Fantasy VII Remake. Combat is infinitely more enjoyable, and there’s a certain thrill in revisiting these familiar locations, redesigned and polished. Obviously, the soundtrack is perfect. But when you’ve been waiting to revisit a treasured piece of fiction for decades, the return often disappoints. 
Not necessarily because of the failings of the fiction itself, but the fact that your personal, idealized version of said fiction will never come to pass. That’s a childish way to look at it, no doubt, but it's often the way we view stories we enjoyed as a child.   
I love the meandering, melodramatic story of the original game, but I was surprised to see that the remake didn’t cut the bloat, but added to it; elaborate, unnecessary backstories and pointless quests pad out a section of the story that simply didn’t need the extra time. 
Sure, Midgar feels more alive than it did before, but it never felt empty. It served as an introduction to a vast world, and throwing the player into an act of eco-terrorism that does nothing but devastate the inhabitants of a depraved slum was a bold narrative choice that set the tone for the rest of the journey. It was a great setting, the beginning of a great adventure.  
The remake reminds me, oddly enough, of Star Wars. The original being a tightly paced film that promised a wider world, lurking beyond the horizon. But Star Wars feels emptier with each revision, each rambling explanation and backstory; the constant tinkering replaced that mystical ambiguity with an abundance of empty mythology, and plot holes. 
And just like a certain breed of Star Wars fan, unhealthily furious with The Last Jedi, I find myself deeply disappointed with the fact that the developers made significant changes to the story, that they dared alter the sacred canon of Final Fantasy VII. 
When Sephiroth made his first appearance, early into the game, my heart sank. “This isn’t the way it’s supposed to be,” the fanboy inside me whispered. And when the actual “Whispers” made their appearance, I was baffled. 
I wanted to replay the game I loved as a kid, rather than experience a meta-narrative, a remake that incorporates its own identity into the story. The Whispers being holders of fate and original canon are a bold narrative decision, absolutely, but it wasn’t what I signed up for. 
I kept playing, regardless, because I was, admittedly, intrigued. And I started to ask myself, “What did you sign up for, exactly? Did you just want to retread familiar ground, and smile at the memories?” That would be like watching Han Solo and Chewie in The Force Awakens; old, grizzled, but still exactly the same, all character development having halted, just to tickle the viewer’s nostalgia. It’s cheap and ultimately unsatisfying, like the majority of fan service.
Final Fantasy VII took me to another world, once, but things have changed. I’ve changed, although the world and story of the game are, technically, more relevant than ever before. But repeating it all, beat-for-beat, might just be a waste of time. 
This is a remake, sure, but it’s still a new game, a new experience and a fresh take on the story. The idea of a rigid destiny, kept in shape by the Whispers, is undeniably interesting. It felt intrusive to me, looking for familiarity, but it’s a clever way of breaking canon, by acknowledging it. 
One of my favorite game series ever, Legacy of Kain, featured a character unhappy with his destiny, who took great pains to alter it, against the iron will of fate itself. It was an incredible idea, and in the world of Final Fantasy VII Remake, adds another layer to an already complex narrative. 
It modernizes this piece of iconic nineties nostalgia, imbuing the tale with a self-aware irony, telling us that the story we waited so long to hear, again, has changed in the telling.
I’m disappointed, sure, but to be honest, I was already disappointed. Because I, like many others, have desperately wanted to play a remake of this game for years, and already envisioned how it would play out. 
In my dream scenario, Final Fantasy VII Remake would cut the bloat of its stretched-out story, rewrite that wonky script, hire competent voice actors, and Barrett wouldn’t wear sunglasses at night time. And it would be rendered with vivid, colorful cel-shading. I mean, just look at the original character designs; they’re cartoons, bursting with personality. 
Final Fantasy VII is, at heart, a ridiculously over-the-top anime, whose insane plot twists and meandering side-stories function so well because the character development never falters, and the game generally understood when to be serious and when to be whimsical. 
Subsequent spin-offs and said remake tend to take themselves a bit too seriously, considering the inherent absurdity of … everything. It’s not the same, but Final Fantasy VII Remake isn’t trying to be - not fully, anyway.  
No doubt, we all have our own vision of what the remake should be, and I think it’s commendable that the creative team at Square Enix came up with something new, that builds on the original, paying homage to the classic game without being slavishly chained to it.  
It’s not “my” game anymore, and I don’t know if I’ll play the next installment, but I must admit - I’m curious to see where the story goes from here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Part 2: ‘I’m Always Paying Attention To Where My Power Is, Especially During The Coronavirus’: Rhonda Ross Shares Wisdom On Coping</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 10th is Mother’s Day. This two-part series about mom-daughter duo, Rhonda and Diana Ross, is dedicated to Moms everywhere. Before social distancing mandates, I attended a Diana Ross concert with no idea who the opening act would be. It turned out to be daughter, Rhonda Ross. A singer/songwriter in her own right, Rhonda’s own unique style and incredible voice brought the house down. It was obvious to me that, following in her mom’s footsteps, Rhonda has the chops to make it big. But something else about this singer/songwriter captivated me. Her latest album, “In Case You Didn’t Know,” reflects her life philosophy of resilience, knowing where you hold your personal power and how they sustain you through the kind of hard knocks we’re all experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rhonda shared her personal approach to dealing with the Coronavirus anxiety in the second part of my interview.
Bryan Robinson: Rhonda, how do you spend your time on the road?
Rhonda Ross: I take my physical, mental and spiritual health extremely seriously. And I do that in all parts of my life wherever I am. One of the things I do on tour is spend a lot of time paying attention to my thoughts. I’m a thought person. When I’m public speaking, I tell a joke that I’m a power monger. I’m always paying attention to where I have power, where I’m holding on to it and where I’m giving it away. One of the places where my power resides is in my thoughts, “What am I thinking about whatever is happening in my life right now?” I’ve worked on that in my quote “time off.” I listen to spiritual teachers. I’m not a TV watcher, except for conscious watching. I can be in a hotel for two weeks and not turn on a TV. I don’t even realize it’s there. I watch very little news. I have a digital subscription to The New York Times and go there to read an article here and there. But I don’t leave the TV on loop.
Robinson: I wanted to circle back to what you said about where you hold your power because this has significance for readers struggling with COVID-19 fears and job loss in the era of social distancing, along with the mindset they take to work. Could you talk a little more about how you do that.
Ross: I’m very aware that the way I feel about something has less to do with what that something is and more to do with how I’m looking at it. We get stuck in thinking that the feeling we’re having is coming from what the thing is; therefore, we have to change what the thing is so we can feel better and not be stressed out or depressed. But that way of thinking gives me no power because I have to change that thing which is very likely unchangeable. And even if it is changeable, it will take crazy amounts of energy on my part to change it. That goes from everything from the government to my husband who doesn’t do the dishes when I want him to. I can’t change him, and I can’t change my son.
Robinson: You’re talking about your perspective.
Ross: It’s all about my perspective, so what is it about my perspective that I have control over? I have control of how I see it, how much I focus on it, how much energy and time I give to it, how much mental space I give to it. Let’s take the coronavirus, for example. I can’t stop a global virus. So I can be stressed or scared or tense about it, which will only hurt me in terms of high blood pressure or depression and other mental and physical problems. Or I can look at the parts of it that are not as scary like how many people have recovered from it. And I can do the things in my life that help me feel in control or give me back my power. I can wipe down the phone, keep my hands clean, I can keep my immunity up. I can get sleep and drink water and make sure I’m not running myself ragged. One of the things that gives me power and control is to not think about what’s going to happen two weeks or six months from now because no one knows. I can focus in the now, be present and know that for right now I’m healthy and safe. I’m not with my son right now and there’s a feeling of wanting to micromanage his hand washing from thousands of miles away. I’m going to trust that they’re doing it. I’m going to breathe and take time to not freak out and panic. This is all to say what things can I control and what things do I have power in. When you focus on where your power is and activate things you have power over, you feel like you’re not being batted around by life. You’re not being thrown up against the wall. You get to walk in your own control, and that is huge for me whether it be the coronavirus or anything else. I’m always thinking about where my power is in this moment and where am I giving it away whether it’s to something else or to somebody else’s opinion.
Robinson: That’s so wise. Our power comes from what we do with what life brings us, because we can’t change life. I love the way you put that.
Ross: I like to think about it like a sailboat. The wind comes, but you don’t get angry at the wind and say, “Why are you coming from the north? You’re not supposed to be coming from the north!” You adjust your sails and keep going by adjusting your sails. That’s where your power is: the adjustment of how you handle what’s coming at you. I think we get into the habit of complaining about everything from the weather to our circumstances. Just the alleviation of that one habit can change how you think. Then going one step further beyond complaining is appreciating how beautiful that tree is blowing in the wind or what great color on that woman or that bird as it’s flying. You talk about something that will reduce stress, it’s walking through life with appreciation.
Robinson: It absolutely will. And it will draw others to you. People want to be around that kind of energy.
Ross: It’s true. I was laughing with my husband some years ago. We were on a flight and he was in a mood, complaining about everything. As soon as we were airborne, the seat in front of him came back but his seat wouldn’t go back, then something else didn’t work (laughs). And he was feeling everything was going wrong, but everything was going right for me. I said to him, “You came on the plane already in a complaining space, and you had a terrible flight, and I had a great flight. And I was sitting right beside you.” It has nothing to do with the objectivity of it. It’s the subjectivity of how one person can be walking through life seeing all the great and beautiful things and attract the nice people. And somebody else can be having a totally different experience. My personal belief is that the difference in your experience is tied to your thoughts, your perceptions and how much you’re complaining or appreciating.
Robinson: That’s so true.
Ross: There are times when things don’t go well for me. My first thought, instead of blaming the world for it, is to ask where my head is and how I found myself here. And I don’t even have to go back and figure it out. I can switch it right now in the moment. That’s my practice and my work all day whether I’m on tour or not. With the kind of pace and routine we have, thinking like that has allowed for everything to go smoothly. Everything I talk about is in my music. To me it’s all the same whether I’m speaking, singing or living—it’s all the same stuff.
Happy Mother’s Day!

    <h5 class="mb-1">One Of The Best Games This Generation Is Free On PS4, But Not Forever</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Generally speaking, if someone gets a PS4 or an Xbox One, I tell them to get Hitman. Sometimes I tell them to get Hitman 2, but the basic gist is the same: these are some of the best games out this generation full-stop, fascinating board games of intrigue, death and perfectly-tailored pants. Hitman is free on PS4 right now, and you should really go play it.
You don’t have forever to play, however. The game is only free this weekend, until May 3. Afterwards, however, it’s not exactly expensive: Hitman: Game of the Year Edition is only $9, and Hitman 2 is only $18. Both are eminently worth it.
The idea is this: you are Agent 47, a genetically-engineered assassin tasked with infiltrating the enclaves of the ultra-rich, from a high-end resort in Bangkok to a fashion show in a Parisian mansion. You’re welcome in parts of each level, but not the whole thing: to get to where you need to be you’ll need a wealth of tricks, disguises and stealth. The goal is sort of what you make it, but ultimately you want to eliminate a series of targets with as little attention but as much fanfare as possible. Each level comes with a range of scenarios ranging from the straightforward to the outlandish, giving 47 a chance to expose his targets and kill them in poetic ways.
For example: a fashion icon uses models as agents to steal international secrets that she then sells. Find the model on his cell phone, knock him out, take his clothes and get your makeup done to look like his. Use your new look to lure the target into a one-on-one meeting. Poison her drink for the celebratory toast, or just garrote her as soon as she closes the door.
Or, if you want: set off some fireworks to lure both her and her partner out to admire. Push her off the balcony onto your first target, eliminating both. Things are wacky that way.
Each level of Hitman is an intricate machine of interlocking characters and systems just waiting to be thrown into chaos. It’s one the most engrossing series I’ve played in years, and now you can give it a shot for free.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Curator Nino Macharashvili: ‘Culture Is Not Canceled’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered the normal landscape of life, pushing almost everything online, including art. Art world is evolving to fit within the new constraints outlined by coronavirus, offering a new type of virtual support system, a platform of expression for a growing online audience.
According to Georgian curator Nino Macharashvili, art is finding new ways to exist, as it is a universal language, which has the demonstrated power to change the world. A Facebook group called “Izoizolyacia” has gained over half a million followers since March 30th, with a hashtag #artisolation. Its followers post homemade replicas of famous artworks from all over the world. The sense of humor and ingenuity of some of its members have gone viral well beyond the limits of this public group. Art offers hope for some, and an escape from reality for many.

Long before the outbreak of COVID-19, Macharashvili was exploring the complexity of art in a digital world and how it changes within the elements of nature. “I’ll remember forever, how the pandemic separated all of us, and, at the same time, united the world with a common problem,” said Macharashvili after attending “The Immigrant Artist” zoom session, an online forum where artists converged to exchange ideas, vent frustrations, and support one another. The cut-throat, competitive world of art has taken a long pause and a new kind of camaraderie has emerged. We are in this together, after all.
As an art curator, Macharashvili helps translate and convey the meaning of contemporary art to viewers. Unlike previous art movements like the Renaissance or Post-Impressionism, Contemporary Art is not defined by certain constraints or ideals, making it more difficult to decipher and in need of ‘translators.’ According to Macharashvili, “Contemporary art in its essence is very complex, controversial and, like our lives, it doesn’t contain ‘universal ideas’ and ‘undoubtable beliefs’.” she explains. On the contrary, contemporary artists are constantly questioning the reality and the ‘social norms’. Macharashvili’s mission is to help art viewers understand the true intention of the artist’s work, when it isn’t instantly clear. Even then, the curator peels each piece of art layer by layer to reveal the truth that is measured against the past, the present, and when applicable, the future. 
However, rather than be stifled by COVID-19 pandemic, Macharashvili is urging fellow artists to use this unique opportunity to fuel their creativity. There are new questions to be answered, new points to draw inspiration from, and new ideas to be discovered. ﻿“Contemporary world and contemporary art are changing every day,” she said. “Creative people are wired to create, and despite that some believe that #2020iscanceled, ‘culture is not canceled’.
How do you envision the post-pandemic art world?
We are living in one of the most interesting eras of human history. The digital revolution has fundamentally changed the world, and in 2020, coronavirus pandemic is forcing the entire world to live online. Mass gatherings such as art fairs, exhibitions, biennials, festivals and concerts will be the last kind of public activity to start after the lock-down. Some events were postponed to Fall, but some of them were canceled for the rest of 2020.
Artists and art organizations are trying to adapt to changes, and attempt to present exhibitions online, conduct zoom meetings, and promote their practice. It’s very interesting for me to witness the change that is happening, specifically how we behave online. What used to be reserved only for official work calls, my Zoom sessions have become a very intimate space of sharing emotions and difficulties during this challenging time. 
The Immigrant Artist zoomsession touched my heart. It was the beginning of self-isolation and everyone was stressed, sensitive and unused to these conditions. The artists were talking about how difficult it was to concentrate or create art these days. One participant cried while talking about the family and her immigration ordeal, and that she was alone in NYC, and we were her only ‘family.’ Over 70 people participated in this session. I’ll remember that first virtual meeting forever, how the pandemic separated us all, and at the same time united us all against the shared problem. 
I envision that existential issues and environmental problems will be more reflected in the works of contemporary artists than ever before.
Do you see any emerging trends, especially among art auctions? 
Despite the fact that purchasing art online, under normal circumstances, is a rather uncomfortable experience, online art sales value grows every year and has reached over $67 billion dollars in 2018. 
The pandemic shift has happened so quickly and it is hard to believe that the whole art world is online now. However, I am sure many of us have noticed that the galleries and auctions nowadays showcase more objects of home design, furniture, and alike. Current Phillips Auction – ‘Hard-Edged: Online Auction’ features 20 works and 12 of them are unique furniture and lighting objects. At the same time, all lots bought at this auction will be held in the storage for 30 days until the further notice. Now, when the home is the only space we are spending our life in, decorations (home design and decor) are more important.
I predict that online art sales will be less than previous years. Though, Sotheby’s announce that ‘collectors are still actively buying art online’. Now more than ever, we should support artists and small art businesses, when we can. 
This crisis affected every individual and business – small or big. However, big galleries having multiple international locations can overcome this challenge easier than smaller art organizations. I want to think optimistically, but, obviously, many small art businesses may stop functioning this year, there are already early indications of this trend. 
There are many countries not able to support art and culture, because the majority of the society thinks art and culture is not vital for a human being, especially when basic economic needs aren’t being met. As British art historian Michael Baxandall once quipped, works of art are, among other things, are ‘fossils of economic life’.
Instagram has become a most important social media platform in the art world affecting the art market. You can buy artwork directly through Instagram. Artists, galleries and other art organizations try to keep social media platforms active and offer the customers ‘appropriate product’ (including custom face coverings or gloves). For example, anonymous Instagram account @JerryGogosian with 70K followers, posts art-memes and leads an AM art radio podcast. 
Here are a key resources curator Macharashvili would recommend for American artists to explore for support during coronavirus pandemic:

What has your art journey been like?
Art has always been part of my life since my childhood. My grandmother was a director of the Culture House in Georgia and she shared her love of art with me. We visited museums and galleries together in Tbilisi.
I graduated from Tbilisi State University and continued my research in contemporary art as a PhD student. My experience in the art includes working in different countries: at the contemporary art galleries and creative agencies for artists, art fairs, the Museum and the University. Also, I’ve worked as an independent art professional and I’m a co-founder of a Non-for-profit organizations in Georgia: ‘ARCHEIΔ’ and ‘Art for Social Change’.
Sometimes, it was not easy to make a living as an art professional in the country of Georgia and I think, not only there, but in other places as well. However, because of my passion for the arts, I dedicated myself to it and was always happy with my choice.
Where do you see yourself making the biggest impact?
I consider myself a cosmopolitan, appreciating every culture and country. At the same time, I’m happy to be born in this amazing country of Georgia. Georgia is a mixture of European and Asian motifs with a unique style. You will meet Synagogue, ancient Orthodox Church and Mosque together in the tiny Old Town. The mixture of eastern and western elements was transformed into the original Georgian motives, this is why  Georgian culture is so unique. 
Georgian Contemporary Art scene is an interesting part of the international art world. Actually, a big part of Georgian contemporary art has been created by Georgian artists living outside the country. Some of my favorites include Andro Wekua, Thea Djordjadze, Vajiko Chachkhiani, Ana K.E. Thea Gvetadze, Keti Kapanadze, Maia Naveriani, Gia Edzgveradze, Eteri Chkhadua, Koka Ramishvili, Tamara K.E. and Tamuna Sirbiladze exhibiting in the leading museums and galleries across the world. Together with Chkadua, we plan to present her multimedia installation ‘Alien Bloom’ at Svaneti Museum of History and Ethnography in Mestia, Georgia.
While presenting Georgian artists at the leading international art fairs and exhibitions in different counties, I realized that they were influenced by global art trends, and at the same time by their own visions. While competing with renowned contemporary artists they received significant interest from the international collectors, curators and press. During the last few years, contemporary art galleries popped up in Tbilisi. Tbilisi Art Fair is held annually from 2018. We have made great progress, but the sustainable art market doesn’t yet exist in Georgia.
Describe your curating logic mechanism? Share with us your process on how do you put together a group show?
Curator is a creator of a new narrative, gathering artist’s works in a unique way and concept and creating a new artwork. Curator’s medium is an exhibition. In my view, a curator is an artist too, playing with images, visions, concepts and space. The same artworks exhibited differently may cause different feelings and opinions about the artist by the viewer. If some artist’s work may be very private and may stay in the studio, the curator’s work is public and based on the engagement of visitors.
Creating an exhibition is a very intimate ritual for me. Before hanging I try to design the compositions in my mind, on paper or in the form of a curatorial model. I always want to listen to the artist, their concept and wishes. But, the exhibition is a work of a curator and sometimes, I can’t consider all artists’ views. When an artist wants to show as many works as possible, my role really becomes crucial. A curator can show the development of an artist's work, without running the risk of creating wasted space.
I work hard in order for my exhibitions to be based on research, strong concepts, and the space is also very important to me. 
What kind of space excites you? 
My passion is site-specific exhibitions, experimental spaces, and brown-fields.
Site-specific exhibition gives you more space for experimentation and creative thinking. Also, the geographical location is very important to perceive the artworks separately and the exhibition in general. The rural areas were always more interesting to me then the capital city where people know more about contemporary art, museums and exhibitions.
Can you mention some specific examples?
I co-founded ARCHEIΔ, an art initiative supporting multicultural collaboration of artists, artisans and designers in 2017 and organized art residency in the Imereti Region of Georgia. Young girls, living in the small village, attended textile workshops and created artworks which I presented at the former wine factory in Obcha. 
Lado Pochkhua's site-specific exhibition was held in the former railway station soviet building. The Book for the New Aristocracy series were perfectly matching the colorful interior of the railway station building. It’s always interesting to me working in the building which had a completely different function before and transforming it by creative experimentation.  
In 2017, I organized the exhibition series ‘Moving Images’ at Moving Gallery - a shipping container transformed to a gallery space which can move to any location desired. It was  a shipping container tour presenting 3 Georgian contemporary artists’ solo exhibitions In Tbilisi and different regions of Georgia. 
Your biggest role to date has been a chief curator of Georgian Museum of Fine Arts, what was the most important lesson you learned from that experience?
Georgian Museum of Fine Arts is a new art museum displaying the family collection of its founders, Gia Jokhtaberidze and Manana Shevardnadze. 3500 works of Soviet and Post-soviet art collection are distributed over the three floors of the museum. It is the only building in Georgia built purposely to host art exhibitions and was opened in 2018.
Chief curator was the highest position at this museum structure and it became a very different experience from all of my previous jobs at the galleries, university or non-profit-organizations. Here, I had a bigger mission, more power, and greater responsibilities. About 15 young women including museum attendants, receptionists and assistants - all were part of our team. Learning how to successfully work all together for the museum's success has become my daily lesson.

You were a professor at the same time. How did you balance it all?
I worked as an invited lecturer of Georgian Art at Tbilisi State University. My students were future guides with a desire to explore more about this challenging job of a curator. While giving them theoretical knowledge and sharing practical experience, we visited architectural sites and museums and galleries together. Sometimes, it’s difficult to perceive contemporary art for a visitor. For example, everyone is impressed with Botticelli’s Primavera and it’s a ‘universal truth’ that this piece is a masterpiece. But, modern and contemporary artworks are more difficult for visitors to understand. I found passion doing this work and it was easy to balance my most passionate interests: art and education!
Project ArtBeat has gained a lot of popularity due to their earlier groundbreaking exhibitions, much to your credit. What new avenues did that project open for you?
I can say that working at the pioneering contemporary art gallery in Tbilisi a very interesting period of my life. I’ve gained invaluable experience while organizing solo and group exhibitions at the Moving Gallery by Project ArtBeat, at the permanent exhibition space – in the unique historic building of an old town and different museums in Georgia. 
The most interesting discovery to me was how I changed my attitude from towards the art market. Project ArtBeat had a very active exhibition and art fair program. I’ve worked on several art projects simultaneously. Presenting Project ArtBeat booths at 11 international art fairs, I found the art market was a very interesting field and realized that I’ve not had the complete picture of the contemporary art world while studying at the university. How different were the sales at Art Dubai and Contemporary Istanbul as compared to Art Vilnius or Kyiv Art Week. I was extremely happy when Turkish businessman, art patron and collector Ali Koc bought 2 paintings from our booth and collector and curator Huma Kabakci purchased artworks and exhibited them at the renowned Pera Museum in Istanbul. 
What was your most memorable project from ArtBeat?
From my curated projects most memorable for me is Shots Across the Plane, a video show which I curated together with Jeremy Gales in May, 2018. We were working on this exhibition for 2 years, after we met in Contemporary Istanbul and eventually, the event was organized by Project ArtBeat at the Museum of Modern Art in Tbilisi, Georgia. I’m proud that the exposition showcased video art masterpieces by prominent contemporary artists: Pipilotti Rist, Hito Steyerl, Janet Biggs, Dana Sederowsky and 2 Georgian artists Tamara K.E. and Tamar Chaduneli. 
Tell me a little bit about FLAG Art Group ? 
In 2019, FLAG Art Group, a creative agency for artists and art organizations was founded in Fort Lee, NJ. As I don’t have a work permit in the US yet, I contributed my insights free of charge to a new art organization, curated the show Beyond Cultural Identities in West New York, NJ and published a gallery catalogue featuring contemporary artists and articles by art professionals. It was an honor to work with an American institution like FLAG Art Group.
If you could have dinner with any artist dead or alive, whom would it be? 
Undoubtedly, I would choose avant-garde artist Petre Otskheli (1907-1937) who revolutionized Georgian scenography. His stage and costume design is a masterpiece and ‘world heritage’. A victim of Stalinist repression, Otskheli has outrun time, a genius who passed away at the same age I’m now. In 1937 he was executed as ‘a member of the counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization’.
I’ve asked people (not related to the art world) to guess the date when these works were created and almost everyone thought they were made by contemporary artists. I would tell Petre that after 100 years, his artworks give me feelings of happiness, pride and motivation at the same time and I’d ask him to tell me whatever he would like to about his life.
Textile arts - what is it?
Recently, while talking to the artist Levan Mindiashvili (who explores different techniques and media in his work – e.g. sculptures translated into tapestries), I mentioned that a few years ago, I discovered contemporary textile arts was extremely interesting to me.
In this medium, it’s difficult to ‘lie’, I mean, to create something not authentic to the artist. We talked about how handmade works become more important during crises. In the self-quarantine, ‘home’ gained a new meaning. As an extrovert, it’s my first time enjoying being at home, home design and hand-made objects became more important to me and I think for the other people too.
Eventually, I decided to create a textile arts exhibition concept and distribute it online. Not just uploading images and texts about the artists from different countries, but creating a virtual and, at the same time, intimate experience intended for online reality, without a necessity of an actual space. 
What is the most pressing question on your mind right now?
I’m just thinking about the clear water in Venice canals, or that the Himalayas are visible for the first time in decades as the lock-down reduced air pollution. What a big difference our ‘sitting home’ has made! Can we keep it up?  The etymology of the word ‘culture’ is connected to the ‘cultivation of the ‘soil’ and ‘mind’. Now, is the time when all residents of the earth should unite with the single idea of saving our world. Living with this idea means trying everything you do to be environmentally friendly. I wish to see more public art projects and environmental artists inspired by ecological ideas.
The best thing, happened to me during this period is that bicycles became the best mode of transportation from New Jersey to New York. I feel happy when I cross George Washington Bridge, and hear Google Maps voice say to me: ‘Welcome to New York City.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Coronavirus Is Making Artists Go Virtual - Here's How That's Changing Their Bond With Their Audience</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The recent spate of online musical offerings – Stephen Sondheim’s 90th birthday celebration, Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert - highlights the pandemic’s profound impact on the relationship between performers and their audiences. Musicians have been sorely affected, but these issues also apply to a range of performing talent from actors to TED-level keynote speakers. 
These days, my musician friends are all busy gearing up for the virtual world. Current topics of conversation? Which 4k camera should I get for live streaming? Does Apogee make the best noise-free mixer? Is the Shure sm7b useful for miking the underside of a grand piano? These days, the performer, it seems, must also be a production engineer.
While they up their virtual game, these artists also bemoan the limitations. One described the experience of virtual performing as “looking at fine art through a cardboard tube while standing in Times Square.” 
What do they miss?  First up, the kind of inspiring interaction that happens among musicians when they are live on stage. You may have seen musicians performing together – for example on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert - but these are likely not live at all, but rather individual, sheltered-in-place performances, synchronized by a click track, and then stitched together. 
The absence of a live audience is an even bigger deficiency, described by one musician friend as “soul crushing.”   Audiences energize performers through their show of appreciation and by the ‘vibe’ they create in a live venue. And that energy is fueled by the rituals and responsibilities of concert attendance. You commit to the performance by showing up, finding your seat and staying in it for the duration. Walking out in the middle of a performance would be awkward, to say the least. You read your program, settle into the buzz of being part of the audience. You express appreciation by applauding and sometimes rising to your feet in a standing ovation. You may try to find the artist afterwards in the hope of an autograph or a quick word. 
In the virtual performance, these rituals are largely absent. Swipe culture and multi-tasking create the potential for easy distraction and interfere with commitment and focus. The experience is comparatively flat, and not just in terms of sound quality. You can’t enjoy the hallowed ambiance of a Carnegie Hall, say, on Zoom, Twitch or Stageit. And clicking on a virtual tip jar is a poor substitute for the rituals of appreciation in a live venue.  
Many musicians have told me of a deeper fear, namely that the expansion of virtual performance will ultimately lead to the erosion of music itself. They are concerned that diluting the engrained rituals of appreciating live performance (and paying for it) will ultimately limit their opportunities. Time will tell, but it appears inevitable that we are heading into a hybrid world, where the convenience of the virtual will increasingly coexist with live performance. This raises troubling economic issues. You might be willing to pay $100 to hear pianist Lang Lang live in concert, but how much is the same music presented as a live stream going to be worth to you?  
So much angst. But is there a silver lining here? Certainly, technological innovation will make virtual performance better over time...and potentially different. It is in the nature of the internet to expand choice dramatically and thus create new patterns of demand. Whether you are a fan of vintage 1960’s bossa nova or 2020’s lo-fi, it will become easier to find exactly what fits with your tastes. And if not, there will be a friendly AI to help you.
Innovation will drive new business models and ways of enhancing the virtual experience. Making people pay for premium virtual performances through subscriptions is one way to ensure commitment. People won’t tune out as easily if they’ve paid for the ticket. And they may be more inclined to pay real money as technology finds new ways to enhance the virtual concert experience. The full flowering of augmented reality technology will enable scenarios in which a performer might “appear” in your living room or conversely where you can become an embodied presence in a virtual concert hall, complete with the ability to talk with the person next to you or even flirt with that interesting someone across the room.
New ways for the virtual audience to provide direct feedback to performers during a performance will also make their appearance. We’re already familiar with emojis that float into view during video conference chat. Why not virtual applause through massed button presses or mouse clicks? One could also imagine a “wow” or “I’m moved” button that provides feedback to performers, perhaps via changing colors projected on a wall.
The virtual domain also offers new opportunities for direct interaction with the artist. Virtual Q & A sessions and pre-concert talks could be enriched with personalization and multi-media. As examples, artists could digitally sign programs, autograph merchandise or give custom downloads. The traditional concert program could morph into a multi-sensory, multi-media experience. In the pandemic era, there is also the more mundane option of sending a program via mail.
Finally, the virtual domain brings scale into the equation. This is important for two reasons. First, scale can enable inclusion by attracting a more diverse audience that is no longer limited by zip code or income level. Second, scale creates new business models. EDM performer Marshmello made history in early 2019 by attracting over 10 million participants to a live performance inside the videogame Fortnite. And a recent virtual performance of Beethoven piano sonatas by pianist Jonathan Biss reportedly attracted over 280,000 attendees. Artists with a social media presence will be able to expand their audiences and generate potentially attractive economics as a result.  However, it remains to be seen whether the virtual domain will be as kind to the vast majority of musicians without a high level of visibility. A Venmo tip jar is just not enough to support a career.
The bottom line is that virtual performance is here to stay. The habits of virtual creation and consumption have become more deeply ingrained and will not likely return to being a simple curiosity. Astute artists will find ways to blend a schedule of live and virtual performances in a cadence that fits them as well as new patterns of audience demand. In addition, they will need to master new skills of social media, community management, and digital production that may have seemed like nice-to-haves but are now part of the new artists’ way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BTS’ Jungkook Breaks The Internet⁠ (Again⁠) With Twitter’s Most-Liked Tweet This Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jungkook, a member of beloved K-pop crew BTS, posted a video of himself singing on Twitter—and proceeded to break the Internet yet again⁠—in a tweet⁠ that received the most likes this week, according to data compiled by the social media tracking firm NewsWhip.
Jungkook, 22, sings a cover of BTS collaborator Lauv’s “Never Not” in the video, while the tweet is just two words: the song title, accompanied by a purple heart emoji.
As of Sunday afternoon (and 24 hours after the tweet posted) it had pulled in over 2.1 million likes and nearly 900,000 retweets.
In 2019, Forbes named BTS the world’s highest paid boy band and K-pop act with $57 million in pretax income.
Jungkook has a history of breaking the Internet; in 2018, Twitter Korea said a video of him singing was South Korea’s most-retweeted of the year.
Jungkook also wields massive influence over fans, with Merlot March wine, Downy laundry detergent and book I Decided To Live As Me all selling out once fans learned he liked those items.
NewsWhip’s Twitter engagement data comes from its database of influential users, which tracks around 350,000 accounts.
176 weeks. That’s how long BTS has been number one on Billboard’s Social 50, a list of the musical artists with the most social media reach. 
BTS, which has seven members, is the best-selling musical artist in South Korean history with over 20 million albums sold. In 2019, Big Hit Entertainment, the Seoul-based company that manages BTS, pulled in $63 million on a record $507 million in revenue. As of April 29, however, Big Hit postponed the group’s upcoming dates and refunded ticket purchases due to the coronavirus pandemic. Big Hit’s financial outlook, as with many other industries, remains murky as the virus continues to spread. “The lack of live events now makes the firm’s digital strategy especially critical,” writes Forbes’ Grace Chung. Beginning around 2011, Big Hit built a rabid BTS social following on Twitter, as well as YouTube and Instagram, by sharing moments (rehearsals, eating dinner) that made the band seem more relatable to fans. 
BTS is short for the Korean phrase “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” or 방탄소년단, which translates to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Cinco De Mayo Why Not Sample Some New Tequilas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are no shortages of official celebrations to commemorate tequila. There is National Tequila Day, which in the U.S. is celebrated on the third Friday in July. This year it falls on July 24. There is also an International Tequila Day, which is celebrated on the same day. In Mexico, National Tequila Day is celebrated on the third Saturday of March and is part of a week-long series of activities to commemorate tequila.
There is also National Margarita Day, which is celebrated every year on February 22, and which commemorates tequila’s signature cocktail. More than 1.6 billion margaritas are served in the U.S. every year, an average of more than 4.4 million a day. That’s a lot of margaritas! According to the Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS), the margarita is the most popular cocktail in the U.S., amounting to about 25 percent of all cocktails sold.
The most famous holiday associated with tequila and with its signature cocktail, however, is Cinco de Mayo. Celebrated each year on May 5, it has emerged as the principal day in which to commemorate tequila in the United States.
It has also become an occasion to honor Mexican culture and the contribution of Mexican Americans to the United States. The celebration have also given rise to the urban legend that more margaritas are served on Cinco de Mayo than any other day of the year. According to DISCUS, on Cinco de Mayo about half of all the cocktails served in America are margaritas.
Paradoxically, Cinco de Mayo has become a far more important holiday in the U.S. than it is in Mexico. In Mexico, Cinco de Mayo is not a national holiday. Other than for Puebla and Vera Cruz, most celebrations are rather low key. Usually not much more than a short military parade or marching band.
Cinco de Mayo commemorates the improbable victory of the Mexican army against a superior French military force at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862.
With the U.S. preoccupied with the Civil War between the Union and the Confederacy, France’s emperor, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte III, the nephew of his more famous namesake uncle, saw an opportunity to create a new French empire in Mexico.
In December 1861, a 6,000 strong French army landed in Vera Cruz and advanced toward Mexico City. At Puebla, on the main road to the capital, a Mexican army of some 2,000 poorly equipped soldiers made a stand against the superior French force. Outnumbered three to one against a better-trained and equipped force, the Mexican army won an improbable victory and crushed the French force. Cinco de Mayo celebrates that unlikely victory.
No one is quite sure how the association between tequila and Cinco de Mayo was established. Privately, many Mexican tequila producers point to Brown-Forman’s Herradura, one of Mexico’s leading tequila producers, as the instigator of using Cinco de Mayo as an occasion to promote tequila and, in particular, its signature cocktail the margarita.
Regardless of the cause, Cinco de Mayo has become an important holiday in the U.S.; a splendid occasion to celebrate Mexican culture and tequila’s ubiquitous cocktail—the margarita. Paradoxically, there are now more Cinco de Mayo parades in the U.S. than there are in Mexico.
The margarita has an equally colorful, though less historically significant history. It is a cocktail that consists of a mix of tequila, a sweet syrup or liquor and either the juice of a lime or lemon or a mix, typically sweetened, based on that juice. The relative proportions vary depending on the particular recipe and the ingredients used.
Generally, however, it is two-parts tequila to one-part sweet liqueur, to two to four-parts lime juice or mixer, depending on how strong the cocktail is made. Over the years, the sweet liquor portion has consisted of a broad range of spirits, including triple sec, Cointreau, Gran Marnier and Curaçao. The drink is typically served on the rocks or “frozen” as an icy slush. The rim of the glass is typically salted.
The origins of the margarita have never been determined and remain hotly debated. Notwithstanding its close Mexican association, most accounts of its invention place its creation either in the U.S. or along Mexican border towns catering to American tourists.
The first printed recipe to a margarita-like drink occurred in 1937. The Café Royal Cocktail Book has a recipe for a drink called a Picador consisting of tequila, triple sec and lime juice. Another explanation is that the margarita is simply a tequila-based version of a popular Prohibition era drink called a daisy. The original daisy was made with brandy, triple sec and lime juice. It’s possible that Americans frequenting Mexican border towns in the 1920s were offered a tequila-based version of the daisy. Interestingly, the Spanish word for daisy is margarita.
By 1945, tequila maker Jose Cuervo was already running advertisements promoting “margarita it’s more than a girl’s name.” According to Cuervo, the cocktail was invented in 1938, as a tribute to Mexican showgirl Rita de la Rosa. It’s likely that the margarita, both the name and the characteristic ingredients, were invented sometime between the 1920’s and 1945. Since most of the creation myths about the invention of the margarita occurred after those dates, it’s also likely that most of the popular accounts about the margarita’s invention are incorrect.
As of January 2020, there are a total of 151 distillers authorized by the Mexican government to produce tequila. Many of them produce multiple brands, both for themselves and for third parties. There are 1,465 brands of tequila bottled in Mexico and another 300 brands bottled outside of Mexico. By law, all expressions of 100% blue agave tequila must be bottled in Mexico. Tequila, which is less than 100% blue agave, what in the past was called mixtos, can be bottled anywhere. Mixtos tequila are fermented from a combination of at least 51% agave sugars and the balance from something else, typically corn syrup.
Below are tasting notes on a range of tequilas relatively new to the U.S. market. These are all expressions produced from existing distilleries for third parties. All of the tequilas are 100% blue agave. Bottle sizes are all 750 ml. The ARP is the average retail price in the U.S.
JAJA is a tequila brand created by Elliot Tebele, founder and CEO of Jerry Media, along with Maurice Tebele and Martin Hoffstein. He’s better known in social media circles as mememerchant@ f**kjerry. His Instagram account has millions of followers. JaJa is Mexican online slang for ha-ha, what in English would be LOL. Presumably that name was easier to clear through the TTB as an alcoholic beverage brand than his Instagram handle.
The tequila is produced at the La Cofradia distillery in Tequila (NOM 1137). The distillery produces 60 different brands, including such well known ones as Casa Noble and Mi Campo.
JAJA is triple distilled. Historically, tequila was double distilled, but triple distillation is becoming popular, especially among new brands, as it makes for a smoother tequila and is a point of differentiation from other brands.
JAJA Blanco, 40% ABV, ARP $36
On the nose, there is a classic raw agave/earthy aroma, with hints of apple and tropical fruit accompanied by a little licorice. On the palate, its smooth, fruity, with a noticeable pepperiness. The finish is medium length, with a lingering caramel note and a soft but persistent pepperiness.
JAJA Reposado, 40% ABV, ARP $43
The Reposado is aged in ex-bourbon barrels for six months. On the nose, there is a hint of oak that quickly gives way to sweet tropical fruit notes of pineapple and melon.

The pepperiness is more pronounced and lingers longer. The finish is medium length, with a persistent sweet pepperiness.
JAJA Añejo, 40% ABV, ARP $50
JAJA Añejo is matured for two years in ex-bourbon barrels. On the nose, its sweet and buttery, floral, with pronounced aromas of vanilla and caramel, along with tropical fruit. The agave note is less vegetal than in its siblings, more cooked. On the palate it’s smooth and sweet, the pepperiness is persistent, but not as pronounced as in the Reposado. Its very fruity with tropical fruit notes, along with some dried apricot, vanilla and caramel. The finish is long, sweet, peppery, with a lingering dried fruit note.
Tromba is a tequila brand founded by Eric Brass, James Sherry, Nick Reid and Marco Cedano. Cedano was formerly the Master Distiller and Manager at Don Julio. It’s named for the intense thunderstorms often seen in the Jalisco Highlands during the rainy season. The name literally means “big rain.” The Ontario, Canada based company produces its tequila at the Tequila el Viejito distillery (Nom 1107) in Atotonilco in the Jalisco Highlands. Twenty different tequila brands are produced at the distillery. Tromba tequila is double distilled.
Tequila Tromba Blanco, 40% ABV, ARP $34
On the nose, there is a pronounced agave flavor, more cooked than vegetal, but embodying elements of both, followed by a pronounced black pepper note, citrus zest and some tropical fruitiness. On the palate, it’s smooth, sweet, with a tingling pepperiness that steadily builds. It’s fruity, with a hint of green pepper, anise and some mint. The finish is medium, with lingering sweetness and a bit of pepper.
Tequila Tromba Reposado, 40% ABV, ARP $40
The Reposado is aged for six-eight months in ex-bourbon barrels. On the nose, it has the same mix of vegetal and cooked agave flavors, although the cooked flavors are more pronounced then in the Blanco. There is a hint of oak, along with some sweetness, citrus zest and a hint of banana and melon. As it opens up, there is a saline, almost minerally note, which emerges. On the palate, its sweet and very smooth, with flavors of banana, pineapple and melon, a bit of licorice and chocolate, along with the requisite caramel and vanilla flavors. There is a mild, but lingering pepperiness. The finish is long, sweet and slightly peppery.
Tequila Tromba Añejo, 40% ABV, ARP $52
The Añejo is aged for approximately 20-24 months in ex-bourbon barrels. On the nose, its sweet and creamy, with cooked agave notes, along with vanilla and cinnamon reminiscent of a crème brûlée like quality. On the palate, it’s very smooth and creamy, sweet, with flavors of cooked agave and vanilla, along with some dried fruit notes and a hint of licorice and chocolate. The finish is medium sweet, with lingering fruit and cooked agave notes and a slight green pepper note at the very end.
Santera was created by master distiller Sebastian Melendrez. It’s made at the Destiladora del Valle de Tequila distillery (NOM 1438) in Tequila. One of the largest producers of tequila in Jalisco, the distillery, owned by the Maestri family, produces 107 different brands of tequila. All of the Santera tequilas are double distilled.
Santera Tequila Blanco, 40% ABV, ARP $42
On the nose, the cooked agave notes are subtle. The aroma is more floral, along with some anise, vanilla and just a bit of cinnamon and a hint of a wet stone minerality. On the palate, it’s sweet, with vanilla and tropical fruit notes. There is an initial burst of pepperiness, which fades quickly. The finish is medium length, with a lingering dried fruit sweetness and a bit of pepper and chili powder.
Santera Tequila Reposado, 40% ABV, ARP $48
The Reposado is aged in oak for six to seven months. The nose is very fruity, with aromas of cooked apple and tropical fruit, along with some anise and like its younger sibling a hint of wet stone minerality. On the palate, its sweet, with pronounced tropical fruit notes of melon, pineapple and mango, along with some pepperiness. There is a hint of wood, but it is quite subtle. The finish is short, sweet, with a pepperiness that quickly fades.
Santera Tequila Añejo, 40% ABV, ARP $54
On the nose, there is a pronounced vegetative note that fades quickly to reveal sweet and fruity notes and a hint of oak. On the palate, there is a pronounced note of vanilla, caramel and cinnamon and cloves, along with fruitiness. There is a pronounced pepperiness, both black pepper and chili pepper notes, along with some milk chocolate. The finish is long, with sweet caramel notes and tropical fruit notes of pineapple accompanied by a lingering pepperiness.
Prospero Tequila is a joint venture between Conecuh Brands and pop star Rita Ora. It’s produced at Tequilera Don Roberto (NOM 1437) in Tequila. The distillery produces 18 different brands. The tequila is double distilled and uses a diffuser in the production process. The Master Distiller is Stella Anguiano, one of the few female master distillers in the Tequila industry.
Prospero Tequila Blanco, 40% ABV, ARP $34
On the nose, the tequila is very floral, with notes of citrus and licorice, along with some tropical fruit notes. It’s fresh, with a wet stone mineral character. On the palate, it’s sweet, creamy, with vegetative, citrus zest, some fruit and a pronounced peppery note. The finish is medium length, sweet and very peppery.
Prospero Tequila Añejo, 40% ABV, ARP $43
On the nose, the Añejo is very clean, fresh and very floral. It’s sweet, with aromas of overripe apples and tropical fruits, along with vanilla and cinnamon. The agave notes are quite subtle and emphasize cooked sweet notes. There is just a hint of anise and green vegetal agave notes in the background. On the palate, its very peppery, featuring more jalapeño and chili than black pepper. Sweet, tropical fruit notes of mango and melon emerge beneath the pepperiness. The finish is medium length, sweet and peppery.
These are all very interesting tequilas. Although they offer different flavor profiles, they are all very smooth and very drinkable. They’re, technically, well made with no obvious flaws. They reflect the modern style of tequila, one designed for the American palate. They are smooth and sweet, and feature a lot of the tropical fruit notes typical of long, 50 to 80-hour fermentations. They differ markedly in one significant variable—pepperiness. That varies from mild to chili and jalapeño hot, and from fleeting to lingering.
On the whole, I find these tequilas rather subtle. They would work well, in my opinion, straight up or on the rocks. In a cocktail, like a margarita, for example, they would be overshadowed, as are most tequilas, by the influence of the mixers.
Still, if you like tequila and want to expand your repertoire, they are all worth exploring, and definitely worth a taste.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, you can say goodbye to tarantulas for the next six month. There can only be one dangerous predator in the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and the two just switched hemispheres at the start of May. Tarantulas have gone down to the southern hemisphere, and scorpions have made their way up north. I’m not sure they really fall under the category of “bugs”, but this is a game that lumps frogs in under “fish”, so sure, whatever. It’s a big new prize that you want to add to your museum, so here’s how to catch one.
The rules here are basically the same as tarantulas, so you can really just sort of think of this as a tarantula re-skin. Still, you might need some pointers on how to proceed. For starters, scorpions show up at night. So start looking between 7:00 PM and 4:00 AM when you don’t have any guests on the island.
Scorpions spawn on the ground, so finding one might be harder if you’re living on a more built-out island. Try going on a mystery tour: if you’re lucky, you might get an entire island infested with them, or you might just find a few more than you would on your home island. If you want to raise your odds, clear the island of as many trees, flowers and rocks as possible, like with tarantulas.
When you see a scorpion on the map, stop. Probably do the same thing if you see a scorpion in the real world. Get out your net, and hold down A to raise it into the ready position. Proceed, cautiously, towards the scorpion.
When the scorpion notices you, it will raise itself into a defensive position. If you keep moving, it will attack, and you’ll need lighting-fast reflexes to catch it. Instead, just stop, but keep your net ready. When it lowers its guard, move forward slowly. It will raise up again, so stop again. Keep doing this until you’re in net range of the scorpion, then let go and swing. With any luck, you should have yourself a new prize.

    <h5 class="mb-1">4 Reasons You’re Afraid To Be The Face Of Your Brand</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s hard to imagine, in this age of personal branding, that there are still people who have a hard time stepping into the spotlight when it comes to their businesses. I can remember the feeling when I started up - not wanting anyone to know who I was. I can also clearly remember the feeling of letting that go, showing up, and seeing the positive results from it.
Lisa Fabrega, a leadership coach and Founder of the Capacity Code™, shared the most common reasons so many women are terrified to step into the spotlight for their business—and it all comes down to expanding their capacity. She defines capacity as your ability to hold, handle and receive every next level of your growth. These are must-have skills when becoming the face of your brand. If you want to become the “Martha Stewart” of your business, but something is holding you back, see if it’s due to one of Lisa’s four root causes.
1. You Don’t Have Strong Emotional Or Boundary Capacities 
As the face of your new brand, the buck stops with you. Instead of people criticizing Company X, they will now be mentioning you by name. “If you know deep down that your boundaries could use some strengthening you might be holding back because you’re worried about suddenly being overwhelmed with people’s requests or receiving direct criticism for expressing your opinions,” says Fabrega. “You’ll need to build your emotional and boundary capacity by getting comfortable saying ‘no’ even when it disappoints others.”
You’ll also need to embrace that everyone isn’t going to like your opinions. And that’s OK. If you’re nervous about expressing an opinion, try sharing it with someone you trust first rather than a stranger. It helps to know that even though some people will disagree with you, the people whose opinions you value don’t.

2. You’re Afraid Of Being Seen
Even when we have successes, we’re almost always hiding a key part of ourselves.
“The hidden parts of you are often what create the most rewarding and lucrative returns for your business. But we’re scared what our family and friends will think if we reveal, for example, that we filed for bankruptcy years ago or had an experience with domestic violence. Intellectually you know everyone won’t agree with or understand your past, but when it happens...oof! One business coaching client I had was afraid to share with people that she had an intuitive gift. She was struggling to get people to attend a live event that she hosted every year. But once she sent an email to her list explaining that she had these gifts and started incorporating them into her events, she was able to more than triple her attendance rates,” shares Fabrega. “If you’re a person of color, it feels doubly dangerous whenever a person leaves a nasty comment or criticizes you because of real life, discriminatory experiences you’ve previously had. But if you truly want to expand your visibility capacity, you have to show up in full and allow the hidden parts of yourself to be seen.”
3. Behind The Scenes, You Look More “Train Wreck” Than “Swiss Timepiece” 
Becoming the face of your brand demands order, cohesion and support that’s unique to you and your business. This is structural capacity and without it - once people have higher expectations of you - your business turns into a game of Jenga. 
“One client I worked with had a million followers on social media, a best-selling book and loads of media coverage—but was petrified at the thought of starting a new company and being the main personality of that brand. She was a jumbled mess behind the scenes because she didn’t know how to deliver her genius or even what role her proprietary process played in her business. But once she started to hone in on her true passion, she was able to get rid of that jumbled mess, simplify her business model, get clear on her messaging and double her revenue in the process,” says Fabrega. “For others, getting to function like a Swiss timepiece might look like getting more support at home so you can focus on your brand, creating a more customized daily work flow (rather than using someone else’s performance hack) or reassessing whether or not the people on your team right now will be able to grow with you.”
4. Your “Inside” Doesn’t Match Your “Outside”
“You’ve probably heard this referred to as alignment, and yet there’s more to it than that. Your values are your own personal north star—even if your north star isn’t considered ‘popular’ or ‘sexy.’ Perhaps it’s time to consider the reason you’re so tired all the time is not really due to how much you’re working, but how hard you’re at the grindstone trying to be someone or something you’re not,” advises Fabrega. “Another client I worked with was resisting becoming the face of her brand because she felt like a fraud. Not because she wasn’t brilliant or accomplished, but because she didn’t have enough experience trusting in herself. She wouldn’t be able to hide behind an old, misaligned brand this time. She would be stepping out on her own. When this happens, you may be tempted to give up, further delay your progress or stay ‘safe.’ Don’t. This is the exact moment you need to confidently step forward and shine.”
Becoming the face of your brand takes guts, but you’ll certainly reap a lot of rewards.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How U.K. And Royals Will Virtually Celebrate Landmark VE-Day, May 8</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The message the world had been waiting for was brilliantly to the point. Shortly after German officials signed the first documents of surrender in Reims, France (additional papers were formalized in Berlin the next day), ending the fighting in Europe, General Dwight Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Command, notified his chiefs of staff: “The mission of this Allied Force was fulfilled at 0241, local time, May 7th, 1945.”
While the Second World War would not come to a final close until Japan’s surrender in August, the end of hostilities on the continent was marked by an outbreak of celebrations in many countries and no where more enthusiastically than in London, where thousands flocked to the streets and to well-known monuments like Buckingham Palace, Parliament and Piccadilly Circus. [To get a better understanding of Britain’s precarious first months during the war, read Erik Larson’s riveting The Splendid and the Vile, which recently topped The New York Times’ non-fiction best seller list.] “In all our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this,” Winston Churchill said when he appeared before exuberant throngs at the Ministry of Health in Whitehall.
The U.K. had hoped for a full-out celebration this year to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day; because of the pandemic all events will be virtual with individual observances taking place at home. But there are plenty of online and televised happenings to commemorate the date and honor veterans and the sacrifices made during the war. The U.K’s Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement: “In these difficult times, acts of remembrance are even more poignant and I am sure that millions will want to join me to remember and give thanks to those who gave so much to secure peace, freedom and prosperity in Europe.”
Here are some of the major events planned. For additional information go to VE-VJDay75.gov.uk. 
At 11 AM, a Two Minute Silence will be observed in the U.K. At 11:15 there will be a VE Day 75 Livestreamhosted by the Royal British Legion. For details, click here.
Queen Elizabeth’s address to the country will be aired at 9 PM, May 8, on BBC One, the time her father, King George VI, spoke to a jubilant Britain 75 years earlier. Prince Charles will commemorate VE Day 75 by reading from his grandfather’s diary entry for the day, which included the historic appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with Winston Churchill. Video chats will take place between members of the royal family and veterans.
Winston Churchill’s victory speech will be broadcast by the BBC during the program, VE Day 75: The Announcement Of Victory, starting at 2:45 PM. In the evening another special, VE Day 75: The People’s Celebration, begins at 8PM. After the Queen’s message at 9 PM, the show will end with a nationwide singing of the WWII classic, “We’ll Meet Again,” made famous by Dame Vera Lynn. For a schedule of additional VE Day television and radio programs planned by the BBC, click here.
ITV will have a program devoted to the U.K’s remarkable Captain (now honorary Colonel) Tom Moore, a British Army and WWII veteran who has recently gained international acclaim for raising more than £30 million for the country’s National Health Service charities by walking 100 laps in his garden. (Moore turned 100 on April 30.)
The Royal Air Force Museum, National Army Museum and the National Museum of the Royal Navy are presenting a Virtual VE Day 75 Festival, from May 7-9, that will include a webinar with top historian James Holland and curators from the museums, along with presentations highlighting experiences both at home and on the front lines during the Second World War
And you can time travel with vintage recipes and music. If you’re frustrated because of the shortages of certain foods during the Covid-19 pandemic, consider that rationing in the U.K.began in 1940 (to see a ration list, go to Historic UK) and continued until 1954. For at-home VE Day celebrations, there are items popular during the Second World War, when cooks had to do a lot with little, that you can make. English Heritage has a party pack that includes recipes for carrot scones and ginger beer. The VE-VJDay75.gov.org site has various assets you can download for a party, like bunting templates and posters, along with recipes for dishes like Homity Pie and an eggless fruit cake. There’s also a Spotify playlist with music from the era with such names as Frank Sinatra, Glenn Miller and Vera Lynn.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Best Ways To Get A Nintendo Switch Right Now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Update, 5/3: It’s been interesting to watch stock fluctuate on both the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch Lite over the past few weeks, and this weekend it seems like real progress is being made on the Switch Lite. We got new stock at a range of places going into the weekend, including Amazon: they won’t ship until mid month, but at least you can order them. It’s Sunday now, and you can still buy one, more or less. Some colors are sold out in their base SKU, some won’t ship until mid-month, and there are various other fluctuations in availability. But if you want to plunk down money for a Switch lite at this moment, you can do it, even at MSRP.
This would suggest that resellers just aren’t having as much luck selling the Switch Lite as the standard model console. It’s still in high demand, or we wouldn’t see the scattered sellouts that we’re seeing now. But the phenomenon of not being able to find a standard Switch anywhere less then $450 or so is driven by resellers using bots to snatch up new inventory the millisecond its made available, and there just doesn’t seem to be that same level of pressure with the Switch Lite.
Original Story:
We’re now two-ish months into quarantine, depending on where you are, and the Nintendo Switch hasn’t gotten any easier to find. The hybrid portable/living room console became a smash hit early on as people both sought new activities to while away quarantined hours for both themselves and their children and to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo’s surprising smash hit life simulator. While the company is reported to be increasing production and has said that more stock is on the way, the console remains difficult to find.
Here’s the truth: the Nintendo Switch is unlikely to be easy to find at MSRP for a long time now. That’s both because of the aforementioned demand and because price-gougers have taken over the marketplace using bots to snag any online availability and then shipping them over to Amazon and eBay at an inflated price point that seems to hover around $500. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that phyiscal retail is closed nearly everywhere right now, so you can’t expect to get around the bots by showing up in-person.
If you live in a state where restrictions are starting to ease, there’s a chance that a retailer selling Switches might open up. Some, like Target and Walmart, have been open throughout the crisis as essential businesses, but even then stock has been near-impossible to find. As things ease up, physical retail will be an easier place to find new consoles than online, but remember to be safe, to wear a mask, and to practice social distancing.
If you absolutely want a new console right now, you likely have no choice than to get one from a reseller at a significant markup.
You should be reminded, however, that the base model Switch is not the only machine in this console family. Nintendo released the Switch Lite last fall, and it’s a capable little handheld. You can’t play it on the TV, and the side controllers don’t come off for multiplayer action. It’s less than ideal if you want to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the family, but it’s great if you’re trying to get your kid something to do.
Switch Lite comes in and out of stock from time to time, but it’s available right now at Amazon.
Even if you’re remiss to get the “budget” console, it’s worth considering either for a child or for yourself. It’s more portable for anyone with a public transit commute, for one thing, and it plays everything that the Switch plays. Other than that, you’ll need to wait or shell out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singular New York Steakhouse Owner Ben Benson Passes Away At 89</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">         
Ben Benson, one of New York’s exemplars in the highly competitive steakhouse genre, has died at the age of 89. Ever familiar in his brightly colored sweaters, Ben would walk slowly through his two-story restaurant on West 52nd Street, seemingly aloof. The truth was, Ben had been legally blind since college and once said, “People think I’m a snob. It’s difficult because I can’t make eye contact.”
         But if he could not connect by eye with his legion of regulars, he kept his professional eye on every aspect of hospitality and quality at his restaurant, which was decked out with folk art, antlers and brass. No one bought better beef or lamb chops. His creamed spinach was nonpareil, and fried items like onion rings were irresistible once tasted. The wine list had depth and breadth and high prices, and his service staff, many long-time veterans from Eastern Europe, could carve open  a roast chicken or shell a lobster with equal parts speed and grace.
       
  With Alan Stillman, a fellow Bucknell alumnus,  Ben founded the TGIFriday restaurants, and opened Smith & Wollensky with him on the East Side, which itself grew into a franchise chain. But Ben refused to open more than one steakhouse with his own name on it, telling the Times,  "There will never, never, never be another Ben Benson's."         Ben Benson’s Steakhouse opened in 1982 and was one of the few of its kind on the West Side, aside from the well-established Gallagher’s, which had opened in 1927. When I started frequently Ben Benson’s in the 1990s, I wrote in Esquire, “The kitchen doesn't make mistakes. There's no overpaid celebrity chef back there, just heat-hardened pros who know how to work an 800-degree grill. . . . There are no puny one and two-pound lobsters here. They start at three and go up from there: five, seven, sometimes ten.  You can spot America's best red meat-loving jocks. Former Yankee David Wells put away a double porterhouse after pitching his perfect game.  And the leakproof doggie bags, which sport a picture of BB's mascot, Rocky the bulldog.” 
        
 Ben Benson’s Steakhouse opened in 1982 and had a terrific run, but after the downturn in 2008, business slumped and never returned to acceptable heights. The steakhouse had also a lot of increased competition from newcomers on the West Side, including The Palm, Morton’s, Del Frisco’s and Ruth’s Chris. Add to that an intolerable hike in his rent, and Ben decided to close his restaurant, on Father’s Day in 2012, with vague plans to re-open somewhere else. But Ben was getting older and his sight wasn’t getting any better. 
         I have to imagine that Ben was a tough negotiator and taskmaster in 
his business, but I only knew him as a very sweet, very New York kind of guy, ready to hear or tell a good story, eager to recommend a particular dish of the evening and someone who clearly loved what he did. That’s the way it is with true restaurateurs and why they stay in business for thirty years. Everybody knew Ben and everyone looked up to him.  There will never, never, never be another Ben Benson.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Mandalorian’s Beskar Steel Has An Earthly Counterpart In Wootz Steel</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the biggest Disney fan, I have long awaited the arrival of Disney+. Along with classic musicals and historic animated shorts, the platform also contains some of the biggest franchises around, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and of course the entire Star Wars back catalog. Launched on 24th March 2020, coinciding nicely with the start of the UK’s COVID-19 ‘lockdown’, the first thing I devoured was The Mandalorian, and with it, every Baby Yoda meme I could get my hands on.
The Mandalorian is a new series set in the Star Wars universe, five years after the end of the original (and let’s just say it, best) trilogy, and two and a half decades before the latest and final trilogy of the Skywalker saga started with The Force Awakens. Din Djarin is a bounty hunter from the planet Mandalore, sporting a uniform we have seen on Boba Fett. Although they shared a job description, Fett Junior was not technically a Mandalorian. Instead, he is a clone of Jango Fett, and did not grow up on Mandalore, confirming that the way of the Mandalorian is a culture, a way of living, and not a species, race or religion. The series explores this culture in greater detail, with the famous armor playing a major role.
In The Mandalorian, Djarin is paid for missions in bars of Beskar steel. This sacred material is used to make a Mandalorian’s armor, which is crafted by expert armorers that know how to work this material. Are there any parallels to materials that we know of in a galaxy closer to home? Let’s take a closer look at the material properties of Beskar steel.
Beskar steel is handled as cast ingots. The dull, slate gray bars of Beskar steel have wavey ridges and patterns on the surface, and are stamped with the Imperial shield of Palpatine’s empire. Armor made of Beskar is highly sought after as it is an extremely robust material, able to withstand blaster shots and lightsaber strikes. It must therefore also be light enough to be worn for prolonged periods of time. We know that the material can be melted in a hot furnace and cast into shapes. It can be worked with heat and hammering. It is malleable enough in a thin, heated form to be shaped into panels, which make it a perfect choice for armor.
Plate armor made of panels has been used for thousands of years, though the full suit of armor dates back to the Late Middle Ages. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, was commonly used as it can be easily forged, hammered, shaped and cut. It is also stronger than iron, owing to the fact that the carbon ‘impurities’ in the steel prevent the iron atoms from sliding past one another, giving rise to a tougher, less brittle material. Beskar certainly seems to have similar properties, and so we can presume that it is a metal, and indeed a form of steel as its name suggests.
Armor needs to be light, but also strong. Sadly not enough research has been conducted on lightsabers here on Earth, so it is hard to vouch for the resistance regular steel would have against such a space sword, however it is possible to engineer steel to be reasonably blaster-proof. For example, stainless steel, an alloy of iron, carbon and some chromium, cannot catch fire easily - handy for us here on Earth, given that we cook food inside stainless steel vessels. It can therefore be presumed that Beskar steel would also be able to withstand blaster fire, especially as they tend to emit cooler yellow flames.
The biggest clue as to whether there is a material analogous to Beskar steel here on Earth is the patterning on each ingot. These waves and ridges of alternating light and dark colours are a trademark of a real material that is known for its strong, light properties, just like Beskar steel. Wootz steel is a high-carbon content steel originating from south India and Sri Lanka. It is formed by heating iron ore to a high temperature in the presence of carbon-containing plants such as bamboo. The resultant smoky fire ensures a high content of iron carbide in the steel formed this way. Though iron carbide is a brittle substance, when incorporated into the bulk of the steel, it ensures that blades made of Wootz steel remain sharp. The burnt bamboo and other plant matter also imparts a little nanotechnology into the mix, ensuring that this steel is stronger and lighter than any other.
Tiny nanoscopic carbon structures, such as straw-like carbon nanotubes and football-shaped fullerenes, are created in sooty fires. These nanostructures are very strong, but also incredibly light. When embedded within the steel, they make the steel even stronger, reducing the brittle nature of the steel even further, without adding any bulk.
Wootz steel ingots were also used to make Damascus steel blades, which were said to be so strong, they would never shatter. Crucially however, Damascus steel and Wootz steel both display very similar wavy patterns to Beskar steel. In Wootz and Damascus steel, these patterns are formed by folding and working the steel, so that iron carbide layers line up, creating intricate patterns. These patterns were historically somewhat of a trademark, though modern techniques now allow metallurgists to create a range of bespoke and intricate designs.
Although the events of the Star Wars universe took place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the science does seem to confirm that a form of Beskar steel exists in our time too. Now, if someone could hurry up with those lightsabers, it really would make my lockdown gardening so much easier...

    <h5 class="mb-1">YoungBoy Never Broke Again Charts A Second No. 1 Album Two Months After His Last Top 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again surprised his dedicated legion of fans a short time ago by revealing he had a new album ready, and he dropped it on April 24 as excitement was still high. While he has always been known for his especially prolific output, it’s somewhat shocking that the musician had a new full-length prepared, as he debuted his mixtape Still Flexin, Still Steppin at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 back in February of this year. Now, he’s reached even higher, proving that there is an insatiable appetite for his art.
The rapper’s new project 38 Baby 2 opens at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The set starts with 67,000 equivalent units, and of that sum, 4,000 are pure sales, as most fans decided to stream the 17-song title. The title racked up 96.9 million streams in its first seven days of availability.
38 Baby 2 is YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s second No. 1 on the Billboard 200. He first reached the summit less than a year ago with AI YoungBoy 2, and he’s come close to adding to that total more than once. He now claims four top 10 efforts in under two years, and that’s to say nothing of his total discography, which now includes nine top 40-charters.
Since 38 Baby 2 arrived with little warning, YoungBoy Never Broke Again hasn’t pushed any of the songs featured on the set to the Hot 100 just yet, though that’s likely to change. Since his stream count was so high, it wouldn’t be odd to see several cuts from the project land on the all-encompassing tally, especially since Still Flexin, Still Steppin produced at least eight charting tracks.
38 Baby 2 serves as something of a sequel to the rapper’s 2016 mixtape 38 Baby. That title didn’t chart on the Billboard 200, but it did help establish him as one of the most exciting new names in the hip-hop field. Now, just four years after the first release in the series appeared, the second is the most popular title in the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ahn Jae-hong’s 2020 Film Roles Include A Funny Lawyer And A Desperate Criminal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ahn Jae-hong appears in two films this year and his roles in those films could not be more different. In Secret Zoo, he plays Kang Tae-soo, a probationary law firm employee, assigned to manage the Dongsan Park Zoo. The assignment is not really a favor since the zoo is broke and there are no animals to attract customers. The only solution is for the staff to dress up and pretend they are animals. 
His other 2020 role is playing Jang-ho in the thriller Time To Hunt. Jang-ho is a petty criminal in a broken-down world. While his comedy character Tae-soo comes up with a desperate but hilarious scheme to keep his job Jang-ho is desperate enough to risk his life for one potentially life-changing heist. From comedy to action-packed drama, from playing a lawyer to playing a thief, both genres demonstrate his ability to create convincing characters. 
“Because the two films are completely different genres I knew I had to approach them differently,” said Ahn. “With Secret Zoo, I had to win the sympathy and compassion of the audience, and with Time to Hunt, I needed to bring out extreme emotions and create a certain cinematic experience.
In Time To Hunt, his character’s close friends, Joon-seok and Ki-hoon, plan to rob a gambling casino, but the plan ends with them becoming the target of a relentless assassin. Jang-ho’s only close connections in the world are doomed to endanger him. His loyalty is self-destructive.
“I wanted to realistically portray the simple yet pitiful sentiment of Jang-ho’s character,” said Ahn. “I thought his reliance on Joon-seok and Ki-hoon was greater than anything, as he has no one else to turn to. He knows Joon-seok’s plan is dangerous, but for Jang-ho, not being alongside Joon-seok is meaningless. This affects Jang-ho to even lead the plan. I tried to relate to and express the desperateness of the dead-end situation.”  
Before making the final decision on taking any role, Ahn notes any similarities he shares with the character. If there aren’t a lot, he considers what it will take to realize that character and Jang-ho required more than the usual amount of planning. 
“I think Jang-ho and I have almost nothing in common. I felt that my approach to Jang-ho was different from how I’ve worked in the past, as I had to entirely create his personality, outer appearance, habits, and tone. However, it was similar in that it entailed the process of finding the realistic and natural aspects to be seen as the character himself.”
Working with director Yoon Sung-hyun was a pleasure, said Ahn, but he also had a good time acting with his cast mates, played by Lee Je-hoon, Choi Woo-sik and Park Jung-min.
“I was also grateful for and really enjoyed being able to create harmony with actors my age and whom I love.”
Ahn has to date appeared in more than two dozen films, including The King of Jokgo, Microhabitat and Fabricated City. He’s also been in a handful of TV dramas, including Reply 1988, Legend of the Blue Sea, Fight for My Way and Be Melodramatic. Although his drama work has only been a fraction of his film work, his Kim Jung-bong role in the TV series Reply 1988 made the actor a household name. He didn’t plan to do more films than TV dramas.
“I think it just worked out that way,” said Ahn. “I equally love both genres very much.”
He continues to love acting as much as he first did during a pivotal moment in college. 
“When I was 20 and in a play in college, there was this moment I felt everyone in the audience was holding their breath and completely focused on me, the actor,” he said. “I think that rush is something I’ll never forget.”
For Ahn, acting is all about communicating with the audience.
“I think the greatest thing about acting is that it moves the audience and brings about certain emotions within them.” 
Both of his 2020 film roles accomplish that in a distinctive way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BTS Collect Another Major Honor In The U.K. With Their Latest Album</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Like every other band and solo musician in the world, BTS can’t tour or do much to promote their most recent full-length Map of the Soul: 7 right now, but that doesn’t mean that fans everywhere aren’t consuming the project. In fact, the group’s latest CD continues to rack up healthy sales and streams in many territories, and now it has earned a special honor in one of the largest music markets on the planet.
Map of the Soul: 7 has just been certified silver in the U.K. by the BPI (British Phonographic Industry), making it their latest release to secure the prize.
Albums are certified by the BPI when they have hit certain sales thresholds, combining pure purchases and streaming equivalents. A silver award means the title has shifted 60,000 equivalent units. When the effort reaches 100,000 equivalents, it goes gold, and 300,000 is enough for an album to be named platinum.
Map of the Soul: 7 was released back in mid-February, so the fact that it has already moved at least 60,000 equivalent copies is impressive. In fact, only a handful of albums that have dropped in 2020 have been able to reach silver status so far.
BTS’s most recent project was an immediate hit in almost every country in the world, including the U.K., where it wasted no time going straight to No. 1. In doing so, it became the group’s second chart-topper, following the historic success of 2019’s Map of the Soul: Persona. The new set was preceded by the promotional single “Black Swan,” which narrowly missed out on becoming another top 40 hit by just a few rungs. First proper single “On” opened at No. 21, while album cut “Filter” barely broke through, landing at No. 100 for a single turn.
Map of the Soul: 7 is BTS’s third piece of music to be certified in the U.K. this year. Just a few days into 2020, their older release Love Yourself: Tear went silver, and on the same Friday in February when Map of the Soul: 7 was made widely available, their 2019 smash single “Boy with Luv,” which features American pop singer Halsey, also earned a silver certification.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Box Office: 18 Years Ago, ‘Spider-Man’ Succeeded Where ‘Batman’ Had Failed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spider-Man’s blockbuster success ushered in a new post-9/11 era of popular, present-tense comic book superhero movies with popular movie stars and based on characters audiences actually wanted to see.
Today is the 18th anniversary of the opening day of Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man. The well-reviewed Marvel adaptation rode a wave of anticipation, buzz and post-9/11 populism to become the first movie to A) earn $40 million in a single day (after a $39 million Friday) and B) gross over $100 million in its Fri-Sun domestic launch. It followed up that $114 million weekend debut with a $71 million (-37%) second weekend, also a record at the time, legging out to $403 million domestic (the fifth-biggest grosser ever in 2002) and $821 million worldwide on a $130 million budget. While Batman’s blockbuster success 13 years earlier had ushered in a wave of (mostly commercially unsuccessful) period-piece pulp adventure movies, Spider-Man ushered in a new wave of big-budget, present-tense comic book superhero movies that featured characters whom audiences actually wanted to see.
It was not the first comic book hit of its era, as Spawn, Blade and X-Men brought in big bucks by giving audiences comic book adaptations they actually wanted to see. But those films were either small-scale hits (Blade earned $141 million on a $40 million budget) or merely “big but not huge” earners (X-Men earned $299 million from a $75 million budget). Spider-Man, which stood out by being a coming of age romantic melodrama first and an action blockbuster second, was the first comic book superhero movie since Batman (and its three sequels) to be a true four-quadrant blockbuster. The unprecedented success of Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst’s Spider-Man (inflation aside, Batman had earned $251 million from a $43 million debut, and $411 million worldwide, in 1989) sent Hollywood chasing comic book superheroes in hopes of creating the next superhero blockbuster.
Perhaps because Tim Burton’s intentionally timeless Batman plays like a 1930’s pulp crime thriller, much of what arrived in the aftermath of its industry-changing success were 1920’s-1950’s pulp adventures. Walt Disney DIS ’s Dick Tracy arrived 30 years ago this June, while The Rocketeer failed to take flight that following summer. The likes of The Phantom and The Shadow typified what Hollywood tried to make in Batman’s wake, and audiences weren’t biting. That’s not a quality judgment. Dick Tracy is among the most grown-up comic book movies ever made and I’ll slam anyone who libels The Phantom. The post-Batman response was akin to Disney thinking that their live-action Dumbo remake was a surefire hit because Beauty and the Beast earned $1.263 billion. Batman was a hit because it was a star-studded and larger-than-life Batman movie, not merely because it was a pulpy superhero adventure.
There were a few exceptions over the next decade. Ironically, New Line Cinema’s low-budget ($13.5 million) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles offered exactly the right lessons from Batman’s success. It was a (very good) present-tense adaptation of a comic book/brand that was currently very popular. Star-driven vehicles like Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (arguably the first grimdark reboot of our time), Antonio Banderas’ The Mask of Zorro and Jim Carrey’s The Mask (which was absolutely a pulp crime comedy, but with a red-hot movie star in the lead role) were relatively big hits. New Line had such success with TMNT ($200 million in 1990), The Mask ($350 million in 1994) and Blade ($141 million in 1998) that I remain shocked that The Crow ($50 million in 1994) came from Miramax (after they grabbed it from Paramount following Brandon Lee’s on-set death).
Blade and Spawn were the starting points to the second wave of superhero cinema, but X-Men (a big success predicated upon the popularity of the source material) and Spider-Man helped turn the comic book superhero movie into an A-level Hollywood franchise-creator. Contrary to popular belief, the road was not a smooth one. None of the comic book superhero movies that followed in the wake of Sony’s Spider-Man were anywhere near as huge the Sam Raimi-directed trilogy. Some of them had moderate success (Tim Story’s Fantastic Four movies both topped $300 million on over/under $115 million budgets in 2005 and 2007), but for every X2: X-Men United ($407 million on a $110 million budget), there were manylike Hulk, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Electra, Daredevil, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Hellboy. Some were more successful than others, but not a one topped $250 million global.
Many of the biggest success stories of the era came from comic book movies that weren’t superhero flicks (300, which earned $456 million in 2007, or Sin City, comes to mind) or were star+genre vehicles like Blade. Keanu Reeves’ Constantine earned $230 million in 2005 and remained the biggest non-Batman/Superman DC flick until Wonder Woman. Meanwhile, Daredevil sputtered at $179 million. Ghost Rider earned $226 million on a $110 million budget. Catwoman and Elektra both bombed, putting the kibosh on female-led superhero movies until Wonder Woman. Hellboy earned just $99 million, and we only got a sequel due to strong DVD sales and Universal’s desire to have a fourth big action movie in 2008 alongside The Incredible Hulk (which, irony, remains the MCU’s only bomb), Wanted (another atypical, R-rated comic book flick) and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.
Not even Batman and Superman could measure up to Spider-Man and Wolverine. Batman Begins rode a wave of rave reviews to a frankly underwhelming $48 million Fri-Sun/$72 million Wed-Sun launch (Batman Forever had opened with $53 million in 1995) in the summer of 2005. But terrific word-of-mouth for Chris Nolan’s terrific “only slightly larger-than-life” origin story kept folks curious. It legged out to $205 million domestic and $371 million worldwide on a $150 million budget. Only solid DVD sales and a faith that an equally good sequel would uptick due to goodwill allowed what would become The Dark Knight to exist. A year later, Superman Returns would earn $206 million domestic and $391 million worldwide, but on a $260 million budget (partially due to previous development costs for discarded Superman flicks) and with none of the buzz or excitement surrounding Batman Begins.
The sheer quality of Batman Begins arguably saved the comic book superhero movie as a viable genre, since up until 2008 the genre (at least in the 9/11 era) was defined by well-liked Spider-Man movies, somewhat well-liked X-Men movies and a bunch of other also-rans that couldn’t remotely compete commercially or artistically. So while Spider-Man ushered in a new era of modern-day, of-the-moment (and technology advanced) superhero adaptations, it really wasn’t until the one-two punch of Iron Man in May ($585 million worldwide) and The Dark Knight in July ($1.004 billion worldwide) that the genre truly began to artistically evolve. The “interconnected era” of the superhero movie, which would give way to The Avengers and the current dominance of the MCU, would also allow the genre to eventually diversify by approximating different genres and thus being different enough to artistically justify themselves.
Batman launched a new wave of IP-specific action fantasy flicks, even if Hollywood mistook the success of Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson’s mega-blockbuster for an inherent interest in pre/post-World War II adventure movies. Spider-Man launched a new wave of A-level superhero comic book movies, often based on comparatively modern comic books with big movie stars. But even then, Hollywood somewhat mistook the popularity of Spider-Man (based on maybe the most popular hero on Earth at the time) for an inherent interest in Marvel and DC comic book origin stories. Even Batman Begins struggled because its entire appeal was rooted in “Hey, it’s another Batman movie!” Spider-Man’s value as a high-quality, character-driven passion play (as well as a colorful action fantasy), one rooted in unapologetic sincerity, stood out in 2002 and paved the way for the likes of Captain America, Black Panther, Wonder Woman and Aquaman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blue’s Cool Snowball Ice Mic Is A Clear Winner All Round</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Loyal readers may know that I’m a big fan of USB Microphones. For two-way video chats and podcasting they’re absolutely brilliant. USB Mics don’t need a separate mixer or a microphone amplifier delivering 48 volts of phantom power; you simply plug them in to a Mac or PC and they just work.
I’ve already reviewed some great USB mics this year from AKG and Blue and now I’m reviewing the Blue Snowball iCE cardioid mic. This is an affordable and slightly quirky USB mic that’s ideal for streaming on YouTube. The Snowball iCE is a futuristic-looking sphere that perches on a mini tripod. The sphere is made from plastic and it’s clearly been built to a price.
Unlike more expensive USB microphones, the Snowball doesn’t include built-in mic monitoring, and neither does it have a mute button or controls to adjust the mic’s gain and pickup pattern. This is definitely a bare-bones mic that’s been stripped down with most of the budget being spent on the important part: the condenser capsule inside.
Many USB mics also include a headphone output so that you can hear your own voice or instrument, as well as the voice of the person you’re calling or the backing track you are accompanying. These mics have zero latency mic monitoring so there’s no annoying feedback or echo that you can get with microphones relying on playback from speakers and a host computer. Built-in mic monitoring is perfect for recording multiple tracks or singing along to a backing track. Unfortunately you don't get that with the Snowball iCE so if that’s a key feature for you, maybe look at a slightly more expensive model.
What you do get for your money is a superbly clear microphone that’s affordable and produces fine-quality recordings. The Snowball is ideal for laying down tracks for music projects or for recording the narration for videos. This mic is a massive upgrade on the quality of the mic built in to most laptops. However, the Snowball iCE is not so good for video chats on Facetime or other communication apps because there’s no onboard mic monitoring. This is disappointing if you are going to be hosting podcasts with online guest contributions.
I tested the Snowball iCE on a video chat first because it’s labeled as being Skype Certified. I was using a pair of headphones plugged into my iMac to listen to the other person at the other end of the line so I didn’t cause any annoying feedback. I was unable to hear my own voice clearly because my ears were muffled by the headphones. And because I couldn’t hear my voice through the headphones, I ended up speaking louder than necessary because I literally couldn’t hear myself speak. Fortunately, I was still able to have a sparklingly clear conversation by removing one of the earpieces thanks to the great sound quality that the Snowball produces. The person I was talking to even commented (without prompting) on how clear I sounded and how detailed and rich the sound was.
The Snowball iCE is very simple to use. All you need to do is connect it to a Mac or PC by plugging in the supplied USB Mini cable. Just ensure the Snowball is selected as the input mic in the software you’re using before adjusting the input level. In no time at all, you’ll be getting a 16-bit 48 kHz digital signal that produces great sound with very low background noise. I’ve tried other makes of microphones at this price point and most of them have has a really annoying background hiss. There’s no such problem here with the Snowball iCE
Verdict: Blue’s Snowball iCE USB mic is excellent value for money. The build quality isn’t as solid as Blue’s Yeti range of mics, but the sound is exceptionally clear and finely detailed. The absence of mic monitoring is disappointing, but if you don’t need that feature then it’s a great piece of kit and perfect for YouTube streaming. However, if you do want onboard mic monitoring, I’d suggest upgrading to a Blue Yeti Nano condenser mic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last Friday, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar unveiled a slow and staggered five-phase roadmap for lifting COVID-19 restrictions in his island nation, calling it a “journey to a new normal.”
The prime minister’s plan lays out five stages for unlocking restrictions, at three week intervals, beginning May 18 and rolling out through most of the summer into mid-August.
“As a nation, our physical health has been attacked, our mental health eroded, our economy battered, and our society put to the ultimate test,” said Varadkar in a national address, adding that stories of hardship formed a “tapestry of struggle and sacrifice and sorrow.”
After taking a beating in the most recent general election, Varadkar resigned as taoiseach in February after Ireland’s parliament reached an impasse in choosing a new premier. He is currently acting as a caretaker prime minister.
More recently, though, Varadkar has seen a surge in popularity for going above and beyond in his handling of the coronavirus crisis, polling suggests. A medical doctor by training, the prime minister has re-registered as a physician and committed to working one hospital shift per week for the foreseeable future.

With a population of just under five million, Ireland has confirmed over 21,000 positive cases and over 1,30o deaths due to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 restrictions have been aggressive on the Emerald Isle. Since last Tuesday, Irish people have been allowed to travel up to five kilometers (3.1 miles) from home to exercise. Previously, people were limited to staying within two kilometers of home.
For the time being, there is no céad míle fáilte (a hundred thousand welcomes) for would-be visitors arriving in Ireland. With the exception of people from Northern Ireland, all travelers entering Ireland must self-isolate for a 14-day period.
But for anyone wondering how soon it might be safe to plan a getaway to Ireland, Varadkar’s roadmap suggests that this summer may still be pushing the envelope.
Consider that Irish restaurants won’t reopen until the end of June. Hotels, museums and galleries be back in business until July 20, and pubs will remain closed until August 10.
Here are some of the key milestones that would impact visitors:
Beginning May 18, the first phase will allow outdoor workers to return to work and for some retail outlets such as garden centers to reopen. Some sporting and fitness activities in small groups will be permitted. People will be able to meet up to four friends and family from other households outside, while maintaining social distancing. 
Starting June 8, the second phase will allow small retail outlets and markets to open where social distancing can be maintained. People can visit other households. Public libraries will reopen.
On June 29, phase three begins. Cafés and sit-down restaurants can reopen where social distancing can be maintained. Non-essential retail outlets with street-level entrances and exits can open. Playgrounds will reopen. Small social gatherings can resume.
With the beginning of phase four, on July 20, the tourism industry can finally begin to reopen. Hotels and hostels can open up, though initially on a limited-occupancy basis. Museums, galleries and places of worship can reopen. Want a haircut or a tattoo? Higher risk services that require direct human contact can finally resume.
The fifth and final phase begins on August 10. On that date, pubs around the country can reopen and larger social gatherings can resume.
Varadkar warned the Irish people that “we have not yet won this fight” and said the country would have to revert to tighter restrictions if the virus rebounded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Hemsworth’s Netflix Actioner, ‘Extraction,’ May Be 2020’s Only Summer Blockbuster</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even if Chris Nolan's Tenet opens in July or August, Chris Hemsworth's Extraction could be the summer's only event movie for adults.
With the obvious disclaimer that one should take Netflix’s own “Our new movie or TV show is a huge hit!” with a grain of salt, they are currently boasting that Chris Hemsworth’s Extraction, which debuted on April 24, is on track to nab 90 million households in its first month of availability. If that comes to pass, it’ll be Netflix’s biggest launch ever. That would be a larger viewership than Michael Bay’s 6 Underground (83 million), Sandra Bullock’s Bird Box (80 million), the first season of Henry Cavill’s The Witcher (76 million) and the Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy Murder Mystery (73 million).
Of course, they now count a “viewing” as someone who watched even two minutes of a given episode or movie, as opposed to 70% (which was allegedly detrimental to the 3.5-hour-likes of The Irishman). But frankly the large viewership numbers make sense. Extraction is both a very good action movie and one of the first attempts at a Hollywood blockbuster that actually feels like a Hollywood blockbuster. Produced by the Russo Brothers and helmed by stunt choreographer and second-unit director Sam Hargave, the Chris Hemsworth action spectacular stars the once-and-future Thor as a disillusioned and borderline suicidal mercenary who kills his way across Bangladash for the sake of a kidnapped young boy.
Unlike a lot of Netflix movies from a lot of really talented filmmakers (Michael Bay’s 6 Underground, Duncan Jones’ Mute, Dan Gilroy’s Velvet Buzzsaw, Dee Rees’ The Last Thing She Wanted, etc.), it feels like there was someone on set (or in development) to veto bad ideas or suggest better ideas along the way. Conversely, it doesn’t feel like a talented filmmaker crafting an adaptation that seems like the worst possible “micromanaged by executives for maximum play-ability” Hollywood redo, like Adam Wingard’s Death Note (fun fact: Wingard’s You’re Next and The Guest are terrific genre hybrids). And it’s not whatever the hell happened with Bright. It’s just a big-budget actioner with some terrific stunts and jaw-dropping set-pieces.
It doesn’t reinvent the wheel and it’s a little “white savior”-ish, but it damn well works and is as confident a directorial debut as, personal preferences notwithstanding, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch’s Keanu Reeves-starring John Wick back in 2014. Moreover, by the cruelty of the current moment, I’d imagine that Extraction may continue to rack up viewership numbers for the near future. Barring a miracle, it could be this summer’s only prototypical blockbuster release. Yes, this weekend was supposed to see Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow kicking off the summer, which is arguably why Extraction arrived on Netflix the week before (ironically one year after the $1.2 billion opening weekend of the Russo’ Avengers: Endgame).
However, the summer movie season won’t really start until, at the absolutely earliest, July 17 when Chris Nolan drags us all out of our homes, gives each moviegoer a hazmat suit and personally deep-cleans every cup holder and seat in every multiplex on Earth on order to make sure that we can see Tenet as intended by God and Nolan himself. That may or may not, slight exaggerations notwithstanding, actually occur on schedule. But in terms of “big” movies that might actually open this summer, it’s Tenet, Mulan and Wonder Woman 1984. In other words, if Tenet gets delayed, then Extraction will be, by default, the event movie of the summer for adults.
That’s not to say older kids can’t enjoy the R-rated and graphically violent Extraction or that the three theatrical biggies won’t be both kid-safe and adult-friendly. However, if Tenet gets delayed past Labor Day, then Extraction will be, by default, the event movie of the summer for adults. And if theaters don’t open until Labor Day, then Extraction will be the only big summer movie of the season period. That’s doubly true when you consider that the big theatrically-intended movies that ended up on PVOD (Universal’s Trolls: World Tour, Warner Bros.’ Scoob and potentially/speculatively Paramount’s SpongeBob 3) or straight-to-streaming (Disney’s Artemis Fowl) were entirely kid-targeted fantasies and not quite expected to break out.
There is a cruel irony in Extraction succeeding as an old-fashioned, R-rated, star-driven Hollywood action spectacular whose kind once defined an “A-level” studio release. It likely would have garnered solid viewership anyway, but the continuing pandemic, which has left folks stuck in their homes indefinitely and kept new big Hollywood theatricals out of the multiplex, has left this it as the default summer tentpole spectacular of the season. The movie everyone hopes will jump-start the movie industry is also a ($200 million) throwback as well. All in a year where the biggest grosser is Will Smith’s R-rated throwback Bad Boys For Life. This is an odd way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Mission: Impossible II.
