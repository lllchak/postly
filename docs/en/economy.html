    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A battered bowler hat from the James Bond film Goldfinger has been valued at up to £30,000 on the Antiques Roadshow. The steel-rimmed hat and weapon belonged to hitman Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata, in the 1964 film.
The owner said he was a big 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia. The studio gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but removed the metal rim.
“As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it,” the owner said.
It was previously revealed that the hat appears on the BBC One show, leaving Antiques Roadshow expert Marc Allum “shaking with anticipation and excitement”.
The Bond item was part of a collection of 007 memorabilia brought to Antiques Roadshow when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.

The item was one of 61 lots sold by the Bonhams auction house in aid of the NHS Charities Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bond villain's hat goes up for auction on Antiques Roadshow for thousands</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oddjob’s deadly bowler hat in the 007 film ­Goldfinger has made a ­surprise appearance on the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow.
The battered steel-rimmed hat was one of those thrown by actor and Olympic weightlifter Harold Sakata in the 1964 film, and valued at up to £30,000.
It was part of a collection of James Bond memorabilia brought to the show when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
The hat, together with a 007 number plate, left Roadshow expert Marc Allum amazed.
He called them an “iconic part of Bond history”, adding: “I’m shaking with excitement.”
The owner said he was a huge 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery as Bond and Gert Frobe as the baddie.
He asked for memorabilia and Pinewood Studios gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but insisted the metal rim be taken out before it was handed over as it was too dangerous.
He said: “As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it any more, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it.”
Despite the damage, Marc valued the flat-crowned bowler at £20,000 to £30,000 and the 007 number plate, which was used by Aston Martin to promote the film but never appeared on screen, at £4,000 to £6,000.
The owner of the collection said they would be stowed away, but he would be interested in selling them.
Over the years, Antiques Roadshow has valued several James Bond items including a jacket worn by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale at £3,000-£5,000 and a watch used in The World is Not Enough valued at £15,000-£20,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antiques Roadshow sees James Bond hat valued at £30k</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antiques Roadshow shocked tonight as a James Bond bowler hat struck gold for a 007 fan with an impressive £30k valuation.
The battered accessory, which used to deadly effect by infamous hitman Oddjob (played by Harold Sakata) in the 1964 film Goldfinger, was part of a collection of James Bond memorabilia brought to the show when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
Expert Marc Allum was seriously impressed by the treasures – including a number plate – and branded them as an ‘iconic part of Bond history.’
Looking at the items, Allum enthused: ‘I’m shaking with anticipation and excitement. This, I think, is an amazingly iconic collection of objects and an amazing story too.’
The owner admitted he was a huge fan of the franchise as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia.
The studio gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but insisted the metal rim was taken out before it was handed over – with disastrous consequences.
‘As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it,’ they said.
Despite the damage, Marc valued the bowler hat between £20k-30k and the 007 number plate, which was used by Aston Martin to promote the film but never appeared on screen, at £4-6k.
Although the owner of the collection said the items would be safely stowed away, he did express an interest in selling them.
Over the years Antiques Roadshow has valued several James Bond items including a jacket worn by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale valued at £3-5k, a watch used in The World is Not Enough valued at £15-20k, and a first edition of The Man With The Golden Gun valued at £1.2-£1.5k.
Antiques Roadshow airs tonight at 7.15pm on BBC One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oddjob's lethal bowler hat appears on Antiques roadshow! Iconic Bond prop was given to Sean Connery's chauffeur while filming Goldfinger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An iconic Bond prop given to Sean Connery's chauffeur could fetch thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer on Antiques Roadshow.
Oddjob's lethal bowler hat, which appeared in Goldfinger, famously had the ability to slice the heads off statues with its blades.
The price the hat sold for has not been revealed, but a second prop that appeared in Christie's, London, in 1998 went for £62,000. 
Oddjob actor Harold Sakata would famously hurl the steel-rimmed hat at enemies during the 1964 film.
He also hurled the weapon at James Bond while he was removing items from a vault. It misses and cuts through electric cables. 
In 1998, the hat was a stand out item of 270 Bond lots that went under the hammer, reports the BBC.
A single collection, amassed by an avid Bond enthusiast over 28 years before the sale, formed the backbone of the auction. Some items also came from stuntman Bob Simmons and other workers at Pinewood Studios.
Actor Desmond Llewellyn said: 'I think it's fantastic, but these people are crazy. The amount of money they are spending is unbelievable.' 
Mr Sakata died in July 1982 in Hawaii, US, from cancer. He came to the attention of Bond directors when they were casting for a mute Asian villain to star in their latest film.
After the role, Sakata went on to be cast as several other military figures before his death. 
The hat's value will be revealed on the BBC programme at 7.15pm tonight.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffet Sells Full Slate of U.S. Airlines Investments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sold its entire holdings in U.S. airlines in the wake of the coronavirus that has led to a virtual standstill of the industry and revenue losses in the billions.
Buffet revealed the news to shareholders on Saturday, according to a Reuters report, which included that the conglomerate had some $7 to $8 billion invested in the airline industry:
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business,” Buffet said. “We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. We will not fund a company that — where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.”
Bershire had already sold 18 percent of its Delta stake and four percent of Southwest shares, it announced on April 3.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s virtual annual meeting. “I am the one who made the decision.”
“Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines,” Reuters reported. “He did invest in USAir in 1989.”
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in 2007. “Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett says he dumped entire stake in airline-sector stocks: ‘The world changed for airlines’ amid coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway dumped all of its holdings in the airline sector, painting a grim picture of the industry that has been badly hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I was wrong about that business,” Buffett said, speaking on Saturday in Omaha, Neb., at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting, which was held virtually due to the deadly disease.
Back in April, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -1.04%BRK.B, -1.07% disclosed that it sold large blocks of stock in Delta Air Lines DAL, -3.81% and Southwest Airlines LUV, -4.13%.
Subsidiaries of Berkshire sold 13 million Delta shares for a total of $314.2 million and 2.3 million Southwest shares amounting to more than $74 million, as he looked to substantially scale back his ownership of the airlines sector which has been devastated by stay-at-home protocols that have been put in place since the coronavirus epidemic took hold of the world over the past three months.
Buffett, however, explained that his company and its subsidiaries have now unloaded their entire stake in airlines.
Buffett explained at the meeting that he thought he was getting roughly 10% of the four largest airlines for an attractive price. He also owned stakes in American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -3.15% and United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -4.51%. Collectively, those airlines, represent some 80% of the passenger miles flown in the U.S., Buffett said.
But he determined recently that his decision, in light of the emerging pathogen, was ill-advised and he sought to unload his position: “I just decided that I’d made a mistake.”
As of the most recent filings, Berkshire had held 70 million shares of Delta representing 1.7% of the conglomerate’s portfolio, according to data provider Whale Wisdom. Berkshire also had roughly 54 million shares of Southwest, representing 1.2% of its holdings, 22 million shares of United Airlines, representing 0.8% and 42.5 million shares of American Airlines, about 0.5% of Berkshire, according to the site.
“The airline business, and I may be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong, changed in a major way,” he explained, noting that it has been through no fault of the CEOs of the companies. “I’ve been basically told not to fly,” he added, noting that he may not fly commercial going forward.
“I wouldn’t normally talk about it, but I think it requires an explanation,” he said of his decision to discuss selling airline stocks.
“We like those airlines but the world has changed…and I don’t know how it’s changed,” he said.
Shares of Delta, the largest airline by market capitalization, were down 59% in the year to date, United Airlines were off nearly 70% so far this year, Southwest shares were down by about 46% thus far in 2020, and American Airlines was off 63% over the same period, as of Friday’s close. An exchange-traded fund that tracks the industry, U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, -2.74%, was down by more than 55% in the year to date.
By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.56% was off 17% so far this year, after recovering much of its March decline in April. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.90% was looking at a year-to-date loss of 12.4% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.13% was down 4.1% so far in 2020.
Airlines received a $25 billion U.S. government bailout back in mid April to prop up the industry
The Trump administration reached an agreement with major airlines over the terms of a $25 billion bailout to prop up an industry hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Volumes for airlines are down substantially, according to industry groups, with the aircraft and passenger volume down more than 90%, compared with a year ago, according to industry group Airlines for America, and more than 3,000 planes have been idled, constituting about half of the active fleets.
On Sunday, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said he thinks the first week of April was the worst period for his company of the coronavirus pandemic, and business should pick up from here.
Speaking in an interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” he said, “I don’t think June will be a good month, but hopefully it will be a bit better than May.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells entire stake in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sold its stakes in the four largest U.S. airline companies, Warren Buffett, the owner of the conglomerate holding company, told shareholders on Saturday. 
Berkshire Hathaway held an 11 percent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 percent of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, and 9 percent of United Airlines, making it one of the largest holders in those companies, according to Reuters. The company had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion in the four companies, Buffett said. 
Citing the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and what it's done to demand for air travel, Buffett said that he decided to sell those stakes because he concluded he'd made a "mistake in valuing." 
"We took money out of the business, basically, even at a substantial loss," Buffett said. "We will not fund a company ... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
"The airline business — and I may be wrong, and I hope I'm wrong — I think it changed in a very major way, and it's obviously changed in the fact that their four companies are each going to borrow perhaps average of at least $10 [billion] or $12 billion each," he added. 
Airlines around the world have experienced a substantial financial hit in recent months as planes stay grounded due to a rapid drop in demand. American Airlines reported a first-quarter net loss of $2.2 billion. United Airlines said its net loss was $1.7 billion. 
Buffett's holding company also reported a loss of nearly $50 billion during the first quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. He expressed optimism about the U.S.'s ability to recover economically during the shareholder meeting, saying, "The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed, and it will do so again."
At the same time, he voiced concerns about the U.S. airline industry and its ability to recover to pre-pandemic levels. 
"I don't know whether two or three years from now that as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did," he said. 
The Trump administration and the major U.S. airlines reached an agreement last month on a $25 billion bailout to help companies weather a sudden drop in revenue. The program, which was created as part of the coronavirus stimulus package signed by President Trump in March, is intended to help the airlines pay staff.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">

The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world’s largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
“It turns out I was wrong,” he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and “we did not take out anything like that,” he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, “the airlines business I think changed in a very major way” and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett’s announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
‘American miracles, American magic’ 
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback “temporary” but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
“We’ve faced great problems in the past, haven’t faced this exact problem — in fact we haven’t really faced anything that quite resembles this problem,” Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country’s economic history.
“But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again.”
“We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789… We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction,” he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women’s suffrage.
“Never bet against America.”
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company’s annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a “Woodstock for capitalists.”
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway’s wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Growth by one measure 
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company’s bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company’s performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net — to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion — resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated “Oracle of Omaha.” Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting “comparative revenue and earnings increases” over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies — including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses — are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are “necessary actions” and “temporary,” it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway sells US airline shares</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines.
Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Buffett said "the world has changed" because of the coronavirus.
He then said he had been wrong to invest in the airline industry.
Mr Buffett's comments came just hours after Berkshire Hathaway announced a record $50bn (£40bn) net first quarter loss, Reuters news agency reports.
The conglomerate had an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines, 10% of Southwest Airlines, and 9% of United Airlines, according to its annual report and company filings.
The firm began investing in the four airlines in 2016, after avoiding the aviation industry for years.
Mr Buffett told the meeting, which was held virtually: "We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss.
"We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."
The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service.
Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit.
"It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up," he said. "It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country."
In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has "tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team".
The airline added that it remains "confident" in its strengths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'American magic' will spur US economic recovery: Warren Buffett</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed."
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
- 'American miracles, American magic' - Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again."
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations.
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
- Growth by one measure - Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Billionaire Warren Buffett dumps airline stocks as Berkshire Hathaway posts $US50b loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire US investor Warren Buffett said his company Berkshire Hathaway completely exited its stakes in the four major US airlines, as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the vaunted investment firm to $US49.7 billion ($77 billion) quarterly loss.
The sales of shares of Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines made up most of the company's $US6.5 billion in equity sales in April.
During his live-streamed annual meeting, Buffett said the business has fundamentally changed following the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. He declined to blame the performance of the airline executives, saying they've done a good job of raising money to get through the crisis.
"The world changed for airlines and I wish them well," Buffett said Saturday. He clarified that he made the decision and that he lost money on his investments. "That was my mistake."
Buffett's had a complicated relationship with the airline industry over the years. After a troublesome investment in USAir, Buffett joked that he would call an 800 number to declare he was an "air-o-holic" if he ever got the urge to invest in airlines again.
Then in 2016, Berkshire dove into the industry again, amassing stakes in the four largest US airlines. At the end of 2019, those stakes amounted to almost $US10 billion. Buffett's renewed faith in the industry prompted speculation that he might one day own one of the carriers.
But now, he's cut those investments again. Berkshire disclosed in April that it had at least trimmed its Delta and Southwest stakes, both of which had previously been above a 10 per cent ownership level.
"The airline business - and I may be wrong and I hope I'm wrong - but I think it's changed in a very major way," Buffett said. "The future is much less clear to me."
The disclosure was among the most significant at the annual meeting, which was notable for its different feel this year as the event that usually draws tens of thousands was done was hosted virtually. Buffett, 89, shared the stage with a top deputy, Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire's non-insurance operating units.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, didn't join, though Buffett said his longtime business partner was in good health.
Buffett said he didn't know how consumer travel habits will change after the pandemic subsides, but any reduction in travel could leave airlines with higher-than-necessary fixed costs. Any impact could filter down to suppliers like Boeing Co.
"The real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not," he said.
Buffett said the efforts to slow the pandemic amounted to "quite an experiment," and while the range of public health and economic outcomes has narrowed, they remain "enormous."
"I don't know the consequences" of shutting down large parts of the US economy, Buffett said, though Berkshire's operating earnings will be "considerably less" than if the virus hadn't hit.
Buffett gave an extended history lesson to back up his assertion that "nothing basically can stop America." He said he's still bullish on the US economy because it has overcome many obstacles over the past two centuries, though "we haven't faced anything that quite resembles this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ditched the 'big four' airline stocks in April, driving $6.1 billion in stock sales</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold the “big four” airline stocks in April, the famed investor revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday.
“It turned out I was wrong,” Buffett said about his decision to invest in the airlines. The companies are well managed and the CEOs “did a lot of things right,” he continued, but “the airline business … changed in a very major way.”
Berkshire’s first-quarter earnings revealed that it sold $6.1 billion in stock in April, without detailing what it sold. Buffett attributed that figure to Berkshire’s exit from the airlines.

Buffett explained the move by highlighting the airlines’ bailout deals with the US government. Their agreements include billions of dollars in loans that they will have to repay, as well as warrants that the Treasury can exercise to acquire their shares at a discount in the future. The warrant part of the deal was inspired by Buffett’s bailouts of Goldman Sachs and other companies during the financial crisis.
The investor also questioned whether people will fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if passenger volumes bounce back to 70% or 80% of their pre-coronavirus levels, he said, the carriers will be left with “too many planes.”
“The future is much less clear to me,” Buffett said about the airline business.

"The future is much less clear to me," Buffett said about the airline business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire sells entire stakes in US airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK, May 3 — Berkshire Hathaway Inc has sold its entire stakes in the four largest US airlines, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting.
The conglomerate held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11 per cent stake in Delta Air Lines and about 9 per cent stakes in both United Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co at the end of 2019, according to its annual report.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse US travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around US$7 billion or US$8 billion (RM30 or RM34.3 billion) amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like US$7 or US$8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sales.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Buffett added. — Reuters

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold the “big four” airline stocks in April, the famed investor revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday.
“It turned out I was wrong,” Buffett said about his decision to invest in the airlines. The companies are well managed and the CEOs “did a lot of things right,” he continued, but “the airline business … changed in a very major way.”
Berkshire’s first-quarter earnings revealed that it sold $US6.1 billion in stock in April, without detailing what it sold. Buffett attributed that figure to Berkshire’s exit from the airlines.

Buffett explained the move by highlighting the airlines’ bailout deals with the US government.

The warrant part of the deal was inspired by Buffett’s bailouts of Goldman Sachs and other companies during the financial crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Says Berkshire Is Reversing Course on Airlines—Again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett is reversing course on his airlines bet -- again.
The billionaire investor said Berkshire Hathaway Inc. completely exited its stakes in the four major U.S. airlines. The sales of shares of Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. made up most of the company’s $6.5 billion in equity sales in April.
During his live-streamed annual meeting, Buffett said the business has fundamentally changed following the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. He declined to blame the performance of the airline executives, saying they’ve done a good job of raising money to get through the crisis.
“The world changed for airlines and I wish them well,” Buffett said Saturday. He clarified that he made the decision and that he lost money on his investments. “That was my mistake.”
Buffett’s had a complicated relationship with the airline industry over the years. After a troublesome investment in USAir, Buffett joked that he would call an 800 number to declare he was an “air-o-holic” if he ever got the urge to invest in airlines again.
Then in 2016, Berkshire dove into the industry again, amassing stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines. At the end of 2019, those stakes amounted to almost $10 billion. Buffett’s renewed faith in the industry prompted speculation that he might one day own one of the carriers.
But now, he’s cut those investments again. Berkshire disclosed in April that it had at least trimmed its Delta and Southwest stakes, both of which had previously been above a 10% ownership level.
“The airline business -- and I may be wrong and I hope I’m wrong -- but I think it’s changed in a very major way,” Buffett said. “The future is much less clear to me.”
The disclosure was among the most significant at the annual meeting, which was notable for its different feel this year as the event that usually draws tens of thousands was hosted virtually. Buffett, 89, shared the stage with a top deputy, Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire’s non-insurance operating units. Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, didn’t join, though Buffett said his longtime business partner was in good health.
Buffett said he didn’t know how consumer travel habits will change after the pandemic subsides, but any reduction in travel could leave airlines with higher-than-necessary fixed costs. Any impact could filter down to suppliers like Boeing Co.
“The real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not,” he said.
Buffett said the efforts to slow the pandemic amounted to “quite an experiment,” and while the range of public health and economic outcomes has narrowed, they remain “enormous.”
“I don’t know the consequences” of shutting down large parts of the U.S. economy, Buffett said, though Berkshire’s operating earnings will be “considerably less” than if the virus hadn’t hit.
Buffett gave an extended history lesson to back up his assertion that “nothing basically can stop America.” He said he’s still bullish on the U.S. economy because it has overcome many obstacles over the past two centuries, though “we haven’t faced anything that quite resembles this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett’s company reports Q1 loss of $50 billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Hard-hit by the market rout surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company of Warren Buffett, has reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion, it reported Saturday.
The company, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called the setback “temporary” but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company’s annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a “Woodstock for capitalists.”
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway’s wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
The meeting is set to begin at 3:45 pm Central time (2045 GMT) and will be live-streamed.
Buffett, in a statement, played down the bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company’s performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier.
The brutal drop in the net — to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion — resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated “Oracle of Omaha.” Buffett, famous for his relatively sedate lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting “comparative revenue and earnings increases” over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies — including in rail transport, energy production, and some manufacturing and service businesses — are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Sunday it was giving privately held Canadian firm AbCellera Biologics Inc C$176 million to help it find naturally produced antibodies that could be used to battle the coronavirus outbreak.
Federal Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said AbCellera had identified over 500 antibodies from a patient who has recovered from COVID-19.
“This funding is instrumental in accelerating and expanding AbCellera’s capabilities to combat COVID-19. AbCellera and its partners expect clinical trials to begin in July 2020 or earlier,” he said in a statement.
The money will also help the firm to build a Vancouver facility that can manufacture antibodies for clinical testing, he added.
AbCellera said in March it was working with Eli Lilly and Co to co-develop antibody products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, a flu-like disease caused by the coronavirus.

AbCellera, which says it has identified more than 500 antibodies from a patient who recovered from Covid-19, said it will use the money “to expand efforts related to the discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat Covid-19” and build technology for future antibody therapies.
AbCellera’s research may also be used to create tests for Covid-19, and the company is working with other organizations to develop new diagnostics to monitor the disease, according to a government statement.
Separately, another Canadian biotech firm, Spartan Bioscience Inc., said it is recalling a Covid-19 testing product after the National Microbiology Laboratory raised concerns about its efficacy, the Ottawa-based company said on its website.
The government’s focus remains on how to resolve the crisis and it’s too early to draw conclusions about the origin of the pandemic, Trudeau said at the news conference. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said there is “enormous evidence” the coronavirus outbreak began in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, without providing proof.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Vancouver based AbCellera Biologics is receiving $175-million in federal support
Funding the research company is an effort to treat COVID-19
OTTAWA (NEWS 1130) — The federal government is pouring millions of dollars into a Vancouver-based bio-research company, which is looking into the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
$175-million to AbCellera Biologics was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his daily update from Ottawa Sunday morning.
He said the company is doing a “very promising” work around COVID-19.
“They’ve identified antibodies that could be used in drugs to treat this virus. This new funding will help them continue their vital work, and will support human [trials].”
Trials will begin as early as July.
In addition to the federal support, the City of Vancouver is “ensuring AbCellera has the infrastructure needed as they accelerate finding a treatment for COVID-19,” Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart says in a release published by AbCellera.
“We couldn’t be more proud to be on the front lines of this global effort thanks to the innovation and leadership of AbCellera,” Stewart adds.
During Trudeau’s Sunday briefing, he said, although while Canadians wait for effective treatments or a vaccine, “we still need a reliable supply of everything from masks to ventilators.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global smartphone shipments down 13% in Q1 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what is pretty much expected news, the global smartphone market has met with a pretty steep decline this year and will continue to experience low numbers the next few months. Given the state of most countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, both shipping and production of devices are affected. The latest numbers from a research firm show that the first quarter of 2020 had a 13% decline on smartphone shipments year on year and it’s the first time it fell below 300 million units since 2014.
According to Counterpoint Research’s Market Monitor Service, the 13% decline of the smartphone market is the fastest decline ever for the 1st quarter of the year. The shipments fell below 300 million units from January to March 2020 and it’s actually the first time this has happened since the first quarter of 2014. This is in part due to the 27% decline in China, which is due to both lower consumer demand and disruption in production and shipment.
Xiaomi and Realme are the only exceptions in terms of the decline in shipments with the former increasing 7% and the latter getting an amazing 157% but these are year on year numbers of course. The main reason for this increase is that India went on lockdown pretty late and both companies have a pretty huge market in that country. But the other main brands suffered losses like Samsung (18%), Huawei (17%), and Apple (5%).
The slight good news for the industry is that the share of 5G smartphones actually increased to 8% for Q1 of 2020 as compared to 1% in Q4 2019. Hopefully, the good numbers for 5G-capable devices will help the numbers for the second half of 2020, although the pace of these rollouts per country is of course affected by all the quarantines and lockdowns. Some countries like Spain and India have postponed 5G implementation.
Trendforce has predicted that global smartphone shipments will experience further decline in the second quarter of 2020. Most industries are expecting this anyway, but the electronic device market will probably be one of the hardest-hit even after nation-wide quarantines are lifted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Research finds that the global smartphone market shrank by the "fastest ever" rate in 1Q2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The market for mobile devices contracted by 13% in the first quarter of 2020 (1Q2020), compared to 1Q2019. All of its top brands, with the exception of Realme and Xiaomi, also saw declines in terms of shipments and share. However, they may all see even more adversity in 2Q2020.
Counterpoint Research has released its global smartphone market report for 1Q2020. It shows that shipments in this sector of the tech economy have dipped below 300 million, something that has not, apparently, happened for quite some time.
This worrying indication is, unsurprisingly, attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. It has driven the market down by 13% year-on-year (YoY). The majority of the top10OEMs in this space also saw declines in their shipments; however, thanks to their reduced pverall volume, individual companies' share of this market mostly declined by single-figure percentages or stayed flat.
The only brands to see gains in this quarter were Xiaomi and Realme. The latter maintained its excellent record for growth as of late with increased shipments of 157%, whereas the former improved in these terms by 7%.
However, neither OEM is likely to replicate this success in 2Q2020, thanks (again) to the knock-on effect of the global public health crisis in prominent markets such as India.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Services And Wearables Have Protected Apple From The Pandemic, But What About The Looming Economic Crisis?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There are a number of interesting surprises to be found in Apple’s financial results. The first is that in a period defined by the coronavirus pandemic, with half the world in lockdown and its stores closed, the company has not only improved its sales and exceed the analysts’ forecasts by showing remarkable resilience, but also its servicesand wearables divisions — two relatively recent commitments within the company’s strategic plan — have enjoyed strong growth.
Global revenues of $58.3 billion represent an increase of 1% over the same period as last year under very different circumstances, beating the analysts’ consensus of $54.54. That may not sound like much compared to Amazon’s numbers, but let’s not forget that many companies are now in the red. But beyond the global number, what is really interesting is the $13.35 billion the services division contributed, compared to $11.45 billion last year; along with the $6.28 billion dollars from wearables and accessories, compared to $5.13 billion a year ago. This is because the emphasis on these two divisions is relatively recent, a strategic refocus that has effectively served to balance the company’s books at a difficult time. Apple’s services and wearables have been its protective mask while the rest of the world caught the virus.
The question, obviously, is not what will happen during the pandemic, which should be relatively short — or so we hope — but afterwards, when the economic crisis kicks in. While we’ve been in lockdown, Apple News has reached 125 million active monthly users, which is not that surprising given Apple’s strong corporate umbrella.
It’s worth asking how many of those users will continue to pay the ten dollars a month it costs in the midst of an economic crisis that is likely to be prolonged. In general, subscription services such as Netflix, Spotify, Apple Music, etc. are somehow considered luxuries, in that the content they provide can, in most cases, be obtained free through other more or less regular channels, which implies that the decision to pay is fundamentally a question of convenience. In that sense, the services that have allowed Apple to balance its books during the pandemic may not be so useful in the post-pandemic phase, especially if the economic crisis turns out to be intense or prolonged. Even Tim Cook has recognized a few uncertainties for the (not so) foreseeable future.
As a rule, services have a certain reputation for being more sensitive to economic crises than tangible products. That said, the rules don’t usually apply to Apple. It will be interesting to see how its results pan out over the year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three quarters of British truckers expect to go out of business within just 2 months due to the coronavirus outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UK truckers are warning Boris Johnson's government that they could go out of business in weeks without more financial support for dealing with the impact of the coronavirus on their industry.
The truckers are playing a vital role in transporting essentials like food and PPE around Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, but their futures still look bleak. Three-quarters say they don't expect their jobs to survive beyond two months, a stark new survey, conducted in the latter part of April and published this weekend, has found.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA), the trade body representing the trucking industry in the UK,  asked its members a series of questions about how the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus had affected their trade.
When asked by the RHA how long they expect their livelihoods to survive at current volume, 75% said two months or less, while 52% said no more than a month. 13% said they expected to go out of business within two weeks.
Richard Burnett, the RHA's Chief Executive, this week, wrote to the government asking for five emergency measures to help the truckers whose cashflow has been torpedoed by the outbreak of the virus and subsequent nationwide lockdown.
They included a temporary suspension of business rates and fuel tax, plus a retention scheme to cover the cost of trucks not in action.
Industry figures have warned the UK government that most haulage operations in the UK are small-to-medium sized companies that will struggle to survive for much longer if their cashflow problems continue. Many already have small profit margins and are reluctant to apply for government loans, as they don't want to take on more debt.
The pain being inflicted on the industry is particularly acute for truckers moving loads, which aren't food and PPE.
Demand for other goods like clothing has plummeted amid the COVID-19 outbreak, while the UK government's strict social distancing measures have forced shops, restaurants, and factories across the country to close.
"If the economy is to recover from this, it is important that we can switch on the supply chain as individual sectors begin their recovery," Burnett said this week.
"No-one knows for sure when that will be, but we must make sure that the industry is up and ready to go at very short notice. We recognize that we need to play the fullest role possible in the UK's recovery and these measures would ensure we can do just that."
The RHA findings published this weekend illustrate the scale of the challenge facing the trucking sector.
LoadingSomething is loading.
73% of respondents said their cash flow had significantly reduced or worsened, with 13% saying they have no cash flow whatsoever. 56% have applied to the UK government's furlough scheme to cover the wages of out-of-work staff.
A figure in the logistics industry, who wished not to be named, told Business Insider: "The situation is dire.
"Ports are suffering, hauliers in non-food or PPE segments are really struggling and facing collapse really struggling, and even those carrying food are facing increasingly tough competition."
A UK government spokesperson told Business Insider:"Hauliers are vital to the nation's battle against Covid-19, and to help support the sector we have made changes to road transport operator licensing, vehicle testing, driver medical renewals, driver training and drivers hours.
"We continue to work with the sector and encourage all firms to make use of the unprecedented package of measures announced by the Chancellor, including £330bn of government backed loans, cash grants and support with tax bills, to help businesses through this difficult time."
However, opposition parties said ministers needed to give industry more support.
Responding to the RHA findings, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said: "Our lorry drivers are essential workers who are keeping the supermarket shelves stocked and delivering other vital supplies.
"Much of this is imported but there are fewer goods going in the opposite direction, putting a big strain on the viability of road hauliers.
"There are real concerns that the furlough scheme needs to have greater flexibility in sectors like road transport. The government should listen to industry and the trade unions and give them the support that employers and workers need to survive the crisis."
Bill Esterson, Labour MP and shadow trade minister, said: "We have to keep this essential industry going to maintain our food supply and viable for us to restart international trade when we eventually emerge from the crisis."
Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Transport and International Trade spokesperson, told Business Insider "the Government must do whatever is necessary to support haulage companies.
"This is about protecting vital supply lines for food and medicine as the coronavirus crisis continues."
She added: "Liberal Democrats are also calling on Ministers to listen to business and find an urgent fix to the business loans scheme, so that small businesses can access the finance they need. Otherwise, people's livelihoods are at risk."

“This is about protecting vital supply lines for food and medicine as the coronavirus crisis continues.”
She added: “Liberal Democrats are also calling on Ministers to listen to business and find an urgent fix to the business loans scheme, so that small businesses can access the finance they need. Otherwise, people’s livelihoods are at risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three quarters of British truckers expect to go out of business within just 2 months due to the coronavirus outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UK truckers are warning Boris Johnson’s government that they could go out of business in weeks without more financial support for dealing with the impact of the coronavirus on their industry.
The truckers are playing a vital role in transporting essentials like food and PPE around Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, but their futures still look bleak. Three-quarters say they don’t expect their jobs to survive beyond two months, a stark new survey, conducted in the latter part of April and published this weekend, has found.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA), the trade body representing the trucking industry in the UK, asked its members a series of questions about how the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus had affected their trade.
When asked by the RHA how long they expect their livelihoods to survive at current volume, 75% said two months or less, while 52% said no more than a month. 13% said they expected to go out of business within two weeks.
Richard Burnett, the RHA’s Chief Executive, this week, wrote to the government asking for five emergency measures to help the truckers whose cashflow has been torpedoed by the outbreak of the virus and subsequent nationwide lockdown.
They included a temporary suspension of business rates and fuel tax, plus a retention scheme to cover the cost of trucks not in action.
Industry figures have warned the UK government that most haulage operations in the UK are small-to-medium sized companies that will struggle to survive for much longer if their cashflow problems continue. Many already have small profit margins and are reluctant to apply for government loans, as they don’t want to take on more debt.
The pain being inflicted on the industry is particularly acute for truckers moving loads, which aren’t food and PPE.
Demand for other goods like clothing has plummeted amid the COVID-19 outbreak, while the UK government’s strict social distancing measures have forced shops, restaurants, and factories across the country to close.
“If the economy is to recover from this, it is important that we can switch on the supply chain as individual sectors begin their recovery,” Burnett said this week.
“No-one knows for sure when that will be, but we must make sure that the industry is up and ready to go at very short notice. We recognize that we need to play the fullest role possible in the UK’s recovery and these measures would ensure we can do just that.”
The RHA findings published this weekend illustrate the scale of the challenge facing the trucking sector.
73% of respondents said their cash flow had significantly reduced or worsened, with 13% saying they have no cash flow whatsoever. 56% have applied to the UK government’s furlough scheme to cover the wages of out-of-work staff.
A figure in the logistics industry, who wished not to be named, told Business Insider: “The situation is dire.
“Ports are suffering, hauliers in non-food or PPE segments are really struggling and facing collapse really struggling, and even those carrying food are facing increasingly tough competition.”
A UK government spokesperson told Business Insider:”Hauliers are vital to the nation’s battle against Covid-19, and to help support the sector we have made changes to road transport operator licensing, vehicle testing, driver medical renewals, driver training and drivers hours.
“We continue to work with the sector and encourage all firms to make use of the unprecedented package of measures announced by the Chancellor, including £330bn of government backed loans, cash grants and support with tax bills, to help businesses through this difficult time.”
However, opposition parties said ministers needed to give industry more support.
Responding to the RHA findings, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said: “Our lorry drivers are essential workers who are keeping the supermarket shelves stocked and delivering other vital supplies.
“Much of this is imported but there are fewer goods going in the opposite direction, putting a big strain on the viability of road hauliers.
“There are real concerns that the furlough scheme needs to have greater flexibility in sectors like road transport. The government should listen to industry and the trade unions and give them the support that employers and workers need to survive the crisis.”
Bill Esterson, Labour MP and shadow trade minister, said: “We have to keep this essential industry going to maintain our food supply and viable for us to restart international trade when we eventually emerge from the crisis.”
Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Transport and International Trade spokesperson, told Business Insider “the Government must do whatever is necessary to support haulage companies.

Concerns have been raised that meat plants could emerge as black spots for Covid-19 infections after employees at a number of factories tested positive for the virus.
The Agriculture Minister confirmed in the Dáil that his department was aware of six clusters in the sector.
It is feared a larger shutdown of plants, as seen in the US, could have a significant impact on the food supply chain and would devastate the incomes of livestock farmers already reeling from the closure of key markets abroad.
TD Paul Murphy warned in the Dáil this week that meat factories and other workplaces could follow nursing homes in becoming the next big Covid-19 clusters.
Meat factories here say beef processing is down 20-30pc due to market disruption and the loss of demand from European foodservice markets.

Russia has reported its highest one-day jump in new coronavirus cases as some other countries relax lockdown restrictions.
China, where the pandemic began in December, reported a single new infection on Saturday, extending a steady decline in confirmed cases.
Russia’s government reported 7,933 new cases on Friday, raising its total to 114,431. The true number is believed to be higher because not everyone is tested and Russian tests are reported to be only 70% to 80% accurate.

Banks will be expected to assess well in advance the likelihood of borrowers not being able to return to full debt repayment after an up to six-month payment break, including looking at the effect of the Covid-19 crisis on different sectors of the economy.
Loan loss provisions for the first quarter of the year are expected to be well up on last year, and likely to be higher still for the second quarter of the year which started on April 1st and falls entirely within the lockdown period.
It is understood the Central Bank will monitor the provisions banks make for estimated losses stemming from the Covid-19 shut down to include taking a view on the medium-term effect the crisis may have on house prices and jobs. That's despite the fact borrowers getting a payment break won't be classed as non-performing or problem accounts.

The public will be given guidance on the wearing of face coverings in public in two weeks at the end of this lockdown phase, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said last night.
He emphasised they are coverings, rather than medical-grade face masks, and said they might be used when travelling on public transport or in shops.
"We are not saying to rush out and use them now.
"We are working up on guidance in the next two weeks," he added.

A five-phase exit strategy has been unveiled by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who last night warned: "It will take some time for our lives to get back to normal." But he insisted: "It will happen."
With the country facing into another bank holiday weekend under lockdown, Mr Varadkar announced that older people who have been cocooning can leave their homes for short periods from next week.
However, they are advised to keep cocooning and avoid contact with anyone when they leave their homes. Over-70s will not be permitted visitors to their homes or to go to shops until the start of June.
Schools will remain closed until September - except for Leaving Cert exams. Crèches, childminders and pre-schools for children of essential workers will be opened on June 29 and all the aforementioned will be reopened for all workers on July 20.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">QUITO (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has approved a request from Ecuador for emergency financing to fight the coronavirus pandemic, granting a $643 million loan, the Andean country’s economy ministry said on Friday.
Ecuador has been among the hardest-hit countries in Latin America by the coronavirus, with 24,675 confirmed cases and 883 deaths, plus a further 1,357 deaths that were likely caused by the virus.
“This financing will allow us to have the necessary liquidity to support the reactivation of the economy, and protect jobs,” the ministry said in a statement.
The outbreak there is boosting pressure on President Lenin Moreno to default on $17 billion in debt and devote more resources toward fighting a pandemic that has left bodies in the streets of the country’s largest city, Guayaquil.
Moreno is scrambling to cover expenses with $3 billion from multilateral agencies and China, but is still securing firm commitments from those creditors.
The 5-year IMF loan has an interest rate of 1.05%, the ministry said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IMF approves emergency loan for Ecuador</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON, USA – The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a $643-million emergency loan for Ecuador, as the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices hit the South American nation.
The Ecuadorian Ministry of Economy and Finance said on Friday, May 1, the 5-year loan came with "favorable conditions" at 1.05% interest.
The country faces a double crisis in the form of the virus and a fall in oil prices, with the IMF forecasting a drop of 6.3% in the country's gross domestic product in 2020.
Ecuador has so far reported more than 25,000 COVID-19 infections and 1,000 deaths linked to the disease.
"This financing will provide the necessary liquidity to support the reactivation of production and the protection of jobs," the ministry said in a statement.
The credit offering joins a 3-year economic assistance program signed by Lenin Moreno's government with the international body in 2019.
That $4.2-billion loan involved a raft of cuts and fiscal adjustments that led to a wave of protests in October 2019 when the government raised fuel prices. – Rappler.com

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BLANTYRE — The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a $91 million loan for Malawi to help fund a balance of payments deficit exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fund said in a statement.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is having a severe impact on Malawi, creating an urgent balance of payments need,” Tao Zhang, deputy manager of the IMF, said in the statement.
“The authorities have been proactive in mitigating the impact of the pandemic, including through increased spending on health care and social assistance … and ensuring food security through purchase and storage of agricultural harvests,” he added.
The low-income southeast African country, which so far has reported 37 coronavirus cases and three deaths, was already suffering from economic stagnation linked to drought, leading to increasing unrest over falling living standards.
Malawi’s main export is tobacco, which makes up about half of export earnings, alongside other crops such as tea and sugar.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The International Monetary Fund will provide Ecuador with a $643 million loan to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak, the nation's Ministry of Economy and Finance said on Friday.
According to the Ministry, the IMF loan has been granted for 5 years and has an interest rate of 1.05%. 
On 1 May, the International Monetary Fund approved a two-year $10.8 billion credit line for Colombia under the Flexible Credit Line.
In April, it approved $389 million in emergency funding for El-Salvador to help cushion the nation’s economy from the impact of nationwide restrictions on transportation and quarantine for citizens exposed to the coronavirus.
Previously, the IMF said it was providing some $100 billion as a short-term liquidity line to more than 100 countries requiring emergency financing due to hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI: The Social Development Bank (SDB) in Saudi Arabia has recently launched new initiatives to support small businesses in the Kingdom, as well as self-employed entrepreneurs, state news agency SPA reported.
The move comes as the country explores ways to support the local economy, which has taken a hit as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
The bank said the aid – which amounted to over $2.39 billion  – will benefit 6,000 businesses through a special financing scheme, with a special focus on supporting health care.
The bank also offered a 6-month grace period, which began last month, for installments.
SDB earlier helped out 100,000 low income families, impacted by the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Saturday confirmed it had approved $643 million in emergency assistance for Ecuador, but said the Andean country would need additional support from other external partners to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the pandemic, plummeting oil prices and a sharp drop in global demand were having a devastating effect on Ecuador, one of the largest oil exporters in Latin America.
The IMF said the emergency aid would help Ecuador finance much-needed health and social assistance spending, while helping to catalyze additional resources from other multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire posts nearly $50 billion loss as coronavirus causes pain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is being hit hard by the coronaviruspandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing “relatively minor to severe” negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed “essential.”
The BNSF railroad saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See’s Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Buffett also allowed Berkshire’s cash stake to rise to a record $137.3 billion from $128 billion at the end of 2019.
That reflected the 89-year-old billionaire’s inability to make large, “elephant” size acquisitions for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, and caution in buying stocks.
Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock, but that was less than in the prior quarter.
“Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn’t see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.
Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is “as well positioned as it can be,” reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire “buy.”
Berkshire released results before its annual meeting, where Buffett said Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest U.S. airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.Buffett said Berkshire “made a mistake” investing approximately $7 billion to $8 billion in the sector, which was changed “in a very major way” as the pandemic shut down most air travel, through no fault of the airlines.
The meeting was streamed on Yahoo Finance. It was held without the usual “Woodstock for Capitalists,” a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, and which Buffett canceled because of the pandemic.
Berkshire’s first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire’s businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders.Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500, despite Buffett’s prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire’s stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and the four airlines.
Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett remains in bullish mood despite $50bn Covid-related losses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50bn (€45.5bn) at the weekend and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing “relatively minor to severe” negative effects from Covid-19, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed “essential.”
However, the billionaire investor has said the US’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the American economy and his investments.
Over more than four and a half hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway at the weekend, Mr Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on US. airlines.
Mr Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with one and three quarter hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Mr Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Mr Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75bn first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealised losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America and Apple during the market meltdown.
Mr Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.

Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter, and sold a net $6.1 billion in April. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, but that was less than the prior quarter.
"Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn't see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.
Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is "as well positioned as it can be," reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire "buy."
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel will likely discuss the pandemic at Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday afternoon, which will be streamed on Yahoo Finance.
The pandemic forced Buffett to cancel "Woodstock for Capitalists," a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha.
 
Berkshire Stock Underperforms
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire's businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders.
Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, despite Buffett's prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire's stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including American Express, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and four US airlines.
Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

Berkshire was not a large net buyer of equities in the quarter, purchasing $4 billion and selling $2.2 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Traffic and takeaways: readers on New Zealand's loosened lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I went back to work on Tuesday. It was exciting to start the day with a sense of purpose after five weeks of time melting into itself. It was a little discombobulating to dust off my clothes, boots and tool belt, and hunt out my bag and lunch box. It was so nice to be in my car, music turned up and travelling fast. I was nearly skipping when I got to work. It was exciting to see my work colleagues – we are a small team of three and we spend long hours working together, arguing and laughing. The first day was very physical – ripping out a wire fence, moving a cut-down tree – it’s going to take at least two weeks for my body to get used to the work again. Kylie Toka, fencer, Marton, Rangetikei
The sun had not even risen and my Kiwi husband was already down at the beach plunging into the cold water. Much to his disappointment, most ocean activities were prohibited in level 4, but the first day of level 3 in Wellington saw a glorious day of sunshine, no wind and still waters. Everyone flocked to the harbour to take up their preferred water-sport; kayaking, paddle-boarding, diving, snorkelling, fishing – everyone was either in or beside the harbour. Even a juvenile humpback whale swam in to join us in marking the special day. Sarah Keating, Wellington
I was so excited about getting back in my sea fishing kayak that I woke up at 3am and waited for the dawn. My fishing trip did not disappoint. The fish were virtually jumping into the kayak; kahawai nibbled at the bottom of the boat, and clouds of jack mackerel swirled and glistened. I dropped my line and after one minute the kayak lurched to the side – I’d got something big. The rod buckled and snapped in two. I was about to cut the line but decided to try and pull it in by hand – a beautiful 4kg snapper emerged from the depths. I’ve read stories from the time of Captain Cook and how the fish were so plentiful. I think I experienced a snapshot of what the coast of New Zealand must have been like in the 18th century. Xand Blee, Waiheke Island
Goodbye to the reduced air and noise pollution levels and the associated health benefits. I was really enjoying the clean air, blissful silence and, for the first time, seeing the water in the estuaries reflecting other colours than dirty brown. But those enjoyments were short lived. People couldn’t even wait until the end of lockdown to jump in their cars. On Friday there was so much traffic you could smell the pollution. Now in level 3, it seems that every man and his dog are in their cars, and you can hear the boy racers speeding on the roads, especially at night. I have already witnessed two incidents of road rage on my daily walk. In level 4 you could see whole families out cycling, but in just two days the motorists have intimidated them off the roads. Anonymous
When the lockdown was eased, it felt as though our town was waking up and stretching after a long sleep. A cafe was buzzing as people returned for their caffeine fix and they had to move the tables outside to remind people that it was takeaway only. The quiet hillside walks we have been taking, almost in complete solitude, were suddenly populated with people laughing and chatting. Vans and cars tripled overnight with tradies ready to carry out maintenance on rentals and holiday homes, and overdue jobs for locals. In the meantime, the native birds sang their hearts out in a backdrop that I hope we don’t lose in a rush to return to normal – whatever that may look like. Lorna Davies, Hanmer Springs
The first thing that was different was the noise. For weeks, I woke up to complete silence, like a Sunday morning, but more intense. I live in a quiet neighbourhood, so the increase in noise is not dramatic, but it is there, a dull background throbbing. I did a few hours of work, cleaned all the living areas, then the call of the beach got to me. I got in my car and drove to Mission Bay. Tamaki Drive, which has to be one of the more scenic city roads anywhere in the world, was a sight for sore eyes; the ocean, the city skyline, the boats, Rangitoto Island and freedom. I drove with the windows down, music blaring, and swore to myself that I would never take such simple pleasures for granted again. Katie Riley, Auckland
Our bubble went to the beach for the first time since before lockdown. It struck all of us how bizarre it was to see so many people out and about. We had become used to it just being the three of us. I’m not sure if a person can develop agoraphobia this quickly, but I definitely feel that gaining back our confidence in public spaces and trusting that those around you are not an immediate threat to your health and wellbeing, are going to be some of the biggest long-term mental challenges we’ll face as we slowly head back to “normal” life. Alice Morrison, Dunedin
The relaxation of lockdown to level 3 means I can allow contactless pickup and drop-off of work to my business. I altered my website so people can “book” the time they will be here, to avoid multiple people being on the premises at once. It is a relief to have customers again, but it is slow going. People seem to prefer to err on the side of caution and stay home still – I’ve not had a rush of work coming in. Marie Rhodes, self-employed picture framer, Tauranga
The messaging here has been clear and the level 4 lockdown saw generally good compliance from the public. Yesterday, however, reminded me how delicate all of this is. I popped to the pharmacy, as I have had to each week during level 4, and it was clear as soon as I pulled to the end of my road that the traffic was more like a normal Saturday afternoon than a Tuesday morning during lockdown. The queue for the McDonald’s drive-thru opposite the pharmacy snaked back towards the motorway, a pattern which seems to have been followed across the country. We are in danger now of losing all that we worked for. Chris Smith, Auckland
I live in the centre of Wellington. It was always a noisy area, but since the lockdown I had become accustomed to the quiet of the city centre. I had forgotten about the lifting of restrictions until I was awoken by the clattering of shutter doors from the appliance shop outside. I decided to go out for a flat white and it was almost overwhelming outside; I forgot to look before crossing the street and almost walked into traffic. The amount of people around made me feel anxious and I felt like the whole lockdown had been a strange dream. It was a beautiful sunny day and everyone seemed to be in great spirits, but I decided to go back to the bubble to finish my coffee. Daryl French, Wellington
It is noisy again - the kiwis do love a power tool, usually early in the morning – and the hope you had that people would be kinder and more relaxed already seems to be dissipating. My local village was bustling again; people queuing for the ubiquitous coffee (the 2m rule semi-ignored), cars becoming impatient with those crossing the road, not so many smiles and “hellos”. For me this will be a greater period of adjustment than the initial lockdown; you had “permission” to be slow, quiet, there were no social expectations, you didn’t have to wash your hair, wear make-up, plan your day, but already I feel the undercurrent of this reappearing and, for me, that will be hard. Jennifer Clements, Auckland

It was a dream years in the making. To offer my skills as a film-maker to Welsh businesses, voluntary organisations and the public sector. Yes, I was giving up a well-paid job with a major organisation. Sick pay, holidays, pension. But I was excited. Confident. And once I land my first client, I’d be unstoppable!
Then... Covid-19.
It had been rumbling down the tracks for weeks as I sipped coffee with contacts and went to networking events. But flu in China wasn’t going to derail my entrepreneurial ambition, was it?
As my leaving date approached – so did lockdown. Two weeks before I was due to leave I said goodbye to my colleagues on a Monday night expecting to edit and film as normal the next day.
But that was it. I never went back. Twenty-two years of corporate life finished and I didn’t even get a lukewarm pint or a leaving card. But lager and leaving cards are the least of my worries.
A regular pay cheque kept us in housing and holidays. Now what? I can’t even leave the house. Let alone shoot a video. The business cards are gathering dust. Yes, they are tax deductible. But if nobody is buying marketing videos I’m not going to have any income to pay tax on anyway!
I delete promising looking networking events from my diary. Rip up my financial forecasts. Truth be told, I’ve been increasingly alarmed and despondent for weeks. Depressed, even. Now, it’s looking like a car crash.
Around me, chaos. Neighbours and friends are laid off. My son’s plans for A-Levels and a trip to the Euros are in tatters. My daughter, home from uni. First year ended in March. My eldest, laid off from a brilliant job she’d started just weeks before.
This is difficult for me. It is difficult for everyone. I can’t listen to the news – it just gets worse. Around me there seems only darkness. Yet, I really can’t think like this. If I can possibly bring myself to see a positive, I have to.
This isn’t just a case of looking for opportunities in a crisis. They exist but I had to search for something else first – a positive state of mind. Basically, a recognition that we will get through this. If people were going to want me before – and they seemed to – they are going to want me after lockdown.
An adviser told me McDonalds are advertising like crazy. When we’re finally allowed out, they want to make sure the first place people go is through the golden arches. And that is the mindset I need. We all need to look up. Look to the future. And plan to make the post-virus world as good as it can be.
So, I postponed my plans for a hiking trip to Scotland, bought myself an incredibly expensive laptop, and began fine-tuning my business plan. My Linkedin is growing and I’m building networks on Zoom. And in doing this, I’m finding so much hope. So much positivity.
I listen to budding entrepreneurs tell me: “Do what you can do now. Plan. Set things up. Don’t worry too much about what you can’t change.”
And it is true. And I’m busier than I’ve ever been. Planning, fixing, networking. Putting my feet in the starting blocks for when this nightmare is over. The thing is, if I can launch a viable business in the middle of the biggest economic horror show in history, I have to have a chance! And I do love a challenge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sian Prior: Our upside down world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We’re all in an upside down world. Outside life has moved inside. Easy has become hard. But sometimes reversals can be positive. I’ve been writing a list of things that used to be annoying but that are now comforting.
The tradies working two doors down from me, for example. Their blaring radio and incessant hammering used to drive me bananas. I’d slam doors and jam in earplugs, trying to shut out the cacophony. Now I go out into the backyard just to hear them cursing while they work. Something normal is still happening, I tell myself. Someone’s making progress.
Ditto with the garbage trucks. Bin morning used to be a trial, woken before dawn by the crashing of bins and roaring of engines. Now I look forward to the garbos’ arrival. The rubbish is still being collected, I reassure myself. We’re not going to be buried alive in our own waste.
And then there’s exercise. I’ve always hated it - a necessary evil in a desk-bound life. I’d procrastinate all day about doing my laps or walking those 10,000 steps. Now I can’t wait to get out of the house and stride along the Merri Creek, marvelling at how birds can still sing in the midst of a pandemic.
My overstuffed shoulder bag is on the list. Years of scrabbling around in the bottom of a bag of detritus to find whatever I’m looking for. The bag is even more stuffed now, but the things in it are comforting – plastic gloves, tissues, a face mask, liquid soap, a water bottle, hand sanitiser, my phone, more plastic gloves. Self-protective items for a scary new world.
My overstuffed bookshelves were another irritant. Novels I read decades ago and haven’t touched since. Memoirs I’ve been planning to read for decades but haven’t opened yet. All of them gathering dust, taking up space, reproaching me. Now at last I know why I’ve hung onto them – for a moment in history just like this. Stories will keep me sane.
The list of unexpected comforts keeps getting longer. Junk mail deliverers. Overly-cheerful radio presenters. Even deadlines, those monkeys on my back, nagging at me to get back to work. This year I have a scary publishing deadline – six months to finish writing a book about the past. Thank goodness. Something to take my mind off the present. What’s on your list?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $6 billion in stock in April, its first-quarter earnings show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $6 billion worth of stocks in April, according to first-quarter earnings released on Saturday ahead of its annual meeting.
The famed investor's conglomerate holds stakes in Apple, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and other companies. It was widely expected to capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap, but instead netted about $6.1 billion from stock sales last month.
Berkshire's cash pile swelled from $128 billion on December 31 to $137 billion at the end of March, despite $1.8 billion in net stock purchases and $1.7 billion in share buybacks in the period.
The group's first-quarter figures fell short of the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Here are the key numbers:
Berkshire posted a net loss of $49.7 billion last quarter, its biggest-ever quarterly loss and a sharp swing from its net earnings of $21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The shift reflected $54.5 billion in investment losses, compared to a $15.5 billion gain in the same period last year.
However, Berkshire warned investors against reading too much into its earnings.
"The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules," the company said in its earnings release.
Berkshire's operating earnings grew 6% to $5.9 billion as insurance investment income and "other" earnings rose, offsetting lower insurance underwriting profits due to expected pandemic payouts and less income from its railroad, utilities and energy segment.
The conglomerate had $113 billion invested in equity securities at the end of March, a slight increase from $110 billion at the end of December. It raked in $965 million in after-tax gains from sales of investments last quarter, a sharp increase from $392 million in the comparable period.

Like many other companies, Berkshire warned that the coronavirus outbreak has "negatively affected" most of its businesses, with the effects ranging from "relatively minor to severe."
Several of its businesses including railroads, utilities, and insurance have been deemed essential and allowed to continue operating, but their revenues "slowed considerably" in April, Berkshire said. Other companies including retailers and some manufacturing and service groups are being "severely impacted" by closures, it added.
Berkshire added that the coronavirus fallout will likely continue in the current quarter.
"The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect ouroperating businesses in March and will likely adversely affect nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly," the company said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway Lost $50 Billion Last Quarter As Warren Buffett’s Investments Took A Hit From Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Warren Buffett’s famed investing conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a massive net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter, as the coronavirus-driven market sell-off took a significant toll on the company's stock holdings.
Berkshire posted a record net loss of $49.75 billion in the first quarter—down from $21.7 billion in profit last year.
That amounts to a loss of $30,653 per share, compared to profits of $13,209 per share in the first quarter of 2019.
Even as the coronavirus hurt the company’s business, Berkshire’s operating profit rose 6% to $5.87 billion, up from $5.56 billion a year ago.
Berkshire’s quarterly filing makes 31 references to coronavirus, showing the pandemic’s substantial impact on the company so far in 2020.
The first quarter saw many of Buffett’s largest stock holdings—including big banks and airlines, plummet even further than the benchmark S&P 500, which fell 20% during that period.
Buffett’s cash pile is up from $125 billion to $137.3 billion, as the Oracle of Omaha continues to look for an elephant-sized acquisition.
Buffett emerged as a key player who helped restore confidence in the markets during the 2008 financial crisis, but he’s remained relatively quiet during the 2020 coronavirus downturn. Charlie Munger, vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B , told the Wall Street Journal recently that the Oracle of Omaha is being “fairly conservative” with his investments in the current market. He also admitted that a few of Berkshire’s smaller businesses might altogether. Companies are reportedly not calling Berkshire for capital like they were in 2008: “The phone is not ringing off the hook,” Munger confirmed, adding that airlines are “all negotiating with the government, but they’re not calling Warren.”
Berkshire Hathaway’s stock is down 20% so far this year, compared to a 13% decline for the S&P 500.
Warren Buffett is the world’s fourth-richest person, with a net worth of $72 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates.
Berkshire’s first-ever online annual shareholders meeting will take place later today, at 4:45 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's firm reports nearly $50B loss as investments drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Warren Buffett’s company reported a nearly $50 billion loss on Saturday because of a huge drop in the paper value of its investments, though the company is still sitting on a huge pile of cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That’s down from last year’s profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.
Berkshire’s revenue grew 1 percent to $61.27 billion.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently
On Saturday afternoon, Buffett plans to lead an abbreviated online version of Berkshire’s annual meeting without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend. The company shifted to an online meeting and cancelled all the events surrounding the event because of the coronavirus outbreak.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posts record loss on coronavirus, but operating profit rises</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc posted a higher operating profit on May 2, but the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments and led to a record net loss.
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss totaled $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totaled $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6 percent to $5.87 billion from $5.56 billion.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire's net results that Buffett considers meaningless.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

Dubai: Malls in the United Arab Emirates' capital Abu Dhabi began reopening to a restricted number of customers this weekend as the UAE eases lockdown measures imposed more than a month ago to combat the novel coronavirus. Three Abu Dhabi malls reopened on Saturday at 30% customer capacity after adopting safety measures, including installing thermal inspection devices, the government media office tweeted and Sharjah emirate said it would reopen malls on Sunday.
Malls, dine-in restaurants and cafes in Dubai, the UAE's business and tourism hub, had earlier resumed operations with limited capacity. Shoppers must wear face masks and gloves and keep their distance. Sharjah emirate's media office said malls, salons and dine-in restaurants could resume operations on Sunday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Social media users share picture showing packed crowds, saying it was taken in Abu Dhabi mall on April 29. -- Courtesy TwitterBy Tommy HiltonDUBAI -- Abu Dhabi has disinfected 41 malls and called for the shops that have reopened to comply with regulations aimed at protecting people from coronavirus, according to reports from the official Emirates News Agency (WAM) on Saturday.The United Arab Emirates has implemented various measures aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus in the country, which has now infected over 13,000 people in the country. Although Abu Dhabi never implemented a 24-hour curfew like Dubai, it did close shops and malls, reopening some malls for the beginning of Ramadan under strict new guidelines.On Sunday, Abu Dhabi Municipality disinfected a further 41 shopping centers – 30 on Abu Dhabi Island and 11 on the mainland – in a campaign aimed at preventing further spread of the coronavirus among shoppers.The campaign was carried out by 25 engineers and inspectors, 391 workers and 55 supervisors.According to ADDED Undersecretary Rashed Abdul Karim Al Balooshi, five permits have been given to shopping centers to reopen in Abu Dhabi so far. He said that ADDED was working with the rest to disinfect them and ensure they were complying with regulations for gradual reopening.ADDED also issued a statement, carried by WAM, calling on shopping centers and malls to continue to comply with the new guidelines facilitating the reopening of shops. These include customers limiting their shops to two hours, wearing gloves and face masks at all times, and being screened by thermal scanners on entry.Social media users had previously reported scenes of packed crowds in Abdu Dhabi mall, suggesting regulations were not being followed.Al Balooshi also highlighted the importance of maintaining social distancing and avoiding congestion as central to shops reopening safely. -- Al Arabiya English

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Malls in the United Arab Emirates' capital Abu Dhabi began reopening to a restricted number of customers this weekend as the UAE eases lockdown measures imposed more than a month ago to combat the novel coronavirus.
Three Abu Dhabi malls reopened on Saturday at 30% customer capacity after adopting safety measures, including installing thermal inspection devices, the government media office tweeted and Sharjah emirate said it would reopen malls on Sunday.

Malls, dine-in restaurants and cafes in Dubai, the UAE's business and tourism hub, had earlier resumed operations with limited capacity. Shoppers must wear face masks and gloves and keep their distance.
Sharjah emirate's media office said malls, salons and dine-in restaurants could resume operations on Sunday.
Other public venues such as schools, mosques and cinemas remain closed in the UAE, which has so far reported nearly 13,600 infections and 119 deaths from the virus. It does not give a breakdown for each of its seven emirates.
The UAE had also relaxed a nationwide curfew, first announced on March 26, with the start of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan on April 24.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wine businesses and smaller restaurants are getting creative to stay afloat, according to a master sommelier — but even as alcohol purchases boom the industry needs our support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With a substantial amount of lockdown time under our belts, people around the world have found creative ways to remain social, active, and entertained. Virtual cocktail hours and dinner parties, live educational tastings, and all-around beverage discourse are filling social media airwaves.
There is no way to replace genuine human interactions: a necessity for a healthy life. However, this crisis has reminded many of us that at the center of human contact often lies a great drink.
And continuing to drink well, learn well, and do well by the wine industry in this time is not only possible, but imperative. 
Over the past decade, wine has seen a growth in consumer demand for information and validation. With the rise in popularity of the sommelier profession, access to expert advice has grown, such as on SommTV. Winemakers, retail buyers, trained sommeliers, wine journalists, and enthusiast influencers have all become more prominent, widening a previously narrow field of critics whose scores focused on retail shelves and an endless sea of Yelp-like reviews on wine apps like Vivino.
Consumers seek greater interactivity and down-to-earth advice (try Crunchy Red Fruit or SommSelect). Restaurants remain the treasure trove, attracting enthusiasts of all levels looking to quench their thirst for wine experiences at restaurants.  
Enter COVID-19. Since the novel coronavirus took hold, alcohol sales in the US have actually boomed. So much so that the first 30 days of quarantine resembled the alcohol-fuelled holiday mania of December.
But almost all that business is being funnelled through established retail supply chains; a small percentage of restaurants and bars are attempting to create in-home experiences to stay afloat. This all goes beyond the sudden deluge of social media hashtags like #quarantinecocktail — this is about supporting an industry that is at risk of faltering.
For restaurants without an already-established retail arm, creativity and agility have been the only ways to survive. Robust social media marketing supported by rich online content is the key for these businesses to tap into the current retail boom. 
Master Sommelier Laura Fiorvanti — one of 35 women in the world with this prestigious title — leads Corkbuzz group. Based in New York and North Carolina, she is taking their offerings online. With streamed versions of her in-house tastings matched with wine packs that can be purchased and shipped from the Corkbuzz cellar, she's turning what was once thought of as an in-person-only event into something that's not only more affordable, but also can be done in your own home.  
National retailer and Vermont wine bar Dedalus has also curated a wide variety of online entertainment that traverses everything from one-on-one happy hours with notable sommeliers to foundational lessons on cheese and its best pairings to fun-loving wine and DJ sets.   
The New York branch of La Compagnie de Vins Surnaturels, with managing partner Caleb Ganzer, has taken to YouTube with their in-house "Wine Boot Camp," popular with the millennial drinker given that they have over 1,000 people log on at a time, and are able to deliver featured wines to the local area thanks to temporary retail licenses being made available to restaurants. (States have banned the on-premise sale and consumption of food and alcohol, they authorized take-away and delivery retail sales for all current liquor license holders.)
For other restaurants looking for ways to thrive through the pandemic, focusing on the in-home experience is key. Whether it's a ready-to cook dinner paired with beverages, individually bottled cocktails, or working with sommeliers and winemakers to create video wine tastings, there needs to be an effort to engage with people in their homes.
Though it may be too soon to tell what combination of virtual content will allow some to surge forward, what is clear is the need to help preserve the restaurant world. Stark numbers overshadow the hope that some restaurants have. According to the Independent Restaurant Coalition and the James Beard Foundation, over 500,000 restaurants have closed temporarily, causing the loss of over 11 million jobs. Only 20% of those closed restaurants believe they'll be able to afford to come back once the new normal sets in.
While a few economic thinkers believe this will just result in a great re-shuffling, others fear that it will expedite the homogenization of American restaurants: a patchwork of individual small businesses that represents the largest private industry employer in the US. 
Large, online-only retailers have seen the largest spike in their revenue during the novel coronavirus era, jumping three-figure percentage points in just days. They represent big discounts on large-production wines and a low-risk comfort zone — purchasing that arrives at your door with zero human interaction. It's these inherent pillars that big businesses are built on, and it's working.  
If there was ever a moment to support small business, now is the time.
All restaurants were deemed as essential businesses. If they haven't shuttered, takeout food and beverage is the only way they are surviving. If someone wants to buy a bottle of wine, check out what is available at a local restaurant first, then a local wine shop.
Some restaurants have turned into grocers that support local farms and butchers. Anything bought here will be fresher and of better quality than what would be found at a supermarket. Lastly, if looking to donate, Frontline Foods and the Independent Restaurant Coalition are the most secure and effective avenues.
If you can think of a restaurant or small retail shop where you thoroughly enjoyed their hospitality, then seek out that place and patronize them. Chances are, they're scrambling to pack wine and food to-go orders so they can one day reopen their doors and welcome you home.

There is no way to replace genuine human interactions: a necessity for a healthy life. However, this crisis has reminded many of us that at the center of human contact often lies a great drink.
And continuing to drink well, learn well, and do well by the wine industry in this time is not only possible, but imperative.
Over the past decade, wine has seen a growth in consumer demand for information and validation. With the rise in popularity of the sommelier profession, access to expert advice has grown, such as on SommTV. Winemakers, retail buyers, trained sommeliers, wine journalists, and enthusiast influencers have all become more prominent, widening a previously narrow field of critics whose scores focused on retail shelves and an endless sea of Yelp-like reviews on wine apps like Vivino.
Consumers seek greater interactivity and down-to-earth advice (try Crunchy Red Fruit or SommSelect). Restaurants remain the treasure trove, attracting enthusiasts of all levels looking to quench their thirst for wine experiences at restaurants.
Enter COVID-19. Since the novel coronavirus took hold, alcohol sales in the US have actually boomed. So much so that the first 30 days of quarantine resembled the alcohol-fuelled holiday mania of December.
But almost all that business is being funnelled through established retail supply chains; a small percentage of restaurants and bars are attempting to create in-home experiences to stay afloat. This all goes beyond the sudden deluge of social media hashtags like #quarantinecocktail – this is about supporting an industry that is at risk of faltering.
For restaurants without an already-established retail arm, creativity and agility have been the only ways to survive. Robust social media marketing supported by rich online content is the key for these businesses to tap into the current retail boom.
Master Sommelier Laura Fiorvanti – one of 35 women in the world with this prestigious title – leads Corkbuzz group. Based in New York and North Carolina, she is taking their offerings online. With streamed versions of her in-house tastings matched with wine packs that can be purchased and shipped from the Corkbuzz cellar, she’s turning what was once thought of as an in-person-only event into something that’s not only more affordable, but also can be done in your own home.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As states reopen for business during the coronavirus pandemic, fast-food giants are betting Americans seeking comfort will flock to old favorites. 
Executives of chains, including McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, and Checkers and Rally's, have all said that customers' desire for normalcy and familiarity will help boost sales as restaurants recover. 
David Gibbs, the CEO of Yum Brands, said on Wednesday that the company's chains — which include Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell — stand out for their "convenience and normalcy, all of which are highly sought out in these uncertain times and beyond." 
Frances Allen, the CEO of Checkers and Rally's, told Business Insider in a webinar that she expects people are going to want to return to comfort food and comfort brands.
"There is going to be this cocooning going on, a sort of a relief that we survived, but at the same time, wanting to embrace the things that give them comfort," Allen said. "And there's nothing like burgers and fries as comfort food. From a selfish point of view, we're also excited to be able to lean back into that."
McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with investors on Thursday that familiar brands thrived in grocery stores as people stayed home. Earlier in the week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company was seeing impressive sales from large brands that customers trust. 
"I think that same dynamic is going to be at play as people start to come out looking for familiar brands," Kempczinski said Thursday. 
Fast-food companies, including McDonald's, Yum Brands, and Restaurant Brands International, that reported earnings this week said that sales are beginning to recover after plummeting in late March. Drive-thru business helped chains outperform the rest of the struggling restaurant business as customers sheltered-in-place across the US.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A lot of people find themselves working from home during the novel coronavirus. However, not every job can be done remotely, and the number further varies by country.  
A recent report by Jonathan I. Dingel and Brent Neiman from The University of Chicago analyzed the share of jobs that can be done at home in different countries. This builds off their previous research of which US cities have the highest share of occupations that can be done at home.
To find the percentage of jobs that can be done at home around the world, Dingel and Neiman mapped the Standard Occupational Classification system from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to the International Labour Organization's International Standard Classification of Occupations. The researchers found these two codes didn't always map to one unique code, so they adjusted by a weighted average for each country.
LoadingSomething is loading.
It is important to note their classification of telework jobs was based on their US classification from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The researchers wrote "the nature of an occupation likely varies across economies with different income levels."
Their results show that the lower a country's GDP per capita, the lower the share of jobs that can be done at home. The researchers note in the paper this means "developing economies and emerging markets may face an even greater challenge in continuing to work during periods of stringent social distancing."
The following chart shows the share of jobs that can be done in 12 countries with the highest GDP per capita. Of these countries, Luxembourg had the highest share of jobs that can potentially be done at home at 53.4%. That is 11.8 percentage points higher than the share of jobs that can be done at home in the US, 41.6%.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘World has changed,' Buffett says, as Berkshire sells all holdings in largest U.S. airlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting, saying “the world has changed” for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11-per-cent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 per cent of American Airlines Co., 10 per cent of Southwest Airlines Co. and 9 per cent of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near-collapse of U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and parking thousands of planes. U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95 per cent and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at precrisis levels.
Mr. Buffett said the airline industry’s outlook changed rapidly.
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,” Mr. Buffett said. “We will not fund a company ... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.”
Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18 per cent of its Delta stake and 4 per cent of its Southwest shares.
Mr. Buffett said Berkshire had invested between US$7-billion and US$8-billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7- or $8-billion and that was my mistake,” Mr. Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.”
Southwest, American and United declined comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has “tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team.” The airline added it remains “confident that the strengths that are core to Delta’s business – our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability – will endure and position Delta to succeed.”
Mr. Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up ... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Mr. Buffett added.
Mr. Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down,” Mr. Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. “Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: Berkshire Hathaway sold its entire stakes in the four largest US airlines in April, chairman Warren Buffett said on Saturday (May 2) at the company's annual meeting, saying "the world has changed" for the aviation industry.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company’s annual meeting, saying “the world has changed” for the aviation industry.

The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines Co, 10% of Southwest Airlines Co and 9% of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S.
travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
US airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights, parking thousands of planes as U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95% and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at pre-crisis levels.
Buffett said the airline industry’s outlook rapidly changed.
“We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,” Buffett said. “We will not fund a company that -- where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.” Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18% of its Delta stake and 4% of its Southwest shares.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc.
“We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,” Buffett said at the company’s annual meeting which was livestreamed. “I am the one who made the decision.” Southwest, American and United declined comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has “tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team.” The airline added it remains “confident that the strengths that are core to Delta’s business our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability will endure and position Delta to succeed.” Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
“It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” Buffett added.
Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.
“If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,” Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter.
“Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pot Job Seekers Surge as Sector Is Still Hiring: Cannabis Weekly</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unlike many industries, the cannabis sector is still hiring during the pandemic. Yet the number of open positions has dwindled as layoffs become more common and many of the jobs that do exist are temporary.
Vangst, which runs the Gigs site for temporary pot jobs and recently launched a platform for full-time positions, is filling about 600 jobs a week. That’s a slight decrease from pre-Covid 19 levels earlier this year, mostly because companies are employing fewer in-store staff as they switch to delivery or curbside pickup. Meanwhile, the number of job candidates on the platform surged by 300% between March and April, according to Karson Humiston, founder and chief executive officer of Vangst.
“We’ve seen a huge uptick in candidates, and we’re seeing a large number of candidates coming from hospitality and retail,” Humiston said in a phone interview. “When our clients do pick up hiring again, they’re going to have access to a really strong talent pool.”
Of the temporary jobs that are being filled on Vangst’s Gigs platform, about half are replacements for employees who are unable to work and the other half are for normal seasonal work related to harvests or packaging, she said.
The cannabis sector employed 243,700 people at the beginning of 2020, up 15% from the prior year and nearly double the number of jobs in 2017, according to data from cannabis information firm Leafly. However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.
Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it’s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about 5% of its total workforce. That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.
“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then Covid-19 came and exacerbated it.”
Not everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.
The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call center volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.
At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.
Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.
“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pot job seekers surge as sector is still hiring</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unlike many industries, the cannabis sector is still hiring during the pandemic. Yet the number of open positions has dwindled as layoffs become more common and many of the jobs that do exist are temporary.
Vangst, which runs the Gigs site for temporary pot jobs and recently launched a platform for full-time positions, is filling about 600 jobs a week. That’s a slight decrease from pre-COVID 19 levels earlier this year, mostly because companies are employing fewer in-store staff as they switch to delivery or curbside pickup. Meanwhile, the number of job candidates on the platform surged by 300% between March and April, according to Karson Humiston, founder and chief executive officer of Vangst.
“We’ve seen a huge uptick in candidates, and we’re seeing a large number of candidates coming from hospitality and retail,” Humiston said in a phone interview. “When our clients do pick up hiring again, they’re going to have access to a really strong talent pool.”
Of the temporary jobs that are being filled on Vangst’s Gigs platform, about half are replacements for employees who are unable to work and the other half are for normal seasonal work related to harvests or packaging, she said.
The cannabis sector employed 243,700 people at the beginning of 2020, up 15 per cent from the prior year and nearly double the number of jobs in 2017, according to data from cannabis information firm Leafly. However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.
Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it’s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about five per cent of its total workforce. That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.
“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then Covid-19 came and exacerbated it.”
Not everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.
The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call center volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.
At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.
Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.
“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. processes over $500 billion in small business loans to stem coronavirus fallout</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - The United States has made over $500 billion in loans to small businesses hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, and about $145 billion remains in the congressionally approved fund, the U.S. Small Business Administration and Treasury Department said Sunday.
The SBA has processed about 2.2 million loans worth more than $175 billion since Congress last month authorized more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, part of almost $3 trillion in spending to fight the heavy economic toll of the pandemic, which has thrown about 30 million Americans out of work.
The second round of funding was launched on Monday, allowing lenders to issue forgivable, government-guaranteed loans to small businesses shuttered by the outbreak.
The average loan size in the second round of the PPP loan processing has been $79,000, according to the statement released on Sunday.
The U.S. government’s $660 billion small business rescue program has stumbled on missing paperwork, technology failure, and the misdirection of funds to big corporations. It also faces the hurdle of forgiving those hastily arranged loans.
The latest data released by the government does not address complaints around the transparency of the program. For example, it not include a breakdown of industries that have received loans.
The pandemic, which has killed more than 66,000 people in the United States, has shuttered wide swaths of American life, closing many businesses and schools and leaving hundreds of millions largely sheltering at home. Over the past week some U.S. states have begun to allow some businesses to reopen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A mind-boggling 30 million people have filed for unemployment in 6 weeks. There are likely more without jobs., Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Job loss stemming from the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating. Economists think there are likely more without jobs that haven’t been captured by the data.
What has been reported so far paints a gloomy picture. In just six weeks, 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. Each weekly report since mid-March has been in the millions – multiple times higher than the worst week of the Great Recession, when 665,000 filed for unemployment insurance.
It took only four weeks of the coronavirus pandemic to erase all jobs created since the Great Recession. Now, there are millions more unemployed, signaling that the economic downturn from the coronavirus pandemic will be severe.
As terrible as the job loss numbers are, they are only part of the picture. There could be more Americans unemployed, according to economists, as not everyone who lost work has been able to file for benefits.

A survey conducted in mid-April by the Economic Policy Institute found that for every 10 people who successfully filed a claim for unemployment insurance, three to four tried to file but were unable to get through the system. In addition, two more didn’t try to apply for UI at all because it was too difficult.
“These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions and the need for economic relief during the coronavirus crisis,” wrote Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould of the EPI.
Accounting for the workers who were unable to apply for unemployment, or tried but didn’t get through, the EPI survey found that only about half of potential UI applicants are actually receiving benefits.

Applying those findings to the five weeks of unemployment claims from March 15 to April 18, the EPI estimates an additional 8.9 million to 13.9 million could have filed for claims if the process had been easier.
To be sure, unemployment benefits have been expanded to include more Americans than ever before. The CARES Act signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of March extended unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who would’ve been otherwise ineligible, including gig workers, freelancers, and those who are self-employed.
This is important, because these groups of non-traditional workers have expanded in the last decade. In 2019, 35% of the workforce freelanced, or 57 million people, up from 53 million in 2014, according to a survey by the Freelancers Union. The share of gig workers at US businesses has grown 15% since 2010, a study from the ADP Research Institute showed.
But, there have been problems implementing the new program established by the CARES Act, called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. At the end of April, only 21 states had started paying out benefits to self-employed and gig workers, according to the Labor Department.

And, states have been delayed in taking in claims filed for the program. Florida, for example, did not begin accepting applications under PUA until Tuesday, Politico reported.
In mid-April, the new system Pennsylvania put in place for PUA crashed due to a flood of new applications, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday. New York’s system crashed as well following a huge surge in claims, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a briefing April 21.
There are also quirks in the data calculation and collection that sometimes yield results that may not show the full picture. Next week, the April jobs report will be released, including nonfarm payroll information and an updated unemployment rate.
As of April 18, economists estimated that the unemployment rate likely spiked to about 20.2% given the surge in UI claims. The next week, however, economists forecast an unemployment rate of 16%, even though claims rose by 3.8 million.
This is not because the situation has gotten any better; it’s instead the way the data is calculated. To be included in the unemployment count, people have to say that they are actively looking for work. Under the expanded benefits from the CARES Act, people do not have to be actively looking for employment to receive a check, and because of the health crisis, many have put job searches on hold.
That technically lowers the unemployment rate, meaning what will be reported for April could be an underrepresentation of how many people are actually out of work in the US.

There could also be further issues with the survey, which depends on the people filling it out to accurately answer questions about employment. Sometimes, as with any survey, respondents don’t interpret or answer the questions as intended.
In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the unemployment rate would’ve been one percentage point higher – 5.4% instead of 4.4% – if those who marked themselves temporarily absent from work due to “other reasons” had said they were unemployed on temporary layoff.
The consequences of such widespread unemployment are dire. Current data shows about one in five American workers is without a job, and as UI claims continue to roll in in the millions, the share will increase.
If the alarming rate of layoffs continues, it’s likely that about half of American workers will be without a paycheck in May, according to ING international economist James Knightley.
It’s widely accepted that the US is in a recession, especially after first-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 4.8% annualized rate before the worst months of the coronavirus crisis.
Now, economists are weighing what type of recovery may take place. The sweeping unemployment is foreboding, given that US consumption is roughly 70% of GDP. The longer that workers go without paychecks, the longer it will take for the economy to recover.

What has been reported so far paints a gloomy picture. In just six weeks, 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. Each weekly report since mid-March has been in the millions — multiple times higher than the worst week of the Great Recession, when 665,000 filed for unemployment insurance. 
It took only four weeks of the coronavirus pandemic to erase all jobs created since the Great Recession. Now, there are millions more unemployed, signaling that the economic downturn from the coronavirus pandemic will be severe. 
As terrible as the job loss numbers are, they are only part of the picture. There could be more Americans unemployed, according to economists, as not everyone who lost work has been able to file for benefits.

A survey conducted in mid-April by the Economic Policy Institute found that for every 10 people who successfully filed a claim for unemployment insurance, three to four tried to file but were unable to get through the system. In addition, two more didn't try to apply for UI at all because it was too difficult. 
"These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions and the need for economic relief during the coronavirus crisis," wrote Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould of the EPI. 
Accounting for the workers who were unable to apply for unemployment, or tried but didn't get through, the EPI survey found that only about half of potential UI applicants are actually receiving benefits.

Applying those findings to the five weeks of unemployment claims from March 15 to April 18, the EPI estimates an additional 8.9 million to 13.9 million could have filed for claims if the process had been easier. 
To be sure, unemployment benefits have been expanded to include more Americans than ever before. The CARES Act signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of March extended unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who would've been otherwise ineligible, including gig workers, freelancers, and those who are self-employed. 
This is important, because these groups of non-traditional workers have expanded in the last decade. In 2019, 35% of the workforce freelanced, or 57 million people, up from 53 million in 2014, according to a survey by the Freelancers Union. The share of gig workers at US businesses has grown 15% since 2010, a study from the ADP Research Institute showed.
But, there have been problems implementing the new program established by the CARES Act, called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. At the end of April, only 21 states had started paying out benefits to self-employed and gig workers, according to the Labor Department.

And, states have been delayed in taking in claims filed for the program. Florida, for example, did not begin accepting applications under PUA until Tuesday, Politico reported.
In mid-April, the new system Pennsylvania put in place for PUA crashed due to a flood of new applications, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday. New York's system crashed as well following a huge surge in claims, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a briefing April 21. 
There are also quirks in the data calculation and collection that sometimes yield results that may not show the full picture. Next week, the April jobs report will be released, including nonfarm payroll information and an updated unemployment rate. 
As of April 18, economists estimated that the unemployment rate likely spiked to about 20.2% given the surge in UI claims. The next week, however, economists forecast an unemployment rate of 16%, even though claims rose by 3.8 million.
This is not because the situation has gotten any better; it's instead the way the data is calculated. To be included in the unemployment count, people have to say that they are actively looking for work. Under the expanded benefits from the CARES Act, people do not have to be actively looking for employment to receive a check, and because of the health crisis, many have put job searches on hold.   
That technically lowers the unemployment rate, meaning what will be reported for April could be an underrepresentation of how many people are actually out of work in the US.

There could also be further issues with the survey, which depends on the people filling it out to accurately answer questions about employment. Sometimes, as with any survey, respondents don't interpret or answer the questions as intended. 
In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the unemployment rate would've been one percentage point higher — 5.4% instead of 4.4% — if those who marked themselves temporarily absent from work due to "other reasons" had said they were unemployed on temporary layoff. 
The consequences of such widespread unemployment are dire. Current data shows about one in five American workers is without a job, and as UI claims continue to roll in in the millions, the share will increase.
If the alarming rate of layoffs continues, it's likely that about half of American workers will be without a paycheck in May, according to ING international economist James Knightley. 
It's widely accepted that the US is in a recession, especially after first-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 4.8% annualized rate before the worst months of the coronavirus crisis.
Now, economists are weighing what type of recovery may take place. The sweeping unemployment is foreboding, given that US consumption is roughly 70% of GDP. The longer that workers go without paychecks, the longer it will take for the economy to recover.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa is hopeful its bailout talks with the German government can be concluded soon, the airline’s board told staff in a letter seen by Reuters, adding that it is also considering alternatives such as creditor protection.
Travel bans have forced the German group to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99% drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, to lose about one million euros ($1.1 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.
“We estimate that these talks can lead to a conclusion soon,” Chief Executive Carsten Spohr and board members wrote in the letter, adding that they are also checking alternative options but do not expect to need them.
“We remain nevertheless convinced that we will not have to fall back on alternatives given the talks with Berlin.”
Lufthansa is negotiating a 10 billion euro bailout that would result in the government taking a 25.1% stake in the airline, weekly paper Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Of that, 5.5 billion euros would be in the form of non-voting capital, for which the government wants a coupon of 9%, the paper said.
A further 3.5 billion euros in loans would be provided by state bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KFW), the paper said, adding that Belgium, Austria and Switzerland might contribute towards the bailout.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lufthansa is negotiating a 9 billion euro bailout, with loans from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, citing a source close to the matter.
The slump in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a sweeping restructuring of the airline industry, with other carriers also seeking state bailouts.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper at the weekend that “taxpayers can count on us not to conduct these talks naively.”

Travel bans have forced the German group to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99 per cent drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, to lose about €1 million (RM4.7 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.

"We estimate that these talks can lead to a conclusion soon," Chief Executive Carsten Spohr and board members wrote in the letter, adding that they are also checking alternative options but do not expect to need them.
"We remain nevertheless convinced that we will not have to fall back on alternatives given the talks with Berlin."
Lufthansa is negotiating a 10 billion euro bailout that would result in the government taking a 25.1% stake in the airline, weekly paper Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Of that, 5.5 billion euros would be in the form of non-voting capital, for which the government wants a coupon of 9%, the paper said.
A further 3.5 billion euros in loans would be provided by state bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KFW), the paper said, adding that Belgium, Austria and Switzerland might contribute towards the bailout.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lufthansa is negotiating a 9 billion euro bailout, with loans from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, citing a source close to the matter.
The slump in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a sweeping restructuring of the airline industry, with other carriers also seeking state bailouts.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper at the weekend that "taxpayers can count on us not to conduct these talks naively."

    <h5 class="mb-1">South Africa to create a new national carrier to replace embattled South African Airways</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Africa is seeking to create a new thriving national airline out of the ashes of its current state-owned carrier, which is technically insolvent and on the brink of being placed in liquidation by administrators.
South African Airways (SAA) has recorded no profit since 2011 and has survived through government bailouts.
An ideal replacement for South African Airways would have both public and private owners, maintain the country’s trade connections and make a profit, the department of public enterprises said in a statement on Friday.
The embattled national carrier has been in voluntary business rescue since December last year.
The rescue practitioners late last month said the of airline cannot survive beyond month end, and the choices left are either a forced liquidation or a winding down process.
All its flights have been grounded since South Africa closed its borders and went into a five-week nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March which has made the survival of SAA, which employs 5,200 employees, even more uncertain.
The airline’s troubles were further worsened last month when the government refused to pay yet another 10 billion rand (531 million dollars) in emergency aid to the company, claiming resources had been stretched by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Stakeholders (…) have agreed on a long-term vision and strategy” with a view to “the creation of a new dynamic airline,” public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said.
The minister said it will not be the old SAA but the beginning of a new journey towards the constitution of a new restructured company which will be the new standard of South Africa. The new carrier is set to compete in the post Covid-19 world.
According to the statement, SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
The demise of SAA would mark an end of era for the 86-year old airline which had gone through years of financial troubles associated and high debt associated with poor management.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Africa is seeking to create a new thriving national airline out of the ashes of its current state-owned carrier, which is technically insolvent and on the brink of being placed in liquidation by administrators.
An ideal replacement for South African Airways would have both public and private owners, maintain the country’s trade connections and make a profit, the Department of Public Enterprises said in a statement on Friday.
The plan has the backing of SAA’s near 5,000-strong workforce, the ministry said, without mentioning the business-rescue team that has been running the airline since December.
“The old SAA is dead, there is no doubt about that,” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said by phone from Pretoria, the capital. “But what will take its place may be some or all of the old SAA and maybe some other airlines too.”
SAA’s administrators, led by Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana, were working on a recovery plan for the perennially loss-making carrier before the Covid-19 crisis forced the grounding of all aircraft.
They began the process of liquidating the airline last month after the government refused to provide a bailout package, and have asked all employees to agree to severance packages.
That offer remains on the table, a spokeswoman for the administrators said when asked to comment on the DPE’s statement. Labor groups have yet to sign up to any deal.
South Africa’s whole aviation industry has been plunged into crisis by the coronavirus pandemic.
SA Express, part of the wider SAA group, has been placed in provisional liquidation, while Comair Ltd. said on Thursday it’s selling assets and in talks with lenders to shore up a precarious financial position.
Gordhan didn’t give details on how a new SAA could be created, calling it a “complex issue.”
He praised the current version’s efforts transporting medical supplies and repatriating citizens stranded by the coronavirus, saying South Africa needs “a national flag carrier that is a source of pride.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOHANNESBURG – Government said it will be starting up a new airline to replace South African Airways (SAA).
The department of public enterprises said the new airline will not be the old SAA, but a restructured airline that South Africans can be proud of.
The move comes as the SAA business rescue practitioners moved to axe the entire workforce of SAA because the airline is broke.
It’s an end of an era for SAA, which has been in the air for 86 years.
The airline has been depending on government bailouts until it was placed under administration last year because of financial problems.
Last month, the business rescue practitioners asked for more money from government but were denied this.
Leading to them saying they have no choice but to terminate all employees of SAA and sell off its assets to pay its debt.
But it seems government and the unions have reached an agreement for a new airline with a business rescue plan that has not yet been agreed on.
The department of public enterprises said SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
Government said this new airline is set to compete in a world post-COVID-19.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Midwesterner's ultra-rare Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster that had been hidden away for more than 40 years just sold for more than $1 million. 
Seven figures is undeniably a huge sum for what looks like a dusty old sports car, but this isn't just any dusty old sports car. 
In today's classic-car market, the 300SL Roadster and its Gullwing sibling are two of the hottest collectibles money can buy. All in all, Mercedes only built 1,848 Roadsters between 1957 and 1963, and the Roadster that just sold is one of only 249 produced for the 1960 model year, according to the dealership that sold it. 
They generally go for at least $1 million at auction, and untouched "survivor" cars like this one can be even more prized than restorations. That's why it doesn't come as a surprise that after the car was listed by New York-based classic-car dealership Gullwing Motor Cars for $1.095 million, the dealership confirmed to Business Insider that it went for the full asking price.
Besides being tucked away in a barn for four decades, this particular 300SL Roadster came with low miles and a known ownership history, making it particularly valuable.

    <h5 class="mb-1">People are spending up to 3 hours waiting in drive-thru lines for McDonald's and Burger King as the chains reopen locations around the world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Burger King reopened its first UK location on Thursday after shutting down all locations in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic.
When the restaurant opened at noon, lines of cars already snaked around the block, clogging the streets of the small town of Havant in Hampshire, according to a report in the UK's Metro. A Hampshire resident told the Metro that he saw a steady stream of cars all day with a spike in traffic around dinnertime.
As fast-food chains reopen restaurants around the world, customers are flocking back to drive-thrus in hordes.  In France during late April, customers waited up to three hours to order at a McDonald's restaurant in an Île de France town after it reopened, according to the French news outlet Le Parisien. 
Twitter users posted photos and videos of long lines and clogged roads as more McDonald's restaurants reopened across the country. One Twitter user wrote in French, "People understand nothing! We are going towards our doom. Why is [McDonald's] already loosening things up? Unacceptable!"
In an earnings call attended by Business Insider, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said that the chain had seen unprecedented enthusiasm at reopenings around the world.
"You may have seen, in the last week, as we've opened up in a few of these markets we had a three-hour wait at one of our restaurants, in France, for people to get through the drive-thru," Kempczinski told investors and reporters on the call. "In Austria, we had a two-mile line of people looking to get into the drive-thru."
This week in New Zealand, police were forced to intervene when crowds got out of hand for the reopening of an Auckland location of BurgerFuel, a New Zealand-based burger chain with 88 restaurants around the world. There were also long lines at KFC and McDonald's as those chains reopened in New Zealand as well. Some stores even ran out of food after being overwhelmed by eager customers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus has put a lot of stress on state economies.
Because of stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses, many workers have been laid off or furloughed and demand in some industries has declined, such as in travel and hospitality.
The response to the coronavirus has already put a strain on state budgets as states have to find money to cover the unprecedented number of people filing for unemployment benefits after major layoffs across industries. Sales and income taxes, which make up a large percentage of a state’s tax revenue, are also affected by more people facing layoffs, staying at home, and spending less.
According to the Brookings Institution, states also have to spend more to meet the demand for Medicaid and other healthcare spending during the pandemic, and some states have enacted or have pending money transfers from their general funds to help with different needs in their state.
“When expenses go up, policymakers have to either cut spending or find revenue from raising taxes or withdrawing from their rainy day funds,” Justin Theal, research officer at Pew Charitable Trusts, told Business Insider. “That’s why having robust savings is so important….Whether a state cuts spending or increases taxes to balance their budget – that ultimately takes money out of the economy and makes it harder for a nation as a whole to recover.”
During the last recession, Theal said states had to make cuts to their budgets in areas like higher education, infrastructure, or state aid to local governments. Some states have caught up in these areas since the recession, but others have not.
“The areas of the budget that the policy makers would typically look to cut, to help balance their budgets during economic downturns, like higher education, in many states there’s not that much flexibility in that area because they hadn’t caught up on the cuts that they had made during the Great Recession,” Theal said.
States can also get aid from federal funding to help budget shortfalls and expenses.
The recent CARES Act has provided some economic relief to help states, businesses, and individuals around the country during the pandemic, but some economists believe that state and local governments will still fall short in their budgets, even with up to $150 billion relief from the CARES Act.
The latest approved federal aid will provide more assistance to small businesses but not state and local governments who need it to cover budget shortfalls. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he would rather have states go bankrupt than give them federal funding.
According to a recent blog post from the Economic Policy Institute, based on already existing predicted budget shortfalls and recent data projections, state and local governments will need another stimulus package of $500 billion.
Amid closures, layoffs, and the need for more federal aid, one positive is that many states have money reserved in rainy day funds, or budget stabilization accounts, to help with economic downfalls. Rainy day funds help states cover budget shortfalls, as most states must balance their budgets each year, so that they can reduce the need for budget cuts or tax increases, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.
Rainy day funds are so important because they could be used to help shortfalls during and after the coronavirus. According to the Associated Press, financial experts said without this financial “cushion” states would have been “in much worse shape” for handling the economic impacts from the pandemic.
“The present crisis should just be another reminder of how important it is to fund these reserve accounts when times are good so that they can help states in difficult times in the future,” Janelle Cammenga, policy analyst at Tax Foundation, told Business Insider.
Although the current situation is an example of the perfect time to dip into reserves, rainy day funds are not unlimited. If a state uses all their money in this account “then they just can’t take anymore money out of it and they have to find another way to balance their budget,” Cammenga said.
The total in rainy day funds across all 50 states was $74.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, using figures from Pew Charitable Trusts. The median number of days a state could run on rainy day funds was 27.9 days, which was 10.6 more days than the median during the Great Recession, according to Pew.
However, the current conditions of those funds vary widely from state to state.
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 34 states have built up their rainy day funds to be better equipped for economic crises than they were going into the last recession. Four states – New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Illinois – have less than a week’s worth of rainy day funds. Kansas cannot operate at all on just rainy day funds because although it opened up its rainy day fund in 2016, the state hasn’t put any money in the account yet. It was planning to start adding money in its account in fiscal year 2020, according to Tax Foundation.
It is important to note that 12 states have limits on how much can be withdrawn in a year. For instance, North Carolina can only take out 7.5% of last year’s general fund, which works out to around $1.25 billion, and Idaho can use 50% of its rainy day balance in a year, or about $373 million.
Every state has legal limitations on how they can spend rainy day funds, except for six states that can use the money for any reason.
There are also differences in who authorizes the withdrawals. The Tax Foundation wrote in a recent report on rainy day funds that it might be easier to use rainy day funds in states that require approval from executive agencies or governors than in those who need approval from legislators. This is because stay-at-home orders and other responses amid the pandemic might make it harder for legislators to come together.
The Tax Foundation compiled a full list of how much of a rainy day fund a state can use, what purposes those funds can be used for, and who authorizes it. Some state governors have already planned on using money from their reserves amid the coronavirus, such as in Washington and Maryland.
Theal said when looking at the rainy day funds, it is important to look at a state’s sources of revenue and the diversity of its economy. According to an article from Vox, 70% of state tax revenue is from sales and income taxes, which have been collapsing as businesses shutter and workers are laid off or furloughed.
Theal said because tax day was delayed this year to July 15, after most states’ budget years finish at the end of June, “you’re shifting this huge influx of personal income tax collections from the current fiscal year to the next one” which will create more stress on balancing budgets.
“The pandemic and its fiscal impacts will linger for months if not years within states,” Theal said. “And so a lot of states are convening emergency sessions to bring the legislators back and have to adjust their 2021 budgets based on the new forecast of how revenue will be impacted and the additional strains on spending and what they ultimately mean to each state’s budget.”
To get a sense of where states and their rainy day funds stand, we looked at Pew’s estimates for how many days they could pay their bills using those funds alone. The following six states represent examples of where places with different financial situations and impact from the coronavirus all sit today.
New Jersey has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, and its finances were already in dire condition before the crisis.
New Jersey used up all of its funds during the last recession and had a hard time rebuilding this reserve, according to NJ Spotlight.
According to Pew Trusts, New Jersey had 3.9 days to operate alone on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $401 million, or 1.1% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
Although the amount is small compared to other states, it is significant because 2019 was the first time in over a decade that money was added to the emergency fund account, according to Politico.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, New Jersey is one of the states “least prepared” for an economic downturn.
“While their economies are not so volatile, they have exceptionally small reserves, partly because they failed for many years to adequately fund their public employee pension systems and now are struggling to restore those systems’ long-term health,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus in the US, with over 156,000 cases in New York City alone, as of April 27, and its major sources of revenue have taken a hit as the tourism industry and businesses temporarily close.
According to data from Pew Trusts, New York had 10.3 days to operate just on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $2 billion, or 2.8% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The state already had a budget gap of $6 billion before the pandemic. One reason for this was due to Medicaid costs and demand. Six million New Yorkers are enrolled in the program and spending for this healthcare program was about $75 billion in fiscal year 2018 in New York, according to The New York Times.
In 2012, “the state froze Medicaid contributions paid by county governments” to help local New York governments, meaning the state then had to help with any Medicaid cost increases, according to Syracuse News. To help with the high costs of the healthcare program and to address the budget gap, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently proposed that counties control increases in the cost of Medicaid locally to no more than 3%, according to The New York Times article.
Theal said with unemployment numbers rising, more people will be looking to “draw upon Medicaid health benefits.” The state’s unemployment rate in March 2020 was at 4.5%, which is most likely lower than the actual rate as this is a preliminary reported figure from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that does not include the subsequent weeks of layoffs and furloughs.
In contrast to New Jersey and New York, Wyoming is better prepared for an economic emergency.
According to figures from Pew, Wyoming can operate for over a year on just their rainy day funds, with 397.7 days worth of funding.
One reason their rainy day fund account of $1.7 billion, or 109.0% of its annual spending, was so high is because the state does a good job of saving money when times are good since its main revenue source of oil and fossil fuels fluctuates, Theal said.
Although Wyoming has a robust rainy day fund, it is one of the states that requires repayment quickly and has to repay the full amount the following fiscal year, according to Tax Foundation.
“I think that when given the choice between cutting more costs and dipping into rainy day funds, I think a lot of states are going to end up relying on their rainy day funds for some relief there,” Cammenga said. “But I think it will be largely the states that don’t have those really stringent requirements.”
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody’s analytics on budget stress tests, Wyoming is “best prepared” for an economic downturn.
However, its reliance on one source of revenue could be an issue, especially during recent declines in oil prices.
According to Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming, interviewed by Sierra Magazine, he said “Wyoming has to make fundamental changes to move beyond its dependence on falling energy revenues. That could mean hiking property or other taxes or introducing an income tax.”
Nevada has a large tourism industry that has been impacted by the state lockdown and is projected to have the most job losses by this summer among states and DC.
According to Pew Trusts, Nevada can run for 27.3 days on just its rainy day fund, which is close to the median across the states in fiscal year 2019. The state had $332 million, or 7.5% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The amount in its account has gone up and down over the years, including during and after the Great Recession.
The state had $268 million in fiscal year 2007, which decreased to $72.6 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the state only had $600,000, enough for less than a day.
According to a Brookings Institution report in 2017, “Nevada policymakers, assuming that the gaming and tourism industry was less vulnerable to swings in the business cycle, did not build up reserves during the early 2000s when revenue was soaring.” As a result, Nevada’s revenue was negatively affected by the Great Recession as its main sources of revenue fell.
But dipping into its reserves, “did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money,” according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic.
According to Pew, Michigan has enough money in its rainy day account to operate for 40.2 days based on its $1.1 billion in reserves, or 11.0% of its spending. Their budget stabilization fund has been rising since fiscal year 2014.
However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.
According to a report by, Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan in 2017, Michigan is only prepared for a “mild economic downturn.”
The state holds a better financial cushion than it did during the Great Recession, when the state had no money saved in its rainy day funds after using them to cover budget shortfalls from Michigan’s “single-state recession”, a term used in Michigan after the state spent almost a decade in a recession even after other states started to recover from a national recession in 2001, according to Citizen’s Research Council of Michigan.
Pew notes that Michigan is one of the states that spends “considerable amounts” outside of their rainy day funds that also might add to aid the state in economic downfalls.
Although California has been building up its rainy day funds since it depleted its account in the Great Recession, the state is already predicting budget shortfalls.
According to Pew, California can run on rainy day funds for 52.8 days, more than double the median among states and among the top 10 states with the highest number of operating days.
Since 2014, the state requires 1.5% of its General Fund be put into its rainy day funds, according to California Legislative Analyst Office. The state had $20.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, or 14.5% of its spending, in its budget stabilization account.
But because of the nation’s response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state’s major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state’s economic shortfalls.
The state heavily relies on personal income taxes for revenue, where 67% of the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 comes from personal income taxes, according to The Sacramento Bee. A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

The recent CARES Act has provided some economic relief to help states, businesses, and individuals around the country during the pandemic, but some economists believe that state and local governments will still fall short in their budgets, even with up to $150 billion relief from the CARES Act.
The latest approved federal aid will provide more assistance to small businesses but not state and local governments who need it to cover budget shortfalls. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently said he would rather have states go bankrupt than give them federal funding.
According to a recent blog post from the Economic Policy Institute, based on already existing predicted budget shortfalls and recent data projections, state and local governments will need another stimulus package of $500 billion.
Amid closures, layoffs, and the need for more federal aid, one positive is that many states have money reserved in rainy day funds, or budget stabilization accounts, to help with economic downfalls. Rainy day funds help states cover budget shortfalls, as most states must balance their budgets each year, so that they can reduce the need for budget cuts or tax increases, according to Pew Charitable Trusts. 
Rainy day funds are so important because they could be used to help shortfalls during and after the coronavirus. According to the Associated Press, financial experts said without this financial "cushion" states would have been "in much worse shape" for handling the economic impacts from the pandemic. 
"The present crisis should just be another reminder of how important it is to fund these reserve accounts when times are good so that they can help states in difficult times in the future," Janelle Cammenga, policy analyst at Tax Foundation, told Business Insider.
Although the current situation is an example of the perfect time to dip into reserves, rainy day funds are not unlimited. If a state uses all their money in this account "then they just can't take anymore money out of it and they have to find another way to balance their budget," Cammenga said. 
The total in rainy day funds across all 50 states was $74.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, using figures from Pew Charitable Trusts. The median number of days a state could run on rainy day funds was 27.9 days, which was 10.6 more days than the median during the Great Recession, according to Pew.
However, the current conditions of those funds vary widely from state to state. 
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 34 states have built up their rainy day funds to be better equipped for economic crises than they were going into the last recession. Four states — New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Illinois — have less than a week's worth of rainy day funds. Kansas cannot operate at all on just rainy day funds because although it opened up its rainy day fund in 2016, the state hasn't put any money in the account yet. It was planning to start adding money in its account in fiscal year 2020, according to Tax Foundation.
It is important to note that 12 states have limits on how much can be withdrawn in a year. For instance, North Carolina can only take out 7.5% of last year's general fund, which works out to around $1.25 billion, and Idaho can use 50% of its rainy day balance in a year, or about $373 million.
Every state has legal limitations on how they can spend rainy day funds, except for six states that can use the money for any reason.
There are also differences in who authorizes the withdrawals. The Tax Foundation wrote in a recent report on rainy day funds that it might be easier to use rainy day funds in states that require approval from executive agencies or governors than in those who need approval from legislators. This is because stay-at-home orders and other responses amid the pandemic might make it harder for legislators to come together.
The Tax Foundation compiled a full list of how much of a rainy day fund a state can use, what purposes those funds can be used for, and who authorizes it. Some state governors have already planned on using money from their reserves amid the coronavirus, such as in Washington and Maryland.
Theal said when looking at the rainy day funds, it is important to look at a state's sources of revenue and the diversity of its economy. According to an article from Vox, 70% of state tax revenue is from sales and income taxes, which have been collapsing as businesses shutter and workers are laid off or furloughed. 
Theal said because tax day was delayed this year to July 15, after most states' budget years finish at the end of June, "you're shifting this huge influx of personal income tax collections from the current fiscal year to the next one" which will create more stress on balancing budgets.
"The pandemic and its fiscal impacts will linger for months if not years within states," Theal said. "And so a lot of states are convening emergency sessions to bring the legislators back and have to adjust their 2021 budgets based on the new forecast of how revenue will be impacted and the additional strains on spending and what they ultimately mean to each state's budget."
To get a sense of where states and their rainy day funds stand, we looked at Pew's estimates for how many days they could pay their bills using those funds alone. The following six states represent examples of where places with different financial situations and impact from the coronavirus all sit today.
New Jersey has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, and its finances were already in dire condition before the crisis.
New Jersey used up all of its funds during the last recession and had a hard time rebuilding this reserve, according to NJ Spotlight.
According to Pew Trusts, New Jersey had 3.9 days to operate alone on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $401 million, or 1.1% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
Although the amount is small compared to other states, it is significant because 2019 was the first time in over a decade that money was added to the emergency fund account, according to Politico.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody's analytics on budget stress tests, New Jersey is one of the states "least prepared" for an economic downturn.
"While their economies are not so volatile, they have exceptionally small reserves, partly because they failed for many years to adequately fund their public employee pension systems and now are struggling to restore those systems' long-term health," the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus in the US, with over 156,000 cases in New York City alone, as of April 27, and its major sources of revenue have taken a hit as the tourism industry and businesses temporarily close.
According to data from Pew Trusts, New York had 10.3 days to operate just on its rainy day funds in fiscal year 2019. The state had $2 billion, or 2.8% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The state already had a budget gap of $6 billion before the pandemic. One reason for this was due to Medicaid costs and demand. Six million New Yorkers are enrolled in the program and spending for this healthcare program was about $75 billion in fiscal year 2018 in New York, according to The New York Times.
In 2012, "the state froze Medicaid contributions paid by county governments" to help local New York governments, meaning the state then had to help with any Medicaid cost increases, according to Syracuse News. To help with the high costs of the healthcare program and to address the budget gap, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently proposed that counties control increases in the cost of Medicaid locally to no more than 3%, according to The New York Times article.
Theal said with unemployment numbers rising, more people will be looking to "draw upon Medicaid health benefits." The state's unemployment rate in March 2020 was at 4.5%, which is most likely lower than the actual rate as this is a preliminary reported figure from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that does not include the subsequent weeks of layoffs and furloughs.
In contrast to New Jersey and New York, Wyoming is better prepared for an economic emergency.
According to figures from Pew, Wyoming can operate for over a year on just their rainy day funds, with 397.7 days worth of funding.
One reason their rainy day fund account of $1.7 billion, or 109.0% of its annual spending, was so high is because the state does a good job of saving money when times are good since its main revenue source of oil and fossil fuels fluctuates, Theal said.
Although Wyoming has a robust rainy day fund, it is one of the states that requires repayment quickly and has to repay the full amount the following fiscal year, according to Tax Foundation.
"I think that when given the choice between cutting more costs and dipping into rainy day funds, I think a lot of states are going to end up relying on their rainy day funds for some relief there," Cammenga said. "But I think it will be largely the states that don't have those really stringent requirements." 
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities using Moody's analytics on budget stress tests, Wyoming is "best prepared" for an economic downturn.
However, its reliance on one source of revenue could be an issue, especially during recent declines in oil prices. 
According to Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming, interviewed by Sierra Magazine, he said "Wyoming has to make fundamental changes to move beyond its dependence on falling energy revenues. That could mean hiking property or other taxes or introducing an income tax."
Nevada has a large tourism industry that has been impacted by the state lockdown and is projected to have the most job losses by this summer among states and DC.
According to Pew Trusts, Nevada can run for 27.3 days on just its rainy day fund, which is close to the median across the states in fiscal year 2019. The state had $332 million, or 7.5% of its spending, in rainy day funds.
The amount in its account has gone up and down over the years, including during and after the Great Recession.
The state had $268 million in fiscal year 2007, which decreased to $72.6 million in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the state only had $600,000, enough for less than a day.
According to a Brookings Institution report in 2017, "Nevada policymakers, assuming that the gaming and tourism industry was less vulnerable to swings in the business cycle, did not build up reserves during the early 2000s when revenue was soaring." As a result, Nevada's revenue was negatively affected by the Great Recession as its main sources of revenue fell.
But dipping into its reserves, "did not offset the deep spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing, and one-time federal stimulus money," according to Brookings.
Although Michigan has enough in its rainy day funds to run for over a month, it might not be prepared for serve economic impacts from the pandemic. 
According to Pew, Michigan has enough money in its rainy day account to operate for 40.2 days based on its $1.1 billion in reserves, or 11.0% of its spending. Their budget stabilization fund has been rising since fiscal year 2014.
However, these reserves might not be enough to cover expenses and shortfalls during and after the coronavirus.
According to a report by, Citizen's Research Council of Michigan in 2017, Michigan is only prepared for a "mild economic downturn."
The state holds a better financial cushion than it did during the Great Recession, when the state had no money saved in its rainy day funds after using them to cover budget shortfalls from Michigan's "single-state recession", a term used in Michigan after the state spent almost a decade in a recession even after other states started to recover from a national recession in 2001, according to Citizen's Research Council of Michigan.
Pew notes that Michigan is one of the states that spends "considerable amounts" outside of their rainy day funds that also might add to aid the state in economic downfalls.
Although California has been building up its rainy day funds since it depleted its account in the Great Recession, the state is already predicting budget shortfalls.
According to Pew, California can run on rainy day funds for 52.8 days, more than double the median among states and among the top 10 states with the highest number of operating days.
Since 2014, the state requires 1.5% of its General Fund be put into its rainy day funds, according to California Legislative Analyst Office. The state had $20.6 billion in fiscal year 2019, or 14.5% of its spending, in its budget stabilization account.
But because of the nation's response to the pandemic, such as businesses temporarily closing and layoffs, that can affect the state's major sources of revenue. Experts covered by the LA Times believe their rainy day funds could be depleted to cover the state's economic shortfalls.
The state heavily relies on personal income taxes for revenue, where 67% of the proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 comes from personal income taxes, according to The Sacramento Bee. A good portion of income taxes comes from upper-income Californians, which The Sacramento Bee points out their source of income can vary. This makes it an unreliable source of revenue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">We surveyed the ‘rainy day’ funds of 6 states to see how prepared they were for a major emergency. The results paint a grim picture for the country’s economic recovery.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The novel coronavirus has put a lot of stress on state economies.
Because of stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses, many workers have been laid off or furloughed and demand in some industries has declined, such as in travel and hospitality.
The response to the coronavirus has already put a strain on state budgets as states have to find money to cover the unprecedented number of people filing for unemployment benefits after major layoffs across industries. Sales and income taxes, which make up a large percentage of a state’s tax revenue, are also affected by more people facing layoffs, staying at home, and spending less.
According to the Brookings Institution, states also have to spend more to meet the demand for Medicaid and other healthcare spending during the pandemic, and some states have enacted or have pending money transfers from their general funds to help with different needs in their state.
“When expenses go up, policymakers have to either cut spending or find revenue from raising taxes or withdrawing from their rainy day funds,” Justin Theal, research officer at Pew Charitable Trusts, told Business Insider. “That’s why having robust savings is so important….Whether a state cuts spending or increases taxes to balance their budget – that ultimately takes money out of the economy and makes it harder for a nation as a whole to recover.”
During the last recession, Theal said states had to make cuts to their budgets in areas like higher education, infrastructure, or state aid to local governments. Some states have caught up in these areas since the recession, but others have not.
“The areas of the budget that the policy makers would typically look to cut, to help balance their budgets during economic downturns, like higher education, in many states there’s not that much flexibility in that area because they hadn’t caught up on the cuts that they had made during the Great Recession,” Theal said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you want a business school education without having to commit to years of learning and pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, a "mini MBA" could be a great alternative for you.
Each mini MBA is different, but they're generally certificate-based programs for business professionals looking to network and bolster their corporate knowledge. You can take them in a matter of weeks and online. And you can get them from top schools, like Rutgers or Bentley, from anywhere between $275 to $6,000, compared to up to $120,000 for full tuition for a two-year MBA program.
Here are seven programs, including Clemson and Pepperdine, that offer them, and how you can use them to advance your career.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bad loans key to Westpac dividend as payout suspended</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac chief executive Peter King says the severity of the COVID-19 economic shock and how much damage it inflicts on the bank's loan book will be the key factors influencing dividend policy, after a historic suspension of payments.
The lending giant on Monday said cash profit plunged 70 per cent to $993 million because of heavy charges for bad debts and last year's money laundering scandal, and it would not pay a dividend in June due to the uncertain outlook.
With the bank setting aside $1.6 billion to cover for bad loans for the crisis, Mr King maintained its "base case" was for a V-shaped recovery that would still result in unemployment of 9 per cent this quarter.
While some analysts said they did not expect a dividend this half, Mr King said the bank would be closely watching how tens of thousands of customers given loan deferrals fared in the months ahead.
"We will monitor the situation, we will look at our book and the performance of the credit book is really the key piece to look at,” he said.
“If the economy comes back on a quicker path, then maybe a decision could be earlier, if it comes back on a slower path then the last time, we would look at it as part of the full-year results.”
In an attempt to minimise the economic carnage caused by the pandemic, banks have deployed loan repayment deferrals and emergency loans to hundreds of thousands of customers in recent months. Westpac said 105,000 mortgage accounts worth $39 billion had been put on hold, alongside 31,000 business loans with a value of $8.2 billion.
Mr King, who was appointed CEO last month after acting in the role since last year, also flagged potential asset sales as he seeks to narrow the lender's focus to banking.
The bank has had re-hired Westpac executive Jason Yetton to oversee a review of businesses including wealth platforms, superannuation and retirement products, investments, general and life insurance, and auto loans. The businesses would be put into a new division and could be sold off, the bank said.
Westpac's results were dominated by the impact of COVID-19, which has lenders bracing for a wave of bad loans, which directly eat into profits.
The bank's closely watched common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, an important gauge of strength, was 10.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets, above the level of 10.5 per cent targeted by regulators.
But, as previously disclosed by the bank, profits in the half were hit by a $1.6 billion charge for COVID-19 and a $900 million provision for the penalty over the AUSTRAC scandal.
As the provisions for bad debts were announced in the weeks leading up to the result, some analysts said the underlying results from Westpac were not as weak as feared. Its stock price closed 2.8 per cent higher, at $15.77.
The dividend suspension is the latest move by an Australian bank to defer its dividend decision, following ANZ Bank last week and Bank of Queensland last month.
Plato Asset Management managing director Don Hamson said he did not expect Westpac or ANZ to pay dividends in the current half. “That’s going to be a six month hole in investors’ incomes,” he said.
Macquarie analyst Victor German also forecast there would most likely not be a dividend paid this half. "Like ANZ, WBC’s CET1 position of 10.8 per cent is at the lower end of peers, and we expect WBC will not pay the dividend unless conditions improve materially," Mr German said.
Mr King painted a bleak picture on the outlook, saying the economy would contract sharply this quarter and not bounce back until late in the December quarter. The bank's base case assumed a 15 per cent decline in house prices and a further 5 per cent next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Westpac has deferred its dividend after revealing a massive 70% slump in profit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac Banking Corporation has revealed a massive 70 per cent slump in first half cash profit of $993 million and elected to defer the dividend until greater clarity is known about the economic impact of COVID-19 on bad debts.
Westpac chief executive Peter King sheeted the hit to profits back to the likely cost of settling the AUSTRAC matter, its ongoing response to recommendations from the Hayne royal commission and growing projections of the cost of the virus crisis.
“This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years. It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision,” Mr King said in a statement.
The bank stressed that its capital position remained sound following its decision to raise $2.8 billion in December last year but said it felt it was prudent not to make a distribution at this time.
“The board has deferred the decision on determining an interim dividend and no dividend will be paid in June 2020. This was a difficult decision given many retail shareholders rely on
The bank said it had been in constant dialogue with the regulator over stress testing scenarios and it had not expressed any concern about its position. The bank said it would revisit the dividend decision at some point over the year.
“Westpac remains well provisioned and capitalised. Nevertheless, the board recognises the uncertain economic and operating conditions and how these may develop over the next six months.
Westpac has also flagged the sale of several wealth assets including its superannuation and insurance operations and wealth platforms. It has created a new “specialist businesses division”, which will be led by Jason Yetton, a former head of retail banking at Westpac who returns from Commonwealth Bank.
Mr Yetton will lead a strategic review of Westpac’s sub-scale operations across superannuation, wealth platforms, investments, insurance, auto finance and the Pacific.
Mr King said “over the coming months we will conduct a detailed strategic review on the best options for these businesses.
This will include considering whether they would ultimately be more successful under different ownership.
Expectations of shareholders had been softened up in recent weeks with the bank announcing $1.4 billion in provisions including setting aside $900 million for the AUSTRAC matter and a further $2.2 billion for bad and doubtful debts with $1.6 billion set aside for COVID-19.
Before the resumption of trade on Monday morning, Westpac shares were down 49 per cent to $15.34 from their 52 week high of $30.05 reached in September last year.
Shares in the bank have been sold off heavily in the wake of the AUSTRAC money laundering scandal that saw CEO Brian Hartzer step down and brought forward the retirement of chairman Lindsay Maxsted.
The decision to pay no dividend follows a directive from the prudential regulator for banks to materially reduce or defer a decision on making distributions until the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is better known.
Last week NAB slashed its dividend to 30¢ from 83¢ while ANZ said it would defer the decision entirely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Westpac profit slumps 70pc, defers dividend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Westpac Banking Corp has revealed a massive 70 per cent slump in first half cash profit to $993 million and elected to defer the dividend until there's greater clarity on the impact that COVID-19 will have on bad debts.
The bank has also chosen to bring forward a decision about the bank's involvement in the beleaguered wealth management sector by putting its remaining assets in a separate division as it considers exiting the sector entirely. Westpac shares fell a modest 1 per cent at the open before recovering by midday to trade 1.6 per cent higher.
Westpac chief executive Peter King sheeted the hit to profits back to the likely cost of settling the AUSTRAC matter, its ongoing response to recommendations from the Hayne royal commission and growing projections of the cost of the virus crisis.
“This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years," Mr King said in a statement. "It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision."
The sharp downturn in the business was reflected in the banks return on equity down to 2.9 per cent from 10.4 per cent in the first half of 2019. The bank said its capital position remained sound following its decision to raise $2.8 billion in December 2019 but said it felt it was prudent not to make a distribution in June after paying investors 93c a share this time last year.
"This was a difficult decision given many retail shareholders rely on Westpac dividends," the bank said. The board had "accepted APRA’s consistent guidance on dividends and being prudent at this point in time".
UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said the result was better than expected with much of the bad news including the multibillion-dollar provisioning already known and applauded the bank for flagging its intention to exit remaining wealth assets.
"Establishment of the specialist business division (wealth management, life, auto finance, general insurance and Pacific) with strategic review to assess "appropriate ownership" is a positive, in our view, given these businesses utilised $4 billion of regulatory capital," Mr Mott said in a flash note for clients.
Good news however was in short supply in the result in which the bank’s four main divisions revealed falls in cash earnings of between 18 per cent and 63 per cent.
Consumer banking fell 18 per cent compared with the previous half on the impact of the bushfires, severe weather events and higher impairment charges.
Cash earnings at the business bank fell 46 per cent as it took an early hit from the likely fallout of the COVID-19 virus crisis.
Earnings at the institutional bank were off a whopping 63 per cent on the previous corresponding half for similar reasons while earnings in New Zealand were off 39 per cent.
The net interest margin at the bank – a key metric which shows the gap between its cost of funds and the price it charges its customers – was a rare bright spot up 1 basis point to 2.13 per cent however CFO Gary Thursby cautioned investors from seeing much improvement in the margin over the next half.
The bank said it had been in constant dialogue with the regulator over stress testing scenarios and it had not expressed any concern about its position. It will revisit the dividend decision at some point over the year; this time last year, Westpac paid an interim dividend of 94 cents per share before cutting it to 80c a share in the second half.
The decision to defer the dividend was an historic one; even during the depths of the recession in 1992, when Westpac almost collapsed, it still paid a small dividend to shareholders.
Westpac's common equity tier 1 (CET1) remained at 10.8 per cent following last year's capital raising.
"Westpac remains well provisioned and capitalised. Nevertheless, the board recognises the uncertain economic and operating conditions and how these may develop over the next six months."
Westpac has also flagged the sale of its remaining wealth assets including its superannuation and insurance operations and wealth platforms. It has created a new “specialist businesses division”, which will be led by Jason Yetton, a former head of retail banking at Westpac who returns from Commonwealth Bank after CBA abandoned plans for a wealth spin-off.
Mr Yetton will lead a strategic review of Westpac’s sub-scale operations across superannuation, wealth platforms, investments, insurance, auto finance and the Pacific. Mr King said “over the coming months we will conduct a detailed strategic review on the best options for these businesses".
"This will include considering whether they would ultimately be more successful under different ownership," he added.
Westpac has already made an effort to reduce its exposure to businesses adjacent to its core banking operations after selling the majority of its financial advice network to Viridian in March 2019 for a song.
The bank pointed to “early signs of stress” in its lending books. While loans put into deferral are not treated as being impaired under after an APRA directive, Westpac said the number of mortgages more than 90 days overdue were up 5 basis points over the half while those more than 30 days overdue were 23 basis points higher. Other consumer 90+ day delinquencies were also higher, up 25 basis points over the half.
"The full impact of COVID-19 is expected to emerge in future periods," the bank said.
Shareholders had been softened up in recent weeks with the bank announcing $1.4 billion in provisions including setting aside $900 million for the AUSTRAC matter and a further $2.2 billion for bad and doubtful debts with $1.6 billion set aside for COVID-19. Overall provisions for expected credit losses now sit at $5.8 billion.
Like ANZ and National Australia Bank last week, Westpac flagged considerable interest among its customers for deferring loans due to COVID-19. It said 105,000 Australian mortgage accounts had been put on hold, with a loan value of $39 billion, and in addition loan repayments had been deferred across 31,000 Australian business loans with a value of $8.2 billion.
On the macro-economy, it said as a base case, it expects the unemployment rate to peak at 9 per cent in June and drop to around 7 per cent by the end of the year.
House prices could fall by 15 per cent in 2020 and a further 5 per cent in 2021.
The bank is expecting a 5 per cent contraction in GDP in 2020 and credit growth in 2020 to be just 0.3 per cent. But in 2021, GDP is forecast to rise by 4 per cent.
Shares in the bank were been sold off heavily in the wake of the AUSTRAC money laundering scandal that saw CEO Brian Hartzer step down and brought forward the retirement of chairman Lindsay Maxsted.
The decision to pay no dividend follows a directive from the prudential regulator for banks to materially reduce or defer a decision on making distributions until the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is better known.
Last week NAB slashed its dividend to 30¢ from 83¢ while ANZ said it would defer the decision entirely and would make a decision possibly as late as August.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rolls-Royce has this to say on its workforce after 'job losses' report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rolls-Royce has released a statement about its workforce following claims that it is set to make thousands of job cuts.
According to the Financial Times, the engineering giant is set to make up to 8,000 job cuts after aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing slashed production to cope with a fall in global air travel, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Rolls-Royce employs a global workforce in its civil aerospace engineering business, which is headquartered in Sinfin.
The major manufacturer has now released a statement saying it will provide "further details" on the impact of coronavirus on the size of its workforce before the end of this month.
A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said: "The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reduce our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times. But we will need to take further action.
"We have to do this right, which means we are working closely with our employee and trade union representatives and then we will consult with everyone affected.
"We have promised to give our people further details of the impact of the current situation on the size of our workforce before the end of this month."
Derbyshire Live's sister site Business Live previously reported how Rolls-Royce was introducing a raft of cost-cutting measures to help the firm save £750 million due to the coronavirus crisis.
In a trading update released to the markets on April 6, the company said that it would be reducing the salary of its global workforce by at least 10%.
The salary of its senior managers and executive team were to take a cut of 20% for the rest of 2020, comprising a 10% reduction and a 10% referral in pay.
Rolls-Royce said it was also reducing discretionary costs, such as non-critical capital expenditure projects, consulting, professional fees and sub-contractor costs, ceasing all non-essential travel and postponing external recruitment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rolls-Royce considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce - source</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L) is considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce, a source close to the company told Reuters, as customers cut production and airlines park planes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The size of layoffs has been mentioned internally by senior management, but is by no means finalised and there is a lot of negotiation still to be done, the source added.
The company’s engines power Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co’s (BA.N) widebody jets and Rolls-Royce is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly.
The Financial Times earlier reported Rolls-Royce was preparing to lay off up to 8,000 of its 52,000-strong workforce.
An announcement on the final figure is not expected before the end of May, when the company will update employees, according to the FT report. (on.ft.com/2VSaQfD)
Last month, Rolls-Royce scrapped its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances to cope with the virus outbreak.
The company’s Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in April Rolls-Royce would be looking at cutting cash expenditure, including salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year.
Discussions with unions about the job cuts have just begun, the newspaper reported, citing sources.
The scale of job cuts is still likely to be larger than after 9/11 when the group cut 5,000 jobs and the vast majority of it is expected to hit the civil aerospace unit, the FT said.
While job losses are also expected in the unit’s operations in Singapore and Germany, Britain’s civil aerospace workforce is expected to bear the majority of the cuts, according to the report.
Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, did not comment in response to a query from Reuters.

Berkshire's first-quarter net loss totalled US$49.75 billion, or US$30,653 per Class A share, reflecting US$54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totalled US$21.66 billion, or US$13,209 per share.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19 impact: Buffett’s Berkshire posts nearly $50b loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday posted a record net loss of nearly $50 billion as the coronavirus pandemic pummeled its common stock investments, but operating profit rose even as COVID-19 hurt its businesses.
Berkshire’s first-quarter net loss totaled $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses from investments, mainly common stocks. A year earlier, net earnings totaled $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. This causes huge swings in Berkshire’s net results that Buffett considers meaningless.
Nonetheless, Berkshire has loaded up on stocks in part because of Buffett’s inability to find large companies to buy outright, a drought that has lasted more than four years and left Berkshire with about $137.3 billion of cash.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 slid 20% in the first quarter but there were steeper falls in several large Berkshire holdings including American Express, Bank of America , Wells Fargo and four airlines -- American , Delta, Southwest and United.
Berkshire’s operating businesses, like much of corporate America, were not unscathed by COVID-19, which hurt volumes at the BNSF railroad and forced retail businesses such as See’s Candies to temporarily close stores.
Most of Berkshire’s businesses have been hurt by the pandemic, with effects so far ranging from “relatively minor to severe,” and revenues of businesses deemed “essential” have slowed “considerably” in April, the company said.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that a few small Berkshire businesses might close altogether.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBCUniversal weighs layoffs at media, entertainment units: WSJ</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) owned NBCUniversal is evaluating a significant reduction of staff across its portfolio of media and entertainment properties as part of a cost-cutting effort, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Discussions began this week regarding cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, according to the report.
Along with its industry peers, NBCUniversal is taking a financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak which has shuttered movie theaters and theme parks. The company has temporarily closed its theme parks and suspended its sports productions and most of its film and TV production.
Although all divisions are being looked at, some areas likely to be under a microscope at NBCUniversal are the theme-parks division and Universal Pictures, the WSJ reported.
NBCUniversal declined to comment on the report.
The company, which reported its results earlier this week, said its quarterly revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 22.5% this quarter from a year earlier, while revenue at theme parks fell 31.9%.
Last month, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said it will start furloughs of non-essential U.S. employees across the company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil's Recovery Could Take Decades, Not Years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Who knows what the new normal for oil demand will be once Covid-19 is firmly in the rear view mirror? Not me, that's for sure. But it is likely to be lower than it was in 2019, and it could be that way for many years. That’s going to create overcapacity throughout the oil supply chain and weigh on prices.
While signs are emerging that we might have passed the worst of this historic oil demand rout, they’re very tentative. No one is predicting a swift recovery to where we were before the pandemic struck. Some, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s chief executive officer, Ben van Beurden, suggest that oil demand may never recover fully.
Citigroup analysts don’t see jet fuel consumption back at last year’s level until well into 2022, and they’re at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Boeing’s CEO suggests passenger traffic might not get back to 2019 levels for three years, and even when the flying public does return, airlines will use their newest and most efficient planes to carry them, as my colleagues Liam Denning and Brooke Sutherland note here.
So let’s make a guess about the loss in future demand, and let’s make a fairly small one. Let’s assume it’s about 5 million barrels a day. That doesn’t sound like too much; it’s about 5% of last year’s global oil demand. The drop in worldwide oil consumption in April has been put as high as 35 million barrels a day, and forecasts estimate 2020 oil use will be about 10 million barrels a day (or 10%) lower than in 2019.
Sure, many of us will return to our pre-Covid-19 ways of life just as quickly as we can, but others will gladly give up the daily commute in favor of working from home more often — and employers may be happy to accommodate their wishes. After months of successful teleconferencing, those business trips that helped keep planes full of high-paying travelers may also come under more scrutiny. These changes may push up electricity use while they dampen fuel demand, but that will do little to help the oil industry, which is increasingly struggling to hold onto its fragments of the power-generation sector.
Of course, we could collectively shrug off this latest crisis, just as we did the financial crash of 2008-09, which was consigned to history with barely a backward glance. But the global pandemic feels very different from the financial crisis. It hits at our physical well-being as well as our financial health, and it has forced us all, to one degree or another, to adopt new ways of living and working, whether we like them or not. 
The industry can survive a 5% drop in long-term demand, but it will find it much harder to thrive.
A loss like that will cause structural overcapacity, right through the oil supply chain. There will be too many wells to get oil out of the ground, too many ships to move it, too many refineries to process it.
Even before the pandemic, we were looking at a world where oil demand growth was increasingly concentrated in plastics, rather than fuels. That was already darkening the outlook for refiners in Europe and North America, which were also facing growing competition from newer plants in the Middle East and Asia that were more efficient and had beneficial long-term oil supply deals. A prolonged drop in demand will only make that competition stiffer, as more plants seek markets for their excess products.
The upstream part of the business — the bit that’s concerned with finding the crude and getting it out of the ground — may face fewer problems. Oil fields naturally go into decline once they’re brought into operation, requiring producers to create new capacity elsewhere. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the U.S. shale patch.
But the second U.S. shale boom was driven by, among other things, several years of robust growth in global oil demand. This led to most of the world’s oil producers, including almost all of the OPEC countries, pumping as hard as they could, and helped to keep oil prices at around $50 a barrel.
But those OPEC producers are now cutting production by more than 20%, and non-OPEC countries are seeing their output fall by similar percentages. True, some of the wells that get shut will never be reopened, but most will sit waiting for their owners to see an opportunity to get them back to work. That overhang of spare production capacity will put an effective cap on oil prices, just as it did throughout the 1990s.
No amount of Saudi-led supply management, or U.S. presidential bullying of foreign oil producers, will be able to remove that spare capacity. And once the current crisis is past, Riyadh may be less willing to play the role of swing producer, restraining its output while everybody else reopens the taps.
Every time oil prices rise, producers will rush to use their idled capacity, undermining the recovery. After the oil-price slump of the mid-1980s, it took two decades for prices to return to their previous levels — longer if you build in the effects of inflation. This time the wait could be even more protracted.

Of course, we could collectively shrug off this latest crisis, just as we did the financial crash of 2008-09, which was consigned to history with barely a backward glance. But the global pandemic feels very different from the financial crisis. It hits at our physical well-being as well as our financial health, and it has forced us all, to one degree or another, to adopt new ways of living and working, whether we like them or not. 
The industry can survive a 5% drop in long-term demand, but it will find it much harder to thrive.
A loss like that will cause structural overcapacity, right through the oil supply chain. There will be too many wells to get oil out of the ground, too many ships to move it, too many refineries to process it.
Even before the pandemic, we were looking at a world where oil demand growth was increasingly concentrated in plastics, rather than fuels. That was already darkening the outlook for refiners in Europe and North America, which were also facing growing competition from newer plants in the Middle East and Asia that were more efficient and had beneficial long-term oil supply deals. A prolonged drop in demand will only make that competition stiffer, as more plants seek markets for their excess products.
The upstream part of the business — the bit that’s concerned with finding the crude and getting it out of the ground — may face fewer problems. Oil fields naturally go into decline once they’re brought into operation, requiring producers to create new capacity elsewhere. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the U.S. shale patch.
But the second U.S. shale boom was driven by, among other things, several years of robust growth in global oil demand. This led to most of the world’s oil producers, including almost all of the OPEC countries, pumping as hard as they could, and helped to keep oil prices at around $50 a barrel.
But those OPEC producers are now cutting production by more than 20%, and non-OPEC countries are seeing their output fall by similar percentages. True, some of the wells that get shut will never be reopened, but most will sit waiting for their owners to see an opportunity to get them back to work. That overhang of spare production capacity will put an effective cap on oil prices, just as it did throughout the 1990s.
No amount of Saudi-led supply management, or U.S. presidential bullying of foreign oil producers, will be able to remove that spare capacity. And once the current crisis is past, Riyadh may be less willing to play the role of swing producer, restraining its output while everybody else reopens the taps.
Every time oil prices rise, producers will rush to use their idled capacity, undermining the recovery. After the oil-price slump of the mid-1980s, it took two decades for prices to return to their previous levels — longer if you build in the effects of inflation. This time the wait could be even more protracted.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin briefly surged past $9,000 this week to its highest since February, mirroring the stock market rally in the middle of the week as Fed chair Jerome Powell said he’s willing to take more action to prop up the economy. With less than two weeks until bitcoin’s halving, investors were uncertain about which direction the price would go as the event approached. “At this stage, it appears that the bulls have prevailed,” digital asset researcher Denis Vinokourov says. If bitcoin responds like it did after its previous two halvings, this could usher in a new class of crypto millionaires.
Other major cryptocurrencies recorded impressive gains Wednesday as well, and Stellar was up more than 75% since the beginning of 2020 at its peak. The market receded slightly as investors took profits toward the end of the week.
With precarious food supply chains becoming front-page news during the coronavirus pandemic, the World Economic Forumreleased a report more than 18 months in the making this week detailing how blockchain can help. The 244-page study lays out a toolkit of how processing plants, distribution centers, retailers, banks and regulators can all work together more efficiently to streamline future supply chains.
An eye-opening report published Monday in the Financial Analysts Journal argued that arbitrage opportunities offered $384 million in risk-free profits to bitcoin investors in the first quarter of 2018. With many unregulated exchanges routinely showing significant price differentials, savvy investors could buy low and immediately sell higher. Arbitrage opportunities like this typically shrink as professional traders enter markets, but this paper found the opposite to be true for bitcoin—market inefficiencies have increased over time.
Social distancing and stay-at-home orders have made in-person voting impractical, so Utah’s Republican convention picked its nominees for the state’s June primary using Voatz, a blockchain-based voting service that uses facial recognition to verify voters’ identities. Voatz was criticized in an MIT study in February for being vulnerable to hackers, but it seemed to go off without a hitch in Utah.
Politicians have shown a keen interest in blockchain all the way up to Washington D.C., where 32 bills addressing cryptocurrency and blockchain policy have been introduced since the 116th Congress was sworn in in January 2019.
Sony announced the launch of its Blockchain Common Database this week as a new high-speed processing technology that can execute and store 7 million transactions per day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">5 Converging Factors: Bitcoin’s Rally Is Just Starting, Even After 150% Surge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just seven weeks ago, Bitcoin was trading down in the dumps, at $3,700 after one of the worst trading sessions in the cryptocurrency market ever.
In the wake of that move, there were many analysts calling for the crypto market to fall even lower than it had, but digital assets quickly rebounded across the board in a show of resilience.
Just around 50 days after the crash and Bitcoin is now trading at $9,200 — 150% higher than the $3,700 lows, a stellar performance that puts almost any other $100 billion+ asset to shame. Although impressive, analysts are convinced that more upside is in the cards for the crypto market, citing a convergence of technical and fundamental factors boosting BTC’s outlook.
The past week has seen the crypto market explode after two weeks of accumulation. As reported by Bitcoinist previously, Bitcoin recently shot past $9,000, reaching a local high of $9,500.
Chart from TradingView.com
This move past the ever-important $9,000 level, which acted as both psychological and technical resistance, is just the start of a greater bull run, analysts say.
One well-known trader corroborated this narrative, identifying five technical and fundamental reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin at the moment, despite the fears of a global recession and a downturn in the stock market:
Asserting how strong the current bull trend is, the trader concluded by writing that while “you might not call and short THE top, you will save yourself a lot of potential headaches by just waiting for a break in the 1D market structure.”
While all the topics the trader mentioned suggest more upside is imminent, the Bitcoin halving is likely to act as the biggest catalyst for a bull run, analysts say.
In approximately ten days as of the time of this article’s writing, estimates from BitcoinBlockHalf suggest, BTC will see what is known as its block reward reduction, or “halving.” This is when the number of coins minted per block mined is cut in half, in this case from 12.5 coins to 6.25.
May’s halving is expected to be certainly bullish for Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with one prominent analyst suggesting that BTC will have a fair price of around $288,000 — over 3,000% higher than the current price — after the event.
Bitcoin’s halving has generated so much hype that as this outlet reported, the Chinese word for the term briefly trended on Weibo, ‘Chinese Twitter’, as the sixth-most active term. The interest that Google users have in the term “Bitcoin halving” has also gone literally parabolic, eclipsing any previous point in crypto history by a long shot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin Just Surged Past $9k: Here’s Why Analysts Think More Upside Is Imminent</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After trading below $9,000 ever since the blow-off top on Wednesday, Bitcoin has been subject to a strong recovery over the past couple of days, culminating in a breakout seen this past hour.
The cryptocurrency, as of the time of this article’s writing, is trading for $9,150 — more than 9% higher than the post-rally lows of $8,400 and up approximately 4% in the past 24 hours. Yet BTC is still a few hundred dollars shy of the $9,500 top.
Bitcoin’s breakout comes in spite of a number of bearish signals the cryptocurrency has printed over the past few days: 1) a sell wall consisting of 1,000 Bitcoin — worth over $8 million — that on Saturday morning appeared on Binance, and 2) BTC’s GTI Global Strength Indicator moving past 70, suggesting exhaustion of the bull trend.
The move past $9,000 is far from the end of the bullish trend, according to top analysts.
One well-known trader remarked that there is a strong confluence of reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin at the moment, even with the aforementioned bearish signals spotted on the charts:
Asserting how strong the current bull trend is, the trader added that while “you might not call and short THE top, you will save yourself a lot of potential headaches by just waiting for a break in the 1D market structure.”
The optimism was echoed by other traders, like the one who shared the chart below, indicating that Bitcoin’s recent price action is eerily similar to that seen in August 2015, when the cryptocurrency saw a parabolic breakout from macro lows.
Should Bitcoin continue to follow this fractal to a T, it could hit $14,000 in approximately a week, which would line up with the Bitcoin halving and a subsequent sell-off spurred by miners dumping coins.
The long-term trend of the leading cryptocurrency is also starting to shape up to be positive.
In a research note on cryptocurrency published Thursday, David Grider — the lead digital strategist at Wall Street analysis firm Fundstrat Global Advisors — said that his firm is bullish on Bitcoin moving forward, specifically citing the halving as a positive catalyst:
Marketwatch, which covered the note, suggested that Fundstrat sees the cryptocurrency nearly doubling in the coming 12 months to $14,350.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin Analyst Who Called $3,200 Bottom in 2018 Thinks This Trajectory Is Next</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The past few days have undoubtedly been bullish for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency ripping over 20% higher from the mid-$7,000s to a price as high as $9,500 over the course of 48 hours.
Since hitting $9,500 though, BTC has stalled, entering a consolidation around $8,800 as the market becomes indecisive, stuck between support around $8,500 and resistance at the ever-important level of $9,000.
Here’s what a top trader expects for Bitcoin to trend in the days to come.
Bitcoin’s consolidation over the past day is likely to be followed by a strong leg to the downside, according to a cryptocurrency trader. He added that while a drop is to be sustained, the cryptocurrency remains in a “strong uptrend” that suggests a rally to $10,000 is in the works prior to the halving.
Chart from @SmartContracter (Twitter)
While many crypto investors are skeptical of the validity of Elliot Wave analysis, the trader has a strong track record in analyzing the ever-volatile cryptocurrency markets, giving credence to his commentary.
In the middle of 2018, when Bitcoin was in the midst of a bear market, the trader remarked that he expected the asset to find an ultimate bottom at $3,200:
By the middle of December, his forecast was proven to be right when Bitcoin plunged from $6,000 to a low of $3,150 over the span of a few weeks, then established a macro bottom at that level.
Further adding credence to his position, the analyst predicted shorter-term price moves over the past few months, like forecasting some of Bitcoin’s strength early this year and the start of the crypto market’s precipitous drawdown in mid-February.
Even if Bitcoin doesn’t trend exactly as the trader’s chart depicts, there is one thing that many analysts have agreed on: the crypto market’s trajectory is pointing up.
As reported by Bitcoinist previously, a trader found that Bitcoin’s strong performance in April saw the cryptocurrency close its monthly candle above a key level of the Ichimoku Cloud on the one-month chart.
This is relevant for BTC because the last time Bitcoin claimed this technical level was in early 2016, when the cryptocurrency was trading around $500 and prior to the 4,000% rally that brought the cryptocurrency to $20,000 just 20 months later.
Chart from @TraderSmokey (Twitter)
This historical precedent suggests that the crypto market is on the verge of its next parabolic rally.
There’s also a confluence of on-chain analytics and fundamental factors that only corroborate that the crypto market is on the verge of a full-blown bull rally.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crypto Tidbits: Bitcoin Hits $9ks, a16z Raises $500M Crypto Fund, Ethereum 2.0 Nears</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another week, another round of Crypto Tidbits. Bitcoin has been one of the best-performing assets in financial markets over the past week, managing to rally as high as $9,500 — over 25% higher where it started this week. Altcoins, interestingly, have underperformed the market leader, with Ethereum and XRP both gaining around 10% over the past seven days.
Crypto’s strength this week comes as the stock market has started to stagnate in the 2,800-2,900 point range, seemingly playing with the idea of a reversal as the economic outlook remains dismal, with a total of 30 million Americans filing for unemployment over the past month.
Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, went as far as to say that the U.S. economy is currently in its worst rut in history due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The recovery will not be V-shaped, Powell added, asserting that it may take a while for life to return to pre-virus levels due to the long-lasting effects of the shutdown of the world’s biggest economic powerhouse.
Whatever the case, analysts are still bullish on Bitcoin.
Roch Rosenblum, the co-head of trading at GSR, remarked to Bloomberg that the ongoing BTC rally is predicated on the macroeconomic environment:
This optimism was echoed by Zac Prince, a co-founder of crypto startup BlockFi, who said that the “current market dynamics are driving a bolstered interest [for] digital currency.” These dynamics he was referencing was the Federal Reserve’s commitment to money printing and the growth in stablecoins.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forget The Halving—Is This The Real Reason Bitcoin Suddenly Soared Toward $10,000?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors are gearing up for the long-awaited bitcoin halving this month—which will see the number of new bitcoin entering the market cut by half.
The bitcoin price has soared this week and is now a strong contender for 2020's best performing asset, climbing to over $9,000 per bitcoin for the first time since late February.
However, while many traders are betting the bitcoin price will climb as a result of this month's cut to supply, the latest bitcoin bounce may have happened for entirely different reasons.
MORE FROM FORBESThis Bitcoin Rival Is Suddenly Rocketing-Up 75% So Far This YearBy Billy Bambrough
Shortly before bitcoin's 20% rally this week, a large transfer of the stablecoin tether was made to bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis with its creators claiming they keep one U.S. dollar in reserve for every tether token issued.
Tether tokens worth a little over $50 million were transferred to Malta-based Binance early on Wednesday, just hours before bitcoin began its $30 billion pump.
A Twitter bot that records major bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades, called Whale Alert, picked up the transaction.
Over the past month Tether Ltd, which controls the stablecoin tether and shares owners and senior staff with the British Virgin Islands-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, has ramped up the number of tether it's creating—minting over $1 billion worth of the stablecoin.
"[On Wednesday we] witnessed extensive buying activity and the high level of scalability and liquidity evident on our platform made us able to seamlessly service all these requests," boasted Bitfinex chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino—who also serves as the chief technology officer of Tether—in a statement that pointed to major U.S. bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's unfortunate outage during the sudden bitcoin rally.

Last year, it was suggested around half of bitcoin's value between March 2017 and March 2018 was created by trades between bitcoin and tether—casting doubt over whether bitcoin's epic 2017 bull run happened organically.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Activist investor hedge fund reportedly financing Eko lawsuit against Quibi over Turnstyle feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. is financing Eko’s patent lawsuit against streaming service Quibi, The Wall Street Journal reports. Eko’s suit claims that Quibi stole trade secrets and that its “Turnstyle” feature violates Eko’s patents. Turnstyle allows Quibi videos to play differently depending on the orientation —vertical or horizontal— of the viewer’s phone, switching in real time.
Eko wants Quibi to stop using its technology or license it and is suing for a preliminary injunction and damages. As part of the financing arrangement, Elliott would get an equity stake in Eko, according to the WSJ, though it’s not clear how much money is involved.
Quibi, the mobile video app that launched last month, raised nearly $2 billion to produce “quick bite” shows that last a max of 10 minutes. It filed a lawsuit against Eko a day before Eko filed its suit, asking a court to find that Turnstyle doesn’t infringe Eko’s patent. Quibi told The Verge in March that Turnstyle was its patented technology and that Eko’s claims were “without merit.”
A Quibi spokesperson reiterated its stance in a statement emailed to The Verge late Sunday. “As we made clear in our filing, Quibi’s patented Turnstyle feature is the result of the work from our talented engineering team,” the spokesperson said. “When a new product launches, these types of claims are unfortunately too common. Eko’s actions and complaints remain meritless.”
Elliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. An Eko spokesperson declined to comment.
Elliott Management is known for aggressive investor activism, backed by more than $40 billion in capital. The group was behind a recent push to replace Jack Dorsey as CEO of Twitter. The two sides reached an agreement in March that allowed Dorsey to remain as CEO but gave Elliott executive Jesse Cohn a seat on Twitter’s board, and a seat on a board committee tasked with evaluating a CEO succession plan for Twitter. Elliott also acquired a stake in AT&T in 2019, writing in a letter that the telco “suffered from operational and execution issues over the past decade, for which the current leadership team is accountable.” But it supported the recent appointment of AT&T COO John Stankey to CEO, according to CNBC.
(Disclosure: Vox Media, which owns The Verge, has a deal with Quibi to produce a Polygon Daily Essential, and there have been talks about a Verge show.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elliott Management financing major patent lawsuit against streaming startup Quibi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. is financing a high-stakes patent lawsuit against Quibi, the new streaming service founded by entertainment veteran Jeffrey Katzenberg, according to people familiar with the situation, putting power players of Wall Street and Hollywood on a collision course.
Elliott has agreed to fund a suit brought by interactive-video company Eko, which claims Quibi is violating its patents and has stolen trade secrets, the people said. As part of the financing, Elliott would end up with an equity stake, the people said. The size of the equity stake couldn’t be learned, though it is a substantial investment, the people said.
The litigation concerns a Quibi feature called “Turnstyle,” which the company has described as a groundbreaking technology. It plays different videos for users depending on how they are holding their phone, switching in real time between horizontal and vertical versions.
New York-based Eko, whose official corporate name is Interlude US Inc., has demanded that Quibi stop using its technology or license it. It is suing for a preliminary injunction and damages. In a statement, a Quibi spokeswoman denied that the company infringed on Eko’s patent, calling Eko’s lawsuit meritless.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hedge Fund Elliott Management Backs Patent Lawsuit Against Quibi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The activist investor that waged high-profile battles with AT&T and Twitter is financing a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile streaming service Quibi, a source familiar with the matter confirms.
Elliott Management agreed to fund Eko’s suit in exchange for an equity stake in the company, theWall Street Journal first reported.
The dispute centers on Quibi’s signature feature, called Turnstyle, which displays full-screen video horizontally or vertically—depending on how the viewer holds the phone.
The Israeli company claims two Quibi employees, who were provided access to its subsidiary’s technology while working at Snap, stole its idea. A Quibi spokesperson issued a statement denying that, saying Eko’s claims lack merit.
The conflict will pit Elliott’s combative founder, billionaire Paul E. Singer, against another tenacious figure, Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Elliott had previously called for the ouster of Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, before reaching a settlement with the company earlier this year. AT&T agreed last year to separate the CEO and chairman roles after Randall Stephenson stepped down.
Quibi launched on April 6, 2020, debuting a service designed to deliver quick bursts of entertainment for busy people on the go—in the middle of a pandemic. Katzenberg and CEO Meg Whitman raised $1.75 billion to launch the service, which attracted 1.7 million downloads in its first week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(This May 2 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of “towel” in second paragraph)
By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O).
Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co (AXP.N), to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

"Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it," Mr Buffett said. "I will bet on America the rest of my life."
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Mr Buffett and vice-chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly two hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Mr Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Mr Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $US49.75 billion ($77.41 billion) first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealised losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America and Apple during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6 per cent, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19.
Mr Buffett said operating earnings would, through at least this year, be "considerably less" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire's cash stake ended the quarter at a record $US137.3 billion, though Mr Buffett said "we're willing to do something very big", perhaps a $US30 billion to $US50 billion transaction.
But it will not be in US airlines, after Mr Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its "entire positions" in the four largest: American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines Holdings.
He said he "made a mistake" investing in the sector, which the pandemic had changed "in a very major way" with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
"It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country," he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Mr Buffett calls "Woodstock for capitalists".
Mr Abel stood in for long-time vice-chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Mr Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Mr Buffett said Mr Munger was in "fine shape" and "good health", and looked forward to attending Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting.
Vice-chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Mr Abel lives closer to Omaha than Mr Munger and Mr Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Mr Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Mr Buffett's eldest son, Howard, would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Mr Buffett as chief investment officer.
Mr Abel told investors "I don't see the culture of Berkshire changing" after Mr Buffett and Mr Munger were no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totalled 391,539 at year end, though some businesses had furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire would not be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totalled about 30.3 million, or 18 per cent of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Mr Abel nonetheless said that in five years, "we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today".
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of long-time Berkshire holding American Express, to Berkshire's board, making him the company's first African American director.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American business tycoon Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc has reported a net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while it also sold off all its airline stocks
Washington: American business tycoon Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc has reported a net loss of nearly $50 billion in the first quarter amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while it also sold off all its airline stocks.
The net loss totalled to $49.75 billion in the first quarter, or $30,653 dollars, per Class A share and $20.44 per Class B share, compared with a net earnings of $21.66 billion a year ago, Xinhua news agency quoted Berkshire as saying in a statement on Saturday.
The first-quarter operating earnings rose to $5.87 billion from $5.55 billion dollars, it added.
"As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe.
Berkshire has taken 'necessary' actions to mitigate the economic losses due to lower consumer demand for products and services," the statement said, adding that the company could not 'reliably predict' when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
At a virtual shareholder meeting also on Saturday, Buffett announced that his conglomerate has sold all its airline stocks, sending an alarming signal to industry devastated by the global pandemic.
"The world has changed for the airlines," he said. "And I don't know how it's changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way. It turned out I was wrong about that business,"
The Berkshire Hathaway previously held shares of United Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines, worth over $4 billion last December, but stocks were down this year by 69.7 per cent, 62.9 per cent, 45.8 per cent, and 58.7 per cent, respectively, according to a report from CNBC. Berkshire, a US multinational conglomerate holding company, is based in Omaha, Nebraska.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway lost $49.7 billion in first quarter stung by coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not even Warren Buffett was spared financially from the coronavirus, as his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a $49.7 billion loss in the first quarter Saturday, reflecting the outbreak’s toll on an investment portfolio that includes big stakes in major airlines and financial firms.
The loss was Berkshire’s biggest ever and a sharp swing from a $21.7 billion profit in the same quarter a year earlier. The conglomerate’s vast array of investments exposed it — and Buffett, long considered one of the world’s top investors — to huge swaths of the battered US economy.
Its total investment loss for the quarter, without accounting for operating earnings, was $54.5 billion. By comparison, its investment gain in all of 2019 was $56.3 billion.
Berkshire said it continued to sell stock in April, totaling $6.5 billion, ploughing that money primarily into supersafe Treasury bills. Later Saturday, at his annual shareholders meeting, Buffett suggested that some of those sales involved Berkshire’s reversing its roughly 10% in the four largest US airlines.
Berkshire’s investment loss tracked the overall slide in stock markets: The S&P 500 dropped 20% in the first quarter. (The company’s biggest holdings are also mainstays of the S&P 500: American Express, Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo, with those stakes amounting to nearly $125 billion.)
The loss overshadowed a 6% rise in Berkshire’s operating earnings, which track the performance of the company’s owned-and-operated businesses like insurer Geico. Buffett regards that as a better measure of the company’s overall performance and has long argued that quarterly paper gains or losses on its investments “are often meaningless” in understanding its overall health.
But it is hard to ignore the damage to a portfolio that includes stakes in financial firms like Bank of America and American Express, both of which reported steep drops in earnings for the first quarter, and four of the biggest US airlines. (Berkshire also disclosed that the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz on its books exceeds the market value of that holding by about 40%, and warned that it might have to take a write-down on the investment in the future.)
Even some of the conglomerate’s wholly owned businesses, like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and retailers like See’s Candy, were hurt by the lockdowns that have shaken the US economy. Still, Geico reported a 28% gain for the quarter, to $984 million, while Berkshire’s overall insurance investment profits rose modestly because of increased dividend income for the company.
The first-quarter results, in which Berkshire reported having $137.3 billion in cash, were released before its first online-only shareholder meeting. Sometimes described as a kind of Woodstock for capitalists, the meeting is usually a weekendlong Omaha, Nebraska, extravaganza celebrating all things Buffett and Berkshire.
This year, it was a decidedly more subdued affair, reflecting the limits on mass gatherings and travel of the COVID-crisis era. Buffett’s longtime business partner, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not attend, staying at home in Los Angeles.
“It just didn’t seem like a good idea to have him make the trip to Omaha,” Buffett said, adding, “Charlie is in fine shape, and he’ll be back next year.”
Buffett was joined instead by Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman overseeing all of the company’s non-insurance companies, who sat at a separate desk some distance from Buffett.
Instead of facing thousands of adoring and affluent shareholders, Buffett, noting that he hadn’t had a haircut in seven weeks, held forth in an almost completely vacant Omaha arena that seats more than 17,000, as his comments were livestreamed.
Discussing the breakdown in the financial markets that prompted the Federal Reserve to drastically ramp up efforts to pump in fresh cash, he said, “We came very close to having a total freeze of credit.”
When it came to Berkshire’s stake in the airlines, Buffett said, “I just decided that I’d made a mistake.”
He added that because of the pandemic’s impact on travel, “the airline business — and I may be wrong, and I hope I’m wrong — but I think it, it changed in a very major way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Says Lost $50 Bln in Q1 Due to COVID-19 Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Sputnik) - US business tycoon Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding has reported a loss of $55 billion in Q1 amid COVID-19 pandemic, compared to $21 billion in profits over the same period last year, the company said in a press release on Saturday.
The published financial statements say the conglomerate lost $49.7 billion in the first quarter. The holding's revenue in 2019 amounted to $254.6 billion.
Meanwhile, the company's operating profits were 6 percent higher than those of 2019, amounting to $5.87 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
Berkshire owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See's Candies.
The businesses were rocked in mid-April due to numerous restrictive measures and lockdowns, which halted many industries across the world.
According to the Johns Hopkins University count, the new coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 3,402,400 people and has claimed the lives of at least 242,000 worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 tally has surpassed 183,400, with over 28,200 fatalities, the university says.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett's firm reports nearly $50B loss as investments drop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett’s company reported a nearly $50 billion loss on Saturday because of a huge drop in the paper value of its investments, though the company is still sitting on a huge pile of cash.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That’s down from last year’s profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire’s investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began. The year before, Berkshire’s investments added $15.5 billion to the company’s profits.
Buffett has long said Berkshire’s operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire’s operating earnings improved to $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or $3,387.56 per Class A share.
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,796.90 on average.
Berkshire’s revenue grew 1 per cent to $61.27 billion.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently
On Saturday afternoon, Buffett plans to lead an abbreviated online version of Berkshire’s annual meeting without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend. The company shifted to an online meeting and cancelled all the events surrounding the event because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slumps to $50bn loss in first quarter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway swung to a $49.7 billion (€44.8 billion) loss in the first three months of the year, as the sharp sell-off in global stock markets hammered its investment portfolio.
The sprawling industrial conglomerate disclosed on Saturday that its stock portfolio, which includes shares in blue-chip groups such as Apple and Bank of America, declined by $55.5 billion in value in the quarter alongside the 20 per cent drop in the S&P 500.
That decline more than offset the improvement in underlying earnings at Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See’s Candies. Operating profits rose 5.7 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9 billion, as investment gains from its insurance business climbed.
“The amount of investment gains [AND]losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in a statement.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled to a record $137 billion and the group shifted a large portion of that into US Treasuries in the first quarter, a filing with US regulators showed.
Mr Buffett has for more than four years struggled to invest that cash in one of the major acquisitions for which the company is known. The so-called Oracle of Omaha has blamed high equity valuations in previous letters to investors as one of the main reasons the company has remained on the sidelines, as other large publicly traded groups went on acquisition sprees in recent years.
Shares of Berkshire have fallen 19 per cent this year to $273,975.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stock market slide pushes Berkshire Hathaway to $50bn loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $49.7bn loss in the first three months of the year, as the sharp sell-off in global stock markets hammered its investment portfolio.
The sprawling conglomerate disclosed on Saturday that the decline in value of its stock and derivative portfolio, which includes shares in blue-chip groups such as Apple and Bank of America, generated a $55.6bn loss in the quarter. Multibillion-dollar mark-to-market losses in the quarter accompanied a 20 per cent drop in the S&P 500.
That decline more than offset the improvement in underlying earnings at Berkshire, which owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See’s Candies. Operating profits rose 5.7 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9bn, as investment gains from its insurance business climbed.
“The amount of investment gains [and] losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in a statement.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled to a record $137bn and the group shifted a large portion of that into US Treasuries in the first quarter, a filing with US regulators showed.
Mr Buffett has for more than four years struggled to invest that cash in one of the major acquisitions for which the company is known. The so-called Oracle of Omaha has blamed high equity valuations in previous letters to investors as one of the main reasons the company has remained on the sidelines, as other large publicly traded groups went on acquisition sprees in recent years.
Berkshire instead purchased $1.7bn of its own common stock during the quarter, with much of that buying occurring in late-February and early-March as the price of its own shares were sliding alongside the broader market. But those purchases did not continue into the start of April, according to James Shanahan, an analyst who follows Berkshire at Edward Jones.
“If Buffett is not seeing opportunities in his own stock should we conclude the recent market sell-off isn’t a buying opportunity,” Mr Shanahan asked. “I don’t know what if anything is more important to ask Buffett today.”
The quarterly disclosure on Berkshire’s many subsidiaries showed only the early impact from the coronavirus outbreak, which is known to have killed more than 200,000 people and has sparked a severe economic downturn.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” Berkshire said.

The group’s BNSF railroad reported a 6 per cent decline in revenues in the period, led by a drop-off in shipments of consumer products. Sales at aerospace-parts manufacturer Precision Castparts slid as Boeing suspended the manufacturing of its 737-Max jet and shipments to covid-affected businesses declined. NetJets suffered from lower demand while Clayton Homes, which makes and sells mobile homes, increased its provisions for loan losses related to the virus.
Insurer Geico was one of the bright spots for the company, as shelter-in-place guidelines across the US led to a drop in auto-related claims.
Berkshire said it was taking measures to cut costs and that some of its business lines had furloughed employees and reduced staff salaries. Shares of Berkshire have fallen 19 per cent this year to $273,975.
Investors will get a fuller update from Mr Buffett later on Saturday through a live video-cast. The company, which remains among the most highly valued publicly traded groups in the world, cancelled the festivities that normally surround its annual meeting due to the health crisis.
The tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders who traditionally descend on downtown Omaha for the company’s annual meeting will instead hear his missives and those from Berkshire vice-chairman Greg Abel this year from their own homes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $6 billion in stock in April, its first-quarter earnings show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold more than $US6 billion worth of stocks in April,according to first-quarter earnings released on Saturday ahead of its annual meeting.
The famed investor’s conglomerate holds stakes in Apple, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and other companies. It was widely expected to capitalise on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap, but instead netted about $US6.1 billion from stock sales last month.
Berkshire’s cash pile swelled from $US128 billion on December 31 to $US137 billion at the end of March, despite it spending $US1.7 billion on share buybacks in the period.
The group’s first-quarter figures fell short of the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Here are the key numbers:
Berkshire posted a net loss of $US49.7 billion last quarter, a sharp swing from its net earnings of $US21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The shift reflected $US54.5 billion in investment losses, compared to a $US15.5 billion gain in the same period last year.
However, Berkshire warned investors against reading too much into its earnings.
“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,” the company said in its earnings release.
Berkshire’s operating earnings grew 6% to $US5.9 billion as insurance investment income and “other” earnings rose, offsetting lower insurance underwriting profits due to expected pandemic payouts and less income from its railroad, utilities and energy segment.
The conglomerate had $US113 billion invested in equity securities at the end of March, a slight increase from $US110 billion at the end of December. It raked in $US965 million in after-tax gains from sales of investments last quarter, a sharp increase from $US392 million in the comparable period.

Like many other companies, Berkshire warned that the coronavirus outbreak has “negatively affected” most of its businesses, with the effects ranging from “relatively minor to severe.”
Several of its businesses including railroads, utilities, and insurance have been deemed essential and allowed to continue operating, but their revenues “slowed considerably” in April. Other Berkshire companies including retailers, and some manufacturing and service businesses are being “severely impacted” by closures.
Berkshire added that the fallout will likely continue in the current quarter.
“The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March and will likely adversely affect nearly all of our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly,” the company said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At a time when the government has decided to provide some relaxations in restrictions during the third phase of the nationwide lockdown starting from May 4, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday called for a greater industrial activities in districts with high economic performance.
The industry body also called for “economic contribution of districts to be taken into consideration while classifying lockdown zones.”
“Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations, including in containment zones, with highest safety protocols,” CII said in a report, ‘Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Area.’
Also ReadLockdown 3.0 begins tomorrow with ‘considerable relaxations’; some curbs to continue
 
The suggestions followed the notification, issued on May 1 by the Centre, on graded exit from the coronavirus- related lockdown.
The third phase of lockdown necessitates “a focused strategy to minimise economic contraction due to Covid-19”, without compromising on efforts to control the contagion, the trade body said in a statement.
“Prioritising districts with heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations, accompanied by strictest precautions, can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses,” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
The industry body also said while the protracted lockdown in the country, necessitated by the rapid spread of Covid-19, has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses.
In its strategy note, it requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to country’s GDP, or presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.
Instead of the current practice of categorising the entire district as a ‘Red zone’, the CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as ‘Containment’, ‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ within an industrial district.
“Economic activities, in varying degrees of relaxation, should be permitted in all areas of this district, but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone,” it said.
Also ReadAllow factories in containment zones to operate, says Food Processing industry
 
The Containment zone may be a street, mohalla or factory building where positive cases have been detected, the industry body said.
It has suggested that close surrounding areas can be classified as Orange zones, where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.
The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart, the industry body said. “Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from ‘Red’ to ‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ within 21 days.
“The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE, masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss, if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration,” Banerjee said.
The government has permitted industrial estates, SEZ and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of ‘red zones’ to commence operations.
“CII submitted that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well,” the statement said.
The body also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.
‘Green’ zones within an industrial district, on other hand, should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but in adherence to strict health and safety protocols prescribed by the authorities.

Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations, including in containment zones with highest safety protocols, said CII in its report titled 'A Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Areas', submitted to the government.

The government notification of May 1 has permitted industrial estates, special economic zone (SEZ) and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of red zones to commence operations.
The industry body said that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well.
It has recommended that close surrounding areas can be classified as orange zones where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.
The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart, according to CII.
"The third phase of lockdown necessitates a focused strategy to minimize economic contraction due to COVID-19, without compromising on efforts to control the contagion. Prioritising districts with heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations accompanied by strictest precautions can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
While the protracted lockdown in the country, necessitated by the rapid spread of COVID-19, has helped in controlling the spread of epidemic and given us time to augment medical capacity, it has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses, the chamber said.
CII has requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to the country's GDP, or presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.
Instead of the current practice of classifying the entire district as a red zone, CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as Containment, Orange and Green within an industrial district.
Economic activities, in varying degrees of relaxation, should be permitted in all areas of those districts, but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone, the chamber suggested.
It said the containment zone may be a street, mohalla or factory building where positive cases have been detected.
In containment zones, industrial units where no positive cases exist, can be allowed to operate if workers can be restricted to the premises or within walkable distance, as per the CII note. Raw materials and finished goods should be disinfected and kept separately for 72 hours before use as permissible by the health authorities.
Maximum precautions and safety measures in the form of masks, repeated sanitation, restricted movement of people and vehicles, and group testing, among others, can be carried out regularly in such containment zones, noted CII.
"Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from Red to Orange and Green within 21 days. The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE, Masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will  be much less than the economic loss if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration," said Banerjee.
CII also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.
Green zones within an industrial district, on other hand, should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but following strictly the health and safety protocols prescribed by the health authorities.
There should be a real time availability of data on all types of zones within the industrial districts. The authorities may also provide updated information on Aarogya Setu app, other apps, local newspapers, radio, TV and online channels, according to the chamber.
It also prescribed standard operating procedures for offices, workplaces, factories and establishments prior to resuming operations.

The government notification of May 1 has permitted industrial estates, Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and industrial townships with restricted entry within urban areas of red zones to commence operations.
The industry body said that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well.
 
It has recommended that close surrounding areas can be classified as orange zones where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.
The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart, according to CII.
“The third phase of lockdown necessitates a focused strategy to minimize economic contraction due to COVID-19, without compromising on efforts to control the contagion. Prioritising districts with heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations accompanied by strictest precautions can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses,” CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
While the protracted lockdown in the country, necessitated by the rapid spread of COVID-19, has helped in controlling the spread of epidemic and given us time to augment medical capacity, it has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses, the chamber said.
CII has requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to the country’s GDP, or presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.
Instead of the current practice of classifying the entire district as a red zone, CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as Containment, Orange and Green within an industrial district.
 
Economic activities, in varying degrees of relaxation, should be permitted in all areas of those districts, but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone, the chamber suggested.
It said the containment zone may be a street, mohalla or factory building where positive cases have been detected.
In containment zones, industrial units where no positive cases exist, can be allowed to operate if workers can be restricted to the premises or within walkable distance, as per the CII note. Raw materials and finished goods should be disinfected and kept separately for 72 hours before use as permissible by the health authorities.
Maximum precautions and safety measures in the form of masks, repeated sanitation, restricted movement of people and vehicles, and group testing, among others, can be carried out regularly in such containment zones, noted CII.
“Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from Red to Orange and Green within 21 days. The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE, Masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration,” said Mr. Banerjee.
 
CII also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.
Green zones within an industrial district, on other hand, should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but following strictly the health and safety protocols prescribed by the health authorities.
There should be a real time availability of data on all types of zones within the industrial districts. The authorities may also provide updated information on Aarogya Setu app, other apps, local newspapers, radio, TV and online channels, according to the chamber.
It also prescribed standard operating procedures for offices, workplaces, factories and establishments prior to resuming operations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Industry leaders want manufacturing to reopen even in red zones, with adequate safeguards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Indian industry leaders have sought more relaxations to resume economic activity in urban areas and containment zones, pointing out that it is essential for kick-starting manufacturing after the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19.
They have sought easing of curbs and resumption of manufacturing activity, pointing out that a phase-wise opening may adversely impact supply chains.
On 1 May, the government had announced that the lockdown, which began on 25 March, would be extended until 17 May, but permitted the resumption of many economic activities in the zones marked orange and green according to the number of cases detected there. But strict curbs remained in place in areas falling in ‘red zones’.
The new guidelines permit industrial activities in rural areas. However, in urban areas, only certain industrial activities taking place in designated industry zones are allowed. Further, no economic activity is allowed in containment zones.
While ‘red zones’ are high-risk zones with fresh cases being reported, ‘orange zones’ are places where no new cases have been reported in 14 days, and green zones are those where no new cases have been reported in 21 days, or there are no cases at all.
Based on the government’s projections, there are 130 red zones, 284 orange zones and 319 green zones as on 30 April.
Many districts in economically-significant states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat are in the red zone, bringing economic activity to a complete halt. The whole of national capital Delhi, commercial capital Mumbai and important hub Pune are in the red zones.

The Confederation of Indian Industry, in a representation to the government on 2 May, has sought that industrial activity should be allowed in all places, including containment zones, subject to safeguards.
It pointed out that there is a need for developing a strategy that minimises the impact of the lockdown on economic activities in the country, without compromising on the efforts at controlling the spread of Covid-19.
It has suggested that the “top economic districts in the country have an additionalrelaxation that will permit industrial clusters and standalone industrial facilities, including those not designated as industrial estates, SEZs (special economic zones) or industrial townships, to operate”.
The CII said the protracted lockdown has started building pressure on large segments of businesses, adversely affecting the prospects of overall growth and development in the country.
“While businesses have, by and large, refrained from laying-off workers, a halt in the revenue streams has started causing serious financial distresses to them. If they continue to remain shut for longer, many of them would be driven into a financially unsustainable situation,” it said.
The CII has suggested that in containment zones, economic activity should be allowed, subject to restriction of movement of workers, sanitation protocol and testing.
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson of Biocon Ltd, has also sought the creation of sub-zones within a red zone for restarting economic activity. She quoted a report that showed that nearly 53 per cent of India’s economic activity takes place in the red zones.
 
On 1 May, immediately after the announcement of the guidelines, Sangita Reddy, president of another industry body, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), had said that while the relaxation will allow for a calibrated opening up of economic activities, many activities won’t resume.
“Though relaxations have been made in the business activities in the green and orange zones, and to some extent in the red zones also, significant part of the economic activity will still remain in abeyance,” Reddy had said, seeking a regular assessment of the zones to further relax the opening up of business activities.
Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, also expressed hope on 1 May that after the lockdown is lifted on 17 May, the opening up is pan-India and comprehensive, pointing out that supply chains will remain paralysed otherwise.

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has suggested that districts with significant industrial and business operations should be allowed to function even if there are cases of novel coronavirus in those regions. Activities should resume even in containment zones with highest safety protocols, recommends CII.
In 'A Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Areas' submitted to the government after the decision to extend the lockdown was announced on May 1, CII stated that "The third phase of lockdown necessitates a focused strategy to minimise economic contraction due to COVID-19, without compromising on efforts to control the contagion".

The CII strategy note prescribes standard operating procedures for offices, workplaces, factories, and establishments prior to resuming operations, after resuming operations, and guidelines for social distancing and visitor management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CII bats for greater industrial activities in 'high economic performance' zones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At a time when the government has decided to provide some relaxations in restrictions during the third phase of the nationwide lockdown starting from May 4, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Sunday called for greater industrial activities in districts with high economic performance.
The industry body also called for "economic contribution of districts to be taken into consideration while classifying lockdown zones."
"Districts with high economic activity should resume all industrial and business operations, including those in containment zones, with highest safety protocols," CII said in a report, 'Strategy Note on Resumption of Economic Activities in Industrial Area.'
The suggestions followed the notification, issued on May 1 by the government, on graded exit from the coronavirus-related lockdown.
The third phase of lockdown necessitates "a focused strategy to minimise economic contraction due to Covid-19", without compromising on efforts to control the contagion, the trade body said in a statement.
"Prioritising districts with a heavy presence of economic and industrial activities with continued operations, accompanied by strictest precautions, can help enterprises to remain financially sustainable while averting job losses," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
The industry body also said while the protracted lockdown in the country, necessitated by the rapid spread of Covid-19, has also caused enormous stress to the financial sustainability of many businesses.
In its strategy note, it requested that the top districts should be identified based on variables like their contribution to country's GDP, or presence of industrial estates and clusters or registration of enterprises in a district.
Instead of the current practice of categorising the entire district as a 'red zone', the CII has suggested the need for classifying zones as 'containment', 'orange' and 'green' within an industrial district.
"Economic activities, in varying degrees of relaxation, should be permitted in all areas of this district but health and safety protocols would differ from zone to zone," it said.
The containment zone may be a street, "mohalla" or factory building where positive cases have been detected, the industry body said.
It has suggested that close surrounding areas can be classified as 'orange zones' where industrial activity can be continued with strict precautionary measures and monitoring.
The distinction of essential and non-essential items should be removed and all factories should be permitted to restart, the industry body said.
"Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from 'red' to 'orange' and 'green' within 21 days.
"The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE, masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss, if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for a longer duration," Banerjee said.
The government has permitted industrial estates, SEZ and industrial townships with the restricted entry within urban areas of 'red zones' to commence operations.
"CII submitted that all industrial units, including in non-notified industrial areas and standalone units, be allowed to function in urban areas. These should include non-essential goods and services as well," the statement said.
The body also called for limited public transport to function to enable workers and self-employed people to reach the industrial areas.
'Green' zones within an industrial district, on the other hand, should be allowed to work with relaxed restrictions but in adherence to strict health and safety protocols prescribed by the authorities.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TUI AG’s Chinese unit will restart its travel business, offering trips and flights within the country to local customers.
The business is resuming after the government lifted a three-month sales ban, and operations will gradually be expanded amid a backlog of demand by Chinese customers, Chief Executive Officer Fritz Joussen said in a statement.
Global travel has been disrupted by the coronavirus crisis and airlines are expected to burn through as much as $61 billion in the second quarter, according to the International Air Transport Association. Joussen said tourism in Europe needs a “clear perspective,” and that European Union nations should develop timetables for flights within the region.
TUI’s online traffic is at 90% of last year’s level, signaling there’s high demand, the CEO said. Customers shouldn’t be limited to trips at home and countries that made good progress in the battle against the virus could be reopened for tourism, he said.
“We need to get out of the crisis now,” Joussen said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">TUI's China unit resumes domestic holiday offers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN — The Chinese unit of Germany’s TUI , the world’s biggest tourism group, said on Sunday it has resumed offering holiday packages in China and urged the European Union (EU) to lift travel restrictions in place to curb the coronavirus.
The resumption of business in China, three months after TUI’s activities there were halted, is focused on short breaks in the mountains and beach resorts.
Other packages include trips in the vicinity of big cities.
“Our offices in Peking and Shanghai were open during the crisis but were not allowed to sell holiday packages,” TUI Chief Executive Fritz Joussen said in a statement.
“We now see a significant backlog of demand for holidays. TUI China will in the coming weeks broaden its offers step by step.”
The global tourism industry is closely watching trends in China for clues to travel patterns in other major markets once the virus, which has infected 3.44 million people and killed 243,00 worldwide, is under control and curbs on movement ease.
Since April, there have been signs of a recovery in China’s tourism market, and aviation experts expect domestic travel in most markets will recover before international travel.
Travel within China is also complicated by movement curbs retained in some regions, such as Beijing, the capital, to guard against a second wave of infections from aboard.
Joussen urged the EU to put in place a concept that allows for the resumption of holiday travel within the bloc, where border restrictions have been in place since March.
“The EU and its member states should develop a timetable for resuming travel within Europe and make holidays possible in 2020,” he said, citing Greece, Cyprus, Spanish islands, Austria and Bulgaria which have made progress toward reopening resorts.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer ruled out reopening Germany’s border with Austria to holidaymakers in an interview with mass-selling Bild newspaper, citing the risk of a second coronavirus outbreak.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Arabia will take strict and painful measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV, adding that “all options for dealing with the crisis are open”.
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply”, Mr. Jadaan said in comments published on Saturday ahead of the interview’s broadcast. No details of possible measures were given.
The world’s largest oil exporter is suffering from historically low oil prices, while measures to fight the new coronavirus are likely to curb the pace and scale of economic reforms launched by Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia’s central bank foreign exchange reserves fell in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years, hitting their lowest since 2011, while the kingdom slipped to a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenues collapsed.
Mr. Jadaan noted the country had introduced stimulus measures aimed at preserving jobs in the private sector and safeguarding the provision of basic services.
Earlier this week he said Riyadh could borrow around $26 billion more this year and would draw down up to $32 billion from its reserves to finance the deficit.
On Saturday he said withdrawals from the kingdom’s cash reserves this year must not exceed a total of between 110 billion riyals ($29 billion) and 120 billion, as specified in the budget.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Says Real Impact of COVID-19 Expected in Second Quarter of 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIRUT (Sputnik) - The full impact of the coronavirus pandemic will reveal itself in the second quarter of this year, Saudi Arabia’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in an interview with local media.
According to Al-Jadaan, Saudi Arabia is considering a wide range of "strict and painful measures" to cut spending.
Al-Jadaan said that Saudi Arabia, as well as the world as a whole, will not return to what it was like before the coronavirus pandemic and suggested that economic processes will undergo significant changes.
In April, Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said that his country was dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting significant drop in oil revenues from a position of strength, since serious reforms had been carried out in the country in recent years, while also indicating that Saudi Arabia had enough of a buffer to deal with the low prices.
As of 2 May, 3,272,202 people have contracted the novel coronavirus, with over 230,000 fatalities registered, the World Health Organization count shows. According to data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centre, more than 3.4 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed globally since the start of the pandemic in December of last year. The global death toll from the viral disease stands at over 242,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Painful steps ahead to fight economic downturn — Al Jadaan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Ismaeel Naar, Joanne Serrieh and Omar ElkatouriDUBAI — Saudi Arabia is committed to protecting itself from the economic fallout of the coronavirus through any necessary financial measures despite plunging oil revenues, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan told Al Arabiya on Saturday.Earlier this week, the Kingdom reported that its budget had fallen into a $9 billion deficit after oil revenue plunged amid a global oversupply of crude due to the coronavirus pandemic.Despite oil being Saudi Arabia’s largest revenue, the Kingdom maintains significant reserves and has vast untapped borrowing potential.While Al-Jadaan acknowledged that the unprecedented global economic impact of the coronavirus would also hit the Kingdom, he said that it was committed to taking the necessary measure to mitigate the fallout — including reducing expenditure and regulating public finance more.“The Kingdom is committed to the task of sustaining public financing, and is committed to having enough financial strength to face this crisis even if it is prolonged. We have taken several steps both in relation to health, and in relation to financial measures in terms of reducing expenditure.“Right now, we are looking at what we can do to reduce the deficit level. Certainly, there has been a significant drop in revenues, and we will likely see its impact in the coming quarters,” Al-Jadaan said during an exclusive interview with Al Arabiya.'Studying several options'The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) said late on Tuesday foreign assets fell in March to $464 billion, the lowest in 19 years, as the Kingdom moves to combat the economic fallout of the virus.Al-Jadaan said that authorities in Saudi Arabia are currently studying several options aimed at mitigating the damage caused by the coronavirus. The minister added that the drop in both oil and non-oil revenues will be seen further in the coming quarters.“We began the year with oil prices higher than $60 per barrel, these days we’re seeing the numbers near $20. This huge drop leads to a more than 50 percent drop in oil revenues,” he said.Saudi Arabia has implemented various policies to control the spread of the virus, including implementing a lockdown on most of the Kingdom, imposing a curfew to limit public movement and shutting incoming international travel.While important, these measures have also had a negative impact on the non-oil economy, as businesses remain closed and people are told to stay at home.“With non-oil revenues, due to the precautionary measures, they will be dropping as there is a huge reduction in economic activity and as a result, the non-oil revenues will drop.“We must deal with this wisely and efficiently and with God’s will the Kingdom will be looking at several options to face a pandemic the world has never seen the likes of for more than 70 years, since nearly World War II. At a global level, this level of pandemic has never been seen before,” Al-Jadaan said.The minister said last week the Kingdom would limit the amount of money it would take from its reserves to a maximum of $32 billion. Instead, the Kingdom will take advantage of its mostly untapped ability to borrow, and issue $60 billion of debt.“We will continue to take loans, and we have seen a large demand on government debt securities, internally or externally. As per the plan we will take loans up to SR220 billion, as per the conditions in the market and the available liquidity,” he said.Al-Jadaan added that he does not believe the Kingdom, or the world, will return to pre-coronavirus economic conditions, mainly as a result of the pandemic’s impact on economic activities and supply chains globally.'Steps taken will be painful'Discussing Saudi Arabia’s economic challenges, Al-Jadaan said that the Kingdom’s economy still depends greatly on public spending and it will therefore continue to maintain public finance to support the economy in the near future. However, he added that his ministry believes more regulations are needed to sustain the measures.“Public finance needs to be regulated more. The government has worked over the last four to five years on big regulations to regulate public finance and lower the deficit, but we still have a long way to go.“We will reduce expenditure, if God wills, even if some of the steps taken will be painful, but they are for the benefit of everyone, for the benefit of the country and for the benefit of the citizens,” Al-Jadaan said.In order to maintain and sustain public financing, the minister said that the government plans on redirecting some public funds to support the health sector in the coming quarters.“The government must take different measures than it previously has. There must be a limit to spending, redirecting parts of it to providing health services for the nationals and residents, and facing the results of the major shock in returns, whether that’s the result of major limitations on people in terms of restricting movement and economic activities. Therefore, its repercussions on demand of raw materials including petrol and the major drop in prices,” he said.Projects delayedAl-Jadaan explained the Kingdom is currently considering delaying some projects as a result of the impact.“As a result of the precautionary measures, therefore, we will reduce spending on them. Projects, whether major ones or some programs for achieving the (Vision 2030), that are, in their nature, a result of the precautionary measures, require delaying its implementation, therefore reducing the spending,” Al-Jadaan said.The finance minister said the Kingdom is also considering other items to limit spending, provided they do not affect people’s basic services.“We’re also considering other items, as long as we don’t touch basic services for the people, all options are open. And, the government is currently studying the effect of these options and will therefore decide based on it and we will make recommendations soon,” he confirmed. — Al Arabiya English

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi to take 'strict, painful' measures to deal with coronavirus impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RIYADH — Saudi Arabia will take strict and painful measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the finance minister said on Saturday, adding that “all options for dealing with the crisis are open.”
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply,” Mohammed al-Jadaan said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV, adding that the impact of the new coronavirus on Saudi Arabia’s state finances will appear from the second quarter of the year.
“Saudi finances need more discipline and the road ahead is long,” he said.
One measure would be to slow down government projects, including mega-projects, to reduce spending, he said.
The world’s largest oil exporter is suffering from historically low oil prices, while measures to fight the coronavirus are likely to curb the pace and scale of economic reforms launched by Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia’s central bank foreign exchange reserves fell in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years, hitting their lowest level since 2011, while the kingdom slipped to a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenue collapsed.
Jadaan said last month that Riyadh could borrow $26 billion more this year while it would draw down up to $32 billion from its foreign reserves to finance the deficit.
On Saturday Jadaan told Al Arabiya Saudi Arabia had used some revenue from investments to plug the deficit, and that the crisis presented investment opportunities.
Jadaan noted the country had introduced stimulus measures aimed at preserving jobs in the private sector and safeguarding the provision of basic services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia announces 8 coronavirus deaths</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JEDDAH: The economic challenges of the coronavirus pandemic are great and neither Saudi Arabia nor the world will be the same when it is over, the Kingdom’s Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said on Saturday.
Saudi Arabia would take strict and painful measures to deal with the impact, and “all options for dealing with the crisis are open,” the minister said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.
“We must reduce budget expenditures sharply,” Al-Jadaan said, and some government projects may be slowed down to reduce expenditure.
Al-Jadaan said that citizens’ welfare and their benefit is top priority, but that some of the action taken will be “painful, but for everyone’s benefit.”
“Current actions taken to date to cut spending are not enough, and Saudi public finances will need more control and the journey ahead is long.

“Expenses must be reduced to cope with the fallout from coronavirus and we need to be careful not to increase the cost of debt.”
“We are currently reviewing a set of initiatives to support the economy, the private sector and the health sector. Revenues have declined dramatically and are expected to continue to decline over this year and possibly until the beginning of the next fiscal year. Therefore we must be prepared, economically and financially, to confront this pandemic.
“We have to plan for the worst, take matters seriously and shrink … in order to continue providing citizens and expats with services, and manage the government.”
Al-Jadaan said that the Kingdom released economic support packages valuing SAR180 billion ($47.8 billion), but that it had used up SAR1 trillion from its reserves over the past four years.
“The real impact of the coronavirus pandemic will appear in the second quarter, and we have to face a very big revenue shock,” he said.
“We must tighten the belt and come out of the crisis strong.”
The number of virus cases in the Kingdom reached 25,459 on Saturday, an increase of 1,362, and the death toll rose by seven to 176. Worldwide, the virus has infected nearly 3.5 million people, and killed more than 240,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett: 'American magic' will spur US economic recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire investor Warren Buffet said Saturday he's confident the US economy will bounce back from its pummeling by the coronavirus pandemic because "American magic has always prevailed".
The 89-year-old made the sanguine prediction about the world's largest economy as his holding company Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter net losses of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett also announced Saturday that his company had sold all its stakes in four major US airlines last month, as the pandemic clobbered the travel industry.
"It turns out I was wrong," he said of his acquisitions of 10 percent stakes in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
Berkshire Hathaway had paid $7 billion to $8 billion, and "we did not take out anything like that," he said.
Between the purchases that took place over months, and the sale, "the airlines business I think changed in a very major way" and could no longer meet Berkshire criteria for profitability, he said.
Buffett's announcement may further hurt airlines already pushed to the brink by coronavirus lockdown measures, now looking to the US government for $25 billion in relief funds.
'American miracles, American magic'
Berkshire Hathaway, based in Omaha, Nebraska, called its first-quarter setback "temporary" but said it could not reliably predict when its many businesses would return to normal or when consumers would resume their former buying habits.
"We've faced great problems in the past, haven't faced this exact problem -- in fact we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem," Buffett said in a lengthy speech on the country's economic history.
"But we faced tougher problems, and the American miracles, American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again." 
"We are now a better country, as well as an incredibly more wealthy country, than we were in 1789... We got a long ways to go but we moved in the right direction," he said, referencing the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage.
"Never bet against America."
Buffett is considered one of the savviest investors anywhere. His fortune of $72 billion is the fourth-largest in the world, according to Forbes, and in normal years, the company's annual gathering in Omaha is a high-point of the calendar for investors, a "Woodstock for capitalists."
But the devastating economic impact of the pandemic has hit hard at Berkshire Hathaway's wide range of investments, and the need for social distancing forced it to hold the annual meeting online.
Buffett addressed his shareholders in a livestream flanked only by Gregory Abel, who is in charge of Berkshire's non-insurance operations. 
His business partner for six decades, 96-year-old Charlie Munger, did not appear.
Growth by one measure
Buffett, in a statement, played down his company's bleak-looking net figure. He said a better measure of the company's performance was its operating earnings, which exclude investments and are less subject to sharp fluctuations.
By that measure, Berkshire Hathaway saw growth to $5.9 billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier. 
The brutal drop in the net -- to a loss of $49.75 billion from a profit last year of $21.7 billion -- resulted primarily from the virus-related decline in value of its broad investment portfolio, which ranges from energy to transport to insurance and technology.
The annual meeting often has an almost carnival atmosphere, as thousands of fans and investors flock to Nebraska to hear from the celebrated "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett, famous for his relatively modest lifestyle, turns 90 on August 30.
In documents filed Saturday, Berkshire noted that until mid-March many of its companies were posting "comparative revenue and earnings increases" over the same 2019 period.
Many of its companies -- including in rail transport, energy production and some manufacturing and service businesses -- are deemed essential and are able to continue working amid the far-reaching confinement orders.
But their turnover slowed considerably in April, the company statement said.
Moves taken by those companies such as employee furloughs, salary cuts and reductions, and capital spending reductions are "necessary actions" and "temporary," it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett says Berkshire have sold ALL $4bn of its airline stocks because of the effect of the coronavirus, but tells investors they should still 'bet on America'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway has sold all its airline stocks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but Warren Buffett is telling investors they should still 'bet on America'.
The billionaire investor revealed the conglomerate has offloaded the entirety of its stocks in the US airline industry, waving goodbye to shares in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines, during the firm's annual shareholder meeting Saturday. 
In the same meeting, Buffett urged investors to hold onto stocks in businesses they like and to 'never bet against America' despite the mounting concerns over the long-term impact the virus is wreaking on the economy.
More than 30 million Americans have lost their jobs since the outbreak began and gross domestic product plummeted 4.8 percent in the first quarter alone, officially plunging the US into its first recession since 2008.  
The airline industry has been one of the hardest-hit by the pandemic as borders closed, the federal government banned flights to and from some nations and stay-at-home orders have left the few planes still operating empty of passengers. 
Buffett confirmed Berkshire has sold its roughly 10 percent stake in the four largest airlines because the 'world has changed' for the industry. 
Back in December, Berkshire owned upwards of $4 billion in airline stocks including 42.5 million or a 10 percent stake in American, 58.9 million or a 9.2 percent stake in Delta, 51.3 million or a 10.1 percent stake in Southwest and 21.9 million or a 7.6 percent stake in United. 
'The world has changed for the airlines. And I don't know how it's changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,' he said during Saturday's meeting, often dubbed Woodstock for Capitalists, which was held virtually.  
'I don't know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.'
The chairman and CEO warned that the current downturn could have an impact on consumer travel habits going on far longer than the virus itself.  
'I think there are certain industries, and unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, that are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events that are far beyond our control,' he said. 
'I don't know whether two or three years from now, that as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year ...The future is much less clear to me about how the business will turn out through absolutely no fault of the airlines themselves.''
Berkshire has sold the entirety of its stake because the company doesn't like to simply 'trim positions'. 
'When we sell something, very often it's going to be our entire stake: We don't trim positions. That's just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We're going to sell it down to 90% or 80%,' he said.
'If we like a business, we're going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can. And when we change our mind we don't take half measures.'
Buffett went on to say that he likes the airlines, but that sometimes there are events 'on the lower levels of probabilities that happen' like the pandemic that mean investors need to change tact.
However, the financial guru offered up somewhat contradictory advice as he recommended investors hold onto stocks they like and continue to 'bet on America'. 
'If you owned the businesses that you liked prior to the virus arriving... nobody's forcing you to sell,' he said. 
'Stocks have an enormous advantage and... if you bet on America, and sustain that position for decades, you're going to do better than, in my view far better than, owning treasuries securities.'  
Buffett said it is difficult to predict when and how the economy will recover as the US comes out of the other side of the crisis, but said investors should 'never bet against America'. 
'We do not know exactly what happens when you voluntarily shut down a substantial portion of your society,'' he said.
He said in the last recession of 2008 'our economic train went off the tracks... This time we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on its siding.'' 
'We may not know the answers to some very important questions for many years,'' he said.
But he urged investors to 'never bet against America and that in my view is as true today at it was in 1789, and even was true during the Civil War and the depths of the Depression.'
The stock market has been spirallng downward amid the pandemic, as businesses across many industries have taken a dramatic hit.  
Last month, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned investors to get ready for a 'vicious spiral' twice as worse as that seen in the 2008 global financial crisis.
For airlines, a decade-long hot streak where the big players together earned tens of billions of dollars, bought new planes and hired thousands more workers was wiped out in a matter of weeks, when the pandemic ramped up. 
Government flight restrictions and border closures aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus ravaged the industry. 
Planes have been pictured abandoned on runways as airlines cut thousands of flights, planes that do take off have barely anyone on board and thousands of staff have been laid off or furloughed to try to keep the industry afloat.
American, United, Southwest and Delta all reported their first losses in years last month.
The major players reached an agreement with the US Treasury in April for $25 billion in government aid to pay workers and avoid massive layoffs. 
But Buffett's own businesses haven't been immune to the pandemic either.
His comments came the same day Berkshire Hathaway reported nearly $50 billion in losses in the first quarter, marking the greatest loss the company has ever suffered throughout its history. 
The conglomerate said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing 'relatively minor to severe' negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed 'essential'.
The conglomerate – which owns companies including Geico auto insurance, Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, Dairy Queen and Duracel - said in a regulatory filing Saturday morning that before the coronavirus outbreak in mid-March many of its businesses were posting revenue and earnings increases compared to year ago. 
However, the pandemic has led the BNSF railroad's shipping of consumer products and coal to fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. 
Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See's Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What can you do in six minutes? Drink a cup of tea, reply to an email, hang up the laundry . . . Well, what if I told you that you could bake an entire cake from scratch? Or whip up a showstopping dessert for family teatime?
Six minutes might not sound long, but it's just enough time to open up a world of delicious possibilities — if you know how.
Few things compare to the satisfaction of baking a mouth-watering cake and serving it to your loved ones. Or taking time out from the frustrations of working from home to make a decadent dessert to lift your spirits. These rituals don't just feed our bodies, they feed the soul. At least, that's how I see it.
In these not-so-ordinary times, perhaps it's not surprising that we are turning to baking for comfort — but that doesn't mean we want to spend hours on it.
After my first book, Three Ingredient Baking, came out in 2018 and led to my Inspire column, many readers said the same thing: they wanted more 'ad break' bakes — the type of thing you can rustle up in the breaks of your favourite TV show. And not just basic biscuits, but creations with real wow-factor.
So here's proof, I hope, that baking doesn't have to be time-consuming, stressful or expensive. It can be simple, speedy — and stunning.
I've tested (and eaten, in vast quantities) each one of these recipes — and I promise you two things.
First, they're all showstoppers. I've designed each to impress, and the results should make them look far more complicated and time-consuming than they really are.
Second, they really do all take six minutes (or less) to make.
Perhaps counter-intuitively, the idea is not to time yourself, though. Sure, you can set a Ready Steady Cook-style challenge and race your friends, if that's what floats your boat. If you do, I stick by the six-minute guarantee. But, at least the first time you make these dishes, there's no need to rush.
Read through to the end of the recipe — some of them require a bit of additional chilling or freezing — and follow the 'prep' steps to the letter, weighing your ingredients, maybe chopping or peeling, pre-heating where needed and making sure you've got the right utensils to hand.
A note here: it's the methods that take six minutes, not prepping your ingredients and kit. Next time around, you can do it faster. I hope it'll help you put the fun — and a bit of magic — back into baking. Because that's what it's all about.
Forget the timing, forget the fact you're creating a showstopper. The whole point of these recipes is to encourage you to bake — and to enjoy yourself in the process.
So dig your hands in, get your fingers sticky and your apron messy —and do it all with a smile on your face. Ready, set, bake!
MAKES 4
START THE CLOCK: Arrange the blackberries in the base of your serving dishes (I use champagne saucers) and put them in the fridge to chill. This speeds up the setting process. Then, put the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water to soften them.
Meanwhile, heat the sloe gin and sugar in a small saucepan over a low heat. Once the sugar has dissolved, take the pan off the heat. Squeeze any excess water out of the gelatine leaves and add these to the gin mixture. Stir to dissolve. Add the soda water and cranberry juice and mix well.
Decant the jelly into the serving dishes (don’t worry if the blackberries float to the top) and dust the tops with edible glitter.
Put them in the fridge to set for at least 3 hours. Serve with shortbread on the side (trust me, you won’t need any more gin). They’ll keep for 4 to 5 days in the fridge.
SERVES 8
START THE CLOCK: Put 110g of the chocolate in a Pyrex bowl and melt it in the microwave on high in 20-second bursts.
Meanwhile, crush the digestives to crumbs by blitzing them in a food processor (or you can put them in a bag and bash them with a rolling pin).
Mix the melted chocolate with the biscuit crumbs and transfer the mixture to a greased dish, using the back of a spoon to press it down firmly into the base and up against the sides.
Spread the caramel sauce over the base and arrange banana slices on top.
Whisk milk into the butterscotch powder for a minute or so until it thickens, and then spread this over the top of the banoffee mixture.
Grate the remaining 10g of chocolate and sprinkle over the top of pudding. Put it in the fridge to set for at least half an hour before serving.
It will last for 2 to 3 days if you keep it chilled.
SERVES 6
PREP: Cut a circle of kitchen roll to around the same size as the rotating plate in your microwave. This is the base on which your pavlova will bake.
START THE CLOCK: Sieve icing sugar into a bowl and mix in the egg white. It should come together into a firm ball.
Place it on the circle of kitchen roll in the microwave and flatten it slightly to a diameter of no more than 8cm (it will spread). Microwave on high for 3 minutes. Keep an eye on it as you move on to the next steps, as the sugar can burn quickly.
Take the berries out of the freezer. Tip the cream into a large bowl and whisk it by hand until it forms soft peaks (this shouldn’t take more than 1 minute). Once it’s at the right consistency, stir in 30g of the desiccated coconut and half the mixed berries.
Carefully slide the pavlova base out of the microwave and on to your serving plate. Allow it to cool slightly before topping with the cream and the rest of frosted berries. Scatter the remaining desiccated coconut over the top.
Serve at once: the microwaved meringue is brittle and won’t keep well, so you have to eat it all in one go!
TIP: You can try all sorts of combinations with the cream and fruit. Whip in some cocoa powder instead of coconut, or top with sliced apricots and honey, or fresh mango, passion fruit and lime zest.
MAKES 12
START THE CLOCK: Beat the butter and sugar together using a whisk. In a separate bowl, loosely beat the eggs with the Pimm’s and citrus zest.
Add half the egg mixture to the butter and sugar, along with half the flour, and fully combine. Then add the other half.
Divide half of the batter between six cupcake cases, spaced out on a microwave-proof plate. Don’t fill them too much (a heaped tablespoon in each is enough) or they’ll overflow as they bake.
Microwave for 2 minutes on high, then repeat with the other six. The cakes should rise in domes to the tops of the cases and turn golden when they’re done.
While the cupcakes bake, make the icing. Whisk the butter, icing sugar and Pimm’s together to make a light, fluffy buttercream. Once the cakes are cool, pipe mounds on top of each and finish with half a strawberry and a sprig of mint.
Serve immediately — with a tall glass of Pimm’s (you don’t want any going to waste, after all). The cakes will keep for 2 to 3 days in an airtight container.
PREP: Grease a 20cm-round, microwave-proof cake dish with butter and line the base with greaseproof paper.
START THE CLOCK: Mix the cocoa powder and coffee together in a small bowl and add 100ml boiling water. Stir vigorously until dissolved.
In a separate bowl, mix the flour and sugar. Add the coffee mixture, followed by the milk, oil, egg and vanilla extract. Beat to combine.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake dish and microwave on high for 4 to 5 minutes, checking throughout. You’ll know it’s ready when it’s risen and spongey (not wet) on top.
While the cake bakes, make the icing.
In a small bowl, add a splash of water to the teaspoon of instant coffee and mix to make a paste. Stir in the icing sugar, a little at a time, adding more water if you need to, until you have a smooth paste roughly the texture of thick cream.
When the cake is baked, carefully tip it out on to a cooling rack and immediately spread the icing over the top (or drizzle). You may want to put a plate underneath the rack as this bit can get messy.
If you like, sprinkle chopped walnuts, pecans or coffee beans around the edge of the cake for a pretty finish — do this before the icing sets so they stick.
You can serve it hot and gooey, as a stodgy pudding with ice cream, or wait until it cools and eat a slice with a cup of tea.
The cake will keep for 3 to4 days in an airtight tin.
TIP: A silicone cake mould tends to be best for this recipe, as it makes it easier to get the cake out without burning your hands.
If it is sticking, simply run a blunt knife around the inside edge to loosen it.
SERVES 8-10
PREP: Preheat oven to 250c/fan 230c/gas 9 and cover a baking sheet with tin foil.
START THE CLOCK: Combine a tablespoon of icing sugar with the melted butter and brush over the tortillas. Using scissors, cut them into eight triangles (like slices of pizza). Arrange on the baking sheet, butter side up, making sure there are no overlaps. Then bake on the top shelf for 5 minutes. Whisk 90g melted chocolate into the mascarpone and sieve in the remainder of the icing sugar. You should end up with a thick, smooth consistency.
Take a small handful of the prepared strawberries (40g to 50g) and purée them — either with a hand blender or by squishing them through a sieve with a fork. Mix in the honey to make a coulis.
Remove the nachos from the oven. If they still seem a little soft, they will crisp up as they cool. Arrange on a platter and top with dollops of cheesecake mix and swirls of coulis. Scatter strawberries and grate the remaining chocolate over the top.
This won’t keep for more than a day! If you want to serve it later, keep the nachos in an airtight tin and everything else in the fridge, and assemble when you’re ready.

    <h5 class="mb-1">7 Ways to Support Small Businesses During the Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Imagine commuting to work without stopping by your favorite coffee shop — you know, the one where the barista knows your name and is making your vanilla oat milk latte as soon as you walk in the door? Or what about never getting to browse the bestsellers at your favorite indie bookstore — you know, the one that always makes you feel warm and cozy and nostalgic for a simpler time?
As we've all come to realize these last few weeks, it's easy to take for granted the small businesses that bring us so much joy. We never had to think twice before swinging by our go-to bagel spot, picking up fresh flowers at the farmer's market, or catching a last-minute class at our cycling studio.
Without our local shops, cafes, and restaurants, not only does our economy suffer, but so do our communities. Because, despite our current reality of being inside, home is so much more than our actual living spaces. Home is the diner where we spontaneously meet up for Sunday brunch. Home is the corner bodega where we get our late-night groceries. Home is the rooftop bar where we celebrate anything at all.
Small businesses give life to our cities, and right now they need our help more than ever. Here are some ways you can support your local community during this trying time.
Although the majority of restaurants and eateries in the United States have had no choice but to temporarily shut down regular operations in the midst of the pandemic, many are still offering takeout and delivery. Turn a usual takeout dinner into something a little more fun by exploring different cuisines. Order Thai one night and go for tacos the next. Pair your meals with some music or an on-theme movie.
Nothing makes or breaks the success of a small business more than online reviews. Think back to any recent services you paid for. Whether it was a relaxing stay at an Airbnb, a memorable dinner date, or a stellar haircut, take a moment to write a genuine, glowing review. It will make a difference not only by attracting new customers, but by strengthening the credibility of the brand. With only your words, you can help a business owner in a huge way — how cool is that?
We can't all be famous influencers, but that doesn't mean we can't use our social media platforms for good. Use your voice and creativity to share a positive experience you've had with a local business. That might mean making the effort to get the perfect shot of your almond croissant from the nearby bakery. Or it could be just the excuse to post the best pictures from your wedding album and give a shout-out to your photographer. Just don't forget to @ them!
Even during such uncertain times, one thing is for sure: there will still be birthdays, holidays, and happy moments worth celebrating. Be one step ahead of the upcoming occasions by shopping online for special gifts. When you order that gorgeous ceramic dish for your friend's fall wedding or that handcrafted necklace for Mother's Day, you'll be supporting the small stores that depend on each and every sale.
In the age of social distancing, our usual exercise routines are looking a little different — especially for those of us cooped up in tiny apartments. But lucky for us, many gyms and studios are now shifting to virtual classes. Whether you join a free Instagram Live class or choose to pay for an online subscription, you'll be helping your favorite fitness companies stay in business and remain relevant during these unprecedented times.
Is there ever a bad time to treat yourself? No way. But right now, our self-care is happening strictly at home. Why not splurge on a gift card for future indulging? In a few months, you could be enjoying a facial, a massage, or a brand-new outfit. It's always nice to have something to look forward to, and your local business will be grateful.
Behind all of our favorite places are people — people with dreams of sharing their craft and passion with all of us. And right now, those dreams are in jeopardy. As a society, we're collectively feeling overwhelmed, but a little kindness, whether in the form of a smile, a "thank you," or yes, a good tip, goes a long way. When we all do our part in supporting our communities, not only will we survive this — but we'll come out even stronger in the end.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google's original Home smart speaker is on sale for $30</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s quite common to see deals on smart speakers, but they’re not often as tempting as this one. Best Buy is selling the original Google Home for just $30, or less than a third of its official $100 price. That’s better than the $50 from not long ago, and puts it at the same price that you’d currently pay for the considerably less capable Nest Mini. You can find the speaker for ever-so-slightly less at the Google Store if you’d rather go direct.
Buy Google Home on Best Buy - $30
Buy Google Home on Google Store - $29
The Home’s design may seem a bit old compared to newer Google smart speakers, but it’s still capable. It should sound better overall than the Nest Mini, and its customizable base lets you match it to your decor. Apart from that, the Home shares many things in common with more recent counterparts. Google Assistant remains a powerful AI helper that has improved over time (particularly for smart home integration), and it’s still a good choice if you like to cast audio from Google-friendly services. You won’t get stunning audio quality or a display, but at $30 it’s a better value than just about anything else in Google’s lineup — and rival speakers like Amazon’s Echo, for that matter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The best deal you'll see today is the Google Home for an insanely low $29 everywhere</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sure, the Google Home smart speaker has been around for a while at this point, but it is Google's quintessential smart speaker. It all started with the Home. Now you can get it for the same price as the Mini version! The Google Home is down to $29 at several retailers including Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and more. You can even find it this low at Google. Most of these retailers require at least $35 in the cart for free shipping, so you're going to pay an extra $5 to $7 unless you can order it for in-store pickup (or order more than one).
This deal price is honestly shocking considering we shared a deal just a couple days ago where it was down to $47, and we thought that was pretty good. I can't imagine this will last long and it looks like some places are already selling out. Get it while you can.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The world's oldest central bank hits legal roadblock in economic crisis fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden's central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it's to act on a pledge to do "whatever it takes" to save the economy.
The Riksbank's 352-year history gives it the distinction of being the world's oldest central bank. But the legislation governing it has yet to catch up with the kind of policy it needs to deliver to address the crisis triggered by COVID-19.
Specifically, the Riksbank doesn't have the legal right to buy bonds issued by companies, even though it's made clear it's ready to do so as part of a recent package of emergency measures.
"The intention of the current Riksbank Act doesn't allow the bank to make outright purchases of corporate bonds or other private securities on the primary or secondary markets," said Niklas Schullerqvist, secretary to the parliamentary committee charged with overhauling the bank's policy framework.
So far the Stockholm-based central bank has bought 5.6 billion kronor ($890 million) of corporate commercial paper as part of an emergency quantitative-easing plan. But it's refrained from buying corporate bonds - an important source of financing in the biggest Nordic economy - despite repeated assurances it will so.
Schullerqvist says the Riksbank needs to consider European Union legislation on state aid as corporate bond purchases "may be considered supporting some specific parts of the economy."
Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank's legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn't comment further because "it's an ongoing process."
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are "certainly on our agenda." He also said "there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market."
Sweden's primary bond market is a vital source of funding for the country's businesses. And with record-low borrowing costs and a growing investor base flush with cash, the market's growth has increasingly shaped Sweden's economy.
But the market has been turned on its head since the COVID-19 crisis hit. Investors panicked and tried to redeem their cash, prompting 35 fixed-income funds to shut their doors. Even so, clients withdrew record quantities of cash and a spike in yields locked out all but a handful of top rated borrowers.
In April, Sweden's syndicated public bond market only saw corporate issuance from investment-grade companies such as Volvo, Industrivarden and Scania, as well as state-owned entities including Jernhusen, Akademiska Hus and Sveaskog.
The crisis that's hit Sweden's corporate bond market has drawn pleas from the investor community for the Riksbank to intervene before it's too late.
The Riksbank "should support new money rather than being very active in the secondary market," said Daniel Sachs, chief executive at credit manager Proventus Capital Management AB.
Magnus Nilsson, founding partner of Nordic Cross Asset Management, says that a "first step" toward making it easier for struggling businesses to access funding "would be for the Riksbank to get involved in the primary market for investment grade bonds."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sweden’s central bank may need to have some of its age-old laws changed if it’s to act on a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to save the economy.

Riksbank spokesman Tomas Lundberg said the bank’s legal team is looking into the matter, but wouldn’t comment further because “it’s an ongoing process.”
Meanwhile, a proposal due to be voted on by lawmakers may strip Sweden’s central bank of its right to do any form of quantitative easing beyond the purchase of government bonds.
According to the bank, “The proposed bill limits the Riksbank’s capacity to act, for instance by not allowing the Riksbank to purchase other securities than government papers, unless there are special reasons, or making lending to the banks conditional on them increasing their lending to companies. If this bill had applied now during the coronavirus pandemic, it would have limited the Riksbank’s monetary policy toolbox and it would have been unclear what the Riksbank was allowed to do.”
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said purchases of investment-grade bonds are “certainly on our agenda.” He also said “there are some legal issues when it comes to buying into the primary market.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Economic repairmen limited to six areas only</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ISLAMABAD  : A team of financial gurus formed by the prime minister to come up with solutions for injecting some life into the country’s economy and offset the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has decided to limit its advisory role to only six areas and shift its focus away from macroeconomic issues.
Adviser to the PM on Finance Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh on Sunday chaired the third meeting of the government-led ‘Thinktank’ where the participants selected six broad priority domains.
“[These areas include] boosting social safety nets (Ehsas and allied initiatives), food security and safety of supply chains, enhancing the role of banks and financial institutions in appropriately designing incentives for market participants, kick-starting low and medium cost housing projects, making the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and the provincial Annual Development Programmes (ADPs) responsive to labour intensive propositions and business facilitation through fiscal interventions,” read a statement issued by the finance ministry.
Unlike the handout issued after the previous meeting, the ministry was silent on the issue of monetary policy. There was also no mention of inflation that fell to single-digit level in April, creating room for a further interest rate cut.
During the second meeting, some members of the Thinktank had called for further slashing the interest rate to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
According to the finance Ministry, the forum decided that fiscal proposals including changes in the rates of sales tax, refunds, etc. would be deliberated upon in detail with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) so that the next federal budget could address these burning concerns which were essential to spur consumer spending.
Moreover, the Thinktank will also take up proposals related to financial and banking matters including review of payroll refinancing scheme, incentives to banks to finance MFIs and MFB, measures for enhancement of remittances and injecting additional liquidity to commercial banks by cutting CRR/SLR and CCB.
“The Thinktank has devised an ‘Impact and Urgency Response Matrix’ by identifying multiple actionable themes with low, medium and high economic impacts pitched against short-, medium- and long-time horizons,” the statement read.
“The participants discussed the evolving economic scenario and identified priority areas which carry the potential of giving maximum boost to economy through accelerating the aggregate demand and easing supply concerns while also ensuring stability of financial system which is equally critical in robust recovery of the economy.”
The finance adviser emphasised the need for evolving a roadmap for the chosen domains, thereby bringing clarity about what needs to be done and who will do it. The need for real-time data and research was highlighted in development of a clear roadmap and implementation framework.
Dr Shaikh concluded the session with the consensus decision that detailed roadmaps for the six domains would be prepared so that respective ministries could be engaged to create further value in ongoing plans meant for boosting the economy.
It was further decided that the implementation review of the PM’s Rs1.24 trillion economic stimulus package would be a regular feature in the next Thinktank meetings to ensure value for money apart as well as smooth service delivery to the deserving segments of society.
The forum has the mandate to provide cognitive support to ongoing response of the federal government apart from extending help in designing new initiatives and mid-course correction of interventions already under execution.
The forum comprises eminent public finance practitioners, financial analysts, bankers, development and monetary economists and academia. They include Dr Ishrat Husain, Shaukat Tareen, Dr Ijaz Nabi, Sultan Ali Allana, Arif Habib, Dr Waqar Masood, the PM’s commerce adviser and the finance secretary.
The finance adviser engaged all participants in extensive deliberations, while defining that the focus of the forum would remain on short-term measures urgently needed to boost the economy which was under acute stress due to both demand and supply compression.
He emphasised the need to learn from international experience in designing fiscal, monetary and other policy responses by the federal as well as provincial governments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FICCI seeks infrastructure status for lockdown-hit steel sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Industry body Ficci has suggested various measures like infrastructure status to the steel industry, zero duty on critical raw materials, and another three-month moratorium to revive the sector, which has been impacted by the lockdown.
COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent nationwide lockdown have affected the demand and production of steel, as well as resulted in the rise of inventory levels, it said, adding the policy interventions would help the industry to revive and help generate employment opportunities.
In its suggestions to the government, Ficci said: "It recommends for an extension of additional three months moratorium granted on payment of interest and repayment of loans without any penal interest and interest free financing/at nominal rates for MSMEs in the sector to revive".
Granting infrastructure status to the steel industry, it said, will give access to finance at competitive rates from various markets and sources.
Besides, the entire supply chain of the sector should be incorporated into essential services, and be allowed to operate with precautionary measures as per the guidelines of the government.
The industry body also suggested zero import duty on critical raw materials for steel making.
The move will help players to reduce input cost and sustain in the market.
Fast tracking operationalisation of all steel consuming industries should be accorded the highest priority, the body said, adding new areas of applications for steel products like in furniture, setting railway infrastructure etc must be explored to further enhance the demand.
"To further reduce financial burden on the sector, Ficci recommends for deferment of royalty, DMF (District Mineral Fund) and NMET (National Mineral Exploration Trust) by 6 months till the economic situation stabilises and subsuming of all levies like royalty, DMF, NMET etc. into one tax like GST," the industry body said.
Other suggestions included to subsidise railway freight by additional 15 per cent for next six months, waiving off charges like container detention and demurrage charges, ground rent by custodians till end of May 2020 to reduce the financial burden on the industry, priority in rake allocation for transportation of raw material and steel products for next 6 months.
It also said that all statutory clearances like mineral license, environment clearance, and consent to operate etc, that are pending for renewals, should be deemed granted for at least one year, in view of the nationwide lockdown.
It has requested the government to facilitate the movement of migrant workers from their native places to plants by providing special sanitised wagons and financial support to the workers for commuting.
The body also raised concerns that India could see a surge in imports post lockdown as many countries would try to dump in their products into local market.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Modi Meets Ministers to Finalize Steps to Revive Indian Economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed ways to increase liquidity and credit to businesses, infrastructure and farming sectors to restart Asia’s third-largest economy, which is reeling under the impact of the world’s toughest lockdown.
In a meeting with senior ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and other key government officials on May 2, Modi discussed strategies and interventions to support small businesses and farmers as the country prepares to allow some activity to revive the economy. Talks revolved around enhancing liquidity and strengthening credit flows for a quick recovery after the country was shut towards the end of March to check the spread of Covid-19, according to a statement posted on Twitter.
Prime Minister Modi announced a total lockdown on March 24, shutting all but essential goods and services. That halted manufacturing and wiped out consumption, the backbone of the economy which is heading for it first contraction in more than four decades. The government has extended the stay-at-home orders for another two weeks from May 4 but eased restrictions in some areas to restart economic activity.
Revival of the infrastructure sector and speedier implementation of construction projects that involve large scale employment were examined, the statement added. The government is considering a proposal to guarantee as much as 3 trillion rupees ($40 billion) of loans to small businesses, people familiar with the matter said last month.
India’s central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das met chief executive officers of the nation’s banks on May 2 to discuss ways to ensure credit flow to businesses once the lockdown order ends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi chairs meet to discuss agriculture sector reforms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the government prepares to rejuvenate the economy by easing the lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a meeting to take stock of reforms in the agriculture sector and discussed various measures, including development of ‘e-NAM into a platform of platforms’ to enable e-commerce and creation of commodity-specific boards or councils to boost agricultural exports.
The high-level meeting, also attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, deliberated on the “pros and cons” of bio-technological developments in agriculture.
The meeting comes at a time when reforms in the agriculture sector remain stuck. In July last year, the government constituted a nine-member high-powered committee of Chief Ministers with then Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis being appointed as convenor. The committee was supposed to submit its report within two months but it managed to do so only much later — the recommendations are yet to be made public.
“PM Narendra Modi held a meeting today to deliberate on the issues and reforms required in the agriculture sector. Special emphasis was given on reforms in agriculture marketing, management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of statute,” the PMO said in a statement.
“The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development,” said statement.
In a series of meetings this week, the Prime Minister has already reviewed several sectors such as power, education, civil aviation, defence, aerospace, coal and mining; and discussed strategies for boosting investment.
The PMO stated, “Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure fairest returns to farmers were some of the important areas covered. Developing e-NAM into a platform of platforms to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics.
Discussion also emanated on the possibilities of uniform statutory framework to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in agrarian economy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi Holds Meeting With Key Ministers; Next Economic Package Targeting Most Affected Sectors Soon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held a series of meetings with key ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and top officials of the government to finalise the second economic package targeted at sectors most affected by the lockdown to check Covid-19 spread.
The meetings involving Shah, Sitharaman and other officials of the key economic ministries are taking place for the last few days and the idea is to get inputs on the impact of the current lockdown on different segments of the economy and identify immediate measures that may be required as a relief and revival strategy, sources privy to the developments said.
As part of this effort, Modi had met Shah, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri on Friday (1May). The meeting was also attended by Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba and the Principal Secretary to the PM.
Meetings were also held with commerce and MSME ministries on Thursday. On Saturday, the Prime Minister had a review meeting with the Agriculture Ministry to deliberate on the issues and reforms related to the farm sector.
With the government permitting various economic activities to start from May 4 by dividing the country into red, orange and green zones, the immediate concern is to support specific sectors through a package, so that businesses regain lost ground and economic activities gradually return back to normal. The government is also looking at giving a boost to the investment climate through a series of reform initiatives.
Sources said that the government may take a phased approach in this regard the next set of stimulus may have a clear focus on the concerns of the SME segments which have been hit hard due to the Covid-19 outbreak and resultant nationwide lockdown. Revival of small businesses is a key concern for the government.
The Finance Ministry has suggested to the PMO to set up a dedicated fund for micro, small and medium enterprises that could be used to provide both interest free loans to identified industries as well as capital support required to bring enterprises back in business after the lockdown. The size of the fund would be large to extend help to a large number of entities.
The MSME fund may also be used to provide interest subvention on loans taken by the sector to reduce their burden and allow some of these labour intensive segments to operate smoothly.
"The contours of the package are being finalised, and the actual timing of the announcement is still to be worked out. But it would be done soon," said an official source.
Though the next set of package from the government to fight the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to be much wider to cover the concerns of the India Inc., particularly the worst-hit travel and tourism, hospitality and aviation sectors, sources said that the government may adopt a phased approach to see that only such measures that immediately benefit a sector during the lockdown are announced first before looking at measures to bring the economy back on track after the lockdown.
While talks with the stakeholders have taken place in different sectors and their needs have been analysed by the Finance Ministry, it is felt that the MSMEs have been hit hard at different levels and need support immediately.
There is wide speculation that the next economic stimulus package could be bigger than the Rs 1,70,000 crore worth of schemes announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in late March, focusing on providing food security to the poor and giving money in their hands to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.
There is also a suggestion to involve five to six big corporate houses in the production of key items of consumption for the masses so that the country doesn't face shortages once demand picks up. This could be done by providing direct linkages of farmers with corporate entities so that key food produce reaches the factories for processing and production.
While announcing the last package, Sitharaman had indicated that concerns of the India Inc. and SME segments and other sectors of the economy impacted by the present lockdown may be looked at and the government would come up with a plan later.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday discussed ways to reform the agriculture sector with an emphasis on marketing, farmers’ access to institutional credit and freeing the sector from restrictions with legal backing.
Full coverage on coronavirus
The government has maintained that the farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19, and the lockdown will not have much impact on its growth in the current financial year, unlike other sectors.
The pros and cons of biotechnological developments in crops or productivity enhancement and reduction in input costs were also deliberated, an official statement said.
The meeting discussed strategic interventions in the marketing ecosystem and reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development. Concessional credit flow to strengthen infrastructure, a special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) beneficiaries and facilitating inter- and intra-State trade of agriculture produce to ensure the fairest return to farmers were some of the other important areas covered, the statement said.

Developing eNAM or the National Agriculture Market (NAM) into a “platform of platforms” to facilitate e-commerce was among the important topics of the meeting. Also discussed was a uniform statutory framework to create new ways of farming, which will infuse capital and technology into the agrarian economy.
The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016, and protecting the interests of small and marginal farmers were discussed at the meeting attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

The meeting also discussed ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with the present times so as to incentivise largescale private investment in post-production infrastructure.
Developing ‘Brand India’, creation of commodity-specific boards/ councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract-farming were some of the interventions that were discussed to boost exports.

The use of technology in agriculture is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.
Mr. Modi underscored the importance of the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain.
The meeting decided to further strengthen the role of Farmer Producer Organisations to make the agrarian economy vibrant and agriculture trade transparent and to create the maximum benefits to farmers. The overall emphasis was on revisiting the laws governing the market for better price realisation and allowing farmers the freedom of choice, the statement said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In PM’s push for farm reforms, a role for Kisan credit cards, PM-KISAN scheme</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a meeting with ministers and government officials to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector in India as the country looks to rebound from the economic setback dealt by coronavirus outbreak.
The government’s focus is on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system for the farm sector and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.
A government release said that this would be achieved by further strengthening Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and by developing ‘Brand India’ in the sector that would contribute to boosting agricultural exports.
“PM Narendra Modi holds a meeting to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector; emphasises on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain,” said a release by the government.
The prime minister has been stressing on boosting exports to aid economic growth.
The meeting also discussed ways to make several government instruments for the sector including the Kisan Credit Cards, PM-KISAN and e-Nam even more effective and increase their contribution to farmer welfare.
Kisan Credit Cards offer short-term credit limits for crops and term loans to holders by participating banks including cooperatives. This initiative grants farmers access to formal banking networks. KCC credit cardholders are also eligible for personal accident insurance for death and permanent disability.
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a scheme started by the Narendra Modi government in 2018 that provides income support of Rs.6000/- per year to all farmer families across the country. The sum is paid in three equal installments of Rs.2000/- each every four months.
National Agriculture Market or eNAM is another initiative to modernize the farming sector with a tool that helps farmers in discovering the best price for their produce. It (eNAM) is an online trading platform for agricultural commodities that brings farmers, traders and buyers at one place.
Saturday’s meeting, which also discussed ways to invigorate the agriculture sector with modern technology, comes in the backdrop of appeals by the prime minister for self-reliance in a post-coronavirus world and for attracting foreign investments by offering a favourable environment aided by government policy, infrastructural and technological advancement.
India readies to enter the third phase of nationwide lockdown from May 4, which will see a graded resumption of economic activities across the country. The government has given total exemptions to the agriculture sector in all zones.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid coronavirus-induced lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday deliberated on ways to reform the agriculture sector with emphasis on agriculture marketing, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of laws. Agriculture accounts for 15 per cent of India's gross domestic product and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the country's 1.3 billion population.
The government has maintained that the country's farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the Covid-19 lockdown and there will not be much impact on its growth in the current fiscal, unlike other sectors.
The pros and cons of bio-technological developments in crops or enhancement of productivity and reduction in input costs was also deliberated, an official statement said.
The meeting also focused on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.
Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure fairest return to farmers were some of the other important areas covered, the statement said.
Developing eNAM or the National Agriculture Market into a "platform of platforms" to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics of discussion on Saturday.
Discussion also emanated on the possibilities of a uniform statutory framework in the country to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in the agrarian economy.
The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 and how to protect the interest of small and marginal farmers was discussed in detail.
Ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with present times so that large-scale private investment in post-production agriculture infrastructure is incentivised, and how it has a positive effect on commodity derivative markets, was also discussed.
Developing 'Brand India', creation of commodity specific boards/councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract farming are some of the interventions that were deliberated to boost agriculture commodity export.
The use of technology in the agriculture sector is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.
PM Modi emphasised on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain.
It was decided to further strengthen the role of Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs) to bring vibrancy in agrarian economy, transparency in agriculture trade and enable maximum benefits to the farmers.
Overall emphasis was on revisiting the existing laws governing market for better price realisation and freedom of choice to the farmers, the statement said. Agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM meets FM for 2nd economic stimulus package amid coronavirus lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a series of meetings with key ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and officials of economic ministries to firm up the second stimulus package for sectors impacted by lockdown to curb spread of coronavirus, sources said.
The prime minister held discussions with Shah and Sitharaman and would have follow up meetings with ministers of key economic ministries such as Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), sources said.
The finance ministry, which deferred release of monthly GST collection numbers on Friday, is also scheduled to make a detailed presentation to the prime minister later in the day on the state of economy and several initiatives that it plans to undertake to stimulate Indian economy.
The prime minister already had meetings with different ministries including civil aviation, labour and power on Friday. He had detailed deliberation with commerce and MSME ministries among others on Thursday with focus on attracting both domestic and overseas investment and revival of small businesses in the country so that the recovery process is hastened.
During these meetings both the home minister and the finance minister were present.

To mitigate hardships faced by the bottom of the pyramid, the government in late March had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash doles to poor women and elderly.
Sources said the government is considering to announce a second dose of relief measures for the segment and a stimulus package for India Inc shortly.
The government had first imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown beginning March 25 and later extended it till May 3.
The lockdown shut businesses, stopped air and rail travel and restricted movement of people and goods.
Beginning May 4, the government has decided to ease certain restrictions including opening of industries for green and orange districts which either have nil or low number of cases. The easing of restriction in specified districts is till May 17 with strict vigil by local administration.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple’s $1.5 Billion Headwind Adds FX to Litany of Company Woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">U.S. multinational companies have begun to feel the sting of a strong dollar on their bottom lines, and there’s no guarantee the pain will go away as economies around the world attempt to reopen.
Dozens of corporations, from Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. to Harley- Davidson Inc., have warned the dollar’s appreciation is hurting foreign revenue. Even Netflix Inc., which benefited last quarter as much of the world was forced to stay at home, said overseas sales gains from rising subscriptions are being offset by a “sharply stronger” U.S. dollar.
Since the novel coronavirus began spreading in Asia early this year, broad measures of the dollar have surged to records as investors flocked to havens like the greenback and corporations hoarded cash. While the economic fallout poses more acute problems for companies, the headwinds from exchange rates could linger even as business rebounds.
“So let’s suppose we stabilize here or drop 1%,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal. “That still leaves U.S. firms facing a big headwind in their attempts to sell U.S.-produced goods overseas. Even if U.S.-based multinationals produce in-country rather than in the U.S., it still still hurts year-over-year earnings after you translate them back into U.S. dollars.”
That hypothetical drop in the trade-weighted dollar would price in improved “global disease dynamics” and a flight away from safety as governments take actions to restore investor confidence, Anderson said. While experts say a second wave of virus infections is inevitable as the world reopens for business, it’s likely to occur later on this year.
Why a Second Wave of Covid-19 Is Already a Worry: QuickTake
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of global currencies going back to 2005, rose 5.2% in the first quarter this year and ended it about 4.7% above its average level during the same period of 2019. Among the Group-of-10 currencies, the greenback has strengthened versus all but the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc this year.
Both the Bloomberg index and the Fed’s trade-weighted dollar index, which measures the currency versus 26 of America’s biggest trading partners, have inched slightly lower since peaking in March. Yet analysts expect dollar strength to linger, at least for the second quarter. With the deepest recession in generations likely unfolding, governments are introducing fiscal stimulus packages that may weaken their currencies further.
While the currency’s strength is just one of a myriad of stresses that businesses are dealing with, it’s still a material hit to sales for many. Exchange rates knocked 1% off of Apple’s $58.3 billion in sales in the latest quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the company’s earnings call. The headwind is expected to grow in the current quarter and reduce revenue by more than $1.5 billion at Apple, which on Thursday joined the growing ranks of companies refraining from providing sales and earnings guidance due to economic uncertainty.
Facebook put the quarterly hit to revenue at $275 million, while Harley-Davidson was dinged for almost $11 million.
“If it was any other quarter, besides during one amid this pandemic, what the dollar did would be a huge issue,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group Inc. in Minneapolis. “But now it’s just another residual problem on the list.”
Multinational companies also faced strong currency headwinds in early 2019 after a bout of greenback weakness in the prior year, but the dollar remained mostly range-bound last year so the effect was subsiding.
And while multinationals are often positioned to offset foreign currency volatility with hedges, the sudden strength in the dollar was as unpredictable as the extent of the virus. The widespread depreciation of foreign currencies has caught companies such as Merck & Co. off-guard.
“It’s hitting us across all of our currencies,” Robert Davis, Merck’s chief financial officer, said on an April 28 earnings call. “But importantly, what’s happening as well, and we’re not able to hedge as much as we normally would, is because we are also seeing a material impact in the emerging-market currencies, as well, where we don’t hedge today.”
Each 8% rise in the value of the dollar causes, on average, a 1% hit to corporations’ revenue, according to estimates from Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
“There was a decent strengthening of the dollar over the first quarter,” Golub said. “And it has and will be noticeable to earnings. But the real issue, for now, is that for some companies there is no business.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bullish for Crypto: A G7 Central Bank Confirmed It’s Floating Negative Rates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite the roaring recovery in the S&P 500, crypto, and other markets,  many facets of the global economy remain in recession. Dozens of millions are unemployed, consumer spending is down, and the global supply chain has come to a screeching halt.
With cashflows going negative around the world, meaning firms are at risk of going bankrupt and millions more risk losing their jobs, central banks have announced increasingly stronger forms of monetary policy to save businesses and individuals.
This was accentuated when the incoming head of a Group of Seven (G7) central bank announced that it is considering negative interest rates. It’s a statement that many in the crypto industry have embraced as a sign of why Bitcoin has intrinsic value in today’s world.
When consumers hold money in banks, they expect to be paid an interest rate. But, this financial trend has started to change as central banks have tried to spur economic growth.
While currently rare, more and more banks (mostly in the Nordic region thus far) have begun charging depositors for holding money with them, a stark contrast from the yields that savings accounts have classically offered over the decades.
Canada could soon be joining the mix, with the Bank of Canada’s incoming governor indicating in a press conference that the central bank is considering the possibility of introducing negative interest rates.
The Bank of Canada is currently imposing a policy interest rate of 0.25%, which has mostly followed that of the U.S. Federal Reserve over the past few years.
The idea goes that Bitcoin and other crypto assets stand to benefit from the global trend of central banks becoming increasingly aggressive.
In a research report published on April 30th, Phil Bonello, head of Grayscale Investments’ research division, commented on this narrative:
Bonello contrasted central banks’ quantitative easing with Bitcoin’s block reward halving, which has recently been dubbed quantitative tightening due to the fact that the event drops the issuance rate of the crypto, instead of increasing issuance as QE and extremely low (or even negative) interest rates do to fiat.
In a world of negative interest rates, holding Bitcoin and other crypto assets makes that much more sense to hold over fiat currency — which is not only being taken away from depositors and is also being debased by aggressive monetary policy.
Encapsulating this sentiment, Mike Novogratz —  the CEO of Galaxy Digital — said “Buy Gold. Buy Bitcoin” in reference to the news that Deutsche Bank will be implementing negative rates in savings accounts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tempting rally under way: Don’t invest aggressively, preserve cash</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The domestic equity market rallied during the week as hopes built up for a possible fiscal stimulus from the government. Global markets, too, rallied as many countries -- including emerging markets like Thailand, Malaysia --announced stimulus packages in the 10-15% range of their GDP. Whereas developed countries like US have provided stimulus to the economy of a similar magnitude; India still awaits a second fiscal package.
The upward move on the Indian bourses was a globally orchestrated rally and if the Indian government does not live up to the expectations of a major stimulus, markets will be disappointed, and bring down the price levels.
The fall in the stocks and the subsequent bounceback was largely due to the market assimilating with the health aspect of coronavirus. The financial implication of the same is yet to be assessed and discounted, not only in India but across the globe. A crisis similar to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09 catalyzed by the subprime mortgages may unfold post lockdown, but on the positive side, central banks across the world have already reduced interest rates to near zero levels in order to boost liquidity, and are preparing themselves to buy bonds worth trillions of dollars from the market to avoid a 2008-09 type crisis.
This hope is pushing markets higher.
On the domestic front, the domestic market witnessed a bagful of optimism in the pharmaceutical sector, which was one of the most neglected spaces since last half a decade. The BSE Pharma index rose 50% this past month. However, the optimism seems to be cooling off and prices are unwilling to continue their upward journey. In spite of the prices opening with a gap up, the rally is being sold out on the same day or the next day.
Stocks like Strides Pharma, Lupin and Glenmark Pharma rallied momentarily on positives of plant/product clearances, but the momentum did not last long. Hence, traders can go short on this sector and investors may avoid and wait for correction.
Event of the WeekThe central banking system of the US, The Federal Reserve, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the 0%-0.25% range and commented that it would use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. The remarks of Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted that the Fed would be patient and would not be in any hurry to move up the rates, which cheered the US market.
This careful status quo decision of the Fed shows the commitment that they will support financial markets with their unlimited money power, which is boosting global equity sentiments.
Technical Outlook
Nifty50 opened with a gap up in the last session with the broader market participation, and ended up forming a big bullish candle for the week. The index has rallied almost 30 per cent from the lows. However, the rally has been corrective in nature and not an impulse up-move. Going with the trend, we maintain a cautious outlook going ahead as the index is approaching the cluster of 50% Fibonacci retracement and gap resistance around the 9,900-9,950 range. Longs can be liquidated on weakness and fresh shorts can be initiated below 9,500.
Expectations for the Week
In the coming week, markets are expected to take major clues from any updates on gradual lifting of lockdown, which would assist the participants to gauge the ground level reality and set the course of direction.
Markets are also expected to keep an eye on the long-awaited stimulus package as well as mutual fund investors’ behaviour on inflows and outflows from Dalal Street. Volatility will remain high in the coming week and a lot of volatility is expected in smallcap and midcap stocks, although they will face selling pressure at higher levels.
Investors should be in wait-and-watch mode and preserve cash by not aggressively investing at current levels. As it is said: equity is king in bull market and cash is king in uncertain times. Investors can selectively book profits in order to raise liquidity. Nifty50 closed the week at 9,859, up 7.7 per cent.

By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said.
“Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O).
Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”
Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co (AXP.N), to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.

    <h5 class="mb-1">White House adviser will not rule out more money for states, small businesses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday he would not rule out anything in a new relief bill to ease the “tremendous hardships” of the coronavirus outbreak, including more money for state and local governments and small businesses.
More than 30 million Americans have joined the unemployment benefit rolls over the past six weeks and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are discussing a fourth coronavirus relief bill.
Democrats are pushing for additional aid to help cities and states cope with lost revenue from a shut-down economy and some governors have warned of massive layoffs if they fail to get it.
Some advisers to Republican President Donald Trump have said the need for another stimulus bill is not yet clear. But Kudlow said “there may well be additional legislation” as officials study how the billions included in the last bill take effect.
“We know the economy is still in a terrible, contractionary phase, tremendous hardships, everywhere,” Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“We’re trying to work through this. I don’t want to rule in or out anything right now. We are in discussions internally and with leading members of Congress.”
Congress has not met in regular session since March, though it has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $3 trillion. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said money for states and cities would be the core of the next legislative package Democrats draft.
Trump has considered linking such aid to sanctuary cities’ immigration policies, Kudlow said.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Sunday federal help to states that have taken a big revenue hit from coronavirus would make a “huge difference.”
“This is about firefighters, police, EMS, teachers at the point of attack. We’re already seeing some layoffs in New Jersey,” Murphy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We need a big slug of federal, direct cash assistance.”
All 50 states are suffering from the lack of revenue over the past two months, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in response to Trump’s argument that states with budget woes before the coronavirus outbreak should not get bailed out.
“Coronavirus has caused that. All of us are having to spend more on social services and healthcare to take care of people,” Pritzker said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Kudlow said authorities need to see the results of the previous funding efforts before deciding on the next steps.
“Then we’ll see, we will see in a couple of weeks, what needs to be done and perhaps how to do it,” Kudlow said.
Kudlow was asked whether more aid would be given to small businesses.
“It may be,” Kudlow said. “We haven’t made a decision yet.”

Some advisers to Republican President Donald Trump have said the need for another stimulus bill is not yet clear. But Kudlow said “there may well be additional legislation” as officials study how the billions included in the last bill take effect.
“We know the economy is still in a terrible, contractionary phase, tremendous hardships, everywhere,” Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“We’re trying to work through this. I don’t want to rule in or out anything right now. We are in discussions internally and with leading members of Congress.”
Congress has not met in regular session since March, though it has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $3 trillion. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said money for states and cities would be the core of the next legislative package Democrats draft.
Trump has considered linking such aid to sanctuary cities’ immigration policies, Kudlow said.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Sunday federal help to states that have taken a big revenue hit from coronavirus would make a “huge difference.”
“This is about firefighters, police, EMS, teachers at the point of attack. We’re already seeing some layoffs in New Jersey,” Murphy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We need a big slug of federal, direct cash assistance.”
All 50 states are suffering from the lack of revenue over the past two months, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in response to Trump’s argument that states with budget woes before the coronavirus outbreak should not get bailed out.
“Coronavirus has caused that. All of us are having to spend more on social services and healthcare to take care of people,” Pritzker said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Kudlow said authorities need to see the results of the previous funding efforts before deciding on the next steps.
“Then we’ll see, we will see in a couple of weeks, what needs to be done and perhaps how to do it,” Kudlow said.
Kudlow was asked whether more aid would be given to small businesses.
“It may be,” Kudlow said. “We haven’t made a decision yet.” (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Tom Brown and Lisa Shumaker)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday he would not rule out anything in a new relief bill to ease the "tremendous hardships" of the coronavirus outbreak, including more money for state and local governments and small businesses.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian bank bad debt could double after coronavirus crisis: sources</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI/NEW DELHI:  India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.
Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
"There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default," the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
"These are unprecedented times and the way it's going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we've seen in earlier quarters," the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorized to discuss the matter with media.
India's finance ministry declined to comment, while the RBI and Indian Banks' Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

Fuel pumps across Brisbane have bucked recent record low prices, jumping as high as $1.19 on Saturday morning, as people head outdoors for picnics and retail shopping following an ease on restrictions.
However, some southern suburbs are still selling fuel for as little as 82.9c at the end of a week in which the state recorded just eight new cases of COVID-19.
All Queenslanders are restricted to staying within 50 kilometres of their home and must continue to practise social distancing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Petrol prices spike as Queenslanders hit the road amid lockdown let-up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Petrol prices have crept up as Queenslanders venture out of their homes for the first time after being confined for weeks of semi-lockdown.
Fuel pumps across Brisbane have bucked recent record low prices, jumping as high as $1.19 on Saturday morning, as people head outdoors for picnics and retail shopping following an ease on restrictions.
However, some southern suburbs are still selling fuel for as little as 82.9c at the end of a week in which the state recorded just eight new cases of COVID-19.
All Queenslanders are restricted to staying within 50 kilometres of their home and must continue to practise social distancing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">More funds for universities the fairest option</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The oldest universities in Australia – Melbourne and Sydney – were established to provide an education to any person who aspired to one. Once they were founded, on principles of equality and civic duty, the colonies no longer needed to send their brightest back to England to learn how to lead.
William Wentworth, who helped set up the University of Sydney in 1851, hoped the institution would allow "children of every class to become great and useful in the destinies of this country".
Fast forward 169 years and today's children have suddenly seen their road to greatness become so much more difficult. They have had their schooling interrupted, their pathways to university thrown into doubt and their social development curtailed by isolation. They will inherit a massive national debt by the end of the COVID-19 crisis which will take them years to pay off. And we now face having to add to that debt to help those very universities they want to attend, after funding from international students fell significantly as a result of the pandemic.
Universities perform a critical public service role through research and education; we benefit as a society from their discoveries and from their graduates. They must survive. But with international students now barred from entering Australia, their financial health is at risk, particularly if the ban stretches into next year.
Today, the federal government accounts for about 30 per cent of university funding, down from over 80 per cent in the 1990s. Coalition and Labor governments have actively encouraged universities to grow their revenue from international students. And grow it they did. International students now account for 46 per cent of enrolments at the University of Melbourne and 39 per cent of enrolments at the University of Sydney.
Their fees have provided for teaching, research and campus upgrades – but that income stream turned into a trickle when the government closed the borders to stop the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in Australia. Universities expect international enrolments to fall further next semester. They have flagged their own significant measures to save costs, including cutting capital works and casual jobs.
Meanwhile, domestic student numbers are set to soar, as the Costello baby boom children of the mid-2000s reach adulthood and the economic downturn triggers a rise in people wanting to retrain. The larger number of students will attract more government funding, but that funding often doesn't cover the cost of running a course.
The options to help Australian universities if their financial difficulties worsen all seem to carry a cost. Allowing international students to enter Australia again will restore a plentiful funding stream and produce other economic benefits in the way of retail spending and jobs, but until there is a vaccine, it risks a resurgence in cases of COVID-19.
We risk suffering as a society if we cut back on research, particularly at a time when we are so reliant on our medical scientists to find that vaccine. Pursuing further partnerships with the private and philanthropic sectors would allow various fields of research to continue, while reducing the strain on the public purse and allowing money to be redirected to teaching Australian students – but that only goes so far.
We cannot allow the government to use the COVID-19 pandemic to revisit their scotched plans of 2014, when they tried to deregulate the sector and allow universities to set their own fees. Under such a scenario, Australian students would have graduated with much larger debts. Such a move goes against the very principles upon which universities were founded in Australia, to afford "children of every class" an education.
While increasing government funding to universities adds to the national debt, at least it will be spread across society – a society which in turn benefits from the educated young people universities create. It is the fairest outcome – and pivots the focus of Australian universities back to the students they were set up to serve.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre to stop charging cancellation fees amid criticism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre has decided to stop charging cancellation fees to customers whose travel has been impacted by COVID-19.
The travel agent had been charging a $300 per person cancellation fee for bookings from before the outbreak, with some law firms and customers considering a class action against the practice.
But in a letter sent to customers on Saturday, Flight Centre backed down from that position.
“The decision to waive [cancellation] fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” Flight Centre Travel Group executive general manager Allisa O’Connell wrote in the letter.
“The waiver follows ongoing discussions with customers and regulators, including the ACCC, and will apply retrospectively to bookings cancelled as a result of COVID-19 on or after 13 March 2020 for which a Flight Centre Cancellation Fee was charged. Please note this waiver applies to our fees – we cannot waive fees or conditions that airlines and other third party suppliers impose.”
Ms O’Connell also confirmed Flight Centre staff would continue to perform the “time consuming task” of processing refunds. The travel agent has come under fire for delays in getting money back to its customers.
Flight Centre will also offer customers travel vouchers of up to $200 per person for those who do not request a refund and instead take credits for future travel.
Ms O’Connor also reiterated that Flight Centre was “well placed financially to weather a prolonged downturn” in the travel industry.
The company said those who accepted a credit voucher could get a refund, without having to pay fees, at the end of December 2021, if travel still isn't possible.
Flight Centre had defended the $300 fee – which was included in its terms and conditions – saying it covers lost commissions, as well as the time and cost involved in managing the refund process.
The embattled travel group is closing 428 Australian stores by the end of July in an attempt to radically slash costs while raising $900 million in fresh equity and debt to last it through the coronavirus pandemic.

The travel agent had been charging a $300 per person cancellation fee for bookings from before the outbreak, with some law firms and customers considering a class action against the practice.
But in a letter sent to customers on Saturday, Flight Centre backed down from that position. The new policy applies retrospectively to cancellation fees already paid.
“The decision to waive [cancellation] fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” Flight Centre Travel Group executive general manager Allisa O’Connell wrote in the letter.

Please note this waiver applies to our fees – we cannot waive fees or conditions that airlines and other third party suppliers impose.”
The ACCC welcomed Flight Centre's move and said it would have taken legal action if the travel group had not made the decision.
“This is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre today for thousands of customers impacted by COVID-19 travel cancellations,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.
“We are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.”
Ms O’Connell also confirmed Flight Centre staff would continue to perform the “time consuming task” of processing refunds. The travel agent has come under fire for delays in getting money back to its customers.
Flight Centre will also offer customers travel vouchers of up to $200 per person for those who do not request a refund and instead take credits for future travel.
The ACCC said it had received 6000 complaints related to travel companies refund policies.
“We ask consumers to remain patient and be mindful of the significant pressures on businesses at this time and, where possible, contact the business by email or website, rather than by phone,” Mr Sims said.
“These are very complex issues and may take smaller businesses more time to respond.”
Ms O’Connor also reiterated that Flight Centre was “well placed financially to weather a prolonged downturn” in the travel industry.
The company said those who accepted a credit voucher could get a refund, without having to pay fees, at the end of December 2021, if travel still isn't possible.
Flight Centre had defended the $300 fee – which was included in its terms and conditions – saying it covers lost commissions, as well as the time and cost involved in managing the refund process.
The embattled travel group is closing 428 Australian stores by the end of July in an attempt to radically slash costs while raising $900 million in fresh equity and debt to last it through the coronavirus pandemic.
The Agereported in April on Melbourne midwife Jacqueline Vella who lost thousands, including $1500 in fees, when she had to cancel a trip to Europe and the United States.
Flight Centre then decided to cap its cancellation fees about a week later, and a day after The Age reported a class action law suit was being planned.
This week, a mother suffering from muscular dystrophy pleaded with Flight Centre to refund the almost $20,000 she spent on a trip with her family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flight Centre to stop charging cancellation fees amid criticism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Flight Centre has decided to stop charging cancellation fees to customers whose travel has been impacted by COVID-19.
The travel agent had been charging a $300 per person cancellation fee for bookings from before the outbreak, with some law firms and customers considering a class action against the practice.
But in a letter sent to customers on Saturday, Flight Centre backed down from that position.
“The decision to waive [cancellation] fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,” Flight Centre Travel Group executive general manager Allisa O’Connell wrote in the letter.
“The waiver follows ongoing discussions with customers and regulators, including the ACCC, and will apply retrospectively to bookings cancelled as a result of COVID-19 on or after 13 March 2020 for which a Flight Centre Cancellation Fee was charged. Please note this waiver applies to our fees – we cannot waive fees or conditions that airlines and other third party suppliers impose.”
Ms O’Connell also confirmed Flight Centre staff would continue to perform the “time consuming task” of processing refunds. The travel agent has come under fire for delays in getting money back to its customers.
Flight Centre will also offer customers travel vouchers of up to $200 per person for those who do not request a refund and instead take credits for future travel.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's dependence on immigration faces its biggest economic test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia's dependence on immigration to grow the economy is about to be sorely tested.
One of the secret ingredients to Australia's unparalleled run of economic growth since the country's last recession has been strong population growth.
While local mums have played their part in swelling the number of locals, the heavy lifting has been done by people from nations such as China, India, Britain, New Zealand and the Philippines who have decided to call Australia home.
Over the past decade, the nation's permanent population has grown by 3.7 million to more than 25 million. Of that increase, 60 per cent was due to net migration.
That extra 2.2 million people have been an economic powerhouse, requiring homes, cars, food and every day goods and services while also contributing fresh skills to the jobs market.
But it has come at a price, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Be it via higher house prices or over-crowded schools, all levels of government have struggled to keep up with the demands of a growing population while reaping the economic benefits of that population.
The Morrison government made much of its decision in last year's budget to cap permanent migration at 160,000 for four consecutive years as dealing with the congestion pressures on our big cities.
That cap didn't include the hundreds of thousands of temporary migrants – be it students or workers – who help run the economy and add to demand.
But with the borders shut, international students stuck in their home countries and immigration all-but impossible, the issues around migration and Australia's dependence on it cannot be ignored.
The government is now expecting net overseas migration – which was forecast to reach 271,000 in 2019-20 – to be 30 per cent lower. Next year, the drop is tipped to be 85 per cent.
Combined, that's close to 300,000 missing shoppers, students, family members and skilled workers from the economy.
With temporary workers leaving the country and others unable to get in, population growth is likely to stall. Sydney could shrink while Melbourne's stellar growth of recent years will be muted, with serious economic repercussions.
Australia will, post-virus, remain a desirable destination for permanent migrants, temporary ones and international students.
The Morrison government's economic rebuilding plan will have to include a discussion around the nation's dependence of immigration.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press has entered detailed discussions with multiple bidders interested in salvaging the newswire and its contacts database Medianet but it will be weeks before its fate is decided.
Chairman Campbell Reid said in a statement that the Board would enter confidential discussions with interested parties over several weeks after it met with consultancy TMT Partners on the weekend to discuss sale proposals.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements," Mr Reid said. "In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
AAP's future has been in doubt since February when The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed that AAP's major shareholders Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and News Corp planned to close the 85-year-old organisation to save costs. But the decision, which affects about 600 employees, was put on hold two months ago after AAP received a number of approaches from parties interested in acquiring its operations.
Staff and AAP subscribers have since been waiting on a decision by the Board about a potential sale before they progress with plans for a future without the newswire. AAP subscribers including the ABC, Daily Mail, Private Media, Guardian Australia and Verizon Media have previously discussed pooling resources and forming journalism partnerships that could replace the newswire when it closes in June, but sources said the conversations have not progressed since the sale process began.
AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson confirmed plans to establish a new private business that would include the company's fact-checking division and parts of its editorial services arm Pagemasters before the sale process began. He also held talks with private investors including stockbroker John Murray but all plans are currently on hold.
News Corp Australia is planning to launch its newswire service, which will provide content for mastheads including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun and external customers, next month.

Chairman Campbell Reid said in a statement that the Board would enter confidential discussions with interested parties over several weeks after it met with consultancy TMT Partners on the weekend to discuss sale proposals.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements," Mr Reid said. "In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
AAP's future has been in doubt since February when The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed that AAP's major shareholders Nine Entertainment Co (publisher of this masthead) and News Corp planned to close the 85-year-old organisation to save costs. But the decision, which affects about 600 employees, was put on hold two months ago after AAP received a number of approaches from parties interested in acquiring its operations.
Staff and AAP subscribers have since been waiting on a decision by the Board about a potential sale before they progress with plans for a future without the newswire. AAP subscribers including the ABC, Daily Mail, Private Media, Guardian Australia and Verizon Media have previously discussed pooling resources and forming journalism partnerships that could replace the newswire when it closes in June, but sources said the conversations have not progressed since the sale process began.
AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson confirmed plans to establish a new private business that would include the company's fact-checking division and parts of its editorial services arm Pagemasters before the sale process began. He also held talks with private investors including stockbroker John Murray but all plans are currently on hold.
News Corp Australia is planning to launch its newswire service, which will provide content for mastheads including The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and The Herald Sun and external customers, next month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AAP staff wait on board discussions with bidders</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian Associated Press will have to wait several more weeks before a decision is made on whether the wire service is sold or closed down.
AAP chairman Campbell Reid said the board, made up of News Corp and Nine executives, has entered into "detailed discussions with a number of parties" which had expressed interest in AAP and Medianet.
"These discussions are confidential and are expected to take several weeks," Mr Reid said in a statement.
"The safeguarding of AAP staff entitlements is the first consideration for the AAP board in these discussions and any agreement entered into with a purchaser will oblige the purchaser to honour those entitlements. In the event of there being no sale AAP will honour those entitlements."
The AAP board met over the weekend to discuss proposals which were put forward by Friday's 5pm deadline.
"You should also be aware that even after the board has met, it could still be some time before any announcement is made, depending on the assessment of the bids," AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson said in a staff email on Friday afternoon.
On March 3, AAP announced it would close its doors after 85 years in operation, affecting 180 editorial staff and a total of 500 individual staff members and 100 contractors across its business.
By mid-March, AAP had received several approaches interested in buying the newswire and its other businesses.
AAP had said the decision was made because the newswire service was "no longer viable to continue", and its largest shareholders, News Corp and Nine, decided to pull their support for the organisation to which they contribute a combined more than $10 million per year.
Australian Community Media and Seven West Media both contribute more than $1 million per year. Clients of the service pay much less for access to AAP content.
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that talent manager Glenn Wheatley was one of the interested parties.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Industry super funds to demand answers as ME Bank borrowers fume</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Industry super fund shareholders of boutique lender Members Equity Bank will demand an urgent explanation on Monday following concerning claims of borrowers being cut off from personal funds without their consent or knowledge.
The Age and Sydney Morning Heraldreported on Saturday that Melbourne-based ME Bank, owned by 26 industry superannuation funds, had blindsided customers by removing their access to money in redraw facilities in order to pay down home loans.
Bill Watson, chief executive of the $3 billion industry fund First Super, described the news as "concerning".
"I'll be seeking an explanation from the bank tomorrow," he said on Sunday. "Once we've received an explanation, we will determine what action needs to be taken from there. As a shareholder, clearly we don't want to see consumers disadvantaged."
Gerard Noonan, the chairman of the $6 billion Media Super, said several members of the fund had raised questions about the ME Bank move.
"We're looking into it," Mr Noonan said. "So far it seems like a readjustment of the way the bank has structured its drawdown facilities when customers have used their excess mortgage repayments as a source of back-up source of borrowing."
Home loan redraw facilities allow borrowers who are ahead on their loan repayments to withdraw funds above their minimum repayment amounts if they need to use those funds for any other purpose. On its website, ME Bank promotes its redraw facility as a product that allows customers to make extra mortgage repayments and with the added flexibility of letting clients "redraw money from your loan at any time, for free."
Other industry super fund directors said they had been seeking to speak with ME Bank over the weekend for information about what had occurred. "But I haven't been able to talk to anyone," said one.
A number of customers last week contacted The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald after noticing between 10 and 50 per cent of their redraw funds were absorbed into their home loan without any notification.
In a statement released on Saturday ME Bank acknowledged the changes had caused concern among some customers, "particularly in the current environment". The lender said the changes were designed to prevent customers from overusing their redraw to a point where they risked falling behind on their original repayment schedule.
"This can put customers at risk of not meeting their repayment commitments, potentially leaving them open to financial hardship at the end of the loan term," ME Bank said.
"No money has been removed from customer accounts. The adjustment made is to the amount available for redraw."
ME Bank said staff were contacting affected customers and reviewing their circumstances to determine how they could help with their financial needs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Never more critical': Government pressed on low-carbon recovery study</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Berejiklian government is being urged by a lower house committee to report within months how the promotion of low-carbon technologies can help revive NSW's economy as well as reducing its dependence on coal.
The five-member lower house Committee on Environment and Planning - three of whom are Liberal MPs - last week agreed to ask the government for the study of the employment and investment opportunities that can be generated by the renewable energy sector and a shift to a low-carbon economy.
Alex Greenwich, the independent MP who is also chair of the committee, said the workforce and economic opportunities from accelerating the take-up of wind and solar energy would be "critical" for the state's rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Our committee has heard thousands of new jobs are waiting to be created and there has never been a more important time for this," Mr Greenwich said.
The jobs range from construction related to the building of new transmission and storage for the power sector, investment in hydrogen technology, to stepping up energy efficiency in homes and businesses that would have lasting benefits.
"There is a lot NSW can do to future proof our economy by increasing access and supply of renewable energy both locally and for export," he said.
The committee had planned to hold hearings into its energy inquiry by now in places such as the Hunter Valley, before the coronavirus-linked lockdowns delayed the events.
The recent collapse in export thermal coal prices - now trading at about half their levels of two years ago - has only added to the urgency of weaning the region off fossil fuels, Mr Greenwich said.
"What is going to happen to this region when these exports and dependency [on coal] drop off further?" he said. "This has to be an area of priority."
Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean, who has said he aims to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy in NSW, said he would respond to the committee's request "shortly".
“I welcome the committee’s support for ensuring a strong and sustainable economic recovery from COVID-19 and their approach to seeking expert input on this matter," Mr Kean said.
The committee members include Liberal MPs, Felicity Wilson, James Griffin and Nathaniel Smith, and Labor's Anoulack Chanthivong.
Rooftop solar energy installations were almost 900 megawatts in the first four months of this year, with new systems in April more than 50 per cent higher than the same month in 2019, Green Energy Markets reported on Friday. The impact on business of the coronavirus, however, will likely show a big fall in solar demand in coming months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Never more critical': Government pressed on low-carbon recovery study</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Berejiklian government is being urged by a lower house committee to report within months how the promotion of low-carbon technologies can help revive NSW's economy as well as reducing its dependence on coal.
The five-member lower house Committee on Environment and Planning - three of whom are Liberal MPs - last week agreed to ask the government for the study of the employment and investment opportunities that can be generated by the renewable energy sector and a shift to a low-carbon economy.
Alex Greenwich, the independent MP who is also chair of the committee, said the workforce and economic opportunities from accelerating the take-up of wind and solar energy would be "critical" for the state's rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Our committee has heard thousands of new jobs are waiting to be created and there has never been a more important time for this," Mr Greenwich said.
The jobs range from construction related to the building of new transmission and storage for the power sector, investment in hydrogen technology, to stepping up energy efficiency in homes and businesses that would have lasting benefits.
"There is a lot NSW can do to future proof our economy by increasing access and supply of renewable energy both locally and for export," he said.
The committee had planned to hold hearings into its energy inquiry by now in places such as the Hunter Valley, before the coronavirus-linked lockdowns delayed the events.
The recent collapse in export thermal coal prices - now trading at about half their levels of two years ago - has only added to the urgency of weaning the region off fossil fuels, Mr Greenwich said.
"What is going to happen to this region when these exports and dependency [on coal] drop off further?" he said. "This has to be an area of priority."
Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean, who has said he aims to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy in NSW, said he would respond to the committee's request "shortly".
“I welcome the committee’s support for ensuring a strong and sustainable economic recovery from COVID-19 and their approach to seeking expert input on this matter," Mr Kean said.
The committee members include Liberal MPs, Felicity Wilson, James Griffin and Nathaniel Smith, and Labor's Anoulack Chanthivong.
Rooftop solar energy installations were almost 900 megawatts in the first four months of this year, with new systems in April more than 50 per cent higher than the same month in 2019, Green Energy Markets reported on Friday. The impact on business of the coronavirus, however, will likely show a big fall in solar demand in coming months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">$300m clean energy fund to back fossil-fuel hydrogen projects</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Morrison government has committed $300 million to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and instructed it to invest in new hydrogen energy projects including those powered by fossil fuels.
The move makes clear the government's position on the debate over the potential to develop an emissions-free hydrogen industry powered exclusively by renewable energy.
"Gas and gas transmission networks already play an essential role in energy reliability, but gas has even more potential as a resource to produce and transmit hydrogen," said Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor.
Renewable energy advocates, along with Labor-led governments in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT, argue fossil-fuelled hydrogen should be barred from public funds, which should flow to “green hydrogen” powered by renewables. State governments contribute to regulation of the energy sector through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).
But crucially for Mr Taylor, he secured majority support at the November COAG meeting to develop a hydrogen industry under a "technology-neutral" approach including all power source options.
Hydrogen has emerged in recent months as a key element of the Morrison government’s emissions reduction strategy, which Mr Taylor said would be based on a "technology investment road map".
Mr Taylor said his goal was to back projects that could reach a long-term goal of producing hydrogen at $2 a kilogram – the point "where hydrogen becomes competitive with alternative energy sources in large-scale deployment across our energy systems".
The announcement of the Advancing Hydrogen Fund follows a crash in the global oil market crash. The fall has flowed on to lower gas prices, which Mr Taylor said “provides us with an opportunity for strategic economic stimulus”.
The government has estimated an Australian hydrogen industry could create more than 8000 jobs and generate about $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050.
Chief Scientist Alan Finkel has said a domestic hydrogen industry could underpin an energy export boom for Australia, and Australia should develop it using renewables and fossil fuel to avoid the risks associated with reliance on any one fuel source.
"By producing hydrogen from natural gas or coal, using carbon capture and permanent storage, we can add back two more lanes to our energy highway, ensuring we have four primary energy sources to meet the needs of the future – solar, wind, hydrogen from natural gas, and hydrogen from coal," Dr Finkel said.
"Think for a moment of the vast amounts of steel, aluminium and concrete needed to support, build and service solar and wind structures.
"What if there was a resources shortage? It would be prudent, therefore, to safeguard against any potential resource limitations with another energy source."
In time, green hydrogen could take over and drive a net zero emissions global economy, according to Dr Finkel.
The Advancing Hydrogen Fund will provide debt or equity finance to commercial projects requiring $10 million or more in capital, which Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive Ian Learmonth said would fill market gaps created by "technology, development or commercial challenges".
Mr Taylor recently announced a $70 million fund for green hydrogen project development through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Strippers, scrap gold and a $3.9 million heist</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A $3.9 million armed robbery in Melbourne's CBD last week, allegedly involving a man with a surgical mask, a gun and a trolley has exposed extraordinary security failings but also reveals the unusual business practices of the city's gold and precious gem dealers.
In a nondescript building near the corner of Collins and Swanston streets, bags of gold jewellery are exchanged for cash, diamonds are used to secure high-interest loans and deposits worth millions of dollars are made into company bank accounts using pseudonyms such as 'Aghtogde'.
Business has been booming in recent months, as the coronavirus battered global financial markets and spooked investors turned to gold bullion as a safe haven. Others had been forced to trade or pawn their old gold jewellery and watches after suddenly facing financial hardship.
Last week, Karl Kachami, 48, from Hawthorn East, allegedly entered the building at 227 Collins Street where many of Melbourne's gold and diamond dealers ply their trade.
At about 9.40am, he is accused of pointing a Glock pistol at the head of an employee of the Melbourne Gold Company based on the seventh floor, before leaving with almost $4 million worth of gold bullion, jewellery and cash.
Mr Kachami was charged on April 30 with armed robbery, theft, false imprisonment and assault, after police found the loot buried at a rural property near the Gippsland town of Dollar.
Lawyer Sazz Nasimi acts for Melbourne Gold Company and its owner Michael Kukulka, who was not present at the time of the robbery.
Mr Nasimi said security was usually extremely tight.
"This was a human error and protocols were not followed on the day," he said.
Mr Nasimi said the safe was unusually full because the company had received a significant consignment of gold a few days earlier amid a surge in demand for the precious metal because of coronavirus.
Mr Nasimi thanked police for the swift arrest and said it was business as usual at Mr Kukulka's company.
However, Mr Kukulka's relationship with Victoria Police has not always been cordial.
In January this year, Licensing Inspector Scott Johnson opposed an application by Mr Kukulka to reopen strip club Showgirls Bar 20 at a new site on King Street.
Mr Kukulka invested $1.2 million in the relaunch of the notorious gentlemen's club, but Victoria Police raised concerns about his involvement in the gold industry.
In an 18-page submission, police identify more than $6 million in irregular transactions in a bank account linked to his business, including dozens of payments from unidentified pseudonyms such as 'Gdetoagch' and 'Aghtogde.' Mr Kukulka has never been charged with any offence in connection with any of those transactions, and he is not accused of any wrongdoing.
Despite the police objections, Mr Kukulka's application was approved last month by the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, and the strip club is expected to open when social distancing guidelines are relaxed.
The scale of Mr Kukulka's previous gold business MAK Precious Metals was revealed in a recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal case, where he was found to have provided almost $460 million in scrap gold to a Sydney-based company called ABC Refinery Pty Limited.
Mr Kukulka sourced gold from a range of sources, including $1.5 million in just six days from Melbourne fraudster-turned-bullion dealer Rocco Calabrese, according to court documents.
Calabrese, aka Rocco De Gonza, has been bankrupt twice, jailed for three dozen deception offences in 2002, and convicted again in 2014 for stealing 5500 kilograms of prawns worth $82,000. Mr Kukulka was not involved in any of Calabrese's wrongdoing.
According to court documents, gold sourced from Mr Calabrese was referred to as ‘Rocco jobs’.
Mr Kukulka's former business also appears to have offered short-term loans, usually secured by diamonds or gold bullion.
Mr Kukulka's former business lent diamond dealer Ron Bensimon $334,000, which was never repaid when Bensimon's empire collapsed in 2016, after amassing personal and business debts of more than $10 million.
Mr Nasimi said Mr Kukulka launched legal action to recoup the debt, but abandoned the claim when Bensimon was declared bankrupt.

Mr Kukulka invested $1.2 million in the relaunch of the notorious gentlemen's club, but Victoria Police raised concerns about his involvement in the gold industry.
In an 18-page submission, police identify more than $6 million in irregular transactions in a bank account linked to his business, including dozens of payments from unidentified pseudonyms such as 'Gdetoagch' and 'Aghtogde.' Mr Kukulka has never been charged with any offence in connection with any of those transactions, and he is not accused of any wrongdoing.
Despite the police objections, Mr Kukulka's application was approved last month by the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, and the strip club is expected to open when social distancing guidelines are relaxed.
The scale of Mr Kukulka's previous gold business MAK Precious Metals was revealed in a recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal case, where he was found to have provided almost $460 million in scrap gold to a Sydney-based company called ABC Refinery Pty Limited.
Mr Kukulka sourced gold from a range of sources, including $1.5 million in just six days from Melbourne fraudster-turned-bullion dealer Rocco Calabrese, according to court documents.
Calabrese, aka Rocco De Gonza, has been bankrupt twice, jailed for three dozen deception offences in 2002, and convicted again in 2014 for stealing 5500 kilograms of prawns worth $82,000. Mr Kukulka was not involved in any of Calabrese's wrongdoing.
According to court documents, gold sourced from Mr Calabrese was referred to as ‘Rocco jobs’.
Mr Kukulka's former business also appears to have offered short-term loans, usually secured by diamonds or gold bullion.
Mr Kukulka's former business lent diamond dealer Ron Bensimon $334,000, which was never repaid when Bensimon's empire collapsed in 2016, after amassing personal and business debts of more than $10 million.
Mr Nasimi said Mr Kukulka launched legal action to recoup the debt, but abandoned the claim when Bensimon was declared bankrupt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Strippers, scrap gold and a $3.9 million heist</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A $3.9 million armed robbery in Melbourne's CBD last week, allegedly involving a man with a surgical mask, a gun and a trolley has exposed extraordinary security failings but also reveals the unusual business practices of the city's gold and precious gem dealers.
In a nondescript building near the corner of Collins and Swanston streets, bags of gold jewellery are exchanged for cash, diamonds are used to secure high-interest loans and deposits worth millions of dollars are made into company bank accounts using pseudonyms such as 'Aghtogde'.
Business has been booming in recent months, as the coronavirus battered global financial markets and spooked investors turned to gold bullion as a safe haven. Others had been forced to trade or pawn their old gold jewellery and watches after suddenly facing financial hardship.
Last week, Karl Kachami, 48, from Hawthorn East, allegedly entered the building at 227 Collins Street where many of Melbourne's gold and diamond dealers ply their trade.
At about 9.40am, he is accused of pointing a Glock pistol at the head of an employee of the Melbourne Gold Company based on the seventh floor, before leaving with almost $4 million worth of gold bullion, jewellery and cash.
Mr Kachami was charged on April 30 with armed robbery, theft, false imprisonment and assault, after police found the loot buried at a rural property near the Gippsland town of Dollar.
Lawyer Sazz Nasimi acts for Melbourne Gold Company and its owner Michael Kukulka, who was not present at the time of the robbery.
Mr Nasimi said security was usually extremely tight.
"This was a human error and protocols were not followed on the day," he said.
Mr Nasimi said the safe was unusually full because the company had received a significant consignment of gold a few days earlier amid a surge in demand for the precious metal because of coronavirus.
Mr Nasimi thanked police for the swift arrest and said it was business as usual at Mr Kukulka's company.
However, Mr Kukulka's relationship with Victoria Police has not always been cordial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First the Australian economy needs CPR. We’ll worry about reform later</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I can’t take seriously all those people saying we mustn’t waste a crisis, but seize this great opportunity to introduce sweeping economic reform. It’s like telling a baby who hasn’t yet learnt to walk it should start training for the Olympics.
It’s true, of course, that we won’t get back to economic life as we used to know it – that is, knew it before the global financial crisis, more than a decade ago – until we get back to reasonably strong annual improvement in the productivity of labour.
But the plain fact is, you’ve got to have a functioning economy before you can worry about how fast its productivity is improving. So there’ll be a time to debate which policies would or wouldn't do most to enhance productivity, but we have more pressing matters to attend to.
Some in the don’t-waste-the-crisis party can be forgiven because they’re under 50 and have no memory of what happens in recessions. But as my colleague Shane Wright has said, most of them are "the usual suspects, falling back on their usual agendas".
They have no genuine concern about the economy’s present life-threatened state, but are business people engaged in rent-seeking, or economists running off faith in their economic model, whether or not it’s supported by empirical evidence their theory actually works.
These urgers have forgotten that micro-economic reform seeks to increase economic growth by making the supply (production) side of the economy work more efficiently. It delivers results only over the medium to long term. It’s thus no substitute for macro-economic management, which deals with managing the demand side of the economy in the short term.
Right now, the prospect of a 10 per cent unemployment rate tells us we have more supply than we’re able to use. Clearly, our problem’s that demand is insufficient. The improvement in economic efficiency we assume we could gain by, say, taxing land rather than the transfer of it, is minor compared with the monumental inefficiency we know for certain is occurring because 10 per cent of our workers can’t find work.
Right now, we don’t even have an economy that’s functioning, much less functioning well. Much of it’s closed - locked up by government decree. We’re starting to ease the lockdown, but we won’t be opening our borders for another year or two.
When we do have most of the lockdown removed, what will we see? The economy won’t snap back. Not even bounce back in any significant way. True, once businesses are allowed to reopen they’ll be making some sales rather than next to none. But with so many households unemployed, sales won’t go back to anything like where they were.
Most households and businesses will be in cost-cutting mode. Firms have been incurring overheads while earning little. Even those households still working will be worried about their big mortgages and fearful of losing their own jobs. As Treasury secretary Dr Steven Kennedy has warned, “some jobs and businesses will have been lost permanently”.
Most firms and households will be getting back to some semblance of normality, but few will be doing much that causes the economy to grow in any positive sense. As Reserve Bank governor Dr Philip Lowe has said, firms and households are suffering from a "high level of uncertainty about the future" and will engage in "precautionary behaviour". They’ll be saving not spending.
Sound like a bounce-back, or an economy still in the intensive care unit? Ask yourself this: which are the forces that will propel the economy forward? It won’t be the main factor we’ve relied on in recent years – high immigration. Our population’s now falling, as people on temporary visas are sent home and not replaced. (Not that population growth does anything much to lift income per person.)
It won’t be “external stimulus” because the rest of the world is growing faster than us (it isn’t), or a lower dollar is making our exports cheaper to foreigners because we’ll continue banning foreign tourists and overseas students. Export commodity prices aren’t rising.
It won’t be growth in real wages (employers will compulsively demand a wage freeze) nor a "wealth effect" from rising house prices prompting households to cut their rate of saving. And a key missing piece: it won’t be big cuts in interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending.
That leaves only "fiscal stimulus" – the budget. The huge government spending so far has merely limited the extent of the economy’s fall. Should Scott Morrison soon start winding it back as he says he plans to, we could fall even further.
No, if we're to actually recover what will come next is a lot more government spending, particularly on useful projects. It can only be a government-led recovery.

    <h5 class="mb-1">8@eight: ASX set to edge lower</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The new month kicked off with volatility on Wall Street as stocks tumbled to close the week. the ASX is set to inch lower this morning, with futures at 8am pointing to a fall of 7 points at the open.
1. May kicks-off with upwell of volatility: The new month has been seized by the bears, with stock markets tumbling on Friday. The headlines of “sell in May and stay away” have been rampant, and perhaps justifiably. The losses for stock markets across the globe were steep, in what was something of a 180-degree change in the market sentiment that defined April’s trading.
It ought to be said, activity was lower than average, and many major stock exchanges were closed throughout Asia and Europe. Nevertheless, for those that were open, it proved bearish day’s trade, with the S&P500 for one, shedding 2.81 per cent, as the VIX leapt back to the 37-mark.
2. Apple and Amazon disappoint the market: One catalyst for the tumble in global equities came as Amazon and Apple disappointed investors with its earnings on Friday morning. Although both companies delivered reasonable financial results for the last quarter, market participants were evidently underwhelmed by their appraisals regarding the future.
Apple refused to deliver any guidance, citing the high degree of uncertainty in doing so. While Amazon flagged that though it expected a boost in top-line growth in the quarter ahead, higher expenses incurred from the fallout from the COVID-19 crisis will impact its future profitability.
3. A better week for US corporates: Apple and Amazon’s results, and the subsequent tumble in tech shares on Wall Street on Friday, belied what was an otherwise better than expected week for both the sector and the S&P500 more broadly from an earnings perspective.
According to data compiled by Fact Set, the information technology sector has generally beaten analyst earnings expectations for the quarter, recording EPS growth of 4.2 per cent, above the 1.3 per cent estimates coming into the reporting period. The strong showing from the IT sector contributed to an improved blended EPS for the S&P500 for Q1, which rose to -13.7 per cent last week.
4. US-China trade tensions reinflame: The other major cause for Friday’s bearishness was of renewed trade tensions between the US and China, as both countries continue their feud about the origins of the COVID-19 crisis, and the culpability for the pandemic.
US President Donald Trump floated the idea of re-introducing tariffs on certain Chinese goods, as punishment for what he says as China’s failure to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It was also reported on Friday in the financial media that President Trump is considering blocking a US Government investment fund from investing in Chinese equities on Security grounds.
5. ASX200 and AUD tumble: The possible return of a tit-for-tat trade-war pummelled Australian stocks and the AUD on Friday. The ASX200 shed 5.01 per cent to begin the new trading month, with the export sensitive materials and energy sectors pacing the index’s losses. The Australian Dollar also found itself victim to concerns about potential tariffs on the Chinese economy.
Moving somewhat in lock-step with the off-shore Yuan, and as a proxy for the global growth outlook, the AUD/USD plunged 1.44 per cent to close the week’s trade at 0.6418. SPI Futures are pointing to a small drop for the ASX200 this morning.
6. Global growth pulse remains weak: Aside from the deleterious effects of another headwind to global trade, the global growth pulse is showing further signs of weakening. Though it proved a better than estimated result, US ISM Manufacturing data printed at its weakest since the GFC on Friday night.
The US 10 Year Treasury yield remained mired 0.61 per cent, with the US yield curve flattening as a result. The US Dollar traded mixed, up against high beta-currencies and the Pound, but down against the Euro and Yen. And gold also bounced, rallying 0.83 per cent Friday to close trade at $US1700.
7. The week ahead: The data this week will home-in on earnings, central banks and macroeconomic data. Over 55 per cent of companies of the S&P500 have already reported, and although few market-moving names release earnings in the week ahead, market participants continue to track the aggregate earnings growth figure of the companies that are updating the market.
The RBA and Bank of England both meet, and aren’t expected to materially change their policy suite. The RBA also delivers its Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday. And the big macroeconomic event will be US jobs data on Friday, which is forecast to reveal the US unemployment rate jumped to 16 per cent in April.

ASX futures down 7 points or 0.1% to 5230

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What you need to know on Monday, May 4th:
The American dollar closed Friday mixed, down against its EUR and the JPY but up against other major rivals. Commodity-linked currencies were the ones that suffered the most, as Wall Street plunged.
The US April ISM Manufacturing PMI came in at 41.5, down fro the previous 49.1 but above the expected 36.9. The sub-components, however, were quite disappointing, particularly the employment one, which plunged to 27.5.
US President Trump menaced to impose fresh tariffs on China amid the miss-handling of the coronavirus outbreak, weighing on the market’s sentiment. Wall Street closed deep in the red, further undermined by dismal earnings reports.
UK PM  Johnson was optimistic about the coronavirus situation, as he tweeted that the kingdom is “past the peak and on the downward slope.” Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that the UK will lift the lockdown anytime soon, suggesting an extended economic setback ahead.
Gold prices recovered ground on Friday amid renewed risk aversion. Spot gold settled at around $1,700.00.
US crude oil settled just below $20.00 a barrel after Baker Hughes reported the number of active rigs declined for a seventh consecutive week to 408 from 465 in the previous week.
Cryptocurrencies spent Sunday consolidating near their recent highs. BTC/USD clings to modest gains above $9,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk says Tesla’s stock price is too high, and now it has fallen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday that Tesla’s stock price is “too high imo,” and the stock fell immediately after. Tesla’s stock is down more than 10 percent.
Last year, Musk made an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to have a company lawyer pre-approve tweets about Tesla’s finances, sales, or deliveries last April. The settlement exists because Musk tweeted he was thinking of taking Tesla private, “funding secured.” The SEC sued him for securities fraud as a result.
Here is Musk’s entire tweet:
On February 19th of last year, Musk tweeted that Tesla would make “around” 500,000 Tesla Model 3s in 2019, which was not in line with the company’s guidance at that time. The SEC then asked Musk if he was complying with the order to have his tweets reviewed. It turned out that he wasn’t, which led to a weeks-long legal battle for a stricter settlement agreed upon in April 2019. Tesla and Musk are still defending themselves from shareholder lawsuits stemming from the go private tweets.
When asked by The Wall Street Journal if he was joking in today’s tweet about Tesla’s stock price or if the tweet had been vetted, Musk only replied “No” in an email.
Musk followed today’s tweet about the stock price being too high by tweeting the lyrics to “The Star-Spangled Banner,” America’s national anthem. This also has echoes of his response to the SEC: he’s called the agency’s response to his February 19th tweets “an unconstitutional power grab.”
Update May 1st, 1:57PM ET: Added comment from Musk obtained by The Wall Street Journal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk's bizarre tweet wipes $14 billion off Tesla market value in hours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk may lose his job as Tesla chief execuive as the carmaker's board, as well as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have taken into account his bizarre tweet that brought Tesla's market value down by $14 billion in hours.
The tweet saying that Tesla stock was "too high" also knocked $3 billion off Musk's own stake in the electric carmaker.
His earlier notorious tweet in August 2018 — when he posted about Tesla "going private, funding secured" at $420 a share — cost him his role as chairman.

The August 2018 tweet resulted in Musk and Tesla reaching a settlement of fraud charges with the SEC. The settlement included $40 million in penalties, split equally between the company and Musk, and the removal of Musk as chairman of the Tesla board.
"As a result of the settlement, Elon Musk will no longer be Chairman of Tesla, Tesla's board will adopt important reforms -- including an obligation to oversee Musk's communications with investors -- and both will pay financial penalties," Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said in a statement.
According to the SEC's complaint, Musk's misleading tweets caused Tesla's stock price to jump by over six percent on August 7, and led to significant market disruption.

On Friday, Musk again stirred the controversy by tweeting that "Tesla stock price is too high imo (in my opinion)".
Tesla's market valuation was worth around $141 billion before the first tweet and it nosedived to nearly $127 billion. One user replied to Musk: "Are you doing it because you need the cash or is this to protest the world burning down?"
Musk replied: "Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down".
Musk is supposed to seek pre-approval if his tweets include anything regarding the company's securities, including his acquisition or disposition of shares, nonpublic legal or regulatory findings or decisions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bank transfer of 2nd installment of Rs. 500 to women Jan Dhan a/c holders from Monday: Fin Min</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Women Jan Dhan bank account holders will start getting the second installment of Rs. 500 from Monday in line with the announcement made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in March.
To help the poor tide over the COVID-19 crisis, the government had on March 26 said ex-gratia payment of Rs. 500 would be credited to women Jan Dhan account holders for the next three months, starting from April.
“Installment of Rs.500 for the month of May has been sent to the bank A/cs of PMJDY women beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package. Beneficiaries are requested to follow the schedule shared below to visit banks & CSPs. Money can also be withdrawn via ATMs & BCs,” Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda said in a tweet on Saturday.
The transfer has been staggered over a period of five days to avoid rush at the bank branches. This will help in ensuring social distancing and avoid overcrowding in banks, he said.
As per the schedule, women account holders under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) having account number with last digit as 0 and 1 will get the money in their account on May 4, while accounts ending with 2 or 3 can approach the bank on May 5. On May 6, beneficiaries with account numbers ending with 4 or 5 can collect their money, while accounts ending with 6 or 7 may withdraw on May 8. The last tranche would be remitted on May 11 for account numbers ending with 8 or 9, the tweet said.
In case of emergency, one can withdraw the money immediately. However, for orderly disbursal, one must follow the banks’ payment plan, it said. Beneficiaries may withdraw any day at their convenience after May 11, it added.
Beneficiaries are encouraged to use the neighbourhood ATMs with RuPay cards, Bank Mitras and customer service points (CSPs) as much as possible to avoid crowding at the branches, it said. “Please note that there will be no charges for withdrawing money from other bank ATMs, at present, as per the government directives,” it said.
During April as many as 20.05 crore women Jan Dhan account holders received Rs. 500 each in their accounts as the first installment. The total disbursement under the head was Rs. 10,025 crore as on April 22.
In a bid to mitigate hardship caused by the coronavirus crisis, the government in late March announced a Rs. 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash doles to poor women and elderly.

As per the schedule, women account holders under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) having account number with last digit as 0 and 1 will get the money in their account on May 4, while accounts ending with 2 or 3 can approach the bank on May 5.

The last tranche would be remitted on May 11 for account numbers ending with 8 or 9, the tweet said.
In case of emergency, one can withdraw the money immediately. However, for orderly disbursal, one must follow the banks’ payment plan, it said. Beneficiaries may withdraw any day at their convenience after May 11, it added.
Beneficiaries are encouraged to use the neighbourhood ATMs with RuPay cards, Bank Mitras and customer service points (CSPs) as much as possible to avoid crowding at the branches, it said.
“Please note that there will be no charges for withdrawing money from other bank ATMs, at present, as per the government directives,” it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM meets Shah, Sitharaman for second stimulus package as lockdown continues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met two senior ministers and civil servants from the economic ministries to prepare a second stimulus package for the economy hit by a nationwide lockdown triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Modi, after his meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will hold talks with key economic ministries such as Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), PTI reported quoting unnamed sources. The finance ministry, which deferred on Friday releasing the monthly Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection numbers, will make a presentation to Modi later in the day on the state of economy and initiatives that it plans to undertake to help the economy.
Modi met with aviation, labour and power ministries on Friday. He had detailed deliberation with commerce and MSME ministries among others on Thursday with focus on attracting both domestic and overseas investment and revival of small businesses in the country so that the recovery process is hastened. Shah and Sitharaman were present in these meetings, reported PTI.
Small businesses, farmers, women, poor, migrant workers and other marginalised sections are likely to benefit from the second stimulus, Business Standard reported on April 28. Industries worst hit by the lockdown--aviation, hospitality, automobiles, real estate, and logistics to name a few—will have to wait. Any support for these sectors and big industry will only happen later down the line, once economic activity normalizes to some extent, officials said.

Sitharaman on March 25 announced a stimulus worth Rs 1.7 trillion or around 0.8 per cent of India’s GDP--much smaller compared to most other G-20 nations. The United States’ stimulus package was pegged at 11 per cent of GDP, that of Australia was at 9.7 per cent, Brazil was at 3.5 per cent, as per data portal Statista.
The government said on Friday it would extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks after May 4, but would allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones under a plan to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
The home ministry issued new guidelines to regulate life and work in this period, based on districts divided into red ( coronavirus hotspot), green and orange zones. There will be considerable relaxations in the districts falling in the green and orange zones, the government said.
A number of activities will remain prohibited throughout the country, irrespective of the zone. Travel by air, rail, metro and inter-state movement by road will remain banned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Modi for new structural reforms to revive economy hit by COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi, May 02: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday underlined the need for new structural reforms and expedite work on infrastructure projects to revive the economy reeling under the impact of coronavirus-induced lockdown.
He made these observations during a series of meetings held on Saturday to discuss strategies and interventions in the financial sector as well as structural reforms to spur growth and welfare in the current context.
The series of meetings with key Cabinet ministers, officials of economic ministries is likely to culminate into a second stimulus package for sectors, including MSME and the farm sector, hit hard by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
Dwelling on the issue of welfare of workers and the common man, the Prime Minister pointed out the need to generate gainful employment opportunities by helping businesses overcome difficulties due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, an official statement said.
The Prime Minister also stressed on the need to strengthen major structural reforms undertaken in the past and new structural reforms in the areas of corporate governance, credit markets and infrastructure sectors were also discussed, it said.
He also stressed the need to take speedy measures to commence work on new infrastructure projects and speed up works in the infrastructure sector so as to make up for the time lost in COVID-19.
He wanted the projects taken up under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) be reviewed at the highest level frequently to avoid time delays and enable the creation of jobs.
The task force on NIP has recently submitted a report which projected a staggering Rs 111 lakh crore investment in the infrastructure sector by 2024-25.
The statement further said that it was also discussed that the reform initiatives undertaken by the various Ministries should continue unabated and the action should be taken in a time-bound manner to remove any obstacles to investment flows and capital formation.
The meeting was attended by the Home Minister, the Finance Minister, Secretaries of the Ministry of Finance along with senior officials of the Government of India.
At a meeting with the finance minister and officials, the prime minister discussed strategies and interventions to support MSMEs and farmers, enhance liquidity and strengthen credit flows.
He also discussed ways and means to ensure financial stability in the wake of COVID-19 and measures taken to enable businesses to recover quickly from the impacts.
Earlier in the day, MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari said that his ministry has suggested a relief package to the prime minister and the finance minister for the medium, small and micro sector and exuded confidence that an announcement would be made soon. "Chaired a meeting on strengthening our MSME sector, which plays a pivotal role in economic development.
There were extensive discussions on ways to make this sector more vibrant, attractive and ready to embrace new opportunities," the prime minister said in a tweet after the meeting.
The Prime Minister in another tweet said, "Held a meeting to discuss subjects related to the financial world, including structural reforms that will give a boost to growth and public welfare. We reviewed strategies to support the MSME sector and ensure liquidity & credit supply."
The central government is focused on ensuring welfare of workers, helping businesses overcome the difficulties arising in the wake of COVID-19, reforms in corporate governance, credit markets and the infra sector, he said.
During another meeting concerning the farm sector, various reforms in agriculture marketing, management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of the statute were discussed.
The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development, an official statement said.
"Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure the fairest return to farmer were some of the important areas covered. Developing e-NAM into a platform of platforms to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics of discussion," it said.
A discussion also emanated on the possibilities of the uniform statutory framework in the country to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in agrarian economy, it said, adding, the pros and cons of bio-technological developments in crops or enhancement of productivity and reduction in input costs were also deliberated.
During the deliberations, each ministry made recommendations and possible steps to be taken in the short run to prop up the sector administered by them.
After a detailed review of every sector, a relief and stimulus package will be worked out, sources said.
The prime minister already had meetings with different ministries including civil aviation, labour and power on Friday.
He had detailed deliberation with commerce and industry ministry among others on Thursday.
To mitigate hardships faced by the bottom of the pyramid, the government in late March had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash doles to poor women and elderly.

Disney is selling non-medical face masks in the US featuring characters from across its multiverse, including Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, the company announced.
Disney will donate one million masks to underserved communities via humanitarian aid organization MedShare, and all profits from the mask sales in the US through September 30th, up to $1 million, also will go to MedShare.

“We realize this is a challenging time for families and wearing any type of mask can be daunting,” Edward Park, senior vice president of Disney store and shopDisney said in a statement. “Our hope is that Disney’s cloth face masks featuring some of our most beloved characters will provide comfort to the families, fans and communities that are so important to us.”
The masks come in packs of four for $19.99 and are available for pre-order now in Disney’s online store, and come in various sizes, including children’s sizes. According to the shopDisney site, the company expects the masks to be available by July 15th.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will US exchange trading floors still be relevant post-coronavirus?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: The coronavirus pandemic has upended US equities trading with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.
The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc , closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in Mar 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group , Cboe Global Markets Inc and Nasdaq Inc also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.
Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on Jun 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange's electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.
At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.
"Our position has always been that when our customers tell us that there's no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team," Tilly said.
The NYSE is the only US exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.
While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
"Only time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor," the study said.
The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.
CME, which runs the world's largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10 per cent of its business was done.
"We will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location," CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.
The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.
"Participants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor," said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

CME, which runs the world's largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10% of its business was done.
"We will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location," CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.
The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said.
"Participants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor," said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will trading floors of US bourses still be relevant in post-Covid-19 world?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic has upended US equity trading, with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.
The NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in March 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group, Cboe Global Markets Inc and Nasdaq Inc also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.
Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.

Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on June 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange's electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.
At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.

"Our position has always been that when our customers tell us that there's no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team," Tilly said.
The NYSE is the only US exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.
While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
"Only time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor," the study said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ireland unveils 6.5 billion euro coronavirus business package</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBLIN: Ireland will allow firms impacted by the coronavirus crisis to warehouse tax liabilities for 12 months, offering a "lifeline" as part of an additional package of business supports that could reach 6.5 billion euros (US$7.2 billion), the government announced on Saturday (May 2).
Commercial rates will also be written off for three months, a 2 billion euro credit guarantee scheme introduced for small and medium sized businesses and Ireland's sovereign wealth fund mandated to invest 2 billion euros directly into bigger firms, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.
After a lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, Ireland laid out a roadmap on Friday for a gradual re-opening of the economy that could allow building sites and some retailers to reopen in two weeks, with restaurants following in June, hotels in July and finally pubs in August.
The government concentrated its initial 8 billion euro fiscal response on increased jobless payments and wage subsidies for workers, with 1 billion euros of liquidity supports offered to reeling firms.
The much larger package on Saturday also included a 10,000 euro restart grant for micro and small businesses. Ireland's main business lobby, IBEC, welcomed the measures as an important further step in addressing the cashflow crisis facing many.
Highlighting the scale of the economic shock, Donohoe said firms had deferred 800 million euros of tax in March alone and that that figure could reach 2 billion euros by June.
He also hoped the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's (ISIF) new equity fund would lead to investment far in excess of the 2 billion euros available capital as it will seek to maximise added capital from existing shareholders and new co-investors.
While Jobs Minister Heather Humphries said more supports will be needed for sectors that will find the coming months harder than others, Donohoe said the acting government had not yet considered any potential sector-specific cut to VAT rates.
Hotels, restaurants and pubs, which will only be allowed operate at limited capacity when they open, have called for the VAT rate for the hospitality sector to be temporarily cut to 0 per cent from 13.5 per cent and for state funds to help them pay rent.
Donohoe said a new government would be required to enact the tax deferral and credit guarantee schemes, the first tangible sign that the political deadlock since an election in February election could directly hurt business if it cannot be broken.
Donohoe's Fine Gael and rival Fianna Fail are trying to find enough support from smaller parties to form a coalition. No new legislation can be passed until a new government is formed and selects the remaining members of the upper house of parliament.
"It is very clear to me that there are economic decisions that our country will need relavent to keeping jobs and creating new jobs that in the coming weeks will require the election of a new Taoiseach (prime minister)," he told a news conference.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Republic announces €6.5bn package to support business struggling with pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Irish Government has announced a suite of measures to help businesses struggling in the coronavirus emergency.
Multi-euro recovery funds were agreed in a special cabinet meeting the morning after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a five-stage road map to reopening society.
The measures include a €2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund and a €2 billion Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years.
A €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses, a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses, the “warehousing” of tax liabilities for 12 months after recommencement of trading and a commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall were also announced.
The Republic's finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
“Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses and our economy have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality. But, by working together, we are minimising the damage,” he said.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.”
The Irish government has already rolled out a multibillion-euro package of assistance for employers and workers during the crisis.
Around 450,000 workers are receiving state payments through a temporary wage subsidy scheme, while around another 600,000 have applied for a special Covid-19 unemployment benefit.
The Government has also significantly expanded financial support for small and medium sized-businesses.
On Friday, Mr Varadkar announced the current lockdown has been extended until May 18, at which point phase one of the “journey to a new normal” will commence.
Each stage is three weeks apart, but the country will only move from one to the other when medical experts confirm it is safe to do so.
The fifth phase is scheduled to commence on August 10 if everything goes to plan.
While the majority of restrictions remain in place for another fortnight, two will ease in the coming days.
From next Tuesday, a travel limit that has forced people to stay within 2km of home when exercising will be extended to 5km, and self-isolating over-70s will be advised they can leave home for a walk or drive.
On May 18, outdoor work, like construction and landscaping, will resume.
Some retail outlets – like garden centres, hardware stores and repair shops – will also reopen.
Mr Varadkar said some outdoor sporting and fitness activities in small groups would also be allowed from that date.
Cafes and restaurants are set to reopen in phase three, which will start on June 29, but pubs are not due to reopen until phase five.
Phase four, which will start on July 20, will see hotels and hairdressers opening for business.
In terms of sport, golf and tennis will be permitted in phase one while close-contact sports such as rugby will have to wait until phase five on August 10.
Mr Varadkar has expressed hope that the show-piece All-Ireland GAA finals could go ahead this autumn, albeit behind closed doors.
In phase one, people outside of the same family unit can meet in groups of no more than four in an outdoor setting.
In phase two, starting June 8, visits to the homes of over-70s and other vulnerable groups will be permitted with strict social distancing and hygiene steps.
The plan does not include any timescale for lifting the cocooning advice.
Mr Varadkar said advice on wearing face masks or coverings in shops and public transport would be issued when the plan begins to roll out on May 18.
Mr Varadkar said schools and colleges will reopen in September/October at the start of the new academic year.
Education authorities are to assess whether Leaving Cert exams for final-year students could go ahead in July in the absence of the wider school population.
Mr Varadkar said it was still the plan for sixth year students to spend two weeks in class ahead of the exams starting.

The five phase plan was agreed by Cabinet on the back of advice from experts on the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).
The current lockdown period had been due to expire on Monday.
The Taoiseach has stressed the blueprint is a “living document” and steps outlined in later phases could potentially be implemented sooner.
He also predicted that the two-metre social distancing guidelines could be reduced, potentially by half.
The total number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Ireland rose to 1,265 on Friday, after another 34 deaths were announced.
As of Friday, there had been 20,833 confirmed cases of the disease.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lufthansa hopeful on deal for German state aid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN: Europe's biggest airline group Lufthansa said on Sunday (May 3) it was close to a deal with the German government on state aid to ease the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The group, which warns it is bleeding cash and might have to declare insolvency, had appeared to be stalled in its bid for up to 10 billion euros (US$11 billion) in aid, according to a report in the weekly Der Spiegel.
But in a note from Lufthansa directors to staff seen by AFP, the company said it has held "intense and constructive exchanges" with the German government on the financial help.
"In our view these discussions could be concluded in the near future," it said.
"Support from the German state constitutes an essential step towards ensuring our future," it said, as Europe begins to ease measures taken to stem the spread of COVID-19.
Like other airlines worldwide, Lufthansa and its subsidiaries that include Swiss and Austrian Airlines have been essentially grounded and face an uncertain future once their operations are fully up and running again.
In April, chief executive Carsten Spohr said the group was carrying fewer than 3,000 passengers daily compared with a pre-pandemic average of around 350,000 a day.
"We are losing about a million euros in liquidity reserves per hour. Day and night. Week by week," Spohr warned.
According to Der Spiegel, the German government is holding out for a stake of just over 25 per cent in the group in exchange for financial aid, which would put Berlin in a position to block strategic decisions by Lufthansa management.
NO BLANK CHEQUES
The Social Democratic Party (SPD), which includes Finance Minister Olaf Scholz among its ranks, has warned Lufthansa it cannot expect a blank cheque from Berlin.
"The state is not some idiot that will just hand over money and have no say after that," SPD leader Carsten Schneider told the daily Die Welt in comments to appear on Monday.
In particular, he ruled out dividend payments to Lufthansa shareholders if the company received state aid.
But Lufthansa directors have warned that without such aid they could declare insolvency to benefit from a grace period during which they could try to sort out the group's finances.
That might mean job cuts, especially given that Spohr has said there are now 10,000 too many workers given the state of Lufthansa's operations.
Around 700 of its roughly 760 aircraft are currently parked at airports and more than 80,000 of its 130,000 staff are on part-time work schemes.
The director's letter to staff nonetheless voiced optimism, saying: "We are still convinced, in light of the talks with Berlin, that we will not have to go with alternative options."
Swiss authorities have already agreed to guarantee loans of up to 1.2 billion euros to Lufthansa, while Austrian Airlines has asked the government in Vienna for 767 million euros in state aid.
The group's supervisory board is to meet on Monday, and hold an online general assembly a day later.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US-China angst tests ‘sell in May’ mantra for emerging markets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even without all the prevailing risks to the global economy, emerging-market investors head into the first full week of May with history against them.Because in eight of the past 10 years, May has proved a losing month for stocks, currencies and local bonds in developing economies.
The uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic, a resurgence in U.S.-China tension and the collapse in corporate earnings merely makes the likelihood of declines this coming week all the stronger. Emerging markets pared weekly gains on Friday while implied currency volatility jumped by the most in six weeks as President Donald Trump revived an attack on China, speculating it could have spread the coronavirus and threatening trade tariffs.
“The biggest new development that could weigh on emerging markets is the pick-up in geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Eric Stein, the Boston-based co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Corp., which manages about $500 billion. “Negativity still hangs over the asset class,” even as global monetary and fiscal stimulus lifted emerging markets during April, he said.
Purchasing managers index data due for release from a number of developing countries this week will offer clues on the depth of the downturn after China’s report on Thursday showed overseas demand slumped. Last month’s gains in the Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso may be tested as the two nations announce gross domestic product data.
Interest-rate decisions will also be in focus in Malaysia, the Czech Republic and Chile. However, the most significant policy meeting may be in Brazil, where a fresh political storm involving President Jair Bolsonaro and the easing of lockdown measures even as the virus infection rate rises have combined to make the real the world’s worst-performing currency this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">April Makes More Market History</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
While the March sell-off broke records, April was historic in its own right, as stocks posted a stunning recovery to finish the month more than 30% off the March lows.
Although the coronavirus pandemic continued to command the world’s attention, focus gradually shifted to reopening the economy as the virus began to slow in major European and US hotspots. Meanwhile, economic data and corporate earnings previewed the extent of the damage from the virus-driven lockdown. Unemployment claims in the US soared and initial first-quarter GDP took its biggest hit since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. But renewed hope for a potential coronavirus treatment and plans to ease stay-at-home orders in several states helped close out an exceptionally strong month for the market.
US equities
Although still negative year-to-date, the S&P 500® and Dow Jones Industrial Average had their best month in decades, returning 12.8% and 11.2% respectively. It was small caps, though, that really shined, rebounding significantly after investors abandoned them in March in favor of presumably stronger mega-cap stocks.
FactSet Research Systems
All 11 S&P sectors finished higher, led by energy, which rallied remarkably despite collapsing oil prices. Growth stocks performed relatively better than their value peers, as larger tech companies drove profits in the new “stay-at-home” era.
FactSet Research Systems
International equities
International equities were also positive but lagged well behind the US market as the virus slowed in China and European hotspots. Latin American stocks were among the worst performers as those countries are highly geared toward the oil market, which fell to unprecedented levels last month.
FactSet Research Systems
Fixed income
Interest rates fell modestly, resulting in positive returns for US Treasuries, especially those with long durations. Taxable bonds were somewhat stronger in April, led by investment-grade corporates. Munis were in the red, well behind their taxable counterparts amid Senator Mitch McConnell’s comments about allowing states to declare bankruptcy.1
FactSet Research Systems
Looking ahead
While April’s market recovery was robust, the pandemic is just beginning to make itself felt in US economic data, and the road to recovery will undoubtedly be marked by fits and starts.
Following the Federal Reserve’s first regularly scheduled meeting since issuing two emergency rate cuts in March, Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy would “likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter.” But he doubled down on the Fed’s “whatever it takes” stance and pledged to keep interest rates near zero until full employment and inflation return.2
We’re not out of the woods just yet, but we are making positive strides. Here are some themes for the weeks ahead:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global stocks will keep a cap on any major gains this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: As companies and economies further reveal the damage caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, markets will stay wary of making any significant gains this week.
Global stocks closed marginally higher last week as investors cautiously raked in gains in spite of dire economic data and corporate earnings that demonstrated the devastating effect of lockdowns.
Markets ended April in comparatively better shape amid growing optimism that movement restrictions will be eased further this month as countries entered the recovery phase of the coronavirus crisis.
However, sentiment turned sour on Friday after US President Trump threatened to levy tariffs on China for their handling of the coronavirus outbreak – reviving an issue that dogged markets all through last year, the US-China trade spat.
Before this latest sign of market weakness, the S&P 500, an index broadly considered to represent global markets, rallied over 36 per cent since March-lows, and also recovered over 65 per cent of the COVID-19 selloff.
One cannot dismiss growing doubts on whether the seemingly unending trade tensions between the world’s top two economies will flare up again in the near term.
But while this calls for market participants to turn nervous, analysts feel it is more likely that investors will use it as an excuse to lock in profits.
“With the US Presidential election only six months away, President Trump is unlikely to follow through on any of the upcoming tariff threats,” wrote Ed Moya, a market analyst with OANDA.
“The main driver for weakness in stocks is the profit-taking with mega-caps Apple and Amazon,” Moya further added, referring to the market decline seen during the end of last week.
While tech giant and iPhone maker Apple last week reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations, CEO Tim Cook warned of uncertain times ahead. Also, Amazon signaled they are spending all of their second quarter profits on its coronavirus response, while calling for caution among its investors.
Beyond coronavirus, the focus this week again will be on central banks with scheduled meetings of the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia, with no policy changes expected.
“We do not expect significant announcements from either (RBA or BoE) as measures previously announced remain a work in progress,” said Aditya Pugalia, director of financial markets research at Emirates NBD.
“Investors will also keenly watch the non-farm payroll data which is likely to confirm the extent of damage to employment as shown by initial jobless claims figures.”
Analysts expect a total of 20 million people to be unemployed in the US, while the jobless rate balloons to 14 per cent in the world’s biggest economy.
“This is no surprise, given the way initial jobless claims have surged over the past month, but comes as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the world’s largest economy,” noted Chris Beauchamp, IG chief market analyst at online trader IG Group.
Also, US earnings will continue to come through thick and fast, with Disney, PayPal and Uber the names to watch, as investors wait to see how these firms are dealing with the global economic crisis.
The improvement in risk appetite in global markets was underpinned by central banks reaffirming their commitment to providing ample support as and when required.
“Global equities, over the past month, have remained in a league of their own,” Pugalia added. “The price movement indicates that equity investors retained their focus on central bank support and easing measures announced by various governments.”
Many investors are under the impression that any ease in stringent curfews will give way to a sharp global recoveries in the second half of the year with the hope the negative fallout will be short-lived, especially if a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is found.
However, most analysts are distancing themselves from this general market wide optimism, while calling for more volatility going forward.

    <h5 class="mb-1">3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week: Disney, General Motors, Tesla</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After finishing its best month of gains in about three decades, the stock market started May on a sour note as sentiment turned negative on the worsening unemployment situation and increasing tension between the U.S. and China over the spread of coronavirus.
Millions more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, sending the six-week total above 30 million since the coronavirus pandemic began to shutter businesses across the country. With that huge economic cost, President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese imports, blaming the Asian nation for misleading the world about the pandemic.
If Trump acts on his threat, that could again start a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, diminishing prospects for a quick economic recovery. All major U.S. benchmarks, including the S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ, slumped about 3% on Friday.
In the coming week, we'll still see a few big names from different sectors of the economy reporting their first-quarter numbers. Here's what we're watching:
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) reports earnings for the fiscal 2020 second quarter after the closing bell on Tuesday, May 5. Analysts are expecting $18.05 billion in sales and $0.93 a share profit per share.
With the entertainment giant’s theme parks closed all over the world due to COVID-19, Disney is expected to report earnings from resorts and consumer products fell by $500 million or more in the period.
The Burbank, CA-based company is also suffering on other fronts: there are no live sporting events for its ESPN network to cover and no theaters currently open where its movies can be shown. Film and TV production has shut down, and its cruise ships are docked.
Faced with these challenges in the coming quarters, Disney probably won’t have much positive news to provide and could avoid delivering future guidance. One bright spot could be the subscriber numbers on its newly-launched streaming service, Disney+ which is benefiting from the stay-at-home environment.
Shares have fallen 27% this year, closing at $105.50 on Friday, after a 2.5% decline for the day.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) will report results for the first quarter before the market opens on Wednesday, May 6. The carmaker is expected to show $0.47 a share profit on sales of $32.09 billion.
Auto manufacturers are among the worst hit companies in this pandemic. Global lockdowns have forced them to close their plants, while at the same time sales have collapsed.
Last week, GM suspended its dividend and  share buyback program as the largest U.S. automaker seeks to preserve cash. The moves announced Monday follow other cash-saving measures taken at the beginning of April, when the company deferred 20% of salaried workers’ pay, cut top executive compensation and put 6,500 employees on leave.
GM shares have plunged more than 45% this year, massively underperforming the benchmark S&P 500 which is down about 13% since the beginning of 2020. The stock fell more than 6% on Friday to close at $20.90.
Investors in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are likely to face another volatile week. The electric carmaker’s shares plunged on Friday after its CEO, Elon Musk, said in a tweet that Tesla stock is too high.
Musk posted more than a dozen times in a span of less than a 75 minutes on Friday, claiming he’s selling “almost all” of his physical possessions and won’t own a house. He also renewed his call for reopening the U.S. economy.
It’s not the first time Musk has warned investors about the high price of his own stock. In the three most recent events, Tesla shares remained in the red one year out, while in the 2013 episode, Tesla plunged 30% in the following month. It eventually recovered over the one-year period, According to Baird Equity Research cited by CNBC.
Investors became more confident about Tesla this year, after the carmaker released a better-than-expected earnings reports, raising expectations that the company was in a stronger position to withstand the coronavirus-triggered slowdown. Shares of the Palo Alto-CA company fell more than 10% on Friday, closing at $701.32.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK-US trade talks to begin on Tuesday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK will plough ahead with trade talks with the US on Tuesday as both nations insist that the negotiations will not be derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
A video conference call will be held between Liz Truss, international trade secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative.
The first round of negotiations will last for two weeks and will involve 200 officials. Future talks will take place every six weeks, according to officials.
The ability for the UK to strike trade deals with individual countries has always been seen as a major prize by the Eurosceptic politicians who led the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.
The Department for International Trade has suggested that a successful deal with Washington could eventually boost the UK economy by £15bn a year.
The department says its analysis suggests that an FTA would benefit every region and nation of the UK with the greatest benefits in Scotland, the midlands and north-east.
However, the government has previously said that such a US deal could boost GDP between 0.07 per cent and 0.16 per cent, prompting claims from some trade experts that the net effect would be negligible compared to the loss of trade resulting from leaving the EU’s single market and customs union.
A cross-Whitehall study conducted in 2018 suggested that growth would be reduced by 2 to 8 per cent in the same period as a result of Brexit.
The UK talks will be led by Oliver Griffiths, director of US negotiations at the DIT, and overseen by Crawford Falconer, chief trade negotiation adviser for the department.
Ms Truss said she would “drive a hard bargain” to secure a deal that benefited the UK and help the economy bounce back from the economic challenges posed by Covid-19.
“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country,” she said.
Washington is expected to demand a relaxation on some regulations in agribusiness, such as allowing imports of chlorinated chicken, which could prove politically unpalatable. Ms Truss has previously said that maintaining food standards is a “red line” for the UK.
Donald Trump, US president, initially said that access to the National Health Service would be “on the table” during the talks, only to distance himself from those comments a few months later.
In early March, the UK government released its negotiating objectives document in which it said that boosting trade for small and medium companies was a priority.
Although the primary focus is on goods, the UK is hopeful of boosting trade in digital services. The UK also hopes to secure an early deal on financial services and will run talks in parallel on improving ties between the City of London and Wall Street.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The significant move comes amid growing optimism that the two countries can have a first stage deal in place by the end of the year when the UK’s transition period with the EU comes to an end. 
 The International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are launching negotiations through a video conference call.  This first round of negotiations will last for around two weeks and will involve around 100 negotiators on each side.
Meanwhile, Tory MPs are pressing the government to ensure trade deals are in place to speed up Britain’s recovery from the coronavirus.
Despite being the risk-positive news, the fears of the US-China trade war keep the US dollar strong against the majority of its counterparts amid the early Asian session on Monday. That said, the GBP/USD remains on the back foot around 1.2480 by the press time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK trade talks with US begin Tuesday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — The U.K. and U.S. will launch talks on a free-trade agreement on Tuesday.
U.K. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss will hold an initial video call with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, with around 100 officials listening in from both sides.
Truss pledged to drive a "hard bargain" with Washington and insisted a trade deal is "essential' to ease the economic burden of the coronavirus.
The first round of talks is set to take two weeks, with further rounds roughly every six weeks. Britain hopes to win lower goods tariffs on its exports to the U.S. on things like cars and ceramics, as well as a package on services, among other things.
Ministers hope negotiations with Washington will pile pressure on the EU in the Brexit trade talks, where the two sides are at an impasse over key sticking points such as fisheries and level playing field rules to limit competition.
Truss said: “As we kick off trade negotiations this week, we will drive a hard bargain that benefits every part of the U.K. and works for the small businesses who are suffering most in this difficult period.”
Jeff Emerson, the spokesman for the U.S. trade representative, added: "I can confirm the talks start Tuesday by video-conference."
On the U.K. side, the talks will be led by negotiator Oliver Griffiths and overseen by Chief Trade Negotiation Adviser Crawford Falconer. The talks will be held remotely until travel becomes possible.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain will begin the first round of post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US this week as the Government seeks to strike an “ambitious” relationship which “opens up new opportunities” to UK businesses.
International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer will launch the negotiations via video conference call because of the Covid-19 crisis.
Around 100 negotiators on each side will take part in the talks, the first round of which are set to last for a fortnight.
Further rounds will take place roughly every six weeks, and will continue to be carried out remotely until it is safe to travel.
“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.
“As we sit down at the negotiating table early next week, be assured that we will drive a hard bargain to secure a deal that benefits individuals and businesses in every region and nation of the UK.”
Talks will be led on the UK side by UK-US chief negotiator Oliver Griffiths, while all UK trade negotiations are being overseen by the Department for International Trade’s chief trade negotiation adviser Crawford Falconer.
It comes after the UK blamed Brussels for having made “limited progress” during the second round of negotiations on a future trade deal between the European Union and UK.
Negotiators have warned their counterparts across the Channel that Britain will “not subordinate” its laws to the EU “in any areas” and called for more flexibility from the bloc in order to strike a deal.
The EU’s negotiation mandate stated that the UK must sign up to some Brussels-set regulations to prevent the bloc being undercut on standards once the transition period ends in December.
Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, last month accused the UK of refusing to commit “seriously” on numerous fundamental points during the talks, which took place via video-conferencing technology because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said: “With the US election now just six months away, we should all be extremely wary of a president who will do anything to stay in the White House, and a Conservative Government that will do anything to help him.
“That is a recipe for a trade deal designed for the benefit of the major corporations behind American industry, farming and healthcare, which will have very real implications on workers’ rights, environmental protections, the food we eat and our beloved NHS.
“If Boris Johnson will not stand up to Donald Trump, then the British Parliament must. This is too important to get wrong.
“Labour will insist that any proposed trade deal is subject to proper scrutiny, and we will not let the interests of the British people be sacrificed to boost the profits of US corporations.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">International Economic Week In Review 4/27-5/1</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Investment thesis: Most of the markets are still far too speculative to make any kind of investment. We're starting to get the economic reports about the severity of the damage and its severe. However, the China and Brazil trades from last week are still attractive for now.
The latest Markit PMI for Chinashows a modest contraction in manufacturing (emphasis added):
Here's a chart of the data:
Notice how quickly the data bounced back to near the 50 level that separates expansion and contraction. New orders were at their lowest level in three months while employment dropped and backlogs increased. The primary problem is the drop in new export orders, which is shown in this chart:
China was the first country hit by the pandemic; it shut down its economy about a month to a month and a half before other regions. The drop in export orders is caused by that four-to-eight-week delay. I would expect it to bounce back within the next few months.
The Bank of Japan released its latest summary of economic projections and economic outlook, which contained the following observation about the long-term risks to the economy (emphasis added):
While the first concern has been implied in the financial press, it hasn't been explained this well. The current thinking about the pandemic appears to be that it is largely a March-June period of aberrant economic activity that will naturally resolve itself by mid-3Q20. Assuming that to be the case, the consensus forecast is for a 2H20 economic rebound. But the longer this goes on, the more pronounced the negative impact of sentiment, which will have a negative impact on consumer and business spending.
This is the first time I've seen the second observation and it's a very interesting point to make. The BOJ is arguing that should the outbreak continue for an extended time, the global economy would be forced to completely rethink itself using "information and communications technology" as central components of that transformation. It doesn't say what this will look like, only that technology would enable it to happen.
In other news, Japanese retail sales were down 4.6% Y/Y in March while industrial production declined 5.2%.
South Korea continues to be the best performing COVID economy: industrial production only decreased .3% M/M in March while retail sales increased 1%.
Russia released two coincidental economic data points. 1Q GDP rose 2.1% Y/Y in 1Q20 while retail sales increased 5.6% Y/Y in March. Neither data set includes lockdown information, so the only thing they really show is that the Russian economy was in fair shape before the lockdown.
EU GDP contracted 3.5% Y/Y in the first quarter:
There is also new information from the largest EU economies:
Today, not only did the ECB add a number of new programs to support liquidity, they also issued a new "whatever it takes" statement (emphasis added):
Don't be surprised to see additional facilities in the future.
Statistics Canada released a flash estimate for March GDP:
Let's look at this week's performance table:
Last week was a stellar week for Latin America: the ETF that tracks the region was the best performer, gaining 7.31%. Brazil rebounded from its sell-off, taking on a gain of 6.41%. A majority of the indexes were up or down modestly. China was the worst-performing sector; it was down 2.28%.
Last week, I noted that traders with a high risk appetite might want to consider going long China or short Brazil. Both markets did the exact opposite.China was breaking out very nicely - until there was new talk of trade sanctions and heightened tensions between it and the US. There was also an uptick in hostilities between the mainland and Australia, as that country argued there should be an international investigation of the virus outbreak.Brazil rallied during the first part of the week but sold off on Thursday and Friday.
I'd hold on to both for at least another week with a sell-stop on the China position just in case there's a sudden uptick in the war of words.

    <h5 class="mb-1">After lockdowns, economic sunlight or a long hard slog?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The strong recovery in global financial confidence caused the S&P 500 index to rebound 13 per cent in April, leaving US share prices only 9 per cent below their levels at the end of last year. This may seem puzzling, given the slim prospect that a vaccine against the virus, or effective treatments, will become available soon. 
The surge appears to rest on the pattern shown in gross domestic product forecasts from the big investment banks (see box), which is mainly driven by the expected path for supply shutdowns.
Based on indices of lockdown policies published by the Blavatnik School of Government, and on population movements shown on Google Maps, it is likely that supply curtailments in the advanced economies reached their peak in April.
From May onwards, a combination of gradual policy relaxations and normalisation of consumer behaviour should allow the global economy to bounce back. China has already seen industrial activity rebound as shutdowns have been relaxed since late February, although exports are now weakening markedly amid global recession.
Growth expectations have also been supported by the sheer scale of the monetary and fiscal policy easing introduced around the world in just a few weeks.
Thomas Huray at Fulcrum estimates that the direct fiscal measures introduced in the advanced economies so far is equivalent to 6 per cent of 2019 nominal gross domestic product, roughly double the equivalent stimulus from 2008 in the financial crisis. Furthermore, JPMorgan estimates that the expansion in central bank balance sheets may exceed 18 per cent of GDP by 2021, about three times the scale in the financial shock.
The relatively optimistic forecasts for the advanced economies seem to treat the 2020 downturn in a similar fashion to a recession caused by a natural disaster, which has a catastrophic immediate effect but then disappears extremely rapidly. If that pattern is repeated this year, the implication is that share price valuations may be only minimally affected by discounted future profits. 
According to a very interesting analysis by Zach Pandl of Goldman Sachs, the equity markets are assuming that the storm will blow over very quickly, with GDP growth rates being higher not lower than normal in 2021. On that basis, equities do not look particularly overvalued.
However, Mr Pandl adds that this outcome would be unique among recent recessions in the country. In a normal cyclical downturn, predictions for GDP growth are reduced in successive years once a recession becomes inevitable. This is particularly true in the second year after the recession starts, suggesting no early bounceback to previous peak activity. The decline in output becomes persistent, not a springboard for recovery.
This more normal pattern underpinned the strong concerns expressed by Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell last week about the medium-term risks to the productive capacity of the US economy following a very deep recession.
Mr Powell also said that the course of coronavirus itself is a new form of economic uncertainty. He is clearly right about this. Although the key infection rate — the reproduction rate — has almost certainly dropped below one in most countries during the lockdowns, there have already been indications from Germany and Singapore that improvements can be partially reversed as restrictions are relaxed.
The grim arithmetic of epidemics strongly suggests that any increase in the R rate significantly above one may lead, sooner or later, to a large second wave in infections that will need to be suppressed.
In his press conference on Thursday, the UK prime minister Boris Johnson promised that the country was now approaching “sunlight and pasture” after passing through the “huge tunnel” of Covid-19. But his chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, suggested it would still be a “long slog” for all countries from here. Unfortunately, the scientist has probably got it right.
Fulcrum has collected an indicative selection of economic forecasts from leading investment bank economists. The average of these suggests that the level of GDP in the global economy will fall by 6 per cent in the first half of 2020, but then rebound to exceed pre-crisis levels of output by the beginning of 2021. 
China is out of synchronisation with the advanced economies, and has already started to recover. This results in some smoothing in the cycle for the world as a whole.
The US economy is expected to show a similar broad pattern, although both the recession and the recovery are expected to be much sharper than for the global economy as a whole. The level of US GDP is expected to fall by 12 per cent in the first half of this year, returning to pre-crisis levels only in mid 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Risk To Escalate When U.S. Monthly Employment Data Released Next Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the release of the US and EU GDP figures, Q1 is behind us. Amidst the great uncertainty, there is at least one thing that is clear. The current quarter is going to be worse, even if not for China. The good news is that with lockdowns gradually easing, the US and European Union, and parts of Asia are probably near the peak of the economic contraction.
The March data suggested China was likely past its low point, and the April PMI, if one accepts it as face value, shows the domestic economy is gaining traction. The non-manufacturing PMI rose to 53.2 in April, which is above the six-month, 12-month, and 24-month averages (49.5, 51.6, and 53.0, respectively). Fears that China will take advantage of the situation to buy depressed assets are prompting many countries to look to tighten up rules about foreign direct investment, especially by state-owned companies. There also appears to be greater sensitivity to sectors, such as medicine and medical equipment, in which officials want to discourage foreign investment.
In the week ahead, the April PMIs may pose some headline risk, but the preliminary reports steal most of the thunder. The May reports will be more interesting as the economies may begin showing signs of stabilizing, before turning up in June or July. The week will start slowly as China and Japan are on holiday through Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
The most interesting, if not important, data point next week the US national employment data at the end of the week. In the four-week period up to the week the establishment survey was conducted, weekly initial jobless claims rose by an astounding 22 mln. Given high levels of uncertainty and unknowns, this gives a rough sense of the magnitude of the impact and, by chance, is also the median forecast for the loss of jobs last month. This in on top of the 701k jobs lost in March.
From the household survey, the unemployment rate is derived. The rise in weekly jobless claims suggests something on the magnitude of 16.0%-16.5%. Here too, the impact has been so profound that the normal confidence intervals around forecasts are not helpful. Under usual circumstances, the difference of a couple tenths of a percent in the unemployment rate (or 100k in the nonfarm payrolls) is significant. Still, now the more considerable variability has been granted. It is also understood that the data lags the developments on the ground, and that thing will get worse in the months ahead.
The US economy contracted by 4.8% (annualized pace) in the first quarter. It held up better than China (-9.8% quarter-over-quarter) and the eurozone (-3.8% quarter-over-quarter). The second quarter will likely tell a different story. China may return to growth. Local government infrastructure spending will provide the necessary fillip. The downturn in Europe and the US will accelerate sharply. A 10%-15% contraction in Q2 in the eurozone looks reasonable. In the US, the annualized decline in output of between 20% and 30% would not be surprising.
The idea that the US economy will be "rocking" by July, as some officials have suggested, seems like one of those aspirational truths rather than a thoughtful economic projection. First, without a cure or vaccine, it appears that new flare-ups of the virus are nearly inevitable as social distancing is relaxed. Second, in aggregate terms, almost an eighth of the US workforce depends on mass transportation. Of course, it is not evenly distributed, with several large urban centers accounting for the bulk, and only about half of workers have access to public transportation. Until people feel safe, the re-opening can only go so far.
Canada also reports April jobs data at the end of the week. Remember the proportions: As a rough and ready estimate, Canada's GDP is a little less than 1/10 of the US, and its population is a little more than 1/10 of America's. It lost more than a million jobs in March (divided almost 50/50 between full and part-time positions. As of May 1, there were three contributors to the Bloomberg survey for Canada's April jobs data. Two of them were looking for jobs losses of 5 mln or more. The third was the outlier at a still staggering 1.2 mln. The unemployment rate could rise toward 20%. 
Canada entered the crisis with fiscal capacity. Consider that the federal government's deficit was a little more than 0.5% of GDP in 2019. The ratio is a function of how large the contraction in the denominator (GDP) and how much the numerator (deficit) will rise. Canada's fiscal response is estimated to be almost C$100 bln or a little more than 4% of (2019) GDP. The IMF's new World Economic Outlook projects the Canadian economy to contract by 6.2% this year. Canada could wind up with a budget deficit of something around 5%. In contrast, the US budget deficit in 2019 was about 4.7% of GDP. The Congressional Budget Office projects this year's shortfall to be near $3.7 trillion or 18% of GDP.
A common refrain is that US yields are low because the Federal Reserve is buying Treasuries. It is obscuring the price discovery process. Perhaps, but not in the way that one might suspect. If the Fed stood back completely and pulled back from the alphabet soup of facilities, the capital markets would seize up like a cardiac arrest. The demand for Treasuries would surge. Interest rates would plummet. This is not a projection or forecast. It is what happened for a few days in March when the markets were unhinged, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to almost 30 bp. The stabilization of the capital markets saw the 10-year yield rise. Last month, it traded between about 54 bp and 78 bp. 
As the markets stabilized, foreign central banks also stopped selling Treasuries. For six consecutive weeks beginning in early March, foreign central banks sold nearly $110 bln of US bonds from their custody accounts the Federal Reserve holds for them. In percentage terms of their holdings, it is rather minor. When their holdings bottomed in early April, they were worth about $2.85 trillion. 
Still, it helped spark the Fed to offer repo facilities so foreign central banks would not have to sell their Treasuries. We were skeptical of its merits as 1) banks were already providing this kind of facility, and 2) that foreign central banks were not the disruptive element. Subsequent research at the Bank for International Settlements suggests it was large pools of leveraged capital playing for small incremental movements played a significant role, for example. 
The repo facility does not appear to have been utilized. However, as the capital markets stabilized, foreign central banks have begun buying back their Treasuries. In the last three reporting weeks, foreign central banks have bought about $24 bln of US Treasuries for their accounts at the Fed. 
One thing that could scare foreign investors and especially central banks is anyone who gave the recent press report that the possibility of that the US would default on debt owned by China a shred of credibility. Even if the US wanted to get China to "pay for Covid-19" by not servicing its debt, it is more complicated then merely not sending Beijing a check on the interest of the nearly $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries it held at the end of February (according to US estimates).
It was quickly denied by Trump's chief economic spokesperson Kudlow. One cannot help but wonder why it was leaked in the first place. It is clear that such a topic is sacrosanct. Even broaching it is dangerous. The amount of money saved by not servicing debt that is owed to China would be lost many times over as a consequence. 
Was it planted intentionally to allow for the denial, and making the other retaliatory measures more palatable?  Other actions, like removal of its sovereign immunity, which would make China subject to lawsuits in the US, is a dangerous road to embark upon as the US also benefits from it. The US could deny government pension funds from investing in Chinese stocks, but it would likely impact the returns more than China. 
While some US officials appear to have already reached a conclusion, many other countries in Europe and Asia have called for a thorough investigation. It is disheartening and troublesome that China is attacking those seeking an inquiry and not cooperating with the World Health Organization that is looking into the origins of the virus. 
China's markets are closed for the extended May Day holiday, which will carry into the first couple of days in the week ahead. The offshore yuan sold off on May 1, and the roughly 0.75% decline was the most since mid-March. The dollar was at its best level in nearly a month, reaching almost CNH7.14. Some suspect it could be China firing a warning shot. It might be, but it does not seem like the most likely explanation. The offshore yuan's decline began during US trading on April 30 and took another leg up in the NorthAmerican session on May 1. There was no need for Chinese officials to do anything because the market was doing it for them if a softer yuan was desired. Asset managers with onshore yuan or offshore yuan exposure (e.g., Dim Sum bonds) might want to hedge the currency risk using the offshore market. Speculators can express their views easier in CNH than CNY. We note that ahead of the weekend, US yields were slightly softer, as the equity losses, disappointing earnings, and weak data sapped risk appetites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trudeau announces $240 million investment in virtual healthcare</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the government is investing $240 million to bring healthcare online amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
During his daily briefing on May 3rd, Trudeau noted that the government is expanding existing tools and creating new virtual platforms for mental health and primary care.
He stated that the online platform for mental health will include strategies to manage stress and also allow people to get support from a professional. Further, Canadians who are in marginalized communities and who require specialized tools will be able to get specific help.
The $240 million investment will also include funding for virtual primacy care. Trudeau said this is important for times when you don’t necessarily need to see a doctor in person.
“By helping doctors run appointments online, you can stay safe at home while getting care, and our hospitals can stay focused on those who need it most,” Trudeau said.
He stated that since Canadians are practicing physical distancing, now is the perfect time to invest in online healthcare.
“If we can use apps to order dinner, video chats to stay in touch with family, we can use new technology to keep each other healthy.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM Trudeau announces major funding for virtual health care, antibody research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- The federal government will spend more than $240 million to make it easier for mental health care and other medical services to take place online.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made that announcement Sunday, saying the funding will go toward new platforms for mental health care and primary care, as well as expansions of existing virtual care supports.
"If we can use apps to order dinner and videochats to stay in touch with family – we can use new technology to keep each other healthy," Trudeau said, adding that there will also be specific tools aimed at people in marginalized communities who require specialized care.
Canadians' mental health seems to have suffered over the past seven weeks as many have spent most of their days at home, feeding feelings of isolation and stress.
One survey released last week found that Canada's self-reported depression rate has more than doubled during the pandemic, while the percentage of Canadians reporting high levels of anxiety has quadrupled. Experts warn that these problems could get even worse as physical distancing and widespread societal closures continue, particularly as it becomes clear that this year will bring a summer unlike any other.
The Mental Health Commission of Canada is offering a new, free online mental health program targeting essential workers. A group of doctors wants long-term mental health supports to be made free for all Canadians, and some Indigenous leaders say their communities are especially at risk for declining mental health.
Trudeau also announced Sunday that the government will give more than $175 million to AbCellera, a Vancouver-based company that says it has isolated hundreds of antibodies that could be used in a potential COVID-19 treatment.
AbCellera has said it could be ready to test its antibody therapy on humans as soon as July.
In addition, the prime minister said more details would be revealed later in the day about a new supply council that will focus on keeping Canada with a steady supply of personal protective equipment and other items considered important in the fight against COVID-19.
"Until we have effective treatments – or better yet a vaccine – we still need a reliable supply of everything from masks to ventilators," he said

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trudeau announces $240M for virtual health-care services</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ottawa is investing $240.5 million in online mental health services during the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his Sunday morning press conference.
Existing online tools will be expanded, and new virtual platforms for mental health and primary care will be created, along with specialized programs for those in marginalized communities.
"If we can use apps to order dinner and video chats to stay in touch with family, we can use new technology to keep each other healthy," Trudeau said, noting telehealth allows patients to stay home and receive support to ease the burden on hospitals and clinics. 
This news comes after the government launched the Wellness Together program, which provides tools and resources to help those struggling with anxiety, stress or substance use, in April. At the time, Trudeau also invested $7.5 million into Kids Help Phone, while Premier Doug Ford announced a $12-million investment into digital health services. 
Since the start of the pandemic, virtual health care has quickly grown. Ontario's services include Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), a non-profit government initiative; Women’s College Hospital, which is on its way to becoming the country’s first virtual hospital; and a new program at SickKids, to name a few. 
Maple, the country's largest national telehealth network, which provides both mental health and primary care services, went from seeing an average of 1,000 patients a day to 4,000.
The doctors behind many of these programs have been hoping to see more sustainable public funding in an effort to bring more services to those in marginalized regions of the country, along with more affordable options, as much of the virtual health-care space has been flooded by expensive, private companies.
Trudeau also announced more than $175 million in funding for Vancouver-based biotech firm AbCellera. The company has identified antibodies that could be used for COVID-19 treatment, and human trials could take place as early as July.
The prime minister also said Ottawa will establish a COVID-19 supply council, mandated to find "innovative solutions" that ensure the country has a consistent supply of personal protective equipment as demand for masks, gloves and hand sanitizer increases from the private sector.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor stresses on need to step up credit flow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HYDERABAD:   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday reiterated the need to improve credit flow, particularly extending working capital to MSMEs besides implementing the 3-month moratorium in toto. Interacting with the chiefs of major public and private sector banks via a video conference on Saturday, Das acknowledged the banking officials’ contribution during the lockdown and discussed the current economic situation in the country.
Reviewing the current situation, he underscored the need to step up credit flow to different sectors including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), micro finance institutions, housing finance firms and mutual funds. Last week, the central bank even opened a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity window to enable mutual fund houses to tide over the crisis.
However, the response has been lacklustre with banks borrowing a mere Rs 2,000 crore, implying that the crisis among mutual funds isn’t as severe. Despite RBI reducing the reverse repo rate to 3.25 per cent discouraging banks from sitting on cash, they continued to park suplus funds with the central bank, and as much as Rs 7 lakh crore is parked under the reverse repo window.
Some of the other topics discussed during the meeting included post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital with special focus on credit flows to small businesses, implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI, monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector, the central bank said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor takes up credit flow issue with public, private bank chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday took up the issue of improving credit flow to various sectors of the economy, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with the chiefs of major private and public sector banks. However, banks said they were looking for a credit guarantee support from the government, while extending loans to NBFCs and also proposed that a decision on extending the three-month moratorium on loan repayments can be taken at the end of May.
The RBI review, called by Governor Shaktikanta Das, has come at a time when non-food credit has plummeted by Rs 33,872 crore to Rs 102.8 lakh crore during the fortnight ended April 10 and the government extended the lockdown by another two weeks to May 17.
The meeting reviewed the current economic situation and credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to NBFCs, micro finance institutions, housing finance companies and mutual funds, the RBI said. The meeting, conducted through video conference, also took up post-lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs and implementation of three months’ moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI.
Explained
With many sectors in the doldrums due to the lockdown, banks are expecting bad loans to rise after June when the moratorium period ends. The extension of moratorium and a government guarantee scheme will give more comfort to the banks which have turned risk averse now.
While banks had extended the loan moratorium to their customers, they have not extended the same facility to NBFCs and MFIs, which borrow from banks. On extending government guarantees to loans to MSMEs and NBFCs, the CEO of a nationalised bank said, “In many countries, the government stepped in and they are giving guarantees particularly for the loans or the incremental credit even to the MSME sector.” This means the liability will be contingent in the books of the government and banks can leverage those guarantees. Banks say it can be a good model to help out borrowers, particularly MSMEs, it’s not clear whether the government is keen on such a proposal.
On the poor credit flow to various sectors, a bank official said, “Unless the economic activity picks up, the demand for credit isn’t likely to pick up and the lack of credit growth is not in my view currently because of any risk aversion.” Though many PSU banks have come out with Covid-19 loan schemes for MSMEs, credit flow has not picked up to the desired levels. The RBI has conducted long-term repo operations (LTRO) for banks at the repo rate of 4.40 per cent, but banks are preferring better rated corporates while ignoring the claims of small units and NBFCs. On extending the moratorium beyond May 31, he said, “Let’s wait till May 31 and then see that what is the demand or what is the situation and depending upon the situation on the ground, I think these are the things which the RBI can take a view and take a calibrated approach. I think the next view probably will be taken after May 31.”
As per the RBI, the Governor “appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal” operations during the lockdown … Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector were discussed.
Bank deposits rise on outflows from debt mutual fund segment
While banks witnessed a contraction in credit outstandings, deposits increased during the fortnight ended April 10. Deposits rose by Rs 1,47,435 crore to Rs 137.1 lakh crore, largely due to the outflows from the debt mutual fund segment. However demand deposits (savings accounts) saw an outflow of Rs 1.35 lakh crore, while time deposits (FDs) surged by Rs 2.82 lakh crore. ENS

The central bank also discussed the issue of loan moratorium in the meeting. The issue assumed significance in the light of the recent Supreme Court ruling that banks need to follow the RBI guidelines on moratorium in letter and spirit.
There was a lot of customer complaints that banks and other lending institutions were not extending the loan moratorium benefit, particularly to non-banking finance companies.
Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to NBFCs, micro finance institutions, housing finance companies and mutual funds, were discussed in the meeting, the RBI said. Some of the mutual funds also faced redemption pressure due to which RBI had opened a window specifically for these entities which can be accessed by banks to tap liquidity to lend to mutual funds. However, there was not much appetite from banks to tap the liquidity window.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Das appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal operations during the lockdown period, the RBI said. The interaction was held in two separate sessions through video conferencing.
Post-lockdown credit flows, including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs, were also discussed. The government has provided significant relaxation for starting economic activities in the third phase of the lockdown that starts from Monday.
Some other issues that came up during the interaction was monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe, and stability of the financial sector.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Guv Shaktikanta Das discusses credit flow to MFs, NBFCs, MFIs with bank CEOs, MDs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held meetings with heads of domestic banks on the economic situation and credit flow to different sectors of the economy, among other issues, the central bank said in a release .
“The governor held meetings with MDs/CEOs of major public and private sector banks today in two separate sessions through video conference. The meetings were attended by Deputy Governors and other senior officers of RBI,” it said.
Das discussed credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including availability of liquidity to NBFCs, microfinance institutions (MFIs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and mutual funds.
NBFCs and MFIs have been demanding a moratorium on their bank obligations as they have been forced to give similar leeways to their lenders. They have been dealing with lack of liquidity, as banks and mutual funds have become wary of lending to them for fear of defaults.
Independent estimates peg the funding gap for NBFCs at Rs 60,000 crore despite RBI’s efforts to make funds available at cheaper rates. Das also reviewed the current economic situation, post-lockdown credit flow, including provisions for working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs and implementation of the three-month moratorium on repayment of loan installment announced by RBI.
Medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) have been the worst hit as the extended lockdown has left them starved of cash. Industries have been waiting for a stimulus package from the government, which is yet to see the day of the light.
The RBI Governor also deliberated on monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe and stability of the financial sector during the meetings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI governor discusses NBFC liquidity, moratorium with bank chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das separately met on Saturday chiefs of public and private sector banks to review India's economy, liquidity of non-bank financial companies (NBFC) and a moratorium for lenders during the coronavirus pandemic.
Deputy governors and other senior officers of the central bank attended the video meeting, too, said the RBI in a statement on its website.
Das took stock of “credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to Non-Banking Financial Companies, Micro Finance Institutions, Housing Finance Companies, Mutual Funds, etc.”
He praised banks for their work during a national lockdown to contain the coronavirus, and stressed on ensuring credit “with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises),” the statement said.

Das enquired about the implementation of a three-month moratorium the central bank has announced for repayment of loan installments. The Supreme Court told the RBI on Friday to ensure that banks pass on the moratorium benefits to the customers properly.
The central bank told banks to monitor their overseas branches because of the slowdown in economies across the globe. The meeting also saw discussions around the stability of the financial sector, the RBI statement said.
Early this week, finance ministry reviewed support including emergency credit line extended by large public sector banks to units impacted by Covid-19 triggered lockdown. State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda have together sanctioned close to Rs 10,000 crore as an immediate credit assistance to affected units.
Banks have built internal capacities for assisting companies including MSMEs. The feedback from interactions is expected to act as input for policies that are in works. However, it was not clear when the package would be finalized, officials said.
Credit growth in almost every sector decelerated in March 2020 from a a year ago as the country went into a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis, data released from the RBI showed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett remains optimistic about future despite coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire investor Warren Buffett doesn't know how or when the economy will recover from the coronavirus outbreak shutdown, but he remains optimistic in the long-term future of the United States.
Buffett said Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's online annual meeting that there's no way to predict the economic future right now because the possibilities are still too varied. Berkshire's meeting was held without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend because of the virus.
"We do not know exactly what happens when you voluntarily shut down a substantial portion of your society," Buffett said because it has never been done. He said it may take several years to understand all the economic implications of the coronavirus outbreak, but it hasn't changed his long-term view because the country has endured wars and depressions before.
“In the end, the answer is never bet against America,” Buffett said.
It's not clear how long the virus will continue to weigh on the economy, Buffett said. He said there could still be unpleasant surprises from the virus and the way people react to it.
“You're dealing with a huge unknown,” Buffett said, so businesses and investors can't be certain of what will happen in the near future.
Buffett said he doesn't expect major banks to have significant financial problems during the virus crisis because they are in much better shape than they were during the financial crisis of 2008.
All of the events surrounding the annual meeting, including a trade show where Berkshire companies sell their products, were cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Buffett had a different partner for the question session.
Instead of sitting next to business partner Charlie Munger in an arena filled with shareholders, Buffett was joined this year by Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who oversees all of the company's non-insurance businesses, to answer questions in front of a Yahoo Finance camera.
“It's certainly a break with years and years of tradition with Buffett and Munger,” said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker who wrote a Buffett biography and has attended every annual meeting since 1985.
The fact that Abel appeared alongside Buffett will add to speculation that he could one day succeed the 89-year-old billionaire as CEO, but it likely also reflects the fact that Abel is based relatively close to Omaha, in Des Moines, Iowa. Abel and fellow longtime executive Ajit Jain, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses, are seen as the two most likely successor candidates although Buffett has no plans to retire.
Omaha missed out on the profits that comes from all the out-of-town visitors attending the meeting. Local economic development officials estimate that Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting normally provides a $21.3 million boost to the area.
Buffett and Abel discussed the nearly $50 billion loss that Berkshire reported Saturday morning and the huge pile of cash the company is holding.
Berkshire said it lost $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, during the first quarter. That's down from last year's profit of $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per Class A share.
The biggest factor in the loss was a $54.5 billion loss on the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio as the stock market declined sharply after the coronavirus outbreak began.
Berkshire’s revenue grew 1 percent to $61.27 billion. The company said revenue slowed considerably in April as the virus outbreak negatively affected most of its businesses. Berkshire closed several of its retail businesses, such as See’s Candy and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, this spring while BNSF railroad and its insurance and utility businesses continued operating while adjusting to reduced demand.
Berkshire is sitting on a pile of more than $137 billion cash because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company recently and he wants to be prepared to endure any crisis. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it was striking that Buffett didn't find any bargains to invest in at the end of the first quarter.
“The lack of investment activity really sticks out,” Shanahan said.
Buffett said that Berkshire sold roughly $6.5 billion of stock in April when it unloaded his company's roughly 10% stakes in the four largest airlines. Buffett said he decided that he made a mistake in how he valued airlines, so he sold all of Berkshire's American, Delta, Southwest and United Continental airline stock.
Buffett said he hasn't made any big deals during the coronavirus crisis because he hasn't seen any on attractive terms. He said many companies have been able to borrow money in the market in the past two months because the Federal Reserve stepped in to keep markets moving, so they haven't turned to Berkshire for help.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

He said there could still be unpleasant surprises from the virus and the way people react to it. Buffett said government programs to help people and businesses who are struggling during the virus outbreak make sense.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nigerian workers deserve three months tax holiday — TUC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share on FacebookShare on Twitter
The President of the Trade Union Congress, Quadri Olaleye, has called on the three tiers of government to grant three months tax holidays to Nigerian workers.
Olaleye made the appeal in his contribution at the Workers’ Day Virtual (online) dialogue with stakeholders to commemorate this year’s annual Workers Day, organised by The Nigerian Workforce Strategy and Enlightenment Centre in Ilorin, Kwara State on Saturday.
He also advised the government to invest massively in the public health sector to encourage frontline health workers, urging government to give reasonable palliatives to Nigerians during the ongoing lockdown.
He urged the government to diversify the economy and standardise the health sector, stressing the need for the government to create jobs and enabling environment for businesses to thrive.
The Executive Director and Lead Strategist at NIWOSEC, Dr. David Ehindero, said the aim of the virtual dialogue was to develop an effective and participatory model of engagement for stakeholders in the Nigerian industrial labour system.
Ehindero said the need to provide an alternative platform for stakeholders to commemorate the annual event despite the COVID-19 related social distancing were amongst the aim of the initiative.
He said: “Part of the objective of the virtual dialogue is to engender interrogation and discussion on the industrial relation and workplace implications of COVID-19 pandemic.
“To articulate vision for a post pandemic era, identifying structure and facilities needed to navigate the socioeconomic environment after the current crisis as well as possible measures to avert prevailing challenges should another challenge occur.”
Dr. Anifowose Kilani, the Chairman, Signa Sabitors, also advocated for comprehensive and compulsory insurance cover for Nigerian workers.
He identified the need for workers to have access to genuine and authentic information, adding that lack of authentic information can affect the psychology of workers.
“Government must handle relaxation of lockdown with caution in order to forestall increasing rate of infection of COVID-19,” Kilani advised.
The Director of Research, Planning and Curriculum Development at the Michael Imoudu National Institute for Labour Studies, Edwin Anisha, also called on the government to ensure that workers do not lose their jobs as a result of COVID-19 crisis.
Anisha advised government to develop unique business models and avoid copy and paste of policies in its resolve to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There is need for government to strengthen public health institutions to respond to emergency health challenges and urgently ensure that there is reliable data with which they could adequately guarantee social interventions,” he said.
The Vice-President, Industrial Global Union, Issa Aremu, in his contribution counselled workers to be creative while the COVID-19 crisis lasts.
Aremu said: “Workers and government should explore the opportunities in the health challenges confronting the country, new jobs can be created while concentrating on the old ones.
“I would also like to stress the need for labour leaders to be more involved in politics and governance.
“Governance should not be left to politicians.
“Everybody should be interested in what is going on in the government.
“There is the need for comprehensive approach to political and economic development as it affects workers.”
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the theme of the Workers Day virtual dialogue was: “COVID-19 And Its Implications For Nigeria Workers.”
The organisers said it was designed to suggest appropriate policy measures for the sustainability of businesses, job security, guaranteed income security and extend social protection and relief to workplace categories most impacted by the pandemic and vulnerable persons in the society.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nigeria workers deserve three months tax holidays, TUC appeals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Mr Quadri Olaleye, has called on the three tiers of government to grant three months tax holidays to Nigerian workers.
Olaleye made the appeal in his contribution at the Workers’ Day Virtual (online) dialogue with stakeholders to commemorate this year’s annual Workers Day, organised by The Nigerian Workforce Strategy and Enlightenment Centre (NIWOSEC), in Ilorin on Saturday.
He also advised the government to invest massively in the public health sector, to encourage frontline health workers, urging government to give reasonable palliatives to Nigerians during the ongoing lockdown.
He urged the government to diversify the economy and standardise the health sector, stressing the need for the government to create jobs and enabling environment for businesses to thrive.
The Executive Director and Lead Strategist at NIWOSEC, Dr David Ehindero, said the aim of the virtual dialogue was to develop an effective and participatory model of engagement for stakeholders in the Nigerian industrial labour system.
Ehindero said that the need to provide an alternative platform for stakeholders to commemorate the annual event despite the COVID-19 related social distancing were amongst the aim of the initiative.
“Part of the objective of the virtual dialogue is to engender interrogation and discussion on the industrial relation and workplace implications of COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A decade after debt crisis, Greece on verge of virus recession</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATHENS, May 2 — Ten years after sinking into its worst economic crisis in living memory, Greece once again faces the spectre of a grave recession in the midst of a global coronavirus lockdown.
Though the country has so far been spared the death toll of other European nations at fewer than 150 fatalities from Covid-19, it will not escape the resulting economic downturn, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned this week.
“The consequences of this coronavirus attack will undoubtedly be dramatic,” he told parliament on Thursday.
“We know with certainty that (the recession) will be deep... we don’t know how long the health crisis will last, we don’t yet know if we’ll have tourism.”
Tourism is one of Greece’s most important sources of revenue, along with shipping.
The Greek state alone could lose €8-10 billion (RM38.1-47.6 billion) in income this year, the prime minister said.
Where’s the money?
Greece has already adopted measures worth €17.5 billion, or 10 per cent of national output, to support businesses and employees, Mitsotakis said.
Including EU funds, the package will reach €24 billion, he said.
But the opposition has questioned whether the money has actually reached the intended recipients.
“Where is this money? It’s good for announcements but actual businesses and (employees) have not received a single euro,” former leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras said Thursday, predicting that layoffs will soon be “out of control”.
Greece this year had been counting on a growth spurt of 2.4 per cent. After exiting the final debt crisis bailout in 2018, its borrowing rates were at historic lows — in October Athens even sold treasury bills at a negative rate — and it has cash reserves of more than €36 billion at hand.
But with most of its economy in virus quarantine since March and global lockdowns expected to wreak havoc on tourism, Greece is expected to sink into a 10 per cent recession this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
‘Irreparable’ damage
Panagiotis Petrakis, professor of finance at the University of Athens, argued that the economic blow will be less severe.
“The most likely scenario is a six per cent contraction, provided there is no deterioration in the pandemic,” he told AFP.
Petrakis also believes that the economic impact of this crisis will be less protracted. The IMF itself estimates a 5.5 per cent Greek recovery in 2021.
The Greek finance ministry says the downturn could be limited to 4.7 per cent through support measures, followed by a 5.1 per cent rebound. The jobless rate will approach 20 per cent, it said yesterday.
The government will begin easing lockdown restrictions this month, with most shops opening by May 11 and restaurants and year-round hotels following on June 1.
But few expect any foreign visitors before July.
Many Greek businesses fear the damage will be irreparable, especially with minimum two-metre social distancing requirements squeezing out customers.
“Last summer I had 10 tables outside and 10 inside. Now, I will just have three tables outside and I’m supposed to make do,” says Costas Gogos, owner of a tavern in the port of Rafina near Athens.
“Many will not even reopen, they won’t manage with so few tables,” added a neighbouring restaurant owner.
Memories of 2010
It was on May 2, 2010, when the socialist government of George Papandreou signed the first of three eventual bailouts with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF that would total 350 billion euros.
A week earlier, Papandreou had stunned the nation by announcing the call for international assistance. His televised address from the tiny island of Kastelorizo is indelibly etched in the nation’s collective memory.
In the years that followed, a quarter of Greek national output would be wiped out in wave upon wave of wage and pension cuts and tax hikes demanded by the so-called troika of creditors.
Unemployment soared to a high of 27 per cent before eventually falling to 16 per cent in March, still the highest in the eurozone.
Dozens of general strikes and hundreds of street protests would follow, many of them violent. In one of the worst incidents on May 5, 2010, three people died in a bank set on fire during an anti-austerity protest, one of them a pregnant woman. The culprits were never caught.
The crisis was sparked by reckless state spending and misreporting of fiscal data to the EU. When revealed by Papandreou’s government, it caused Greece’s borrowing rates to spike beyond reach. — AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">A decade after debt crisis, Greece on verge of virus recession</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ten years after sinking into its worst economic crisis in living memory, Greece once again faces the spectre of a grave recession in the midst of a global coronavirus lockdown.
Though the country has so far been spared the death toll of other European nations at fewer than 150 fatalities from COVID-19, it will not escape the resulting economic downturn, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned this week.
"The consequences of this coronavirus attack will undoubtedly be dramatic," he told parliament on Thursday.
"We know with certainty that (the recession) will be deep... we don't know how long the health crisis will last, we don't yet know if we'll have tourism."
Tourism is one of Greece's most important sources of revenue, along with shipping.
The Greek state alone could lose 8-10 billion euros ($8.8-11 billion) in income this year, the prime minister said.
- Where's the money? -
Greece has already adopted measures worth 17.5 billion euros, or 10 percent of national output, to support businesses and employees, Mitsotakis said.
Including EU funds, the package will reach 24 billion euros, he said.
But the opposition has questioned whether the money has actually reached the intended recipients.
"Where is this money? It's good for announcements but actual businesses and (employees) have not received a single euro," former leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras said Thursday, predicting that layoffs will soon be "out of control".
Greece this year had been counting on a growth spurt of 2.4 percent. After exiting the final debt crisis bailout in 2018, its borrowing rates were at historic lows -- in October Athens even sold treasury bills at a negative rate -- and it has cash reserves of more than 36 billion euros at hand.
But with most of its economy in virus quarantine since March and global lockdowns expected to wreak havoc on tourism, Greece is expected to sink into a 10 percent recession this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
- 'Irreparable' damage -
Panagiotis Petrakis, professor of finance at the University of Athens, argued that the economic blow will be less severe.
"The most likely scenario is a six percent contraction, provided there is no deterioration in the pandemic," he told AFP.
Petrakis also believes that the economic impact of this crisis will be less protracted. The IMF itself estimates a 5.5 percent Greek recovery in 2021.
The Greek finance ministry says the downturn could be limited to 4.7 percent through support measures, followed by a 5.1 percent rebound. The jobless rate will approach 20 percent, it said Friday.
The government will begin easing lockdown restrictions this month, with most shops opening by May 11 and restaurants and year-round hotels following on June 1.
But few expect any foreign visitors before July.
Many Greek businesses fear the damage will be irreparable, especially with minimum two-metre (6.5-feet) social distancing requirements squeezing out customers.
"Last summer I had 10 tables outside and 10 inside. Now, I will just have three tables outside and I'm supposed to make do," says Costas Gogos, owner of a tavern in the port of Rafina near Athens.
"Many will not even reopen, they won't manage with so few tables," added a neighbouring restaurant owner.
- Memories of 2010 -
It was on May 2, 2010, when the socialist government of George Papandreou signed the first of three eventual bailouts with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF that would total 350 billion euros.
A week earlier, Papandreou had stunned the nation by announcing the call for international assistance. His televised address from the tiny island of Kastelorizo is indelibly etched in the nation's collective memory.
In the years that followed, a quarter of Greek national output would be wiped out in wave upon wave of wage and pension cuts and tax hikes demanded by the so-called troika of creditors.
Unemployment soared to a high of 27 percent before eventually falling to 16 percent in March, still the highest in the eurozone.
Dozens of general strikes and hundreds of street protests would follow, many of them violent. In one of the worst incidents on May 5, 2010, three people died in a bank set on fire during an anti-austerity protest, one of them a pregnant woman. The culprits were never caught.
The crisis was sparked by reckless state spending and misreporting of fiscal data to the EU. When revealed by Papandreou's government, it caused Greece's borrowing rates to spike beyond reach.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The lockdown due to coronavirus scare has brought economic activity to a grinding halt accompanied with job and livelihood losses, according to an industry chamber survey.The country-wide lockdown imposed on 23 March, while necessary, has had deep ramifications on economic activity, a snap poll conducted by Confederation of Indian Industry has said.According to the CII CEOs Snap Poll on Impact of COVID-19 on Economy and Industry, while a majority of the firms continue to anticipate a significant decline in their topline, they now foresee a delay in economic revival and demand recovery.The survey saw the participation of more than 300 CEOs, of which nearly two-thirds belonged to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.Citing findings from its CEOs, the survey indicated that 65 per cent of the firms expect revenues to fall more than 40 per cent in April-June quarter.Taking cognizance of the deteriorating industry expectations, CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee said, “While the lockdown was necessary to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on the population, it has had dire implications for economic activity. At this hour, the industry awaits a stimulus package for economic revival and livelihood sustenance besides a calibrated exit from lockdown.”The survey results reveal that the country may experience a protracted slowdown in economic activity, as 45 per cent of the CEOs polled feel it will take over a year to achieve economic normalcy once the lockdown ends.On the job and livelihoods front, more than half of the firms foresee job losses in their respective sectors after the lockdown.A significant share of respondents (45 per cent) expect 15 per cent to 30 per cent cut in jobs.However, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported that they have not experienced a salary/wage cut in their firms so far.With respect to their own companies, however, the respondents anticipate a slightly quicker recovery within 6-12 months with 34 per cent of the respondents indicating the same.Further, a major proportion of the respondents anticipate normalcy in domestic demand conditions within 6-12 months, post lockdown.For the full financial year 2020-21, the expectations of a fall in revenue are staggered, with 33 per cent of the firms anticipating a revenue fall of more than 40 per cent, closely followed by 32 per cent of firms expecting a revenue contraction ranging between 20 per cent to 40 per cent.While three out of four firms have identified that a ‘complete shutdown of operations’ was a major constraint being faced by business, more than half of them have also indicated ‘lack of demand for products’ as a hindrance to business activity.The survey also points out that according to a large proportion of the firms, a recovery in domestic demand, for their product or services, may precede the recovery in foreign demand for the same.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Three out of four firms have identified 'complete shutdown of operations' as a major constraint being faced by businesses, whereas more than half of them have indicated 'lack of demand for products' as a hindrance
The country-wide lockdown imposed on March 23, while necessary, has had deep ramifications on economic activity.
A CII CEOs Snap Poll on Impact of COVID-19 on Economy and Industry has found that Indian industry not only anticipates a significant decline in their topline, but also fears that economic revival and demand recovery may take more than a year. The survey saw participation from more than 300 CEOs, of which nearly two-thirds belonged to MSMEs.
Majority of the respondents (65 per cent) expect revenues to fall more than 40 per cent in the current quarter (April-June 2020). For financial year 2020-21, the expectations of a fall in revenue are staggered, with 33 per cent of the firms anticipating a revenue fall of more than 40 per cent, closely followed by 32 per cent of firms expecting a revenue contraction ranging between 20 per cent to 40 per cent.

A similar snap poll conducted a month ago by CII had found significant majority of firms expecting revenues to fall more than 10 per cent.
While three out of four firms have identified 'complete shutdown of operations' as a major constraint being faced by businesses, more than half of them have also indicated 'lack of demand for products' as a hindrance to business activity.
The survey results also suggest the possibility of a protracted slowdown in economic activity. Forty five per cent of the respondents say it will take more than a year to achieve economic normalcy once the lockdown ends. However, with respect to their own companies, 34 per cent of the respondents anticipate a slightly quicker recovery, i.e. within 6-12 months. The CEOs also say the recovery in domestic demand, for their product or services, may precede the recovery in foreign demand for the same.

On the jobs and livelihoods front, more than half of the firms (54 per cent) foresee job losses in their respective sectors after the lockdown ends. A major share of respondents (45 per cent) expect 15 per cent to 30 per cent cut in jobs. However, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported that they have not carried out a salary/wage cut in their firms so far.
Taking cognisance of the deteriorating industry expectations, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, called for a stimulus package for the industry. "While the lockdown was necessary to mitigate the impact coronavirus has on the population, it has had dire implications for economic activity. At this hour, the industry awaits a stimulus package for economic revival and livelihood sustenance besides calibrated exit from lockdown," he states.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reliance to produce new gas from D6 by end of June; to cost USD 2.2/unit at current oil prices</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK have pushed back the start of production from the second wave of discoveries in their eastern offshore KG-D6 block to end June because of restrictions on the movement of people and material the nationwide lockdown has imposed.
At current Brent oil price of around USD 26 per barrel, the gas from R-Series field in KG-D6 block will cost about USD 2.2 per million British thermal unit -- lower than even the government-mandated rate of USD 2.39 for gas from state-owned ONGC fields.
In an investor presentation post its fourth-quarter earnings, Reliance said it is working on three projects in the KG-D6 block, where production from older fields stopped in February this year.
"First Gas from R-Cluster field expected by June 2020 subject to lifting of lockdown," it said.
Gas production from R-Cluster was to start by mid-May but the coronavirus lockdown has delayed it.
Reliance said it expects to achieve a peak output of around 28 million standard cubic metres per day by FY24 when all three projects are up and running.
Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance in November last year auctioned the first set of 5 mmscmd of gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block by asking bidders to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required.
Sources said Reliance had in November set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
Considering current average Brent price of USD 26 per barrel, the gas will cost around USD 2.2 per mmBtu.
Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
In the first round of auction in November 2019, Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL bought a majority of volumes on offer. The price at that time came to USD 5.1-5.16 per unit.
But international oil rates have slumped as demand evaporated due to outbreak of coronavirus and lockdowns imposed by countries around the globe.
Essar Steel had picked up 2.25 mmscmd in the country's first transparent and dynamic forward auction that lasted about five-and-half-hours on November 15, 2019, sources said.
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group and Mahanagar Gas Ltd bought 0.3 mmscmd, sources said, adding GAIL, acting on behalf of fertiliser companies, bought 0.3 mmscmd of gas.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had bought 0.35 mmscmd and 0.10 mmscmd went to Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GSFC)/Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), sources said. In all, 15 customers across sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, city gas, glass and ceramic got gas in the tender, they added.
In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.5 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translated into a price between USD 5.1 per mmBtu and USD 5.16 per mmBtu at the then prevailing Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel.
Initially, Reliance had set a floor quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.
To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production. Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New €6bn package of measures to help firms post-COVID</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Commercial rates are to be waived for three months for business impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A shortfall of €260m on local authorities is to be funded by the Government.
It is part of a new package of supports worth over €6bn agreed by Cabinet.
It includes allowing companies to get a low-interest rate loan to re-open their business.
The measures were agreed at a special Saturday Cabinet meeting, following the publication on Friday of a roadmap for re-opening business.
The Government has already brought forward a series of measures - such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment - but says it is now necessary to introduce a number of additional measures.
Those include a €10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019.
A €2bn Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund will also be available within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).
This will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms.
While a €2bn COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme will also support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years with below market interest rates.
It will also see the ‘warehousing’ of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months after trading recommences.
During this time, the Government says there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue, and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.
The Revenue Commissioners confirmed that COVID-19 related VAT and payroll tax debts - due March 1st to the date when sectoral restrictions are lifted - will be parked for a period of 12 months.
It also said no interest will accrue on the tax debts during this 12 month period.
And after that period, the related tax debts will carry a reduced interest rate of 3%  - down from 10% - until the debt is paid.
Revenue added: "The timeframe allowed to pay the ‘warehoused’ debt will be flexible and determined by the ability of the business to pay both COVID-19 related debts as well meeting its ongoing tax liabilities as they arise in the normal course".
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said: "On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
"We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people."
Business Minister Heather Humphreys said: "We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.
“The new €250m Restart Fund in particular will be a critically important tool to support small businesses in our towns and villages to re-open their doors and get back on their feet with supports of up to €10,000 available."
And Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy added: "The commercial rates waiver is an important response from Government.
"This will provide relief to impacted businesses as well as certainty to local authorities as to their funding.
"Rates alleviation will be complemented by the establishment of a Restart Fund for micro and small businesses which would provide a further €250m to support ratepayers."

The measures are:
Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to “minimise the damage” of the pandemic.
Minister Donohoe said: “Covid-19 has created a world that none of us could have imagined just a few short weeks ago. Our collective public health has been targeted; our businesses, and our economy, have been shouldered with an unimaginable burden; and our society is grappling with this new reality.
.
"But, by working together, we are minimising the damage. The hard work of the Irish people has ensured that we are getting to grips with this disease, our people are united in caring for one another under the most extreme of circumstances and our businesses are attempting to adapt to this new and most challenging environment.
“On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commercial rates waiver and €10,000 restart grant - Government's financial plan to reboot economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Government ministers announced more financial measures today costing up to €6.5bn over the coming years to help “re-boot” the Irish economy.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said €2bn will be made available for loan guarantee schemes for small and medium businesses, a waiving of commercial rates for three months, and a deferral of tax obligations for a period.
The measures are:
“Today’s package of measures aims to help our businesses to restart, reconnect and rehire staff who have been laid off or furloughed,” said Minister Donohoe.
He said the Government has already brought forward a series of measures to support those impacted by this global pandemic.
They have included emergency income support such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. It is now necessary to introduce a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted.
Minister Donohoe said: “On top of the measures previously put in place by Government, this suite of measures being outlined today is designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies, and allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.
“We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting our people, and wider society, and rebuilding our economy so that we can get people back to work safely. We will do this by being cognisant of official public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all our people.”
Finance minister Paschal Donohoe said the measures are designed to "minimise the damage" of the pandemic.
Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys said the economy had moved past the initial shock phase of the coronavirus crisis and was now in a stabilization phase.
The new measures announced today were to fund the third phase – “the re-boot phase.”
She said: “The roadmap announced by Government yesterday outlines a pathway to reopening our economy. This suite of supports represents the next phase in our ongoing response to support businesses through the pandemic and will assist them as they plan for the future’.
“We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.
“The new €250 million Restart Fund in particular will be a critically important tool to support small businesses in our towns and villages to reopen their doors and get back on their feet with supports of up to €10,000 available.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">State goes big in effort to help businesses struggling through shutdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many businesses will have been taken aback by the long timetable for reopening set out by the Government on Friday. However, the programme of new supports announced on Saturday is significant and tries to address the needs of different types of businesses, many now facing a longer closure period than expected and an unprecedented cash squeeze.
Some of this, including a new credit guarantee scheme and further Revenue forbearance on taxes, requires new legislation and will therefore not be finalised until a new Government is in place.
The cost of Covid-19 in terms of additional Government spending is rising sharply. The latest package commits another €6.5 billion in supports to business. Add another €8 billion already committed through wage and income subsidies and higher health spending, and the total is now between €14 billion and €15 billion, or about 7 per cent of national income. An unprecedented crisis has required an unprecedented support programme.
That said, the final exchequer cost of the latest measures will be much less in the long term; a lot of the warehoused taxes will be repaid, not all credit guarantees will be called in and some investments will generate a return.
Still, it will push State borrowing higher and we will be reliant on the European Central Bank’s presence in the markets to help us raise funds at rock-bottom interest rates. This is a vital part of the economic calculation for Ireland in the months ahead.

The financial supports for business announced on Saturday follow the significant wage subsidy scheme, which is helping cover payroll costs. With ongoing fixed costs, many firms are facing a cash crisis and, if not addressed, it will turn into a solvency crisis and threaten their future.
The new schemes announced attempt to address this. A key part of the plan – a credit guarantee scheme committing more than €2 billion – requires new legislation, and it appears this is not possible until a new government is formed and a new taoiseach puts their nominees into the Seanad. With doubts over whether talk to form a government will succeed, this threatens to leave key parts of the plan hanging in mid-air for a prolonged period. It further ups the pressure to form a new government.Decisions on how to respond to demands for VAT cuts for restaurants and hospitality will also fall to a new government.
The schemes fall into a few different headings. The credit guarantee scheme is a vital element, assisting companies to get access to bank loans. This adds to existing credit supports, which have had slow enough draw-downs. Some details remain to be outlined, including the cost – which we are told will be below market rates. This is an important part of the plan to help SMEs, and banks need to be prepared to lend on the basis of the 80 per cent guarantee. Some tweaks in the rules will help.
The other big ticket item is a €2 billion fund to be run by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund to invest in medium and larger businesses, defined as those with more than €50 million in turnover or more than 250 employees. These are designed to be investments on commercial terms to help bigger firms through the crisis. The Government is conscious, according to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, of controversy in other countries over big business taking state support and then paying out money to shareholders or management. Steps are promised to avoid this happening here. As we know from past history, this is a tricky area for Government and managing this will be challenging and potentially controversial.
The other actions involve an extension of measures already in place, including a significant extension of Revenue forbearance (legislation will also be necessary here) and a sensible move to waive rates for three months for firms which have had to shut.
A €250 million restart fund for micro and small businesses will be launched and designed to give them cash support to help restart, based on a refund and waiver of rates from 2019. This will be essential for many of the smallest firms, though the limit of €10,000 may need to be lifted a bit given the pressure many firms are under and the costs of restarting. In time, more cash may be needed here.
Businesses generally welcomed the proposals, although they will look for quick clarification on detail. Given the extended nature of the reopening announced on Friday, the new measures were even more essential as many firms will remain shut for well beyond the 12 weeks initially envisaged. The Government also faces vital decisions on how to extend wage supports beyond this initial 12-week timeline . The business support programme may be amended or added to, but a significant amount of cash is now committed to try to save business and jobs. The next challenge is to get all this operational and get the restart going.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Venezuela’s sending its gold reserves to Iran: This is where socialism leads</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s come to this: Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro is now sending a good chunk of the nation’s gold to Iran in exchange for help propping up the decrepit oil industry.
At least nine tons of gold, worth about $500 million, flew off to Iran last month, government officials told Bloomberg News. That leaves the crisis-plagued nation with a scant $6.2 billion in hard-currency assets, the lowest amount in three decades.
For decades, Venezuela’s oil industry thrived. But under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, the government took over — and began milking it for fast cash while firing expert workers and managers and slashing spending on maintenance, repairs and other vital capital investment.
As a result, everything’s breaking down and output has crashed — even as global oil prices have also collapsed during the pandemic, further squeezing revenues.
Because Maduro won’t allow safe private investment, he has to turn to his “allies” in Tehran — except the regime there insists on hard payment for its expertise. No honor among thieves, y’know.
Nor is oil the only industry in collapse: Reliable electricity, health care and even food are increasingly rare in Venezuela thanks to the Chávez-Maduro regime’s “Bolivarian socialism.”
For years, Sen. Bernie Sanders and lefties around the globe cheered the Chávez-Maduro socialist approach to industry and the economy. But now those economics are forcing Maduro to loot his country’s last reserves to buy help from a pack of theocratic terrorists.
That’s the anti-utopia that progressives’ policies actually deliver.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Report: Venezuela is Using Gold to Buy Oil from Iran</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid economic collapse, Venezuela has been relying on Iran to prop up its oil industry by giving the Islamic Republic tons of gold bars, thereby depleting the South American country’s gold vaults, reported Bloomberg on Thursday, citing sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The outlet reported that “government officials piled some 9 tons of gold—an amount equal to about $500 million—on Tehran-bound jets this month as payment for Iran’s assistance in reviving Venezuela’s crippled gasoline refineries, the people said. The shipments, which resulted in a sudden drop in Venezuela’s published foreign reserve figures, leave the crisis-ravaged country with just $6.3 billion in hard-currency assets, the lowest amount in three decades.”
The Latin American country holds some 70 tons of gold in its vaults, according to Bloomberg.
Mahan Air, which is sanctioned by numerous countries, including the United States, “has flown more than half a dozen jets to the South American nation in the past week alone. Most delivered gasoline additives, parts and technicians to help repair a key refinery along Venezuela’s northwestern coast,” reported Bloomberg. “Mahan has sent other planes to the international airport outside of Caracas, where they are loaded with the gold bars to take back to Tehran, said the people, who asked not to be named because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the transactions.”
Tehran and Caracas have been working together in attempting to evade U.S. sanctions against both countries.
This gold-for-oil exchange exemplifies a bigger issue posed by Iran, according to Emanuele Ottolenghi, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
He wrote in The Dispatch that Venezuela’s “geographic location makes it easier to transfer goods procured on Latin American markets to Iran by plane. Iran can rely on vast networks in Latin America, many of which are linked to local Hezbollah financiers. Over the years, these networks have become involved in numerous illicit activities, including money laundering for drug cartels and gun-running.
“The individuals comprising these networks are usually Lebanese or Iranian nationals holding a local passport from the Latin American country where they reside. Their companies are locally registered and not subject to any sanctions regime. They have no difficulty buying directly from the U.S., including, potentially, dual-use technology—such as commercial drones, some of whose components could be repurposed for military projects. A direct flight from Caracas would help deliver these goods to Iran.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Salaries increase for top mutual fund CEOs on robust business growth</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CEO salaries increased at the country’s top mutual fund houses during 2019-20 on robust business growth, with HDFC Mutual Fund's Milind Barve being the highest paid executive.
According to an analysis of the data made public by mutual funds, the CEO salary given by the top 12 fund houses in terms of assets under management increased in the range of 2-132 per cent in 2019-20 from the preceding fiscal year. However, CEO remuneration of Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, Nippon India MF and DSP MF dropped by up to 19 per cent during the period under review.
The salaries for chief investment officers also witnessed a rise for most fund houses.
Salary disclosed by the fund houses for 2019-20 was decided in April-May 2019 on the basis of 2018-19 profitability, which was at an all-time high for the industry, according to industry executives. Overall, the past fiscal was a good year for the mutual fund industry barring the month of March, which saw record declines amid the coronavirus pandemic. Barve, chief executive of second-largest fund house HDFC MF, claimed the top slot with a salary pay-out of Rs 7.43 crore for the fiscal. His package climbed by 3 per cent from Rs 7.23 crore in 2018-19. In terms of percentage growth, SBI MF, which is the largest fund house in the country in terms of AUM, gave its CEO Ashwani Bhatia a salary jump of 132 per cent to Rs 51 lakh in 2019-20. He had earned a salary of Rs 22 lakh in the preceding fiscal. Ironically, Bhatia is the lowest paid CEO among the top fund houses.
Apart from SBI MF, fund houses like UTI MF and Kotak MF too gave a staggering salary hike to their respective CEOs.
Barve is followed by Nilesh Shah, the top honcho of Kotak MF, who received a pay package of Rs 7.32 crore, 68 per cent higher than Rs 4.35 crore received in the preceding fiscal. ICICI Prudential MF paid Rs 6.98 crore to its MD Nimesh Shah last fiscal, a hike of 12 per cent from Rs 6.25 crore in 2018-19.
Nippon India MF’s CEO Sundeep Sikka got a salary of Rs 6.01 crore, which is a decline of 8 per cent from last fiscal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Salaries increase for top mutual fund CEOs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CEO salaries increased at the country's top mutual fund houses during 2019-20 on robust business growth, with HDFC Mutual Fund's Milind Barve being the highest paid executive.
According to an analysis of the data made public by mutual funds, the CEO salary given by the top 12 fund houses in terms of assets under management increased in the range of 2-132 per cent in 2019-20 from the preceding fiscal year.
However, CEO remuneration of Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, Nippon India MF and DSP MF dropped by up to 19 per cent during the period under review.
The salaries for chief investment officers also witnessed a rise for most fund houses.
Salary disclosed by the fund houses for 2019-20 was decided in April-May 2019 on the basis of 2018-19 profitability, which was at an all-time high for the industry, according to industry executives.
Overall, the past fiscal was a good year for the mutual fund industry barring the month of March, which saw record declines amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Barve, chief executive of second-largest fund house HDFC MF, claimed the top slot with a salary pay-out of Rs 7.43 crore for the fiscal. His package climbed by 3 per cent from Rs 7.23 crore in 2018-19.
In terms of percentage growth, SBI MF, which is the largest fund house in the country in terms of AUM, gave its CEO Ashwani Bhatia a salary jump of 132 per cent to Rs 51 lakh in 2019-20. He had earned a salary of Rs 22 lakh in the preceding fiscal.
Ironically, Bhatia is the lowest paid CEO among the top fund houses. Apart from SBI MF, fund houses like UTI MF and Kotak MF too gave a staggering salary hike to their respective CEOs.
Barve is followed by Nilesh Shah, the top honcho of Kotak MF, who received a pay package of Rs 7.32 crore, 68 per cent higher than Rs 4.35 crore received in the preceding fiscal.
ICICI Prudential MF paid Rs 6.98 crore to its Managing Director Nimesh Shah last fiscal, a hike of 12 per cent from Rs 6.25 crore in 2018-19.
Nippon India MF's CEO Sundeep Sikka got a salary of Rs 6.01 crore, which is a decline of 8 per cent from last fiscal, while the same for A Balasubramanian, chief executive at Aditya Birla SunLife MF, was at Rs 5.41 crore, a decrease of 7 per cent.
IDFC Mutual Fund chief executive Vishal Kapoor's pay package rose to Rs 5.12 crore from Rs 5.01 crore, translating into an increase of 2 per cent.
Chandresh Nigam, chief executive at Axis MF, got a salary of Rs 4.8 crore in the period under review as compared to Rs 3.97 crore in 2018-19.
However, he took home a pay package of Rs 17.67 crore, which included a one time pay-out.
UTI MF's Acting CEO Imtaiyazur Rahman took home a salary of Rs 4.48 crore in the past fiscal, a 97 per cent jump from Rs 2.27 crore paid in 2018-19.
On the other hand, salary of DSP MF's Kalpen Parekh plunged by 19 per cent to Rs 4.2 crore in 2019-20.
The salary of Sanjay Sapre, president of Franklin Templeton MF, was not available for 2019-20 as the company's financial year ends in September. Sapre's salary was Rs 3.50 crore for the year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to Rs 2.99 crore in the previous fiscal.
L&T MF top boss Kailash Kulkarni's salary rose from Rs 2.41 crore to Rs 2.7 crore in the period under review.
The fund houses started disclosing salaries after Sebi, in April 2017, directed them to disclose annual remuneration of all employees earning Rs 1.02 crore or above within one month of a financial year, starting with 2016-17.
Earlier, remuneration of all employees earning Rs 60 lakh or above in a financial year was required to be disclosed.
This is part of Sebi's effort to promote transparency in remuneration policies so that executive salary is aligned with the interest of investors. While a few mutual fund houses have complied with Sebi's directive and disclosed the information, others still have to comply with the rule.
The asset under management of the industry, comprising 44 players, rose to Rs 27 lakh crore at the end of March 31, 2020 from Rs 24.5 crore in March-end 2019 and Rs 23 lakh crore in March-end 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No bank in Nigeria shall retrench staff of any cadre – CBN</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said no bank in Nigeria shall retrench staff irrespective of their  cadre.
The apex bank said in a press release that this is necessary to help mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods.
Earlier, the Managing Director of Access Bank had said in an interview that the bank would lay-off 75 per cent of its workforce which comprises mostly of junior workers.
A special meeting of the bankers’ committee was convened on May 2, by the CBN, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry.
According to the apex bank, the committee particularly deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties.
CBN has, however,  stated in the press release that banks will require its express approval before they can lay-off  staff.
In an interview with The ICIR, Martins Kayode, a financial consultant said, “Some of the banks are scared they would run out of business in no time, so they want to push some workers out to save cost.”
But, according to Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC), banks can help customers and businesses to pull through the crisis and emerge stronger once the outbreak eventually recedes.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world into exceptionally difficult and largely uncharted waters, and banks are feeling the strains alongside their clients, their employees and the societies they serve.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kayode Oyero
The Central Bank of Nigeria and the banks in the country have agreed to shelve the planned sack of workers in the banking sector as a result of the pandemic.
This was contained in a statement on Sunday by the apex bank’s Director, Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor.
The PUNCH reports that the Presidential Task Force Team on COVID-19 had said last week that banks would be allowed to re-open for commercial operations as the lockdown eases in parts of the country effective Monday, May 4.
Some banks had proposed the idea of downsizing their workforce as they plan to recommence operations, a decision that has met public outcry.
But the apex bank said it convened a meeting with the banks to review the economic impact the proposed action would have on workers and their families, especially at such a difficult time.
It said, “A special meeting of the Bankers’ Committee was convened on May 2, 2020, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry. The Committee particularly deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties and decided as follows:
“In order to help minimize and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has ordered all banks not to retrench workers.
A statement from the apex bank signed by Mr. Isaac Okorafor Director, Corporate Communications said the CBN, Bankers’ Committee decided to suspend lay-offs in banks.
Access Bank has been trending in the media after an alleged video of a town hall meeting between the Managing Director of the bank Herbert Wigwe and the staff.
In the video, Wigwe was heard informing staff of the bank that some contract staff of the bank will be laid off while other staff will have their salaries cut.
Following the backlash that greeted the video, the CBN on Sunday stated: “In order to help minimise and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time).”
This decision the CBN said was taken “following special meeting of the Bankers’ Committee on May 2, 2020, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry.”
The Committee, the CBN noted “deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties.”
At the end of the deliberations, it was also decided that “the express approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria shall be required in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary to lay-off any such staff.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: CBN orders banks not to lay off workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has directed banks not to lay off staff amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
Although speculations about the impending sack of workers in the banking sector have been on since the outbreak of the coronavirus, Access Bank Plc was the first to announce its plan to downsize, or in the alternative slash its workers’ salaries.
The group managing director of the bank, Herbert Wigwe, announced during a video conference with the bank’s staff that the management of the bank plans to offload about 75 per cent of its workforce.
Criticism has tailed the bank’s decision with the Nigeria Labour Congress threatening to mobilise its members to fight such plans.
But, apparently to forestall a major crisis in the country, even as the country’s economy is struggling to find its footing as the economic impact of the coronavirus bites harder, the CBN, through its Bankers’ Committee, on Sunday, ordered the immediate suspension of such plans.
The CBN spokesperson, Isaac Okoroafor, who signed the statement, said the order was given at the end of a special meeting of the Bankers’ Committee held on May 2 to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry.
The statement titled: “CBN, Bankers’ Committee Suspend Lay-offs in Banks”, reads:
“A special meeting of the Bankers’ Committee was convened on May 2, 2020, to further review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry. The Committee particularly deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties and decided as follows:
“1. In order to help minimize and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time).
“2. To give effect to the above measure, the express approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria shall be required in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary to lay-off any such staff.
“The Central Bank of Nigeria solicits the support of all in our collective effort to weather through the economic challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

In a video that went viral on social media, Herbert Wigwe, chief executive officer of Access Bank, had hinted that the bank would have to lay off some staff and implement a salary cut.
Wigwe said he would take a 40 percent salary cut.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CBN suspends banks from sacking staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have suspended the ongoing staff layoffs by some banks in the country.
The apex bank corporate communications director Isaac Okorafor made the disclosure in a statement on Sunday.
“In order to help minimize and mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and livelihoods, no bank in Nigeria shall retrench or lay-off any staff of any cadre (including full-time and part-time),” Okorafor said.
This is coming after a few banks have resorted to lay off staff and also cut down staff salaries.
Nigeria’s Access Bank Plc is one of the banks planning to cut staff salaries to avoid laying off as coronavirus continues to ravage the world and affect global economies, Bloomberg reported.
Bloomberg on Friday reported that “people with direct knowledge of the matter” said the pay cuts are expected to start from May unless business conditions improve.
Apart from the coronavirus troubles which forced many banks to close some of their branches and allow staff to work from home, crash of oil prices and the threat of another naira devaluation pose a great threat of rising bad-debt levels for banks.
To avoid the economic crisis on the bank, CBN said there will be a review the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian banking industry after their special committee meeting.
The committee, the CBN noted “deliberated on the issue of the operating costs of banks in view of the disruptions emanating from the global economic difficulties.”
Okarafor stated that “the express approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria shall be required in the event that it becomes absolutely necessary to lay-off any such staff.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Saturday (2 May) announced the suspension of the operations of the Mumbai based CKP Co-operative Bank Limited (Ltd) and cancelled its banking licence, reports Economic Times.
The RBI said that all the depositors of the bank are entitled to repayment of their deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs five lakh under the DICGC Act, 1961 which provides the depositors with deposit insurance.
The strong decision to suspend operations and cancel the bank's license came as the RBI reasoned that the financial position of the bank was highly unsustainable and that there was no concrete revival plan or proposal for a merger with another bank.
RBI also underscored that there was no credible commitment from the management of the bank towards a course of revival. The central bank said, "The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and the interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest."
The RBI will now go ahead with the liquidation proceedings against the bank post which the depositors would be paid with the insured sums on their deposits.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India on Saturday said it cancelled the licence of Mumbai-based CKP Cooperative Bank, as the bank’s financial position is “highly adverse and unsustainable”. The central bank said that the affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest. The order, passed on April 28, is effective from April 30.
“Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the CKP Co-operative Bank Limited, Mumbai, is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits...” the RBI said. The central bank asked the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, to issue an order for winding up the affairs of CKP Cooperative Bank. It also ordered the registrar to appoint a liquidator.
The RBI said CKP Cooperative Bank is not in a position to pay its depositors. Instead, they will be paid according to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation can grant each depositor up to Rs 5,00,000 as repayment, the RBI said.
“The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations,” the RBI said. “No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further.”
As of November 2019, the total deposits of the bank amounted to Rs 485.56 crore and its loan book has Rs 161.17 crore, Mint reported.
In March, RBI had imposed a moratorium on cash-strapped Yes Bank, and restricted withdrawals at Rs 50,000 for each account. The board of directors of the bank was also superseded with immediate effect. The RBI said Yes Bank lacked a credible revival plan, and therefore it had to act in the interest of the public and depositors.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India has cancelled the licence of Mumbai-based CKP Co-operative Bank to carry on banking business in the wake of its unsustainable financial position. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the bank and appoint a liquidator, the RBI said.
On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. The bank has a deposit base of Rs 486 crore.
According to the RBI, it cancelled the licence of the bank as the financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. “There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible,” the RBI said.
“The bank is not satisfying the requirement of minimum capital and reserves, capital adequacy and earning prospects and also stipulated minimum regulatory capital requirement of 9 per cent,” it said. The bank is not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.
“The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest,” the RBI said. The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations.
“No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further,” it said.

“The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of The CKP Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, and appoint a liquidator for the bank,” RBI said in a late evening statement on Saturday.
The depositors of the bank will get a maximum of ₹5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), as per law. The deposit insurance cover was increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh earlier this year. The bank has a deposit base of ₹485.56 crore, as on November 2019.
“The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible,” the RBI said, giving reasons for the decision.
The bank has negative networth of ₹239.2 crore. It has a customer base of 1,34,167 and has eight branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts.
The banking regulator said the bank did not satisfy the requirement of minimum capital and reserves and was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.

The Federal Government has directed the release of about 17,500 metric tonnes of assorted grains from Yola National Food Reserve site for distribution as palliatives to Nigerians.
Haruna Sulaiman, Director, National Food and Strategic Reserve, said this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria in Yola on Saturday.
Sulaiman said the gesture was part of the Federal Government’s palliatives to cushion the effect of COVID-19 lockdown in the country.
Sulaiman, represented by Amusa Sulaiman, Manager, Yola Food Reserve site, said the department has many food reserve sites across the country.
He said: “Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a Presidential Order for us to start releasing food from national food reserves.
“The department has issued a standing order to every site to start re-bagging in preparedness for distribution to all states of the federation.
“From Yola site, there is directive from government to immediately release about 17,500 tonnes, equivalent of 100 trucks of the assorted grains of sorghum and maize to Kano State Government.”
Sulaiman said 28 trucks out of 100 had arrived in Kano on April 30, adding that the trucks were leaving Yola reserve site to Kano under the supervision of the National Emergency Management Agency.
Sulaiman said that after the Kano operation, the Yola site was expecting another directive to release the grains to other states of the federation.

“From Yola site, there is a directive from the government to immediately release about 17,500 tonnes, the equivalent of 100 trucks of the assorted grains of sorghum and maize to Kano State Government.”
He said 28 trucks out of 100 had arrived in Kano Thursday, adding that the trucks were leaving Yola reserve site to Kano under the supervision of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
Sulaiman said after Kano’s operation, the Yola site was expecting another directive to release the grains to other states of the federation. (NAN)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Homebase reopening all 164 stores tomorrow with strict social distancing measures</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Homebase is reopening all its outlets from tomorrow with strict social distancing measures in place.
The DIY retail business will open the shutters on all 164 of its stores across the country after they were closed in March.
While Homebase is considered an "essential retailer" and therefore could have stayed open, the decision was made to shut to protect staff.
Last week Homebase opened 20 stores as a trial, with 50 following on Wednesday once that had proved succesful.
From tomorrow all Homebases will be back up and running.
Chief executive, Damian McGloughlin, said a lot of hard work had gone in to ensure it could “safely welcome customers back through our doors”.
Some key services will not be offered such as kitchen design appointments and key cutting.
The reserve and collect services, as well as carpet cleaner hire, will also not be running.
Homebase opens at 10am on Sunday and closes at 4pm.
On weekdays and Saturdays it stays open for an hour longer.
Homebase is not the only DIY store which is  welcoming customers back inside.
B&Q has fully reopened all 288 of its retail stores
The company has gradually opened the doors of its sites across the country, with its final two outlets reopening on Thursday.
In the world of food plenty of shops are planning their return.
Pret a Manger has reopened 30 outlets for deliver only while Nandos, Burger King, KFC and Wagamama are all lifting the shutters.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Retailer Lidl Ireland says it is to temporarily stop sale of certain items due to longer queues at some stores.
This includes a Crivit outdoor trampoline, Smoby garden slide, Gemini swingset and a wooden kitchen.
In a statement, the company says: "At Lidl, the safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority.
"We have implemented numerous measures across all of our stores over the past two months in order to ensure appropriate social distancing can be achieved.
"Due to unprecedented and exceptional demand on certain items in recent days, we have seen queues form outside our stores prior to opening.
"These queues have made social distancing externally more challenging".
It adds that the items, which were due to be sold on Monday May 4th, will go on sale at a later date.
It has apologised to customers - but says "the safety of our team and customers must take priority at this challenging time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Next confirms details of which stores it is reopening first</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Back in March, high street retailer Next closed all of its stores due to it being deemed non-essential by the Government.
However last month announced the operation of its website once again, opening up for a limited amount of orders each day.
And, now as a next step, the retailer has revealed its plans to reopen, and it looks like the biggest sale yet could be on the horizon, reports MEN.
A spokesperson for Next said: "On Thursday 26 March, we temporarily closed our UK warehouses and distribution networks in order to adapt our operations to working safely in a coronavirus world.
"During the 18 days of closure we re-organised all aspects of our warehousing to ensure social distancing and improved sanitation.
"We re-organised the flow of pedestrians, adapted exits, entrances, congregation areas, rest areas and workstations. 
"In addition, we changed our picking routines and delivery promise to smooth workflow during the day and eliminated the peaks in activity most likely to result in close contact between operatives."
Next is now ready to reopen its stores once Government restrictions are relaxed. The reopenings will be in phases with Next adding its larger out of town stores will be first to reopen.
This is because they have larger car parks and are easier to manage. When stores do reopen, safety measure similar to those implemented across supermarkets will be in place.
The spokesperson added: "We have plans in place for the re-purposing of our stores ready to re-open in a socially distanced world.
"Measures include screening of tills, distance marking walkways, sanitisation stations, exit and entry management systems and other measures.
"The reduction in sales volumes has meant that we have a lot more stock in our warehouses than anticipated.
"Although our main July and January End of Season Sales are likely to fall outside lockdown, we believe clearing our surplus stock will prove challenging if social distancing restrictions are in force."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lidl has cancelled the sale of a number of items which were due to go on sale Monday, May 4th.
In recent days, the company has seen queues forming outside its supermarkets before opening as people looked to purchase items which were anticipated to be in high demand.
Forecasting similar scenes on Monday, Lidl has said it will not be selling the Crivit Outdoor Trampoline, Smoby Garden Slide, Gemini Swingset and Wooden Kitchen. The items will instead be available at a later date.
"At Lidl, the safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority," the Supermarket said in a statement.

"Due to unprecedented and exceptional demand on certain items in recent days, we have seen queues form outside our stores prior to opening. These queues have made social distancing externally more challenging.
"For this reason we have made the decision to cancel the following items which were due to be sold on Monday May 4th: Crivit Outdoor Trampoline; Smoby Garden Slide; Gemini Swingset and Wooden Kitchen.
"We apologise to all customers who are left disappointed by this decision but we feel the safety of our team and customers must take priority at this challenging time. We will put these items on sale at a future date."

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the new funding during his daily news conference in Ottawa this morning as provinces across the country prepare to start re-opening on Monday.
The government is spending $240 million to boost access to online health services, including mental-health support and virtual access to doctors for primary care.
Ottawa is also providing $175 million to AbCellera Biologics Inc., which Trudeau says has shown promising signs of progress in identifying antibodies that could be used create a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Trudeau also says Canada will work with its allies to get answers around the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 following unsubstantiated reports the virus leaked from a Chinese lab.
But the prime minister insists the immediate focus is on helping Canadians through the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CKP depositors to get money back</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About 99.2% of the 132170 depositors of CKP Cooperative Bank will get their full deposits back as they are covered under the deposit insurance scheme, Reserve Bank of India said on Sunday.
The bank's license was cancelled by the RBI. It requested the registrar of cooperative societies (RCS) for the liquidation process.
"CKP Co-op Bank Ltd., Mumbai has been under All Inclusive Directions of @RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC," a RBI spokesperson said in a social media post.
RBI has requested the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the CKP Cooperative Bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.
Now RCS will appoint a liquidator for starting the process of giving back the deposits in consultation with Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). The deposit insurance cover was increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh earlier this year. The bank has a deposit base of ₹485.56 crore, as on November 2019.
RBI said CKP, which has 8 branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts, did not satisfy the requirement of minimum capital and reserves and was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">More than 90% CKP Co-op Bank depositors to get back money, says RBI</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 99 per cent of the depositors in CKP Co-op Bank will get full payment of the deposits back from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a senior official of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tweeted on Sunday.
The RBI cancelled the licence of CKP Co-op Bank on April 28, and notified the cancellation on its website on Saturday. It said deposits up to Rs 5 lakh are guaranteed by the DICGC. This portion is 99.2 per cent.

“CKP Co-op Bank, Mumbai, has been under the all-inclusive directions of the RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 132,170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2 per cent will get full payment of their deposits from their DICGC,” tweeted Yogesh Dayal, chief general manager of RBI.
RBI, in a statement on Saturday, had said there was no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank and that credible commitment towards revival from the management was not visible.
The bank failed to meet the regulatory requirement of maintaining a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent and reserves. The RBI said the lender was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors.
The affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to public interest and the interests of depositors, the RBI statement said. CKP Bank's NPA is more than 97 per cent as it lent to real estate players in and around Mumbai who did not pay back. The bank's total deposits was Rs 485 crore, but the net worth was a negative Rs 239 crore.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Under the DIGC scheme, full recovery for those accountholders is allowed who hold funds of less than Rs 5 lakh
The Reserve Bank of India on Sunday said 99.2 percent of The CKP Co-operative Bank's 1.32 lakh customers will be eligible for full recovery of their funds under the DICGC scheme when the bank is liquidated.
Under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) scheme, full recovery for those accountholders is allowed who hold funds of less than Rs 5 lakh in case the bank goes bust.
A day after licence cancellation of the bank, RBI issued a clarification on Twitter to pacify the accountholders of the lender.
RBI's CGM - Communications Yogesh Dayal in a tweet today said, "Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC."
On Saturday also, the apex bank said all depositors will be covered under the deposit insurance scheme of the DICGC but did not specify how many of the bank's customers had accounts having less than Rs 5 lakh.
The limit of the DICGC scheme was increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh after the PMC Bank episode.

On May 2, the RBI cancelled the licence of CKP Co-operative Bank, with effect from the close of business on April 30, 2020. On liquidation, depositors are entitled to repayment of their deposits up to Rs 5 lakh only from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) as per usual terms and conditions, the RBI said in a press release.
"The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible," the RBI said.
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has been asked to issue an order for winding up the affairs of the Mumbai-based CKP Co-operative Bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank, it said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">About 99.2% CKP Co-operative Bank depositors to get money back under deposit insurance: RBI</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About 99.2 percent of the 1,32,170 depositors of CKP Co-op Bank, whose licence was cancelled on Saturday, will get their full deposits back under the deposit insurance and credit guarantee scheme (DICGC), a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) spokesperson said on May 3.
"CKP Co-op Bank Ltd, Mumbai has been under All Inclusive Directions of RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for a revival of the bank, its licence has been cancelled. Out of 1,32,170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2 percent will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC," said Yogesh Dayal, chief general manager, department of communication at RBI said in a tweet.
Under Deposit insurance scheme, on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to Rs5 lakh from DICGC. In other words, going by RBI communication, 99.2 percent of the depositors of CKP Bank are in the less than Rs 5 lakh deposit category.
As on April 30, the bank had a loan book of Rs 158 crore and deposits of Rs 486 crore. The bank had a negative net worth of Rs 239 crore, according to the latest figures available. Nearly, 97 percent of its loans had turned to NPAs, a lot of which are loans given to small and mid-sized real estate developers.
CKP Bank has its head office at Matunga, Mumbai and has eight branches spread across Mumbai and Thane districts. "The Bank has attained an important status in the co-operative banking sector, by crossing various milestones of quality and standards and by setting new standards of its own," its website says.
The lender is the latest cooperative bank to lose its licence on account of financial failure. Cancelling its licence, the RBI said that the financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. The adverse financial position was only one of the many reasons behind the cancellation of the licence. The bank, as per RBI's observation, also did not have any concrete revival plan or proposal for a merger with another bank.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI cancels Mumbai-based CKP Co-op Bank's license</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Sunday said 99.2 per cent of the depositors of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, whose license has been cancelled, will get full payment of their deposits from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)
As at November-end 2019, CKP Co-op Bank, as per its website, had deposits aggregating Rs 485.56 crore and loans aggregating Rs 161.17 crore. 
According to a tweet by RBI Chief General Manager Yogesh Dayal, “CKP Co-operative Bank has been under All Inclusive Directions of @RBI since 2014. As there was no scope for revival of the bank, its license has been cancelled.
“Out of 132170 depositors of the bank, about 99.2% will get full payment of their deposits from DICGC.”
The RBI, in a statement on Saturday, said the licence of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, has been cancelled with effect from the close of business on April 30, 2020.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Bank is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits as defined in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 with immediate effect, the central bank said in a statement.
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Pune, Maharashtra, has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the affairs of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai and appoint a liquidator for the bank, the central bank said in a statement.
Depositors eligible for higher deposit insurance claim
With the cancellation of licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The CKP Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, as per the DICGC Act, 1961 will be set in motion, it added.
On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of ₹ 5 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) as per usual terms and conditions. 
DICGC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, had raised the limit of insurance cover for depositors in insured banks from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh per depositor with effect from February 4, 2020 with the approval of Government of India.
The central bank said it canceled the Bank’s license as “The financial position of the bank is highly adverse and unsustainable. There is no concrete revival plan or proposal for merger with another bank. Credible commitment towards revival from the management is not visible.
“The bank is not satisfying the requirement of minimum capital and reserves…and capital adequacy and earning prospects…and also stipulated minimum regulatory capital requirement of 9 per cent.”
The central bank statement observed that the affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public interest and interest of the depositors and that the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to the interest of depositors as also public interest. Thus, the bank has not been complying with provisions of Section 22 (3)(b) and (c) Banking Regulation Act.
“The bank’s efforts for revival have been far from adequate though the bank has been given ample time and opportunity and dispensations. No merger proposal has been received in respect of the bank. Thus, in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed to carry on its business any further.
“No useful purpose would be served by allowing the bank to continue as envisaged in Section 22(3)(e) of the Act. Rather, Public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry on its banking business any further,” the RBI said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK starts state-backed loans for smallest firms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — A government-backed loan scheme to help Britain’s small businesses survive the coronavirus lockdown comes into effect on Monday, allowing firms such as hairdressing salons, coffee shops and florists to receive emergency cash.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, who previously opposed 100% state backing for commercial loans, announced the new facility on April 27, bowing to pressure to do more for the smallest companies after a previous scheme got off to a slow start.
The new “Bounce Back Loans” allow businesses including sole traders to borrow between 2,000 and 50,000 pounds ($2,500-$62,500) at a flat interest rate of 2.5%. Banks handling the loans will not be required to run credit checks or assess the long-term viability of applicants.
“Small businesses will play a key role creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic,” Sunak said in a statement to mark the first day when the Bounce Back scheme goes into operation.
“The Bounce Back loan scheme will make sure they get the finance they need – helping them bounce back and protect jobs,” he said.
Most British businesses have been shut to the public since March 23, when the government imposed social distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus. Government forecasters have said the economy could contract by 35% in the second quarter.
Britain last month announced an emergency 330 billion-pound credit scheme including loans of up to 5 million pounds for small and medium-sized companies, with state guarantees of 80%.
But many companies said they struggled to secure bank approvals, putting pressure on Sunak to provide full state guarantees for commercial loans to the smallest businesses.
From Monday, any firm that has already taken out a loan of 50,000 pounds or less under the 80%-state-backed scheme can apply to have it switched over to the Bounce Back scheme.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard Q4 net rises 24% to ₹282 cr</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company on Saturday reported a 23.8% rise in net profit at Rs 282 crore for the March quarter.
The non-life insurer had posted a net profit of ₹228 crore in the corresponding period of 2018-19.
The gross direct premium income (GDPI) of the company stood at ₹3,181 crore in Q4 FY20, compared to ₹3,485 crore in Q4 FY19, ICICI Lombard said in a regulatory filing.
For the full year 2019-20, the profit after tax or net profit increased 13.8 per cent to ₹1,194 crore from Rs 1,049 crore in the preceding fiscal.
GDPI of the company stood at ₹13,313 crore in FY20 compared to ₹14,488 crore in FY19, a de-growth of 8.1 per cent, it said.
Excluding crop segment, GDPI increased to ₹13,302 crore during the year compared to ₹12,036 crore in FY19, up 10.5 per cent.
This was in line with the industry growth (excluding crop segment), ICICI Lombard added.

Combined ratio — a measure of profitability — stood at 100.4 per cent in 2019-20 compared to 98.8 per cent a year ago, primarily on account of long-term motor policies, change in product-mix and losses from catastrophic events, the company said.
For the March quarter, the combined ratio stood at 100.1 per cent compared to 99 per cent in the same period last year.
The ratio denotes the money flowing out via in dividends, expenses, and losses. Whereas a ratio below 100 indicates underwriting profit, above 100 means paying out more money in claims than receiving through premium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard's pre-tax profit up 7% in Q4 on improved loss ratio</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Private sector non-life insurer ICICI Lombard reported a 7.27 per cent growth in pre-tax profit for the quarter ending March 2020 (Q4FY20) at Rs 371 crore. This was largely on account of an improvement in loss ratio across corporate segments such as fire insurance, and the no-loss situation in the crop insurance business as it generally shied away from the segment.
The insurer reported a net profit of Rs 282 crore in Q4FY20 compared to Rs 228 crore, registering a growth of 23.8 per cent on account of lower tax outgo for the quarter at Rs 88.7 crore (Rs 118 crore in Q4FY19).
The company's underwriting losses narrowed down to Rs 29.42 crore in Q4FY20, from Rs 49.70 crore a year ago. ICICI Lombard also reported lower underwriting losses for the full year (FY20) at Rs 105.15 crore compared to Rs 169.65 crore in FY19.
The combined ratio of the company, a measure of profitability of non-life insurers, stood at 100.1 per cent in Q4FY20, compared to 99 per cent in Q4FY19. A combined ratio of below 100 indicates that insurer is making underwriting profits.
The gross premium earned by the company was down eight per cent, at Rs 3,181 crore in Q4FY20, mainly due to a decline in crop insurance business. The management said it will be cautious with crop insurance business in FY21 as well. In FY20, the premium earned by the company was down 8 per cent to Rs 13,313 crore from Rs 14, 488 crore in FY19.

ICICI Lombard made underwriting profits in segments like fire, marine, and group health, while it booked underwriting losses in the motor segment and retail health. Given that the third-party hikes for FY21 have been put on hold by the insurance regulator because of the covid-19 disruption, the loss ratios in the segment may shoot up in the future if insurers resort to heavy discounting in the own damage segment. Also, with social distancing being the new norm, the use of private vehicles may see rise and could result in a higher number of accidents and, therefore, more claims for insurers.
In the light of the covid-19 disruption, the company has assessed and provided for impairment of Rs 119 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and Rs 120 crore for the year ended March 31, 2020 on investment assets as per its policy.
The company has maintained a healthy solvency ratio at 2.17x as of March 31, 2020 as against 2.18x at December 31, 2019 and higher than the minimum regulatory requirement of 1.50x. Solvency ratio was 2.24x at March 31, 2019.
It did not declare any dividend at end of the March quarter as the insurance regulator had instructed the companies to take a conscious call on the dividend payment to conserve capital in light of the current situation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICICI Lombard Q4 results: Net profit rises 23.8%, premium income drops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: ICICI Lombard has posted a 23.8 percent rise in its March quarter profits at Rs 281.93 crore due to a reduction in underwriting losses even as the private insurer’s premium income dropped both for the quarter and full financial year.
The underwriting loss reduced to Rs 29.42 crore in Q4FY20 as compared to Rs 49.70 crore in the year-ago period. Gross premium income of the company for the quarter stood at Rs.3181 crore as against Rs.3485 crore in the same period last year mainly on account of loss of crop insurance business. Excluding crop insurance, GDPI rose by 2.9 percent YoY to Rs 3,244 crore.
Reduction in underwriting losses was due to a conscious call to not write crop business and also due to pricing improvements in segments like fire insurance, said Bhargav Dasgupta, CEO, ICICI Lombard.
The company’s MTM investment losses came at Rs.550 crore in the quarter mostly on account of financial market meltdown. The overall investment book at the end of the financial year 2019-20 stood at Rs.26300 crore, the company said. Lombard has subsequently made a provision of Rs.120 crore against diminution in the value of investments.
The general insurer's solvency ratio was 217 percent at FY20 as against the minimum regulatory requirement of 150 percent, down from 224% at the end of FY19. The company is not planning on raising any capital in near term even as it had “sufficient headroom” to raise tier 2 capital when required, Dasgupta told reporters at the earnings call.
“We are operating in unprecedented times with pandemic spreading across the world and impacting economies and lives,” said Dasgupta. “Over these weeks we have had to rearrange our processes – from claim settlement to channel operators,” adding that the pandemic would likely bring disruptions in the businesses of all general insurers in the ongoing quarter.
However, he stopped short of giving an assessment on the extent of losses expected given the uncertain nature of the pandemic. “It will require a brave person to predict that (losses to industry), given how things are changing every second day,” Dasgupta said.
The combined ratio – a measure of insurers’ profitability -- stood at 100.4% in FY2020 compared to 98.8% in FY2019 primarily on account of long-term motor policies, change in product-mix and “losses from catastrophic events.” For the reporting quarter it came at 100.1% as against 99% in the corresponding period last year.
The Return on Average Equity (ROAE) was 20.8 percent in FY20 compared to 21.3 percent in FY19. ROAE was 18.8 percent in Q4 compared to 17.5 percent in last year period.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil-hungry Asian nations pounce on low prices to build stockpiles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE – Some oil-hungry Asian nations are taking advantage of the collapse in prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to build up their crude stockpiles.
Here are some questions and answers about strategic reserves and the region's oil supplies:
What are strategic oil reserves and why do countries need them?
Strategic reserves are stockpiles of oil and other fuels held by governments in secure storage facilities to cover unexpected disruptions to energy supplies.
Major economies such as the United States, China, and Russia began to build up reserves after oil shocks in the 1970s, according to Ravi Krishnaswamy, regional senior vice president for energy and environment at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The events that spurred them to take action were principally the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab nations, and the 1979 Iranian revolution, which fuelled worries about supplies.
How big are the strategic reserves across the region?
China is believed to have the biggest in the Asia-Pacific. Beijing does not give an official estimate, but analysts say it is at around 550 million barrels. In comparison, the United States' strategic reserves currently hold around 630 million.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation said recently that the country's reserves were "obviously insufficient, and have not yet reached the international standard '90-day safety line.'"
The International Energy Agency requires its members to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports. China is an associate member, but not a full member.
Japan's oil reserves were around 500 million barrels at the end of February, equivalent to national consumption for more than 7 months, according to the latest official data, while South Korea had around 96 million barrels in strategic reserves as of December 2019, enough for 89 days.
India, by contrast, has reserves with storage capacity of approximately 40 million barrels – which would last just 10 days in the country of 1.3 billion people.
How are reserves stored?
Strategic reserves are stored largely in secure underground depots like natural rock caverns. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude, is stored in huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast.
But building underground storage is challenging as it needs to have the right geological formation, and countries also need to build infrastructure to pump oil in and out.
The high cost of building reserves has stopped many countries developing them to sufficient levels.
In Asia, India uses caverns to store its reserves but other countries, such as Japan, put theirs in aboveground tanks.
Which Asian countries are pouncing on low prices to build up stockpiles?
Australia, which has long had one of the lowest levels of emergency stockpiles in the developed world, said it will take advantage of the fall in prices to develop a strategic reserve in the US.
The country's own storage capacity is already full, but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
In China, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange last month gave approval for state-owned Sinopec Petroleum Reserve to add more storage capacity.
One storage depot in southern Guangdong province can hold up to 600,000 cubic meters (3.8 million barrels), while another in northern Hebei province can hold up to one million cubic meters.
India's Ministry of Petroleum tweeted on April 15 it was buying crude to fill its reserves, stored in rock caverns, "to their full capacity."
Madhu Nainan, editor of industry publication PetroWatch, however, questioned whether the country had enough available storage space to build up capacity quickly.
"In India, storage tanks and pipelines are full and dealers' tanks are full," he told Agence France-Presse (AFP).
Japan and South Korea, with ample stockpiles, have not announced plans to build up their reserves substantially.
A Japanese trade ministry official said current levels were sufficient, while Seoul plans to increase stockpiles by less than 1% this year.
Could low prices boost the region's economies when lockdowns are lifted?
It looks unlikely, in the short term at least. Many observers believe economic activity won't bounce back quickly with the gradual lifting of lockdowns but only when a vaccine for the virus is discovered – which could be some time away.
"Low oil prices won't turbocharge Asian economic recovery," Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst, told AFP.
Are there any winners from low prices?
Major oil importers in Asia – such as China, Japan, and South Korea – would in usual times benefit from low prices, but this is unlikely to be the case immediately given the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
In Japan, for example, "the price crash has hit financial markets hard, which is negatively affecting the Japanese economy," said Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
"We can't apply our usual framework to this unprecedented period."
Some economists, however, expect oil prices to stay low for a long period, meaning major importers could eventually emerge winners.
"Oil prices are expected to remain low to some extent when the post-corona era comes, and given the current situation, it will have a positive effect on [South Korea's] economy in terms of recovery," said Jung Jun-hwan, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.
There are also "obvious losers" in Asia, such as oil exporters Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei, said OANDA's Halley. – Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oil-hungry Asian nations pounce on low prices to build stockpiles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some oil-hungry Asian nations are taking advantage of the collapse in prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic to build up their crude stockpiles.
Here are some questions and answers about strategic reserves and the region's oil supplies:
- What are strategic oil reserves and why do countries need them? -
Strategic reserves are stockpiles of oil and other fuels held by governments in secure storage facilities to cover unexpected disruptions to energy supplies.
Major economies such as the US, China and Russia began to build up reserves after oil shocks in the 1970s, according to Ravi Krishnaswamy, regional senior vice president for energy and environment at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The events that spurred them to take action were principally the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab nations, and the 1979 Iranian revolution, which fuelled worries about supplies.
- How big are the strategic reserves across the region? -
China is believed to have the biggest in the Asia-Pacific. Beijing does not give an official estimate but analysts say it is at around 550 million barrels. In comparison, the United States' strategic reserves currently hold around 630 million.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation said recently that the country's reserves were "obviously insufficient, and have not yet reached the international standard '90-day safety line'".
The International Energy Agency requires its members to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports. China is an associate member, but not a full member.
Japan's oil reserves were around 500 million barrels at the end of February, equivalent to national consumption for more than seven months, according to the latest official data, while South Korea had around 96 million barrels in strategic reserves as of December 2019, enough for 89 days.
India, by contrast, has reserves with storage capacity of approximately 40 million barrels -- which would last just 10 days in the country of 1.3 billion people.
- How are reserves stored? -
Strategic reserves are stored largely in secure underground depots like natural rock caverns. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude, is stored in huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast.
But building underground storage is challenging as it needs to have the right geological formation, and countries also need to build infrastructure to pump oil in and out.
The high cost of building reserves has stopped many countries developing them to sufficient levels.
In Asia, India uses caverns to store its reserves but other countries, such as Japan, put theirs in above-ground tanks.
- Which Asian countries are pouncing on low prices to build up stockpiles? -
Australia, which has long had one of the lowest levels of emergency stockpiles in the developed world, said it will take advantage of the fall in prices to develop a strategic reserve in the United States.
The country's own storage capacity is already full but it has an agreement with the US allowing it to lease space in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
In China, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange last month gave approval for state-owned Sinopec Petroleum Reserve to add more storage capacity.
One storage depot in southern Guangdong province can hold up to 600,000 cubic metres (3.8 million barrels), while another in northern Hebei province can hold up to one million cubic metres.
India's Ministry of Petroleum tweeted on April 15 it was buying crude to fill its reserves, stored in rock caverns, "to their full capacity".
Madhu Nainan, editor of industry publication PetroWatch, however, questioned whether the country had enough available storage space to build up capacity quickly.
"In India, storage tanks and pipelines are full and dealers' tanks are full," he told AFP.
Japan and South Korea, with ample stockpiles, have not announced plans to build up their reserves substantially.
A Japanese trade ministry official said current levels were sufficient, while Seoul plans to increase stockpiles by less than one percent this year.
- Could low prices boost the region's economies when lockdowns are lifted? -
It looks unlikely, in the short term at least. Many observers believe economic activity won't bounce back quickly with the gradual lifting of lockdowns but only when a vaccine for the virus is discovered -- which could be some time away.
"Low oil prices won't turbocharge Asian economic recovery," Jeffrey Halley, OANDA senior market analyst, told AFP.
- Are there any winners from low prices? -
Major oil-importers in Asia -- such as China, Japan and South Korea -- would in usual times benefit from low prices but this is unlikely to be the case immediately given the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
In Japan, for example, "the price crash has hit financial markets hard, which is negatively affecting the Japanese economy", said Toshihiro Nagahama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
"We can't apply our usual framework to this unprecedented period."
Some economists, however, expect oil prices to stay low for a long period, meaning major importers could eventually emerge winners.
"Oil prices are expected to remain low to some extent when the post-corona era comes, and given the current situation, it will have a positive effect on (South Korea's) economy in terms of recovery," said Jung Jun-hwan, a researcher at the Korea Energy Economics Institute.
There are also "obvious losers" in Asia, such as oil exporters Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, said OANDA's Halley.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI reviews measures to ease financial stress</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held a meeting with the heads of banks and reviewed the economic situation and implementation of various measures announced by it to reduce stress in the financial system amid the COVID-19 crisis.
The meeting, which happened in two separate sessions through video conference, saw participation of managing directors and CEOs of major public and private sector banks, the RBI said in a statement after the meeting.
 
In his opening remarks, the governor appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal operations during the lockdown period.
During the meeting, among other matters, review of the current economic situation and stability of the financial sector among other things were discussed.
Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to non-banking financial companies, microfinance institutions, housing finance companies, mutual funds, etc and post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs were also deliberated.
Implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI was also reviewed during the meeting.
The Supreme Court earlier this week directed the RBI to ensure that its March 27 guidelines directing lending institutions to allow a three-month moratorium to all borrowers is implemented in letter and spirit.
Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe was discussed, it added.
The Reserve Bank has announced several steps to ease the pressure being faced by borrowers, lenders and other entities including mutual funds and has promised to take more initiatives to deal with the developing situation.
The RBI has injected funds within the system towards lending. The reverse repo rate cut will discourage banks from parking cash with the RBI and encourage them to lend to the economy.
The Indian economy may be headed for a rare quarterly contraction during April-June as economic activities have come to a halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The government had earlier unveiled a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package of free foodgrains and cash doles to the poor to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak  of COVID-19 pandemic.

The Reserve Bank has announced several steps to ease the pressure being faced by borrowers, lenders and other entities including mutual funds and has promised to take more initiatives to deal with the developing situation.
The RBI has injected funds totalling 3.2 per cent of GDP into the economy since the February 2020 monetary policy meeting to tackle the liquidity situation.
The RBI has been prompting banks to push lending by cutting its key policy rate by 75 basis points to an 11-year low of 4.4 per cent. Besides, it also slashed reverse repurchase rate, a tool to control the money supply, to 3.75 per cent to encourage banks to deploy surplus funds within the system towards lending.
The reverse repo rate cut will discourage banks from parking cash with the RBI and encourage them to lend to the economy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RBI Governor Meets Bank Chiefs; Reviews Implementation Of Various Measures</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bookmark
Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Saturday held a meeting with the heads of banks and reviewed the economic situation and implementation of various measures announced by it to reduce stress in the financial system amid the Covid-19 crisis.
The meeting, which happened in two separate sessions through video conference, saw participation of Managing Directors and CEOs of major public and private sector banks, the RBI said in a statement after the meeting.
In his opening remarks, the governor appreciated the efforts of banks in ensuring normal to near normal operations during the lockdown period.
During the meeting, among other matters, review of the current economic situation and stability of the financial sector among other things were discussed.
Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to Non-Banking Financial Companies, Microfinance Institutions, Housing Finance Companies, Mutual Funds, etc. and post lockdown credit flows including provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to MSMEs were also deliberated.
Implementation of three months moratorium on repayment of loan instalments announced by the RBI was also reviewed during the meeting.
The Supreme Court earlier this week directed the RBI to ensure that its March 27 guidelines directing lending institutions to allow a three-month moratorium to all borrowers is implemented in letter and spirit.
Monitoring of overseas branches of banks in view of the slowdown in economies across the globe was discussed, it added.
The Reserve Bank has announced several steps to ease the pressure being faced by borrowers, lenders and other entities including mutual funds and has promised to take more initiatives to deal with the developing situation.
The RBI has injected funds totalling 3.2 percent of GDP into the economy since the February 2020 monetary policy meeting to tackle the liquidity situation.
The RBI has been prompting banks to push lending by cutting its key policy rate by 75 basis points to an 11-year low of 4.4 percent. Besides, it also slashed reverse repurchase rate, a tool to control the money supply, to 3.75 percent to encourage banks to deploy surplus funds within the system towards lending.
The reverse repo rate cut will discourage banks from parking cash with the RBI and encourage them to lend to the economy.
The Indian economy may be headed for a rare quarterly contraction during April-June as economic activities have come to a halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The government had earlier unveiled a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package of free foodgrains and cash doles to the poor to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Only small section of online sellers may start selling non-essentials, say industry executives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With many states yet to issue their guidelines for e-commerce companies and a large number of sellers being located in red zones, it is likely that only a small percentage of merchants on online platforms like Amazon and Flipkart will be able to start operations from May 4 and sell non-essential items, according to industry executives.
On Friday, the home ministry announced a two-week extension of lockdown but said there would be certain relaxations for orange and green zones. Under the latest rules, e-commerce activities in red zones, which cover large cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad, are permitted only for essential goods during the third phase of lockdown.
A senior industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said that while there are Centre's guidelines for e-commerce companies for the third phase of the lockdown, only few states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have notified their guidelines so far.
This lack of clarity from other states could pose difficulty for e-commerce companies to resume full operations, the person said.
Another challenge for e-commerce companies that follow the marketplace model (like Amazon India, Flipkart and Snapdeal) is that many of their sellers are either located or have their warehouses in red zones. The home ministry guidelines issued a few days ago, remain unclear on operations of these marketplace sellers of non-essential products, who are in red zones. So, they are dependent on how local authorities issue their guidelines, the person said.
E-commerce platforms and many several consumer organisations have also been requesting the government for expansion of the list of essential products to include items like laptops, mobile phones and chargers as well as summer clothing to ensure people that do not have to step out of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The person said that the addition of these categories will help customers, especially in red zones, to continue work and study from home and practice social distancing.
Another industry executive said e-commerce platforms have been engaging with seller-partners to prepare them for resumption in services.
The seller, if in the orange and green zone, will be able to see the locations they can service, while the customer will see products that can be delivered to them depending on their location, while other items may carry indicators saying the item cannot be delivered.
Srinivas Mothey, senior vice-president at Paytm Mall, said the company has already had discussions with its suppliers, logistics partners, and most importantly, offline shopkeeper base and they are all set to go online.
"We would be going live with key consumer demand categories like consumer electronics, laptops, home and fashion. These verticals and catalogues would be open to our customers besides continuing essentials. We would be taking new orders for non-essentials from Monday, May 4, and deliver in all green and orange zones," he added.
Mothey said most of its sellers in non-essential categories have confirmed their preparedness by updating their inventory and would be starting to go live on May 4 and the rest will follow suit over the coming week as zonal restrictions ease.

"We have extended their processing times to pack and ship products by 2-3 days buffer, relaxed SLAs (service-level agreements), and penalty conditions on order processing temporarily. We are in the process of getting inventory updated and cataloguing their SKUs (stock keeping units) on the platform. Our logistics partners are in touch with them and will start the process of deliveries soon as we start getting orders," he added.
Walmart-owned Flipkart had welcomed the Centre's move to allow e-commerce companies to offer non-essential products in orange and green zones and said it is working with lakhs of sellers and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across India and helping them prepare their businesses resume operations.
An Amazon India spokesperson has said millions of small and medium businesses and traders will be able to jump-start their businesses and livelihoods across their workforce after the relaxations coming in from May 4.
Emphasising that the company will focus on maintaining the "sanctity of the new guidelines around the red zones", Amazon India has also urged the government to consider the positive role e-commerce can play to get customers all priority products they need in the red zones as well to enable a stronger economic support for the small businesses while prioritising safety.
Under the first phase of the nationwide lockdown between March 24 and April 14, the government had only allowed delivery of essential goods through e-commerce platforms. On April 16, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued fresh guidelines for the current lockdown, allowing e-commerce deliveries and movement of trucks, but on April 19, it modified its order to allow online commerce companies to deliver essential items only till May 3.
Interestingly, traders' body CAIT had argued that e-commerce companies were misinterpreting the MHA guidelines of May 1 and "twisting (them) in their favour to misguide the various state governments and authorities and to create unnecessary confusion".
CAIT has sent a communication to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh (also chairman of the GoM on COVID-19) urging him to get the matter clarified by the MHA. It has also written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">E-commerce firms gearing up for businesses, to make products available</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">E-commerce companies say they are witnessing a steady growth in traffic after the home ministry on Friday extended a national lockdown but allowed the online sales of essential and non-essential products in zones that have almost controlled the coronavirus outbreak.
While there was doubt about the new guidelines announced for e-commerce, government sources clarified Saturday that e-commerce players will be allowed to deliver essentials and non-essential items in designated Orange and Green zones for the next two weeks, the time for which lockdown has been extended.
The Home Ministry's Lockdown 3.0 notification will allow these companies to sell non-essential items such as phones, laptops, electronic devices, apparel and appliances, which comprise most of their sales. The e-commerce platforms would be taking such orders after five weeks of pandemic-related shutdown which hit their sales severely. The rider, however, is that state governments will decide what items will be allowed to be sold.
Walmart-owned Flipkart said it is working with several sellers and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across India. It further said its seller support team is providing constant online counsel and support to sellers on the platform to help them resume operations over the next couple of days complying with the government directives.

“We welcome the government's efforts in progressively charting out an exit plan from the lockdown and allowing e-commerce to serve consumers in the Orange and Green zones by fulfilling their product needs, in addition to serving essentials (and) grocery in Red zone through a safe supply chain and SOPs (standard operating procedure),” said a Flipkart spokesperson.
As a marketplace e-commerce player, Flipkart said it is their responsibility to enable sellers and the MSME community to bounce back and facilitate economic activity.
Competitor Amazon said the ministry's new notification on the lockdown would help the company serve people safely. “Millions of small and medium businesses and traders will now be able to jumpstart their businesses and livelihoods across their workforce,” said Amazon.
While the company would maintain the sanctity of the new guidelines around the Red Zones, Amazon urged the government to consider the positive role e-commerce can play to get customers all priority products they need in the Red Zones as well enabling stronger economic support for the small businesses while prioritising safety.
Traffic to e-commerce firm Snapdeal’s platform has been growing steadily since Friday night’s MHA announcement. Apparel and household products topped the list for searches and orders placed. “Users are thronging the platform looking to place orders for a wide variety of products for which they have been waiting for a long time,” said Snapdeal.
About 100 per cent of the sellers on Snapdeal are third-party, independent sellers. Most of these are small sellers and MSMEs who also operate in the markets and bazaars of India. The resumption of broader e-commerce will directly and immediately benefit them by enabling them to resume their operations. “We expect 80-90 per cent of our sellers in the non-restricted zones to be live in the coming week,” said a Snapdeal spokesperson. The firm said other sellers remain in readiness and are keen to commence operations - they will be assessing the local operating conditions in their areas and Snapdeal will continue to guide and support them in this regard.
Since a majority of Snapdeal’s orders come from non-metros, tier-2 and tier-3 cities, the firm expects a large part of India to be available for the deliveries. Logistics planning, which is a detailed exercise, will be done continuously as per ground realities. Snapdeal said it will endeavour to move maximum orders to meet the expected surge in demand, but this will be done in a way that prioritises the overall safety of the sellers, delivery partners and buyers.
Snapdeal has continued to accept orders for both essentials and non-essentials during the lockdown period. While the orders for government-defined essentials were shipped out continuously, it will now start to deliver all other orders received by the firm. Delivery of existing orders, including for essentials, will be a priority. Since there is also a large number of previously ordered products to be delivered, the company believes that deliveries may be slower in the beginning and will pick up speed later in the week.

Paytm Mall said it would start operations from Monday in accordance with the new guidelines.
As millions of people are working and studying from home due to the lockdown, customers are searching for work from home essentials such as mobile phone charges, earphones, data cables and extension cords and also fitness essentials on the e-commerce websites. They are also looking for stationery products and personal grooming items.
E-commerce companies were allowed only to sell essential goods like groceries, medical supplies, and baby food since the first lockdown came into effect on March 25. Last month the government gave an indication that it would allow e-commerce delivery of both essentials and non-essentials, but later said only essential items would be allowed to be ordered and delivered, a move that the industry described as a complete u-turn.
The decision marked a big win for small trader bodies, most notably the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which wanted the government to reconsider its earlier decision to allow e-commerce firms to sell non-essential items.
“It is unfortunate that the e-commerce companies have become habitual offenders in misinterpreting MHA guidelines and twisting it in their favour to misguide the various State Governments and authorities and to create unnecessary confusion,” said Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary General, Confederation of All India Traders, on Friday. “There is no mention of allowing e-commerce to deliver non- essentials in Orange or Green Zones,” said Khandelwal.

The Retailers Association of India (RAI) on Saturday said the new notification by the MHA is a good start to getting the economy moving. “We look forward to clarifications from the states and how they would like to adopt these new guidelines. We hope that the government does recognise the safe space that malls provide for shoppers and opens them up in a regulated manner. The retail industry is still awaiting fiscal aid and policy support to allow it to be able to survive this pandemic,” said RAI.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lauding the government's decision to partially allow sale of non-essentials, the e-tailers said the move will help meet consumer demand while easing the burden of piled up inventory of the MSMEs amid the extended nationwide lockdown
In a major relief to Indian e-commerce firms such as Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, the government has allowed the players to deliver both essential and non-essential items across green and orange zones during the third phase of the lockdown, beginning May 4. The e-tailers, however, are allowed to deliver only essential items, which include grocery, hygiene products, and medicines, in red zones.
"Ecommerce activities will be permitted only for essential goods outside containment areas in red zones," the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in revised guidelines issued on Friday.
Lauding the government's decision to partially allow sale of non-essentials, the e-tailers said the move will help meet consumer demand while easing the burden of piled up inventory of the MSMEs amid the extended nationwide lockdown. They have promised delivery of products with proper precautions and in a safe manner, ensuring social distancing.
Amazon reportedly said that this will allow millions of small-and-medium businesses and traders to jumpstart their operations and livelihoods across their workforce.

Online retailer Snapdeal said that the move will help start a gradual process of economic recovery by enabling lakhs of sellers and MSMEs to cater to the demand of users through online and offline channels.

"We welcome MHA's announcement that paves the way for a calibrated resumption of various economic activities, including e-commerce, in various parts of the country. This will help start a gradual process of economic recovery by enabling lakhs of sellers and MSMEs to cater to the demand of users through online and offline channels," a Snapdeal spokesperson reportedly said.
Srinivas Mothey, Senior Vice President at Paytm Mall, said, "Many have been eagerly waiting for some relief in lockdown guidelines to buy air conditioners, refrigerators to beat the growing heat. This move will give a major relief to citizens and compliment the stupendous efforts the government has made to combat Covid-19 and keep Indians safe," he added.
On Friday evening, the Ministry of Home Affairs announced that the nationwide lockdown would be extended by other two weeks with effect from May 4, 2020. However, the government issued  relaxations in the districts falling in the green and orange zones. All the 733 districts across the country have been divided into three zones - red (hotspots), orange (having a limited number of COVID-19 cases) and green (no cases).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Copper giant Peru to gradually ease restrictions on mining sector in May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LIMA — Peru will gradually ease restrictions on key sectors including mining and construction in May, the government said in a decree on Sunday, after activity had been virtually paralyzed since mid-March by the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown.
In the decree published in the official newspaper El Peruano, the government said the exploitation, storage and transportation of large-scale mining could be restarted, as well as key construction projects, some related to hydrocarbons.
Peru is the world’s second largest producer of copper and is heavily dependent on the sector for economic growth.
The decree said that to restart activities, companies must implement rigorous health protocols to avoid infections. These will be set by local governments within the next five days and will be supervised by health authorities.
The country’s mining sector and wider economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has seen 42,534 confirmed cases of the virus in the country – the second most in Latin America. The death toll from the disease in Peru is now around 1,200.
“It is necessary to begin the social and economic recovery,” the government said in the decree.
“Therefore, it is a priority to address the transition to a resumption of activities that incorporates precautions and protective measures to prevent infections and minimize the risk of a rebound in the disease.”
Major local mine Antamina, controlled by global firms BHP Group Ltd and Glencore, reported over the last week that some 210 company workers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, of which 87% were asymptomatic.
The government of President Martín Vizcarra had previously said it would restart key activities in four phases starting this month, but without specifying which sectors.
The supreme decree on Sunday also included resumptions of production in the agricultural industry, industrial fishing, some areas of construction and the metal-mechanical sector.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In March, FPIs had withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian capital markets (both equity and debt)
Continuing their selling spree for the second straight month, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew a net Rs 15,403 crore from the Indian capital markets in April amid the coronavirus crisis.  As per the depositories data, FPIs pulled out a net sum of Rs 6,884 crore from equities and a net Rs 8,519 crore from the debt segment between April 1-30.  The total net outflow during the month stood at Rs 15,403 crore.
In March, FPIs had withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian capital markets (both equity and debt).  "Of the inflows that are coming into India, nearly all are in the NBFC and pharma sectors," said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww.
He further said outflows have continued due to uncertainty surrounding economic conditions and investors are being cautious, keeping their reserves in the US dollar.  "Though net outflow continued in April, it did not reach the levels seen in March. However, the pessimism continues to grip the markets. Foreign investors would continue to adopt a cautious stance, which is also reflected in their investment pattern in the Indian markets.

"So far, India has been able to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading aggressively. In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors," said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.
With selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front. They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
"These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes," Srivastava said.FPIs remain in sell-off mode, pull out Rs 15,403 crore in April

However, the pessimism continues to grip the markets. Foreign investors would continue to adopt a cautious stance, which is also reflected in their investment pattern in the Indian markets.
"So far, India has been able to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading aggressively. In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors," said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.
With selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front. They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
"These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes," Srivastava said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FPIs pause selloff mode, outflow drops 88% in April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a big relief to the capital markets, even as the coronaviruspandemic continues to hit economies and markets worldwide, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) significantly reduced the pace of outflows in April, after a record net outflow of Rs 1,18,203 crore in March 2020. In April, FPIs pulled out a net of Rs 14,858 crore from equity and debt markets.
According to data sourced from CDSL, FPIs sold a net of Rs 6,883 crore from the equities market in April and sold net holdings worth Rs 12,551 crore from the debt market.
They were, however, net positive investors in debt voluntary retention route (VRR) scheme that allows FPIs to participate in repos and also invest in exchange traded funds that invest in debt instruments. They invested a net of Rs 4,032 crore in debt VRR schemes in April.
The VRR channel is aimed at attracting long-term and stable FPI investments into debt markets, while providing FPIs with operational flexibility to manage their investments.
While net fund outflow of Rs 14,858 crore from capital markets in April is a significant amount, it is one-eighth of outflows seen in March when the pandemic started spreading in India and the Prime Minister announced a 21-day lockdown on March 24.
The outflow from the equity markets reduced from Rs 61,972 crore in March to Rs 6,883 crore in April. The sharp decline in outflow brought relief for equity markets and they staged a smart recovery, in line with other global markets. After witnessing a sharp fall of 23 per cent in March, the Sensex at BSE revived sharply by 14.4 per cent in April.
Experts say as the government has announced to significantly relax the lockdown restrictions in districts marked in green and orange, and also allow certain business activities in districts marked in red, it will restart some economic activity in the country that has come to a grinding halt.
“While there has been relative control in the spread of virus in India, the uncertainty still continues. However, as countries around the world are working on developing medicine and vaccine for Covid-19 and there seems to be some progress on it, a success on that front will lead to a V-shaped recovery in the economy and markets. Unless, there is a fresh scare on spread of virus, I think FPIs will not press the panic button,” said the CEO of a leading brokerage.
Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India, said, “So far, India has been able to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading aggressively. In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalize the sagging economy would have also resonated well with investors.”
He further added that with selective relaxation in the lockdown and gradual opening up of economic activity in the country, foreign investors will be closely watching the developments on this front.
They would also start looking at the domestic economic indicators as well to see how the country manages its deficits, he added.
“These are unprecedented scenarios; and with risk-taking going off the table, emerging markets like India may continue to witness similar trends for a prolonged period or until the time situation on the coronavirus front stabilizes,” said Srivastava.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Algeria rules out IMF borrowing to ease financial woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has declared his country will not approach the IMF for loans, despite a financial crisis triggered by a collapse in global oil prices and coronavirus lockdowns.
"Accumulating debt harms national sovereignty," said Tebboune, in a meeting with Algerian media broadcast late Friday.
The North African nation is heavily dependent on oil production, which generates over 90 percent of the country's export receipts.
A collapse in hydrocarbon prices this year -- caused by plunging demand due to societal lockdowns designed to combat the spread of coronavirus, and exacerbated by a brief price war between key players Russia and Saudi Arabia -- is putting ever greater pressure on Algeria's external accounts.
Even before this year's crisis took hold, Algeria's foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $62 billion at the end of 2019, from $180 billion in 2014.
But the president said Algeria would prefer "to borrow from its own citizens, rather than the International Monetary Fund or World Bank."
Algeria fell into heavy debt with the IMF during the 1990s, an episode Tebboune referenced in his address.
He also expressed aversion to borrowing from foreign banks, saying that doing so prevented Algeria making its position clear on issues including the fate of the Palestinians and Western Sahara.
Morocco has controlled most of the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, since the 1970s.
It fought a war with the Algeria-backed Polisario Front over the territory from 1975 to 1991, when a ceasefire deal was agreed.
Tebboune also said that certain "friendly" nations had offered loans, which had been declined for the time being.
He did not specify which countries had offered assistance.
The president ruled out relying on extra printing of domestic currency by the central bank, noting that this could cause an inflationary spiral.

Even before this year’s crisis took hold, Algeria’s foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $62 billion at the end of 2019, from $180 billion in 2014.
But Tebboune stressed he prefers “to borrow from Algerian citizens, rather than the IMF or the World Bank.”
He also expressed reluctance to borrowing from foreign banks, saying that doing so prevented Algeria from making its position clear on issues including the fate of the Palestinian cause and Western Sahara.
Tebboune also said that several “friendly” nations had offered loans, which had been declined for the time being. he did not name these countries.
He ruled out relying on extra printing of the local currency by the central bank, noting that this could cause inflation.
Tebboune also revealed plans to develop new natural resources, including uranium, gold and phosphate, with the help of foreign investors, after the end of the health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus.
“The novel coronavirus has frozen several plans and projects. But they will be launched after the health crisis is overcome,” he said.
A sharp fall in oil and gas revenue in recent years has deepened the country’s financial problems, widening the budget and trade deficits.
Algeria still relies heavily on energy earnings despite previous announcements that it would carry out reforms and develop the non-hydrocarbon sector.
The coronavirus outbreak has worsened the economic situation with energy earnings dropping further, forcing the government to cut spending and planned investment for 2020.
“We are determined to develop our agriculture and reduce significantly the value of purchases from abroad,” Tebboune stressed.
Elected in December 2019 after mass protests demanding political and economic reforms and the removal of the ruling elite, Tebboune has vowed to open up the economy and amend the constitution to give a greater role to parliament.
“A political change will take place and strong institutions will be created,” Tebboune said, referring to demands by the protest movement known as Hirak.
The government has decided to postpone loan payments for state and private firms financially hit by the coronavirus, and Tebboune said more measures would be taken to benefit companies and the self-employed.
“Losses of firms are being assessed. We are ready to provide financial support. Even self-employed people such as taxi drivers and hairdressers will be helped,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI: Top executives of Emirates and Etihad, two of the Middle East’s biggest airlines, have said passenger demand may not return to pre-coronavirus crisis levels until 2023.
About 85 percent of the world’s airlines could face financial distress by the end of the year without government aid, Emirates President Tim Clark and Etihad CEO Tony Douglas told a video conference hosted by the US-UAE Business Council last week.
Clark and Douglas reiterated their beliefs that until an effective vaccine for the COVID-19 respiratory disease becomes widely available, how passengers fly will be different, a statement by the council said.
Lasting restrictions like 14-day quarantines, testing, and social distancing will impact demand and operations, they said.
The airlines could not be reached for comment.
Emirates and Etihad, which operate fleets of over 370 aircraft, a majority of them wide-bodied, grounded their operations in March and are serving limited outbound flights to take repatriate foreigners from the UAE.
Dubai is expected to resume welcoming tourists by July, more than four months after halting the vital sector due to the coronavirus pandemic, an official said.
The return however will be gradual and could be delayed until September, Helal Al-Marri, the director general of Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, told Bloomberg TV last week.
A majority of global airlines have also stopped operations due to shutdowns imposed to counter the spread of the novel coronavirus.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Top executives of Emirates and Etihad, two of the Middle East's biggest airlines, have said passenger demand may not return to pre-coronavirus crisis levels until 2023.
About 85% of the world's airlines could face financial distress by the end of the year without government aid, Emirates president Tim Clark and Etihad chief executive officer Tony Douglas told a video conference hosted by the US-UAE Business Council last week.
Clark and Douglas reiterated their beliefs that until an effective vaccine for the COVID-19 respiratory disease becomes widely available, how passengers fly will be different, a statement by the council said.
Lasting restrictions like 14-day quarantines, testing, and physical distancing will impact demand and operations, they said.
The airlines could not be reached for comment.
Emirates and Etihad, which operate fleets of over 370 aircraft, a majority of them wide-bodied, have grounded their operations in March and are serving limited outbound flights to take repatriate foreigners from the United Arab Emirates.

The return however will be gradual and could be delayed until September, Helal al-Marri, the director general of Dubai's Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, told Bloomberg TV last week.
A majority of global airlines have also stopped operations due to shutdowns imposed to counter the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has repeatedly called on governments to provide generous aid to airlines.
IATA said on April 23 that air traffic in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is set to plummet by more than half due to the virus crisis.
It also said that MENA airlines' revenues are forecast to slump by $24.5 billion this year compared to 2019.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, said last month that the pandemic could mean 1.2 billion fewer air passengers worldwide by September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forty Days That Prompted Indian Companies to Write-Off a Quarter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — M.S. Unnikrishnan’s main focus nowadays is to get his 10 factories in India up and running as the nation slowly starts to exit the world’s strictest stay-at-home restrictions.
Unnikrishnan, managing director of Thermax Ltd., a maker of energy efficient cooling equipment, is still awaiting permission to reopen three more. From Thermax to Kalyani Steel Ltd. companies are slowly being allowed to resume operations from Monday even though the lockdown has been extended for two weeks.
Resumption of activity after almost 40 days won’t help salvage economic growth this quarter — or even the fiscal year– as the lockdown decimated consumption, the main driver of Asia’s third-largest economy. Majority of chief executive officers in a survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry expect domestic demand to take six to 12 months to return, while 45% see economic normalcy to take more than a year after the lockdown ends.
“This quarter would be a write-off for entire India. By second quarter, we will learn to live with the disease,” Unnikrishnan said in a phone interview on Sunday. “How fast can we restart the economy engine is the question right now.”
It may not be fast enough. Factories that have opened are operating at about a third of their capacity and others are seeing demand for their products have evaporated. Star Cement Ltd., the most profitable maker of the construction material in India, saw demand fall 80% at a factory it recently reopened.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered factories to shut from March 25 and allowed some to reopen starting April 20. Modi met with ministers and government officials on Saturday to formulate ways to restart Asia’s third-largest economy.

Meanwhile top carmakers, that couldn’t ship a single vehicle to dealers in April, are still not sure when they will be able to resume production.
The complete shutdown may result in a rare contraction in growth, according to economists. Unnikrishnan said he expects localized lockdowns to happen more frequently.
India reported the biggest single-day spike in infections on May 2, recording more than 2,400 new cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Those numbers now stand almost at 40,000 cases and more than 1,300 deaths.
“Covid-19 has had an unprecedented impact. It’s the biggest risk as we look into the future,” said Srinivas Phatak, Hindustan Unilever’s chief financial officer in a post-earnings call with reporters last week. “It’s difficult to estimate the pace of recovery. There’s still a lot of disruption and business is not back to normal.”
Rules Eased
ITC Ltd., India’s largest cigarette maker, that also makes instant noodles, soaps and incense sticks, said it will work with local administrations to resume operations where possible with the stipulated precautions.
“The company is in a state of readiness for different scenarios,” a spokesperson said in a text message. “It remains imperative that progressively the entire value chain from sourcing to manufacture to distribution functions optimally to scale up economic activity and generate the critical livelihood opportunities.”
Industrial establishments in urban areas, including special economic zones, will be allowed to operate. That includes manufacturing units for essential goods, including drugs, pharmaceuticals and medical devices and IT hardware production, the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement on May 1.
“Lockdowns will happen regularly hereafter,” only that it may not be announced by the federal government, according to Thermax’s Unnikrishnan. “There will be location-wise lockdowns, but it is going to happen. That will continue for a very long period.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zero April sales add to the Motown gloom, but stocks may still look up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: As auto sales grinded to zero in April and the chorus for government support grew louder, Dalal Street analysts remained cautious in their outlook for the sector.
India's top automakers Maruti Suzuki, Royal Enfield and M&M reported zero domestic sales for the month for the first time ever, after the nationwide lockdown halted output and shut the sales network. However, some of them exported a few units as ports opened during the month.
With the government easing the lockdown measures in some parts of the country, automobile dealers body FADA was looking towards to resuming business again, but expects demand to remain weak.
“We need to see how much of demand has got affected. It is expected to be significantly lower and the industry will require enormous government support immediately after the lockdown to get the demand back on track,” said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, President, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) said.
He said government support in the form of a reduction in GST rate on automobiles and interest rates through banks and NBFCs will help spur demand.
Anticipating resumption of businesses and a rise in factory operations to full efficiency, auto stocks rallied on Friday. Nifty Auto Index gained 6.45 per cent, led by up to 20 per cent gains in certain constituent stocks.
Despite the late rally, Nifty Auto Index is down over 28 per cent year to date. None of its constituents is trading in positive for the current year. Going by the sales forecast of analysts, a complete recovery in stock prices may take time.
“For passenger vehicles, we expect Q1 volumes to dip 70-80 per cent, but they will come back to the long period average growth of 8 per cent by Q4 in fiscal 2021. Same will be the case with two-wheelers,” said Prasad Koparkar, Senior Director, CRISIL Research.
The credit ratings agency expects auto and auto component makers to the among the worst hit by the lockdown, as they will see highest possible erosion in revenue and hence face the higher risks of credit defaults and downgrades.
“Within consumer discretionary, sales of big-ticket items like cars will recover last. There is a school of thought that two-wheelers may see some initial demand as people will be worried about public transport. So, sales of two-wheelers may recover faster than cars,” said Shyamsunder Bhat, CIO at Exide Life Insurance.
He said companies may also face a space crunch to store newly-produced vehicles as it will take some time to clear the existing inventory.
Aishvarya Dadheech, Fund Manager, Ambit Asset Management, echoed Bhat's thoughts and said the auto sector will have a relatively moderate recovery time as the concept of shared mobility will probably change.
However, some experts think, despite a dismal outlook, some auto stocks may continue to gain. Kunj Bansal, Partner & CIO, Sarthi Group, said with the consistent rise in the market, high-beta stocks and names from those sectors which were not participating earlier will join in on every rise, and they will include auto stocks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Credit risk funds see outflows of Rs 11,134 crore in a week after Franklin Templeton crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mutual funds witnessed outflows of Rs 11,134 crore under credit risk funds in a week after Franklin Templeton decided to shut down six credit risk schemes on April 24 blaming the ongoing “liquidity crisis” in the market.
According to the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI), net redemptions under credit risk funds stood at Rs 2,949.49 crore as of April 24, and peaked at Rs 4,294.36 crore as of April 27. “Thereafter, for the past three days i.e. on Tuesday April 28, April 29 and April 30, the net redemptions under credit risk funds stood at Rs 1,847.29 crore, Rs 1,251.17 crore and Rs 793.99 crore respectively,” AMFI said.
As the credit risk fund category had assets of over Rs 55,000 crore till March, over 20 per cent of the funds was pulled out by investors in the last week of April alone. The overall debt segment had witnessed outflows of Rs 1.94 lakh crore in the month of March.
However, AMFI said net redemptions under credit risk funds, one of debt mutual fund scheme category, which constitute less than 5 per cent of total debt mutual fund AUM, are tapering off substantially, post RBI’s announcement of special liquidity measure of Rs 50,000 crore for the mutual fund industry.
“All mutual funds have met the redemptions in the normal course of business. There is 81.5 per cent drop in net redemptions in credit risk funds category on April 30 from the peak net redemptions as on April 27, courtesy measures announced by the RBI,” AMFI said.
Explained
While the RBI’s Rs 50,000 crore liquidity window has given some comfort to mutual funds, credit risk funds are most at risk if redemptions continue, particularly where funds have exposure to less liquid securities, such as unlisted securities and higher risk appetite through exposure to defaulted entities.
Nilesh Shah, Chairman, AMFI, said: ‘’Declining trend in net redemptions from credit risk funds is a welcome development, indicative of investors comfort from RBI’s special liquidity facility available to the MF industry. AMFI will continue to work with regulators for normal functioning of the market.”
Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, the ninth largest mutual fund in the country, had given a big jolt to the investor community with its decision to wind up six yield-oriented managed credit funds with effect from April 23, 2020.
The six schemes — Franklin India low duration fund, dynamic accrual fund, credit risk fund, short term income plan, ultra short bond fund and income opportunities fund — have combined assets under management of around Rs 28,000 crore.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Credit risk funds’ redemptions peak at ₹4,294 cr on April 27; fall with RBI’s liquidity support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Credit risk funds have seen a net redemption of ₹8,186 crore over the past week, following the turbulence created by the sudden closure of six debt-oriented schemes by Franklin Templeton.
Net redemptions under such funds peaked to ₹4,294 crore on April 27, against ₹2,949 crore on April 24. Subsequently, they fell to ₹1,847 crore, ₹1,251 crore and ₹794 crore between April 28-30 as the RBI offered support to the MF industry.
Credit risk funds those that invest nearly two-thirds of their corpus in relatively low credit-rated debt instruments.
Nilesh Shah, Chairman, Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), said the declining trend in net redemptions from credit risk funds indicates investor comfort from RBI’s special liquidity facility to the MF industry. The AMFI will continue to work with regulators to ensure normal functioning of the market, he added.
Last Monday, the RBI had announced a special liquidity window of ₹50,000 crore for banks to lend specially to the mutual fund industry to tide over any redemption pressure from investors. Banks can now borrow 90-day funds from the RBI at the current repo rate of 4.4 per cent and on-lend to MFs or purchase investment-grade corporate papers held by them.
The RBI scheme is available between April 27 and May 11. Banks buying securities from MFs can hold them in their held-to-maturity segment, even if the total investment in that category overshoots the central bank’s limits. The advantage of the segment is that banks do not have to account for mark-to-market losses in case the bond values fall further.
As of April 23, four mutual fund houses, including Franklin Templeton, had borrowed ₹4,428 crore from banks to meet redemption requests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">After RBI infusion, net redemptions under Credit Risk Funds down by 81.5%, claims AMFI</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) on May 3 claimed that net redemptions under Credit Risk Funds have dropped 81.5 percent after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a special liquidity measure of Rs 50,000 crore for the mutual fund industry.
Net redemptions under Credit Risk Funds stood at Rs 2,949.49 crore as on April 24 and peaked at Rs 4,294.36 crore on April 27, AMFI has said.
Thereafter, for three days — April 28, 29 and 30 — the Net Redemptions under Credit Risk Funds stood at Rs 1,847.29 crore, Rs 1,251.17 crore and Rs 793.99 crore, respectively.
According to AMFI, this is an 81.5 percent drop in net redemptions in Credit Risk Funds category as on April 30, from the peak on April 27 “courtesy measures announced by the RBI”.

"Declining trend in net redemptions from Credit Risk Funds is a welcome development, indicative of Investors comfort from RBI's special liquidity facility available to the MF industry. AMFI will continue to work with Regulators for normal functioning of the market," Nilesh Shah, Chairman, AMFI.
Credit Risk Funds constitute less than 5 percent of the total Debt Mutual Fund AUM.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Norwegian Air gets bondholder deal on US$1.2b debt-for-equity swap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OSLO, May 4 — Norwegian Air said yesterday it had secured support from enough bondholders for a US$1.2 billion (RM5.15 billion) debt-for-equity swap, a vital step in helping it survive the coronavirus crisis.
The budget airline is poised to run out of cash by mid-May without approval for its plan, which involves handing over most of the company to its lessors and bondholders.
Airlines around the world have been hit particularly hard by the impact on travel of the coronavirus pandemic, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
The next step for Norwegian Air is to secure support from its lessors for its rescue plan, ahead of an extraordinary general meeting today to get approval from shareholders.
Bondholders had turned down Norwegian Air’s plan on Friday, but yesterday the airline said it had now secured a written agreement with the largest bondholders of the NAS07, without naming them, to improve some of the terms.
Although holders of three of its four bonds had given sufficient backing on Friday, support among holders of the NAS07 bond had fallen short of the minimum requirement, with only 62 per cent voting in favour, less than the 67 per cent required.
“I am pleased to confirm that we have reached an agreement with the bondholders,” CEO Jacob Shram said in a statement, which said that a vote will still need to take place on May 18 to ensure Norwegian Air secures the necessary 67 per cent support.
The agreement will provide an improvement of terms for holders of the NAS07 — whose collateral include slots to fly in and out of London’s Gatwick airport — so that the value of their bonds after the conversion may be increased by up to 38 per cent, against 20 per cent earlier, based on valuations of the Gatwick slots.
The same terms would apply for holders of another bond, the NAS08, but not for those of the NAS09, Norwegian Air said.
Also today, Norwegian is set to decide the timeline for the launch of a share issue, which will end on May 18. The airline has said it plans to raise 400 million crowns.
If successful, the debt-to-equity plan allows the carrier to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion Norwegian crowns (US$265 million), which hinge on a reduction in its debt to equity ratio, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Norwegian Air is only paying invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure. It has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold. — Reuters

    <h5 class="mb-1">Europe prepares for more lockdown easing as virus hopes rise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Europe on Sunday prepared for a further cautious easing of coronavirus restrictions following signs the pandemic may be slowing, with hard-hit Italy set to follow Spain in allowing people outside.
More than 243,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
With signs that the spread of the contagion has been brought under control, parts of Europe, Asia and the United States have begun to lift restrictions to try to inject life into economies crippled by weeks of closures and ease the pressure from populations wearying of confinement.
After a two-month lockdown in Italy — with the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world — people on Monday will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaway and wholesale stores can resume business, but there was some confusion about the extent of the easing.
“I’m hoping this morning’s paper will clear up some of the many questions about what we can and can’t do,” said Pietro Garlanti, a 53-year-old cleaner, as he queued at a kiosk. “I want to take my old mum to the sea-side, can I?”
Italian authorities have stressed that preventative measures are still needed.
“On the one hand, we’re super excited for the reopening, we’re already organising various activities the kids will be able to do with their grandparents outdoors, workshops in the garden, that sort of thing. The kids can’t wait to see them,” said Marghe Lodoli, who has three children.
“On the other hand, it’s disorientating. The rules are not clear, and we’re not sure if just using common sense will do.”
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany will continue its easing on Monday, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary will allow public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.
With health experts warning the disease could hit hard once again, governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs on movement.
Face masks will be mandatory on public transport starting Monday in Spain, where people were allowed to go outdoors on Saturday after a 48-day lockdown.
Lockdowns ease in Asia With pressure growing on governments worldwide to balance public health requirements with the need to ease intense economic pain, some nations in Asia announced similar measures.
South Korea — once the second worst-hit nation on the planet — said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures”.
Thailand meanwhile allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen on Sunday so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.
Despite the reopenings, experts have cautioned that many countries are still not through the worst of their outbreaks yet.
In the latest sign that the pandemic remains a serious threat, the Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country for a week starting Sunday in a bid to ease the pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.
And to boost morale in what many expect to be a long fight, the armed forces of India — where the world’s biggest lockdown is in force — organised tributes to the nation’s medical workers, including helicopters showering petals on hospitals.
Elsewhere, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.
Rouhani warned, however, that while Iran would reopen “calmly and gradually”, it should also prepare for “bad scenarios”.‘Beyond breaking point’Across the Pacific, the pressure to ease virus measures is intense on leaders in the United States, where the economy has been hammered with tens of millions left jobless.
The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world and President Donald Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain.
Florida is set to ease its lockdown on Monday, as authorities in other states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators — some armed — who have protested against the lockdowns.
There are signs that the pandemic is slowing down in some parts of the United States.
In New York City, the epicentre of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close, the Christian charity running it said Saturday, as virus cases decline in the city.
But authorities are wary of letting their guard down too fast, with fears the virus could wreak havoc in the most vulnerable communities in the United States.
A massive wave of infections is sweeping through America’s prison population — the world’s largest at 2.3 million — with coronavirus deaths on the rise in jails and penitentiaries across the country.
Riots over inadequate protection and slow responses by authorities have already taken place in prisons in Washington state and Kansas.
“Things are beyond breaking point at this facility,” said Brian Miller, an officer at the Marion prison in Ohio. “Right now it’s hell.”

More than 243,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the great depression.
With signs that the spread of the contagion has been brought under control, parts of Europe, Asia and the United States have begun to lift restrictions to try to inject life into economies crippled by weeks of closures and ease the pressure from populations wearying of confinement.
After a two-month lockdown in Italy – with the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world – people on Monday will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaway and wholesale stores can resume business.
However, Italian authorities have stressed that preventative measures are still needed.
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany will continue its easing on Monday, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary will allow public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.
With health experts warning the disease could hit hard once again, governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs on movement.
Face masks will be mandatory on public transport starting Monday in Spain, where people were allowed to go outdoors on Saturday after a 48-day lockdown. 
Spain today counted another 164 coronavirus deaths, the lowest daily number in nearly seven weeks as the country begins to gradually lift its strict lockdown.
The figures from the health ministry bring the total number of fatalities from the pandemic in Spain to 25,264 – the fourth-highest after the United States, Italy and Britain.
It is the lowest daily increase since 18 March when 107 deaths were recorded but the ministry’s emergencies coordinator, Fernando Simon, said the figure had to be interpreted with “caution” as it comes on a long holiday weekend when reporting of fatalities by hospitals is usually slower.
“The figures are very good and confirm the trend we have observed. We have to see if they are consolidated in the coming days,” he told a news conference.
Confirmed cases of the virus rose by just 838 to 217,466, although the government recently began counting in its total only patients who test positive using a technique known as PCR.
It was the tenth straight day that the number of cured, at 1,654, surpassed new infections.
Health experts believe Spain’s outbreak peaked on 2 April when 950 people died over 24 hours. Since then, the toll has been gradually dropping.
Spain’s nearly 47 million people have since March 14 lived under one of the strictest virus lockdowns in the world, with only adults authorised to leave home to buy food, medicine or walk the dog.
But Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Tuesday unveiled a plan to gradually begin easing the restrictions in four phases that should be completed by the end of June.
Lockdowns ease in Asia 
With pressure growing on governments worldwide to balance public health requirements with the need to ease intense economic pain, some nations in Asia announced similar measures.
South Korea – once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -  said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures”.
Thailand meanwhile allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen today so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.
Despite the reopenings, experts have cautioned that many countries are still not through the worst of their outbreaks yet.
In the latest sign that the pandemic remains a serious threat, the Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country for a week starting today in a bid to ease the pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.
And to boost morale in what many expect to be a long fight, the armed forces of India – where the world’s biggest lockdown is in force – organised tributes to the nation’s medical workers, including helicopters showering petals on hospitals.
Elsewhere, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.
Rouhani warned, however, that while Iran would reopen “calmly and gradually”, it should also prepare for “bad scenarios”. 
‘Beyond breaking point’
Across the Pacific, the pressure to ease virus measures is intense on leaders in the United States, where the economy has been hammered with tens of millions left jobless.
The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world and President Donald Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain.
Florida is set to ease its lockdown tomorrow, as authorities in other states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators – some armed – who have protested against the lockdowns.
There are signs that the pandemic is slowing down in some parts of the United States.
In New York City, the epicentre of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close, the Christian charity running it said Saturday, as virus cases decline in the city.
But authorities are wary of letting their guard down too fast, with fears the virus could wreak havoc in the most vulnerable communities in the United States.
A massive wave of infections is sweeping through America’s prison population – the world’s largest at 2.3 million – with coronavirus deaths on the rise in jails and penitentiaries across the country.
Riots over inadequate protection and slow responses by authorities have already taken place in prisons in Washington state and Kansas.
“Things are beyond breaking point at this facility,” said Brian Miller, an officer at the Marion prison in Ohio. “Right now it’s hell.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virus impact puts thousands of Rolls-Royce jobs at risk</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON, United Kingdom – Thousands of jobs could be at risk at British aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which on Sunday, May 3, said it was in talks with unions about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on operations.
As many as 8,000 jobs could be affected, according to one person familiar with the matter, as the firm grappled with what it said was the "unprecedented" fallout from the pandemic.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reducing our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times," a spokesman said.
"But we will need to take further action," he added.
The company, which has 50,000 staff in 50 countries, including some 24,000 in the United Kingdom, is working with employee and union representatives.
Further details on job losses would be given to staff before the end of the month, the spokesman said.
The global aviation industry has been badly affected by the outbreak, forcing flights to be canceled because of lack of demand and restrictions on travel.
According to the International Air Transport Association trade body, air traffic dropped by more than half in March compared with the same period last year.
United States aerospace giant Boeing has said it expected to make thousands of job cuts because of the fall in traffic volume, with demand dropping to levels not seen since 2006.
Traffic had previously dropped 10.3% year-on-year in February.
Europe's Airbus last week reported a net 1st quarter loss of 481 million euros ($522 million), compared to a profit of 40 million euros in the same period last year.
Airbus said in early April it had cut aircraft production by around a third as global airlines scaled back their plans because of the pandemic. – Rappler.com

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - Thousands of jobs could be at risk at British aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which on Sunday said it was in talks with unions about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on operations.
As many as 8,000 jobs could be affected, according to one person familiar with the matter, as the firm grappled with what it said was the "unprecedented" fall-out from the global pandemic.
"We have taken swift action to increase our liquidity, dramatically reducing our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these exceptionally challenging times," a spokesman said.
"But we will need to take further action," he added.
The company, which has 50,000 staff in 50 countries, including some 24,000 in the UK, is working with employee and union representatives.
Further details on job losses would be given to staff before the end of the month, the spokesman said.
The global aviation industry has been badly affected by the outbreak, forcing flights to be cancelled because of lack of demand and restrictions on travel.
According to the International Air Transport Association trade body, air traffic dropped by more than half in March compared with the same period last year.
US aerospace giant Boeing has said it expected to make thousands of job cuts because of the fall in traffic volume, with demand dropping to levels not seen since 2006.
Traffic had previously dropped 10.3% year-on-year in February.
Europe's Airbus last week reported a net first-quarter loss of 481 million euros ($522 million), compared to a profit of 40 million euros in the same period last year.
Airbus said in early April it had cut aircraft production by around a third as global airlines scaled back their plans because of the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New head of Alberta Energy Regulator wants to rebuild confidence in leadership</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CALGARY — Like a sports coach coming off a disappointing season, the new head of the agency that regulates Alberta’s heavily challenged energy industry knows he’s got some work to do.
“One (goal) is rebuilding confidence in the leadership internally,” Laurie Pushor said in an interview.
“Confidence in the public and government and the industry that we are a good team of people and that we’re doing our best and that we’re open to continuing to improve.”
Pushor, two weeks into the job, replaces Jim Ellis as boss of the Alberta Energy Regulator. Ellis left last November after investigators found serious mismanagement, misuse of about $2.3 million and a “culture of fear” among whistleblowers.
“Improvement will include continuing to strengthen transparency and continuing to strengthen accountability for our performance,” Pushor promised.
That’s not the only challenge he and the energy regulator face.
There’s an enormous backlog of abandoned and orphaned wells that will cost someone billions to clean up. There are difficult relationships between the regulator, First Nations and landowners.
And there’s the industry itself for which profits and reserves are declining.   
Don’t count Alberta out yet, said Pushor. Notwithstanding the uncertainties of COVID-19 and international oil price wars, there’s still money to be made, he said.
“If you look at recovery rates and the innovation that industry is applying to known reserves, not only might we not be presiding over an industry in decline, but you might see a bit of a renaissance in conventional production.”
Rebuilding trust with First Nations is another priority for Pushor. In his previous job as Saskatchewan’s deputy minister of energy and resources, he worked with a traditional knowledge-keeper, he said.
“He is relentless in reminding me that it’s about relationships,” said Pushor, who promises plenty of face-to-face time with Indigenous leaders.
“If you’re not in a relationship, you’re not going to be able to move things forward. We, as the regulator, need to be in a good relationship with First Nations.”
Pushor wants the same kind of contact with landowner groups, who have often been critical of how industry uses their land and treats them.
“It’ll start with three or four of the larger groups out there that have organized. I look forward to catching up and understanding their issues and seeing what can be done to move things ahead.”
When it comes to cleaning up wells, Pushor acknowledges he’s got some work to do to grasp the legal ins and outs. Critics have long pushed for a legislated timeline for dealing with old infrastructure and say that the province’s calculations on whether a well owner has the wherewithal for cleanup are antiquated.
Pushor asks for a little time to dig into those issues.
“The government’s the policymaker,” he said. “They’re going to give us the framework they want us to operate in.”
There’s an inevitable tension between business, environmental and public concerns, Pushor said.
“That tension is real and it should be. What makes a regulator effective is ensuring that tension is balanced.”
He believes the public still has faith in the Alberta Energy Regulator, despite its internal and external problems.
“Confidence in the industry and the regulator, while they may have eroded somewhat, remains relatively stable. But we can always do better and we should.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moratorium: Finance Minister asks banks to consider abolishing accrued interest on HP loans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 — Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz today requested that financial institutions consider abolishing the accrued interest on hire purchase (HP) loans, as well as profit from their fixed-rate Islamic financing, during the six-month moratorium period on loan repayments.
Taking to his Facebook page today, Zafrul said that though there are many banks that offer loan deferment without imposing the accrued or compounded interest, the leeway does not cover all loan products.
“Each bank, meanwhile, sets its own approach on matters related to interest imposition, during the moratorium.
“Taking into cognisance that there is a possibility that it can be implemented, and taking the people’s request into account, I would like to suggest that all financial institutions, especially those involved in this moratorium, to consider abolishing the accrued interest for hire purchase loans or profits for fixed-rate Islamic financing, for this six-month moratorium period,” Zafrul said.
He added that although the final say in the matter lies with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, has begun taking proactive steps to seek a solution to the issue, via discussions with BNM and banks, in the interests of the people.
“Given the challenging economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, I sincerely hope that this view can be given due consideration by BNM and other financial institutions in the country. I believe this move will have a positive impact on our people,” he added.
BNM yesterday said that it regrets the “confusion and anxiety” stemming from its announcement on changes to the six-month moratorium for HP loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing, on March 30.
In a newly released frequently asked questions (FAQs) list yesterday, the central bank denied that it had also backpedalled on its initial announcement.
In its explainer, BNM stressed that the payment deferment is still automatic for HP and fixed rate Islamic financing, adding that what is required now is an additional step to comply with procedural requirements under the Hire-Purchase Act 1967 (HP Act) and Shariah.
“This additional step is unavoidable, and is required to incorporate the changes to the payment schedule and/or amounts as a result of the six-month payment deferment in loan/financing agreements.
“We sincerely regret any confusion and anxiety that this announcement may have caused. The deferment of loan repayments is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers/customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This intent remains the same. The confusion arises because of the misperception that the repayment amounts for a HP loan cannot be changed,” it said.
BNM added that the misperception arose, due to an illustration provided in an initial version of the FAQs, “where certain assumptions and caveats were made.”
It said that it had later removed the example when banks provided their own illustrations.
BNM then provided an example of a RM50,000 HP loan with a remaining tenure of five years and a fixed interest of 2.71 per cent (or an effective rate of 5.36 per cent) per annum:
Before the deferment, the monthly instalment was RM712.
But should the deferment option be accepted, based on this example, the monthly instalment is now RM731, or an increase by 2 per cent or RM19. Consequently, the total interest increase incurred is RM1,130.
Several reports emerged on the evening of April 30, citing a BNM press release, on a purported reversal from what was initially announced with regards to deferment of HP loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing.
Financial website, Ringgit Plus, reported that the press release had “hinted of a big change that will affect millions of Malaysians currently servicing car loans or Islamic financing.”
The report, which was one of those widely shared by those angered by the announcement, reported that BNM had also implied that from May 1, 2020, the six-month moratorium will also no longer be an automatic opt-in for all customers.
Ringgit Plus reported that the press release further stated that BNM required that all borrowers “are provided with clear information on the process and changes to the terms of their agreements”, and that the banking institutions provide borrowers with “necessary steps that they need to take to complete the process of deferring their loan/financing payments”.
This was seen as a departure from what was announced initially, where customers are only asked to opt-out of the deferment, should they want to continue servicing their loans with their banks, as otherwise, banks would grant an automatic deferment.
BNM later said that any additional interest that some banks may charge on the deferred payment cannot be higher than the original hire-purchase contract signed.
The central bank reiterated that, as a regulator, it has from the very beginning, already indicated that there will be accrued interest or profit with regard to the six-month moratorium.
The announcement also saw social media users targeting Zafrul with criticisms coupled with the hashtag #bankerjagabanker.
The confusion further escalated and caused widespread anger; which even led to the start of an online petition denouncing the move by BNM and demanding for zero per cent interest on the deferred instalment payments.
Last month, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the government’s move to freeze loan repayments for six months due to the coronavirus disease, which he said will provide relief worth RM100 billion to Malaysians.
The prime minister said the unprecedented move BNM announced on March 24, was the government’s response to public concern about hardships they are enduring due to the movement control order (MCO). — Malay Mail

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finance minister asks banks to consider abolishing accrued interest on hire purchase loans, profits on fixed-rate Islamic financing during moratorium</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 — Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz today requested that financial institutions consider abolishing the accrued interest on hire purchase (HP) loans, as well as profit from their fixed-rate Islamic financing, during the six-month moratorium period on loan repayments.
Taking to his Facebook page today, Zafrul said that though there are many banks that offer loan deferment without imposing the accrued or compounded interest, the leeway does not cover all loan products.
“Each bank, meanwhile, sets its own approach on matters related to interest imposition, during the moratorium.
“Taking into cognisance that there is a possibility that it can be implemented, and taking the people’s request into account, I would like to suggest that all financial institutions, especially those involved in this moratorium, to consider abolishing the accrued interest for hire purchase loans or profits for fixed-rate Islamic financing, for this six-month moratorium period,” Zafrul said.
He added that although the final say in the matter lies with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, has begun taking proactive steps to seek a solution to the issue, via discussions with BNM and banks, in the interests of the people.
“Given the challenging economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, I sincerely hope that this view can be given due consideration by BNM and other financial institutions in the country. I believe this move will have a positive impact on our people,” he added.
BNM yesterday said that it regrets the “confusion and anxiety” stemming from its announcement on changes to the six-month moratorium for HP loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing, on March 30.
In a newly released frequently asked questions (FAQs) list yesterday, the central bank denied that it had also backpedalled on its initial announcement.
In its explainer, BNM stressed that the payment deferment is still automatic for HP and fixed rate Islamic financing, adding that what is required now is an additional step to comply with procedural requirements under the Hire-Purchase Act 1967 (HP Act) and Shariah.
“This additional step is unavoidable, and is required to incorporate the changes to the payment schedule and/or amounts as a result of the six-month payment deferment in loan/financing agreements.
“We sincerely regret any confusion and anxiety that this announcement may have caused. The deferment of loan repayments is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers/customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This intent remains the same. The confusion arises because of the misperception that the repayment amounts for a HP loan cannot be changed,” it said.
BNM added that the misperception arose, due to an illustration provided in an initial version of the FAQs, “where certain assumptions and caveats were made.”
It said that it had later removed the example when banks provided their own illustrations.
BNM then provided an example of a RM50,000 HP loan with a remaining tenure of five years and a fixed interest of 2.71 per cent (or an effective rate of 5.36 per cent) per annum:
Before the deferment, the monthly instalment was RM712.
But should the deferment option be accepted, based on this example, the monthly instalment is now RM731, or an increase by 2 per cent or RM19. Consequently, the total interest increase incurred is RM1,130.      
Several reports emerged on the evening of April 30, citing a BNM press release, on a purported reversal from what was initially announced with regards to the interest payable on the deferred HP loans and profit on fixed-rate Islamic financing.
Financial website, Ringgit Plus, reported that the press release had “hinted of a big change that will affect millions of Malaysians currently servicing car loans or Islamic financing.”
The report, which was one of those widely shared by those angered by the announcement, reported that BNM had also implied that from May 1, 2020, the six-month moratorium will also no longer be an automatic opt-in for all customers.
Ringgit Plus reported that the press release further stated that BNM required that all borrowers “are provided with clear information on the process and changes to the terms of their agreements”, and that the banking institutions provide borrowers with “necessary steps that they need to take to complete the process of deferring their loan/financing payments”.
This was seen as a departure from what was announced initially, where customers are only asked to opt-out of the deferment, should they want to continue servicing their loans with their banks, as otherwise, banks would grant an automatic deferment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Finance minister asks BNM and banks to reconsider charging interest on HP loans in 6-month moratorium</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Finance minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz has waded into the issue regarding banks charging interest on paused hire purchase (HP) loan payments (or profit from fixed-rate Islamic financing) in the government announced six-month moratorium to ease financial burden and improve cashflow in these difficult times.
Before we go into what the former top banker turned cabinet member said on his Facebook page, here’s a recap on the issue. This week, it was announced that HP loans (we’ll use the term to cover fixed-rate Islamic financing as well) will come with additional interest charges after the six-month moratorium effective from April 1 to September 30.
Basically, if you choose to take up the half-year payment pause, it won’t be interest free, and you’ll have to pay back the interest later. The confusion, and anger for some, is that many expected the six-month payment moratorium to incur no interest, just a pause and nothing else.
A Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) FAQ released on March 27 indicated that there would be no additional interest charged on HP loans. This mention regarding HP loans was subsequently dropped in an amended FAQ dated April 21, and mention of interest being charged emerged. Refer to the screenshots to compare.
Basically, there will no free lunch now, so to speak, but Tengku Zafrul is requesting the banks to consider abolishing the accrued interest for HP loans for the six months.
“Lately, there has been confusion regarding the interest or profit rate charged during the six-month moratorium scheme offered by banks. Among the causes of this confusion are various sources that delivered inaccurate information. With that, BNM on May 1 published an FAQ document that has been updated. BNM has also conducted a press conference to clarify the confusion faced by borrowers,” he said today on his Facebook page, translated into English here.
“For your information, there are indeed banks that offered loan moratoriums without charging accrued interest or compounded interest. However, it does not cover all loan products. Also, every bank has its own approach regarding charging interest in the moratorium period.
“Taking into account that there’s a possibility for it to be implemented, and after considering the rakyat’s request, I would like to suggest that all financial institutions, especially those involved in the moratorium, consider abolishing the accrued interest (for HP loans) or profit (for fixed-rate Islamic financing) for the six-month moratorium period,” he added.
The minister acknowledged that this matter is under the purview of BNM, but said that the finance ministry has started proactive steps to find a solution for the issue via discussions with BNM and the banks, to find the best solution for the people.
“We at the finance ministry are ready to work together with BNM and the banking sector to ensure the implementation of this call. The government is always sensitive towards the needs of the rakyat, especially those from the B40 and M40, and is taking this matter seriously. In such a challenging economic situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, I hope that this view will be given fair consideration by BNM and the financial institutions.
“I am confident that this move will bring positive impact to the rakyat,” he ended.
Yesterday, BNM released a statement acknowledging the public’s confusion. “We sincerely regret any confusion and anxiety that this announcement may have caused. The deferment of loan repayments is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers/customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. This intent remains the same. The confusion arises because of the misperception that the repayment amounts for a HP loan cannot be changed,” BNM said.
The central bank added that the misperception came about due to an illustration provided in an initial version of its FAQ, “where certain assumptions and caveats were made.” BNM said that it had later removed the illustration when the banks provided their own.
Earlier, we’ve also seen a few banks confirm these “assumptions” of monthly instalments staying the same after the moratorium period, in both their own FAQs and official responses to customer queries. We were among those who reported this original scenario, based directly on the information available, which – at the time – was accurate.
Yesterday, BNM also released an example of a RM50,000 HP loan with a remaining tenure of five years, on a fixed interest of 2.71% per annum. The original monthly instalment was RM712. Should the borrower opt for the payment pause, the monthly instalment will be RM731 in October once the moratorium ends. This is an increase of 2%, or RM19 a month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett stays on sidelines with cash rising to $137 billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Katherine Chiglinsky
Warren Buffett has been waiting years for stocks to look more attractive. He apparently didn’t think the first-quarter plunge was that opportunity.
As the coronavirus slowdown started to grip the U.S., the famed investor’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was building its massive cash pile to a record $137 billion by the end of March. The company said that figure climbed even higher as it dumped more than $6 billion of stocks in April, making Buffett a net seller of equities so far this year.
Buffett, who will host Berkshire’s annual meeting virtually later Saturday, has largely stayed in the shadows as the pandemic hammered the global economy and stock markets. That’s a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when his Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse. While Berkshire’s operating earnings climbed in the first quarter, Buffett warned of pain from the virus’s fallout.
“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” the company said in a regulatory filing Saturday.
The sharp drop in stocks sparked a debate over whether the slide was overblown, with some financial leaders highlighting buying opportunities and others predicting more pain to come. Those looking to Buffett for bullish signs would be left wanting. Berkshire reduced its stock buybacks even as its shares saw their biggest quarterly decline in more than a decade, while the $6.1 billion of net equities sales in April far outstripped the $1.8 billion of net purchases in the year’s first three months.
“Historically, he’s been pretty visible in the marketplace, encouraging investors to take advantage of market downturns and being greedy when others are fearful,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “But if Buffett himself isn’t seeing opportunities, even in his own stock, what are we to think about the recent market selloff? Is it not a buying opportunity for long-term investors?”
Throwing off CashBerkshire’s Class A shares have dropped about 19% this year through Friday’s close, worse than the 12% decline in the S&P 500 over the same time period.
Berkshire repurchased just $1.7 billion of its own stock, less than it did in the last three months of 2019. The company recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as airlines have been pummeled by travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders worldwide.
Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices. That has prompted a range of questions about whether he can continue the market-beating run that turned Berkshire into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
“He’s really careful about taking on risks that he can’t really ascertain, and I think that’s what’s happening now,” said Paul Lountzis, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Lountzis Asset Management.
The conglomerate’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by $55.5 billion in unrealized losses in the huge stock portfolio. Gains in the insurance unit’s investing portfolio helped push operating earnings up almost 6% to $5.87 billion.
Wild RideBerkshire started to see the Covid-19 pandemic affect units including its railroad, BNSF, which reported a 5.2% decrease in volume in the first quarter. Precision Castparts, which makes products for industrial and energy companies, reported lower sales across all of its major markets, partially because of the pandemic and Boeing Co.’s 737 Max issues. The company’s footwear and apparel businesses were also hit, reporting a 34% decline in earnings.
The company said its essential businesses that have remained open saw revenue slow “considerably” in April, while many of those that had to close are being “severely impacted.” Berkshire didn’t record any goodwill impairments in the quarter, but said it may have to write down the value of some of its businesses at its next review in the fourth quarter. Still, the company called its liquidity and capital “extremely strong.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“Berkshire Hathaway should still produce solid earnings and remain a bastion of financial strength, but stark 1Q declines bode poorly for 2020 comparisons.”
-- Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst
Buffett will host the annual meeting starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
Here are other details from Berkshire’s earnings report:
• Berkshire’s businesses have implemented business-continuity plans to help weather the crisis and are “preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of Covid-19.”
• Some operations have had to furlough employees, reduce wages and salaries, or cut back on capital spending to help mitigate the losses, Berkshire said in the report. See’s Candies, which Buffett bought in 1972, announced in early April that it would furlough retail workers and said more recently that it was testing reopening a few stores.

“As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” the company said in a regulatory filing Saturday.
The sharp drop in stocks sparked a debate over whether the slide was overblown, with some financial leaders highlighting buying opportunities and others predicting more pain to come. Those looking to Buffett for bullish signs would be left wanting. Berkshire reduced its stock buybacks even as its shares saw their biggest quarterly decline in more than a decade, while the $6.1 billion of net equities sales in April far outstripped the $1.8 billion of net purchases in the year’s first three months.
“Historically, he’s been pretty visible in the marketplace, encouraging investors to take advantage of market downturns and being greedy when others are fearful,” Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “But if Buffett himself isn’t seeing opportunities, even in his own stock, what are we to think about the recent market selloff? Is it not a buying opportunity for long-term investors?”
Berkshire’s Class A shares have dropped about 19% this year through Friday’s close, worse than the 12% decline in the S&P 500 over the same time period.
Berkshire repurchased just $1.7 billion of its own stock, less than it did in the last three months of 2019. The company recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as airlines have been pummeled by travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders worldwide.
Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been on the hunt for higher-returning investments such as acquisitions or stock purchases for years, but has struggled amid what he called “sky-high” prices. That has prompted a range of questions about whether he can continue the market-beating run that turned Berkshire into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
“He’s really careful about taking on risks that he can’t really ascertain, and I think that’s what’s happening now,” said Paul Lountzis, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Lountzis Asset Management.
The conglomerate’s first-quarter net income plunged to a loss of $49.7 billion, driven by $55.5 billion in unrealized losses in the huge stock portfolio. Gains in the insurance unit’s investing portfolio helped push operating earnings up almost 6% to $5.87 billion.
Berkshire started to see the Covid-19 pandemic affect units including its railroad, BNSF, which reported a 5.2% decrease in volume in the first quarter. Precision Castparts, which makes products for industrial and energy companies, reported lower sales across all of its major markets, partially because of the pandemic and Boeing Co.’s 737 Max issues. The company’s footwear and apparel businesses were also hit, reporting a 34% decline in earnings.
The company said its essential businesses that have remained open saw revenue slow “considerably” in April, while many of those that had to close are being “severely impacted.” Berkshire didn’t record any goodwill impairments in the quarter, but said it may have to write down the value of some of its businesses at its next review in the fourth quarter. Still, the company called its liquidity and capital “extremely strong.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“Berkshire Hathaway should still produce solid earnings and remain a bastion of financial strength, but stark 1Q declines bode poorly for 2020 comparisons.”
— Matthew Palazola, senior industry analyst, and Derek Han, associate analyst
Buffett will host the annual meeting starting at 3:45 p.m. in Omaha with key deputy Greg Abel by his side. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, won’t be in attendance. Follow the TopLive blog here.
Here are other details from Berkshire’s earnings report:
Berkshire’s businesses have implemented business-continuity plans to help weather the crisis and are “preparing for reduced cash flows from reduced revenues and economic activity as a result of Covid-19.”Some operations have had to furlough employees, reduce wages and salaries, or cut back on capital spending to help mitigate the losses, Berkshire said in the report. See’s Candies, which Buffett bought in 1972, announced in early April that it would furlough retail workers and said more recently that it was testing reopening a few stores.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway reports record quarterly loss thanks to pandemic, but Warren Buffett likely isn't too worried</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berkshire Hathaway took a hit during the coronavirus pandemic, reporting a record net loss of $49.75 billion in the first quarter. But CEO Warren Buffett likely isn't too concerned, CNBC reports.
That's because Buffett considers the company's operating profit, which actually rose 6 percent in the first quarter, to be a better performance measure. Berkshire's losses mainly reflect losses from investments in common stocks, which the company had loaded up on recently because Buffett hasn't been able to settle on any large companies to buy outright over the last four years. Some of those stocks include four major airlines — American, Delta, Southwest, and United — which have plummeted due to the decline in travel.
While the net loss was record-setting for Berkshire, Buffett is never immune to swings like this since an accounting rule requires the company to report unrealized stock losses and gains with earnings. That leads to booms and busts that the CEO considers meaningless, per CNBC.
Still, many of Berkshire's operating businesses were indeed hurt by the pandemic, and revenues deemed "essential" slowed "considerably" in April. Read more at CNBC.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deputy finance minister urges Sarb to print money – Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Africa’s finance deputy minister was quoted in a leading newspaper on Sunday as urging the central bank to temporarily create money to fund the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, David Masondo called on the government to avert a 1930s-style depression by getting the central bank to buy government bonds directly to fund the country’s deficit during the coronavirus crisis.
“Such bonds must be once-off special bonds with earned proceeds, and should be treated as a temporary measure with a clear exit plan,” he was quoted by the paper as saying.
“Such money from the Sarb (South African Reserve Bank) must be used for immediate Covid-19 health-related interventions and … economic recovery measures,” he added.
A central bank spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Cyril Ramaphosa last month announced a record R500 billion rescue package equalling 10% of the GDP of Africa’s most industrialised nation, to cushion the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then debate has stirred as to how it is to be funded.
Ramaphosa has approached the IMF and World Bank, a sensitive issue in a government that has generally been hostile to the so-called Washington consensus.
Masondo is a former youth leader of South Africa’s Communist Party, but since Ramaphosa appointed him a year ago he has been a strong advocate of tough economic reforms, including clamping down on excessive government spending.
In an unprecedented move in March, the bank central did begin a programme of buying back government bonds from the secondary market to inject liquidity and prevent lending from seizing up.
But the idea of the central bank purchasing government debt directly to fund the deficit would most likely cross a red line for Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, a fiscal conservative who believes in central bank independence.
The government would also be keen to avoid a situation like neighbour Zimbabwe, whose runaway money-printing to pay its bills triggered massive hyperinflation a decade ago.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No more subsidy, increased tax… what FG promised IMF to secure $3.4bn loan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The federal government assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it would not return to the era of fuel subsidy after the COVID-19 pandemic is over.
In a letter of intent requesting for the $3.4 financial assistance under IMF’s rapid financing instrument, the federal government assured the IMF that it would remain “engaged with the IMF to benefit from its policy advice and its technical assistance”.
The letter was signed by Zainab Ahmed, the minister of finance, budget and national planning, and Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
At a meeting on March 18, the federal executive council agreed that it would begin moves to deregulate the downstream oil sector by adjusting petrol retail price to any development in the global oil market.
Read the full text of policy assurances that the Nigerian government provided to the IMF below:
Going beyond this year, the government of Nigeria is fully committed to pursuing policies consistent with macroeconomic stability and good governance:
First and foremost, we will revert to our government’s planned medium-term fiscal consolidation path—which includes increasing revenue to 15 percent of GDP through further VAT reforms, rise in excises, and removal of tax exemptions— once the crisis passes. The recent introduction and implementation of an automatic fuel price formula will ensure fuel subsidies, which we have eliminated, do not reemerge. In line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act, this will allow us to reduce the Federal Government deficit to under 3 percent of GDP and eliminate recourse to central bank financing by 2025.
We are also advancing in our power sector reforms—with technical assistance and financial support from the World Bank—including through capping electricity tariff shortfalls this year to N380 billion and moving to full cost-reflective tariffs in 2021.
Monetary and exchange rate Policy. As outlined in our home-grown Economic Recovery and Growth Plan, we are also strengthening monetary and exchange rate policies with a view to moving towards full exchange rate unification and greater exchange rate flexibility, which would help preserve foreign exchange reserves and avoid economic dislocation.
In addition to the external borrowing sought, we are also increasing our domestic borrowing limits in the supplementary budget so that we can make use of our favourable low domestic yields, particularly since the results of the last domestic bond auction show strong demand. The existing stock of overdrafts held at the CBN will also be securitized.
We fully recognize the importance of ensuring that financial assistance received is used for intended purposes. To that end, we will (i) create specific budget lines to facilitate the tracking and reporting of emergency response expenditures and report funds released and expenditures incurred monthly on the transparency portal (http://opentreasury.gov.ng/); (ii) publish procurement plans, procurement notices for all the emergency response activities—including the name of awarded companies and of beneficial owners—on the Bureau of Public procurement website; and (iii) publish no later than three to six months after the end of the fiscal year the report of an independent audit into the emergency response expenditures and related procurement process, which will be conducted by the Auditor General of the Federation—who will be provided the resources necessary and will consult with external/third party auditors.
In line with IMF safeguards policy, we commit to undergoing a new safeguards assessment conducted by the Fund. To this end, we have authorized IMF staff to hold discussions with external auditors and provide IMF staff access to the CBN’s most recently completed external audit reports.We do not intend to introduce measures or policies that would exacerbate the current balance-of-payments difficulties. We do not intend to impose new or intensify existing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, trade restrictions for balance-of-payments purposes, or multiple currency practices, or to enter into bilateral payments agreements which are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
We are determined to meet the immense challenge the Covid-19 pandemic is facing us with. Support from the international community will be critical, and we look forward to early approval of financial assistance by the IMF—which will help our effort to keep the Nigerian economy on a strong path and sustain our fight against poverty. Beyond this much needed immediate financial assistance, we reaffirm our willingness to remain engaged with the IMF, to benefit from its policy advice and its technical assistance.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">’Femi Asu
The Federal Government has pledged that it will ensure that fuel subsidy, which was recently removed, does not re-emerge.
The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, and the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, made the pledge in a letter to the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Mrs Kristalina Georgieva.
The sharp drop in crude oil prices on the back of the spread of coronavirus saw the landing cost of petrol hitting a record low, wiping off subsidy on the product.
The pump price of petrol, which is still being regulated by the government, was reduced to N125 per litre from N145 per litre on March 18, 2020.
The Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency further announced on March 31 a price band of N123.50-N125 per litre.
The IMF, last Tuesday, approved the country’s request for emergency financial assistance of $3.4bn, and published the Federal Government’s letter of intent in a detailed report released late on Wednesday.
“The recent introduction and implementation of an automatic fuel price formula will ensure fuel subsidies, which we have eliminated, do not reemerge,” the Federal Government told the IMF in the letter dated April 21, 2020.
The Chairman, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, Mr Tunji Oyebanji, said market operators remained uncomfortable with pump prices being fixed by fiat.
Oyebanjo, in the association’s latest newsletter seen by our correspondent, said, “Prices (supply or purchase costs and open market sales prices including pump prices) should not be regulated but monitored against anti-competitive and antitrust abuses by the already established competition commission and subject to its clearly stated rules and regulations.
“All suppliers, transporters, service providers and market players (including the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation) should be subject to the same rules and regulations, backed by appropriate legislation.”
He said equal access to foreign exchange at competitive rates to all market players must be guaranteed.
Oyebanji said, “Monopolies and dominant market players should be deliberately restructured or their market dominance deliberately curtailed.
“Abuses related to market dominance include cutting prices in order to drive out competitors, determining market share of other market players using their dominance in the supply chain and sometimes selling at a loss (or break-even) to manipulate the market.
“Monopolies create inefficiencies and inequities in the market, government interference and abuse.”
The NNPC has been the sole importer of petrol into the country for more than two years, after private oil marketers stopped importing the commodity due to crude price fluctuations, among other issues.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Ministry of Finance on Friday reassured the international community of accountability and transparency in the spending of the foreign assistance aid given to the country to fight the coronavirus, saying the government has established a committee under the leadership of the first vice president to ensure better management of the funds.
"The Afghan government is fully committed to undertake the right management and transparent spending of the aid. There are certain sets of procedures outlined for this purpose which will ensure transparency, better management and effective use of the assistance," said Shamroz Khan Masjidi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance.
Following the spread of COVID-19, the international community has pledged around $540 million dollars to Afghanistan in its struggle against the deadly pandemic.
Of the amount, $115 million was provided by the World Bank, $115 million by the EU, $50 million by the Asian Development Bank, $25 million by the US and $220 million in loans by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
"Money was allocated for the fight against the coronavirus from the national budget--there is also foreign aid--but poor management and poor monitoring systems cause doubts about the ability of the government," said Ezatullah Adib, a member of Integrity Watch Afghanistan (IWA)"
Recently the Afghan government announced that it had created a committee under the chairmanship of First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, and the Afghan government insists that this aid should be spent through the government budget instead of NGOs.
Experts have said that the Afghan government needs to assure the global community that it can manage and spend the international assistance by defining comprehensive and effective strategies.
"They (the international community) feels fear about a possible waste of money, and the people have raised complaints," said Tariq Farhadi, a former presidential adviser.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Statsguru: Key indicators point to grim economic outlook amid lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">March saw just 10 days of the lockdown due to Covid-19, and lead indicators point at the weakening economic activity.
The crucial eight-industry core sector output fell the sharpest in the new series in the month (chart 1). This is likely to have a dampening impact on the index of industrial output (IIP), which will be released on May 12. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing did not contract but was the lowest in four months (chart 2). The figure to be released on Monday will tell the grimmer story ahead as many vehicle manufacturers, including Maruti Suzuki India and MG Motor India, reported zero sales
in the domestic market.
PMI's services did contract, with trade, hospitality coming to a grinding halt, though the pace of fall in the index was not as steep as that of the core sector (chart 3) April data would show the real position. With the external world facing the same situation and even worse in some markets, exports declined the sharpest since 1994-95 (chart 4).
However, the situation on the external account is not as worrisome due to the fall in global oil prices and many economists expect small surplus or minor deficit in the current account balance.
The demand for petrol in the domestic market reflected the same trend. As economic activity came to a virtual halt, the consumption of petrol fell in the month, for the first time in 2019-20 (chart 5).
The effect of lockdown was evident on power demand as well with the industry not allowed to work except for essential goods. The demand never rose since March 22, year on year. It was falling on earlier days of the month as well, but it was not a secular decline (chart 6).StatsGuru is a weekly feature.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington: Economic activity in the US manufacturing sector plunged to an 11-year low in April amid mounting COVID-19 fallout and weak global energy markets, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported.The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell by 7.6 percentage points to 41.5 per cent in April, the lowest since April 2009. Any reading below 50 per cent indicates the manufacturing sector is generally contracting.Of the 18 manufacturing industries, only paper products and food, beverage and tobacco products reported growth, according to the ISM."The PMI indicates a level of manufacturing-sector contraction not seen since April 2009, with a strongly negative trajectory," Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM's manufacturing business survey committee, said in a statement.
"The coronavirus pandemic and global energy market weakness continue to impact all manufacturing sectors for the second straight month," Fiore said."Our refinery is losing money making gasoline due to the falling demand," said an executive from the industry of petroleum & coal products, according to the ISM.The manufacturing contraction came after the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that US real gross domestic product in the first quarter contracted at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent amid COVID-19 fallout, the biggest quarterly decline since the 2008 financial crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manufacturing Sector Plummets In April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
By Robert Hughes
The Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a 41.5 percent reading in April, down from 49.1 percent in March. The April result is the second month in a row below the neutral 50 threshold (see top chart). Overall, the report notes, "Comments from the panel were strongly negative (three negative comments for every one positive comment) regarding the near-term outlook, with sentiment clearly impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and continuing energy market recession. The PMI indicates a level of manufacturing-sector contraction not seen since April 2009, with a strongly negative trajectory."
Many of the key components of the Purchasing Managers' Index have already fallen to levels not seen since the lows of the Great Recession in 2008-09. The New Orders Index came in at 27.1 percent, down from 42.2 percent in March and the lowest since December 2008 (see top chart). The results suggest production as measured by the Federal Reserve's industrial production for manufacturing index may show steep declines in the coming months. The New Export Orders Index came in at 35.3 percent in April, down 11.3 percentage points from a 46.6 percent result in March.
The production index was at 27.5 percent in April, down from 47.7 percent in March and a new record low since the survey began in 1948 (see bottom chart). The backlog-of-orders index came in at 37.8 percent in April, down from 45.9 percent in March and suggesting a second month of decline in backlogs.
The employment index fell 16.3 percentage points to 27.5 percent in April versus 43.8 percent in March, and the lowest reading since June 1949 (see bottom chart). The move farther below neutral suggests employment in manufacturing likely fell sharply in April. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Situation report for April is due out on Friday, May 8. Consensus expectations are for a shockingly large loss of more than 22 million nonfarm-payroll jobs including a drop of 1.6 million jobs in manufacturing. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to 16.1 percent from 4.4 percent in March.
Supplier deliveries, a measure of delivery times from suppliers to manufacturers, jumped for the third consecutive month, reaching 76.0 percent, up from 65.0 percent in March. April was the highest reading since April 1974. Slower supplier deliveries are usually consistent with stronger manufacturing activity. However, the slower deliveries in April were more a result of supply chain and logistical constraints. According to the report, "Suppliers continue to struggle to deliver, at a much stronger rate compared to March. The COVID-19 pandemic was the primary cause of global and domestic supply chain disruptions, with suppliers impacted by plant shutdowns, transportation challenges and the continuing difficulty in importing parts and components."
The prices index fell 2.1 percentage points to 35.3 percent in April from 37.4 percent in March, and the lowest since January 2016. Weaker prices were reported for scrap steel, other steels, aluminum, copper, corn, distillates and other energy sources.
Customer inventories in April are still considered too low, with the index remaining below 50 at 48.8 percent versus 43.4 percent in the prior month (index results below 50 indicate customers' inventories are too low). The index has been below 50 for 43 consecutive months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amid pandemic, oil woes, Saudi Arabia eyes further reforms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — A beleaguered Saudi Arabia is taking modest steps to improve its human rights record as it tries to navigate the coronavirus pandemic and the fallout from plunging oil prices that have rankled the United States and the Trump administration.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the force behind Saudi Arabia’s sweeping changes and risky gambles, is eyeing further steps he hopes will improve the kingdom’s international image, which was badly damaged by the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by government agents in 2018 and the war in Yemen.
In the past week alone, the kingdom announced two changes to the law: banning flogging as a punishment and doing away with the death penalty for crimes committed by minors.
People familiar with the crown prince’s plans say future steps are likely to be announced within weeks and months and will involve penal reform so that punishments meted out for specific crimes are no longer the sole purview of judges.
Still, it may not be enough to win Riyadh fresh support in Washington or praise from human rights groups.
The crown prince, while transforming life inside Saudi Arabia, has overseen a parallel crackdown on activists and perceived critics. Among those detained in the prince’s quest to solidify power are dual U.S.-Saudi nationals, women’s rights activists, writers, moderate clerics and senior princes.
Saudi Arabia’s already strained relationship with Congress has worsened in past weeks, including among members of President Donald Trump’s party.
Republicans have accused Saudi Arabia of exacerbating instability in the oil market. That came after the kingdom ramped up oil production and slashed prices following a breakdown in talks with Russia over production cuts before a new deal was reached.
The volatility and price crash in oil, amid already weakened demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, pummeled U.S. shale producers, leading to layoffs in the industry, particularly in Republican-run states.
Some Republican senators warned in late March that if Saudi Arabia does not change course, it risks losing American defence support and facing a range of potential “levers of statecraft” such as tariffs and other trade restrictions, investigations and sanctions.
The backlash couldn’t have come at a worse time for the kingdom as tensions remain high with rival Iran.
The crown prince may be hoping that continuous reforms can revive what had largely been a warm relationship with the Trump administration, which has deployed U.S. troops to the kingdom to deter Iranian attacks. Positive headlines could also help maintain support from Washington even if Trump is defeated in November.
Domestically, the crown prince’s reform efforts are aimed at modernizing the country and creating millions of jobs to stave off an upswell in unemployment and discontent among the majority of the population, who are under the age of 35.
To do this, the crown prince has forged a friendship with Trump, his influential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, courted foreign investors and used the country’s sovereign wealth fund to scoop up investments abroad. It has paid millions of dollars to Western public relations firms and consultancies to revamp Saudi Arabia’s image and put together a plan to diversify the oil-dependent economy.
That’s meant pivoting Saudi Arabia away from its ultraconservative Islamic roots, known as Wahhabism, which many in the country closely adhere to.
There are, however, hard limits on the kingdom’s reforms, which the prince is dribbling out with the blessing of his father, King Salman.
Executions for crimes committed as minors have been relatively rare, so ending that practice isn’t a major change. It appears only one of the 184 executions in 2019 was for a crime committed as a minor. In addition, the reforms are expected to spare the lives of at least six Shiite men who were facing possible death penalty for crimes committed as minors. Many minority Shiites in the Sunni-ruled country complain of discrimination as sectarian tensions have soared regionally.
There’s also no indication that Saudi Arabia is curbing the crackdown on perceived critics.
The killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi critic and Washington Post columnist, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by agents who worked for Prince Mohammed cast a pall over the reforms the 34-year-old prince had been lauded for. It also complicated his ability to court foreign investment needed to transform the Saudi economy.
Members of Congress voted unanimously to hold the crown prince responsible for Khashoggi’s death, despite his insistence that he had no knowledge of the operation.
Not long after, Congress voted to end U.S.-assistance in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, a conflict that has killed thousands of civilians, displaced millions and pushed people to the brink of famine. Trump vetoed the bill.
Since Khashoggi’s killing, few U.S. lawmakers have travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet Prince Mohammed.
It wasn’t always like this. The young royal had been highly praised in Washington before Khashoggi’s killing for decisions on ending the ban on women driving, allowing concerts and movie theatres and curtailing the powers of the religious police.
These moves allowed young Saudis to mix publicly without strict gender segregation rules. They gave Saudi women more freedom in how they wear the floor-length abaya in public. Women were also encouraged to play sports and work in greater numbers.
Last year, Saudi Arabia allowed women to travel abroad and obtain a passport without the permission of a male relative. For years before this change, women of all ages had to rely on the whims of husbands, fathers, brothers or sometimes their own sons to travel. It led to women fleeing Saudi Arabia t o escape abusive homes.
Progress on women’s rights, however, coincided with the arrest of more than a dozen Saudi women right’s activists in mid-2018. Several remain imprisoned and face trial on crimes related to national security and their human rights outreach.
Some have testified of being tortured and sexually assaulted during interrogations by masked men. At least one of the women attempted suicide.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amid pandemic, oil woes, Saudi Arabia eyes further reforms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A beleaguered Saudi Arabia is taking modest steps to improve its human rights record as it tries to navigate the coronavirus pandemic and the fallout from plunging oil prices that have rankled the United States and the Trump administration.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the force behind Saudi Arabia's sweeping changes and risky gambles, is eyeing further steps he hopes will improve the kingdom's international image, which was badly damaged by the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by government agents in 2018 and the war in Yemen.
In the past week alone, the kingdom announced two changes to the law: banning flogging as a punishment and doing away with the death penalty for crimes committed by minors.
People familiar with the crown prince's plans say future steps are likely to be announced within weeks and months and will involve penal reform so that punishments meted out for specific crimes are no longer the sole purview of judges.
Still, it may not be enough to win Riyadh fresh support in Washington or praise from human rights groups.
The crown prince, while transforming life inside Saudi Arabia, has overseen a parallel crackdown on activists and perceived critics. Among those detained in the prince's quest to solidify power are dual US-Saudi nationals, women's rights activists, writers, moderate clerics and senior princes.
Saudi Arabia's already strained relationship with Congress has worsened in past weeks, including among members of President Donald Trump's party.
Republicans have accused Saudi Arabia of exacerbating instability in the oil market. That came after the kingdom ramped up oil production and slashed prices following a breakdown in talks with Russia over production cuts before a new deal was reached.
The volatility and price crash in oil, amid already weakened demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, pummeled US shale producers, leading to layoffs in the industry, particularly in Republican-run states.
Some Republican senators warned in late March that if Saudi Arabia does not change course, it risks losing American defense support and facing a range of potential “levers of statecraft” such as tariffs and other trade restrictions, investigations and sanctions.
The backlash couldn't have come at a worse time for the kingdom as tensions remain high with rival Iran.
The crown prince may be hoping that continuous reforms can revive what had largely been a warm relationship with the Trump administration, which has deployed US troops to the kingdom to deter Iranian attacks.
Positive headlines could also help maintain support from Washington even if Trump is defeated in November.
Domestically, the crown prince's reform efforts are aimed at modernizing the country and creating millions of jobs to stave off an upswell in unemployment and discontent among the majority of the population, who are under the age of 35.
To do this, the crown prince has forged a friendship with Trump, his influential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, courted foreign investors and used the country's sovereign wealth fund to scoop up investments abroad.
It has paid millions of dollars to Western public relations firms and consultancies to revamp Saudi Arabia's image and put together a plan to diversify the oil-dependent economy.
That's meant pivoting Saudi Arabia away from its ultraconservative Islamic roots, known as Wahhabism, which many in the country closely adhere to.
There are, however, hard limits on the kingdom's reforms, which the prince is dribbling out with the blessing of his father, King Salman.
Executions for crimes committed as minors have been relatively rare, so ending that practice isn't a major change. It appears only one of the 184 executions in 2019 was for a crime committed as a minor.
In addition, the reforms are expected to spare the lives of at least six Shiite men who were facing possible death penalty for crimes committed as minors. Many minority Shiites in the Sunni-ruled country complain of discrimination as sectarian tensions have soared regionally.
There's also no indication that Saudi Arabia is curbing the crackdown on perceived critics.
The killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi critic and Washington Post columnist, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by agents who worked for Prince Mohammed cast a pall over the reforms the 34-year-old prince had been lauded for.
It also complicated his ability to court foreign investment needed to transform the Saudi economy.
Members of Congress voted unanimously to hold the crown prince responsible for Khashoggi's death, despite his insistence that he had no knowledge of the operation.
Not long after, Congress voted to end US-assistance in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, a conflict that has killed thousands of civilians, displaced millions and pushed people to the brink of famine. Trump vetoed the bill.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Single Level Above $9,000 Is Crucial to an Even Greater Bitcoin Rally</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has been on a stellar run over the past week, gaining 20%, according to data from Coin360.com. It’s a move that has brought the cryptocurrency above resistance level after resistance level, suggesting an uptrend is forming.
Since peaking at $9,500 though, the cryptocurrency has slipped, with BTC now trading at $8,800 as of the time of this article’s writing. It’s a retracement that isn’t all too convincing of the bull case, an analyst has suggested.
According to a crypto swing trader, Bitcoin closing above $9,090 on a weekly basis will have him “full[y bullish] until further notice,” referencing how the level has been a key resistance and support level over the past year.
BTC closing above $9,090, the chart suggests, would confirm a resistance-support flip of that level, giving the cryptocurrency the fuel to rally even higher.
Unfortunately, it seems that this bullish close will not come to pass, with BTC trading at $8,800 as of the time of this article’s writing.
Unless the cryptocurrency can mount a multi-percent rally in the coming two hours, a weekly close above $9,090 will need to wait until next week.
Bitcoin seems unlikely to close the weekly above the level specified by the trader, but analysts say there is a confluence of other reasons to be bullish on the main cryptocurrency on a medium-term time frame.
One well-known trader remarked that there is a strong confluence of reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin at the moment. The confluence of reasons is as follows:
Also bullish, the Parabolic Stop-and-Run Reversal indicator just signaled a “buy” for Bitcoin on the weekly chart.
Nunya Bizniz, a chartist in the cryptocurrency space, explained that in the wake of the six times this indicator has appeared in the past five years, Bitcoin saw “substantial upside.” Such was the case at the start of 2019, when just prior to the 25% breakout on April 1st, the PSAR flipped bullish, marking the start of an over 300% rally.
History repeating will see BTC strongly break to the upside yet again in the coming weeks.
In terms of fundamentals, Bitcoin’s block reward halving is a mere 10 days out, estimates suggest. Analysts expect this fundamental event to act as a catalyst for a parabolic surge in the cryptocurrency market.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin May be Topping Out After Buyers Lost a Key Level</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has entered what appears to be another bout of sideways trading within the upper-$8,000 region. This has come about after the crypto’s bulls made another attempt to propel it past the resistance that has been established throughout the lower-to-mid $9,000 region.
The benchmark crypto’s recent price action has led analysts to note that it could be topping out, as the consecutive rejections it has posted throughout the past few days is a dire sign that greatly favors sellers.
If the crypto confirms this possibility and begins declining lower, its first major support zone exists around $8,250.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up marginally at its current price of $8,935, marking a notable decline from daily highs of $9,200 that were set yesterday afternoon.
The crypto was able to post what appeared to be a sustained break above $9,000 yesterday afternoon, as buyers held BTC above this level for several hours before moving to test the resistance at $9,200.
The visit to this level, however, sparked a sharp selloff that led it down to its strong support at $8,800, which has since been defended.
One popular crypto trader spoke about this latest rejection in a recent tweet, explaining that it is now imperative that buyers continue defending the crypto’s point-of-control at $8,800.

Another popular pseudonymous trader recently explained that he believes BTC could be forming a local top as it fails to surmount its overhead resistance.

Because Bitcoin has broken below $9,000 in the time since this analysis was offered, it is a growing possibility that the crypto declines lower in the hours and days ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bitcoin Falls Back Into The Upper-$8,000 Region</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has entered what has all the earmarks of being another episode of sideways trading inside the upper-$8,000 area. This has come to to fruition after the cryptocurrency’s bulls made another attempt endeavor to drive it past the resistance that has been built up all through the lower-to-mid $9,000 region.
The benchmark cryptocurrency’s recent value activity has driven experts to take note of that it could be topping out, as the consecutive dismissals it has posted all through the previous few days is a desperate sign that extraordinarily favors sellers.
In case the cryptocurrency confirms this chance and starts declining lower, its first significant support zone exists around $8,250.
At the hour of writing this post, Bitcoin is trading up hardly at its present price of $8,846, denoting an notable decay from daily highs of $9,200 that were set yesterday evening.
The cryptocurrency had the option to present what showed up on be a continued break above $9,000 yesterday evening, as purchasers held Bitcoin (BTC) over this level for a few hours before moving to test the resistance at $9,200.
The visit to this level, nonetheless, started a sharp selloff that drove it down to its solid support at $8,800, which has since been guarded.
One well-known cryptocurrency trader talked about this most recent dismissal in a recent tweet, clarifying that it is presently imperative that buyers keep shielding the cryptocurrency’s point-of-control at $8,800.
He said –
Another mainstream pseudonymous trader recently clarified that he trusts that Bitcoin could be shaping a local top as it neglects to conquer its overhead resistance.
He said –
Since Bitcoin has broken underneath $9,000 in the time since this analysis was offered, it is developing chance that the cryptocurrency decreases lower in the hours and days ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Billionaire Warren Buffett hasn't had a haircut or worn a tie in 7 weeks, he revealed at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett has been dressing down and letting his hair grow out during the coronavirus pandemic, he revealed during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday.
“It’s been seven weeks since I’ve had a haircut,” the billionaire investor and Berkshire CEO said during the virtual event, which was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
“It’s been more than seven weeks since I put on a tie or anything,” Buffett continued. “Just a question of which sweatsuit I wear.”

The 89-year-old has likely been avoiding a trip to the barbers and other non-essential social contact to avoid catching the potentially lethal virus.
He joked in March that he was “drinking a little more Coca-Cola” during the pandemic, as the soda “seems to have warded off everything else in life.”
Buffett made his latest comments while discussing Berkshire’s exit from its positions in the “big four” US airlines. The conglomerate sold $US6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, which Buffett attributed to dumping airline stocks.
He suggested that people might fly less in the coming years out of fear of catching the virus, or cut back on travel after realising the ease of working from home. Fewer passengers could force the airlines to drop prices, widening their losses due to the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Billionaire Warren Buffett hasn’t had a haircut or worn a tie in 7 weeks, he revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett has been dressing down and letting his hair grow out during the coronavirus pandemic, he revealed during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday.
“It’s been seven weeks since I’ve had a haircut,” the billionaire investor and Berkshire CEO said during the virtual event, which was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
“It’s been more than seven weeks since I put on a tie or anything,” Buffett continued. “Just a question of which sweatsuit I wear.”

The 89-year-old has likely been avoiding a trip to the barbers and other non-essential social contact to avoid catching the potentially lethal virus.
He joked in March that he was “drinking a little more Coca-Cola” during the pandemic, as the soda “seems to have warded off everything else in life.”
Buffett made his latest comments while discussing Berkshire’s exit from its positions in the “big four” US airlines. The conglomerate sold $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, which Buffett attributed to dumping airline stocks.
He suggested that people might fly less in the coming years out of fear of catching the virus, or cut back on travel after realizing the ease of working from home. Fewer passengers could force the airlines to drop prices, widening their losses due to the coronavirus.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett discussed a range of topics at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday, famously described as “Woodstock for capitalists.”
The famed investor and Berkshire CEO, along with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, hosted the virtual event and answers questioned posed by journalists.
The pair spoke hours after Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings. The company posted a record quarterly loss of about $50 billion, largely due to $55 billion in investment losses. It also grew its cash pile from $128 billion to $137 billion in the period, and sold about $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, upending expectations that it would capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap.
Here are the highlights from the Berkshire annual meeting:
Buffett opened the meeting by explaining the absence of Charlie Munger, his longtime partner.
“Charlie is in fine shape, his mind is as good as ever, his voice is as strong as ever,” he said, but it “just didn’t seem like a good idea” for the 96-year-old to attend.
“He’s added Zoom to his repertoire,” Buffett continued. “He’s just skipped right by me technologically. Like stepping over a peanut.”
Buffett tackled the topic of coronavirus early on in the meeting.
“It’s been a flip of the switch in a huge way in terms of national behavior, the national psyche, it’s dramatic,” he said.
“There was an extraordinary wide variety of possibilities on both the health side and the economic side,” he continued. A few months on, it’s become clear that “we’re not getting a best case and we know we’re not getting a worst case.”
“The range of possibilities is still extraordinarily wide,” he continued. “We do not know what happens when you shut down a substantial portion of society.”
Whereas the train fell off the tracks in the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett said, “This time we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on its siding.”
Buffett discussed America’s rapid progress since its creation.
“We are a very, very young country,” he said. “What we have accomplished is miraculous.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett held forth on airlines, buybacks, bailouts, coronavirus, the US economy, oil prices, and other topics at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, often described as "Woodstock for capitalists."
The famed investor and Berkshire CEO, along with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, hosted the virtual event and answered several questions. The event was livestreamed by Yahoo Finance.
The pair spoke hours after Berkshire released its first-quarter earnings. The company posted a record quarterly net loss of about $50 billion, largely due to $55 billion in investment losses.
It also grew its cash pile from $128 billion to $137 billion in the period, and sold about $6.1 billion in stock on a net basis in April, upending expectations that it would capitalize on the coronavirus sell-off and buy stocks on the cheap.

Here are the highlights from the Berkshire annual meeting:
Buffett opened the meeting by lamenting the absence of Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and his longtime partner.
"Charlie is in fine shape, his mind is as good as ever, his voice is as strong as ever," he said. It "just didn't seem like a good idea" for the 96-year-old to fly from his California home to attend the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
"He's added Zoom to his repertoire," Buffett continued, referring to the video-conferencing app. "He's just skipped right by me technologically. Like stepping over a peanut."
Buffett discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
"It's been a flip of the switch in a huge way in terms of national behavior, the national psyche, it's dramatic," he said.
"There was an extraordinarily wide variety of possibilities on both the health side and the economic side," Buffett continued. A few months on, it's become clear that "we're not getting a best case and we know we're not getting a worst case."
"The range of possibilities is still extraordinarily wide," Buffett continued. "We do not know what exactly happens when you shut down a substantial portion of your society."
Whereas the US economy went off the tracks in the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett said, "This time we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on its siding."

Buffett offered historical context for the current disruption by reflecting on the Great Depression. He pointed out that someone who invested on the day of his birth in August 1930 needed to wait more than 20 years to make back their money.
He also discussed the challenges that his father faced at that time, when he had no job and two children to feed, but couldn't access his savings as the bank was closed.
"Don't worry about your groceries," Buffett's grandfather, who owned a grocery store where Buffett and Munger worked as children, told his father. "I'll let your bill run."
"He cared about his family, but he wasn't going to go crazy," Buffett joked.
When the Dow Jones passed the 381 mark in the 1950s, he said, investors feared the market was overheated and it was going to be 1929 again. Buffett's mentor and boss at the time, Benjamin Graham, was called to Washington along with a slew of other experts to assess whether the US economy was in trouble.
Now, the Dow is above 24,000. "You're looking at a market today that has produced $100 for every $1," Buffett said. "Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it."
"We are now a better country as well as an incredibly more wealthy country than we were in 1789," the next slide read. "We have gone dramatically in the right direction," Buffett said.

Buffett applied his optimistic outlook to the pandemic threat. He also underlined his company's commitment to funding its own operations, and warned against the dangers of debt.
"When something like the current pandemic happens, it's hard to factor that in and that's why you never want to use borrowed money to buy into investments," he said. "We run Berkshire that way."
"There's no reason to use borrowed money to participate in the American tailwind," he added.
Buffett also trumpeted the merits of stocks.
Equities are an "enormously sound investment," he said, that will outperform US Treasuries and the money people have stashed under their mattresses over time.
Buffett also discouraged people from selling stocks purely because their prices change.
"If you owned the businesses you liked prior to the virus arriving, it changed prices, but nobody's forcing you to sell."
The Berkshire boss recommended "the best thing" for investors to bet on is the S&P 500 index, as it gives them a broad cross-section of American businesses.
"I will bet on America the rest of my life," Buffett said. "I hope I've convinced you to bet on America."

Buffett described the impact of coronavirus on Berkshire's numerous companies.
"For some period, certainly during the balance of the year ... our operating earnings will be considerably less than if the virus hadn't come along," he said. "It hurts some of our businesses a lot."
While Berkshire's three biggest businesses — insurance, the BNSF railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy — are in a "reasonably decent" position," Buffett said, other businesses have been "effectively shut down."
Buffett also defended the company's vast cash reserves.
"We don't want to be dependent on the kindness of friends even," Buffett said, let alone strangers. "There are times when money almost stops," he added, pointing to the 2008 financial crisis and the liquidity crunch just over a month ago.
"Investment-grade companies were essentially going to be frozen out of the market" in late March, Buffett said, before the Federal Reserve "reacted in a huge way."
"Fear is the most contagious disease you can imagine, makes the virus look like a piker," he added, using a term for a gambler who only makes small bets.
Buffett shed some light on Berkshire's stock-market activity in recent months. "We did very little in the first quarter," he said.
However, he pointed to Berkshire's sales of $6.1 billion in stocks on a net basis in April, and explained that figure reflected its exit from positions in the "big four" US airlines.
"It turned out I was wrong," Buffett said about his bets on American, Delta, United, and Southwest. He explained that the airline business has "changed in a very major way."
The investor questioned whether people would fly as much in the next two or three years as they did last year. Even if 70% or 80% of the airline business returns, he said, the carriers could end up with "too many planes."
Later, he added that an oversupply of airline seats would drive down prices, and it was unclear how long the airlines would have to sustain billions of dollars in operating losses due to the pandemic.
Moreover, they will have to repay their recent loans from the government out of their earnings, he said. The carriers also agreed to hand over warrants that the Treasury can exercise to buy their shares at a discount in the future then sell them for a profit, potentially weighing on their stock prices down the line.
"The future is much less clear to me," Buffett said about the airline business.
Buffett addressed the question of whether Berkshire would be bailing out companies as it did during the financial crisis. He said that the Fed's speed in lending to struggling companies meant there was less need for Berkshire's cash this time around, and the right opportunity was yet to come its way.
"We haven't done anything because we don't see anything that attractive to do," Buffett said. However, there was some early interest, he added.
"There was a period right before the Fed acted," the investor said. "We were getting calls. A number of them were able to get money in the public market, frankly at terms that we wouldn't have given them."
Buffett and Abel added that none of Berkshire's fully owned businesses have applied for government aid.
Buffett detailed the tough situation at See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned chocolate maker that he's described as his "dream business."
"We were in the midst of our Easter season, and Easter is a big sales period for See's," he said. "See's business stopped and it's a very seasonal business to start with. We have a lot of Easter candy. Easter candy's kind of specialized too, we won't sell it."
He also acknowledged that not all of Berkshire's businesses will last, giving the example of Blue Chip Stamps, a trading stamps company that he invested in back in the 1970s.
Buffett tackled the topic of Berkshire's underperformance versus the S&P 500 in recent years.
"The truth is I recommend the S&P 500 to people," he said. "Berkshire is about as sound as any single investment can be in terms of earning reasonable returns over time, but I would not want to bet my life on whether we beat the S&P 500 over the next 10 years."
While Berkshire's sheer scale makes it difficult to beat the broader market, Buffett said, it has some upsides.
"We're better positioned than anyone in the energy business," he said, citing the fact it doesn't have to pay dividends. "We can do things in insurance that nobody else can do."
Buffett lauded Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairman of insurance operations.
He praised his intelligence, revealing that he wrote to Jain's father a few years after he joined Berkshire to say, "If you've got another son like this, send him over from India, and we'll rule the world."
Buffett weighed in on the plunge in oil prices in recent weeks. He defended his $10 billion investment in Occidental Petroleum, saying "it was attractive at oil prices that then prevailed." Now, he continued, "it does not pay to drill."
"Any shareholder in any oil-producing company, you join me in having made a mistake so far in where oil prices went," Buffett added. "Who knows where they go in the future." 
If oil prices remain low, he continued, at least some energy companies are likely to default on their loans, hurting their shareholders and causing headaches for the banking industry.
"There's going to be a whole lot of money [lost]," Buffett said.
Buffett considered the prospect of negative interest rates as central banks around the world cut rates to almost zero in order to stimulate their economies.
"Probably the most interesting question that I've seen in economics," he said.
"We're doing things that we don't know [their] ultimate outcome," Buffett continued, warning of "extreme consequences."
The puzzle of what negative rates would do to US financial markets is "the most important question in the world," he said in March. "And I don't know the answer."
Buffett doubled down on his defense of buybacks as an efficient way of distributing cash to shareholders. The practice is facing fresh criticism after the "big four" airlines repurchased billions' worth of their stock in recent years, then clamored for government aid when they were caught short of cash by the coronavirus outbreak.
"It's very politically correct to be against buybacks," Buffett said. "There's a lot of crazy things said on buybacks."
While he's witnessed some cases of "stupid" buybacks, they aren't immoral, he added.
Buffett answered a question about why Berkshire didn't repurchase more of its shares when they plunged in late March.
The investor seemed to suggest that Berkshire's intrinsic value fell roughly in line with its stock price during the market meltdown.
"I don't feel that it's far more compelling to buy Berkshire shares now than I did three months or six months or a year ago," Buffett said.
"Berkshire is worth less today because I took that position than if I hadn't," he said about its airline investments.
Buffett praised the Paycheck Protection Program, the government initiative to loan money to small businesses to help them weather the pandemic.
"It's a very good idea to take care of the people that are having terrible trouble taking care of themselves," Buffett said. He expected some amount of fraud, but gave "real credit" to Congress for acting promptly to help the millions of people left jobless by the outbreak.
Comedian Bill Murray submitted a similar question about how the country would reward the grocery-store cashiers, delivery drivers, warehouse workers, and others who will make up "a new class of war veterans."
"It's like people that landed in Normandy," Buffett said. "The poor, the disadvantaged, there's an unimaginable suffering. They're working 24-hour days and we don't even know their names."
"We ought to do something that can help those people," he added, referring more broadly to Americans struggling to make ends meet. "Nobody should be left behind."

The Lagos State Government has issued fresh guidelines for the reopening of markets and shopping malls as part of efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered gradual easing of the lockdown imposed on the Lagos, Ogun and FCT from Monday.
Speaking at a stakeholders’ meeting in Alausa, Ikeja, Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr. Wale Ahmed, said all markets and stores in the various Local Governments/Local Council Development Areas across the metropolis will be allowed to open from 9 am till 3 pm on selected days.
He emphasised that everyone patronising them will be mandated to observe precautionary measures such as physical distancing and high levels of personal and respiratory hygiene.
 
Ahmed disclosed that malls will also be allowed to open with the provision that stores will maintain a 60% occupancy capacity at any point in time while ensuring two-meter physical distancing is maintained between a shopper and the next person in the store.
The Commissioner maintained that food handlers must also wear masks and hand gloves in markets at all times.
He directed shop owners must provide hand sanitisers and wash hands with soap and running water at all entry points, conduct temperature checks on customers and ensure that nobody is exempted from the process.
According to him, the guidelines are proactive measures put in place to curtail a possible spread of the deadly virus among traders in markets places and malls when the gradual ease of the lockdown commences on Monday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Lagos State Government has issued new guidelines for the reopening of markets and shopping malls in the state as part of efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, following Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu‘s announcement on the gradual easing of the lockdown in Lagos from Monday.
Speaking at a stakeholders’ meeting held in Alausa, Ikeja, the Honourable Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Wale Ahmed , reiterated that all markets and stores in the various Local Governments/Local Council Development Areas across the metropolis will be allowed to open from 9 a.m till 3 p.m on selected days.
He emphasised that everyone attending these markets and stores will be mandated to observe precautionary measures such as physical distancing and high levels of personal and respiratory hygiene.
Mr Ahmed declared that malls will also be allowed to open with the proviso that stores will maintain a 60 per cent occupancy capacity at any point in time, while also ensuring that a two-meter physical distancing is maintained between a shopper and the next person in the store.
The commissioner maintained that food handlers must also wear masks and hand gloves in markets at all times, directing that shop owners must provide hand sanitisers and wash hands with soap and running water at all entry points, conduct temperature checks on customers and ensure that nobody is exempted from the process.
According to him, the guidelines are proactive measures put in place by the government to curtail a possible spread of the deadly virus among traders in markets places and malls when the gradual ease of the lockdown commences on Monday, May 4, 2020.
Mr Ahmed disclosed that stakeholders at the meeting, which was attended by the Iyaloja/President, General Association of Commodity Market Women and Men of Nigeria, Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, and other major market leaders in the state, unanimously agreed that effective from May 4, 2020, food sellers and other ware traders should operate on alternate days in all markets across the State.
“In essence, those trading in other items and wares apart from food will only be allowed to trade on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while all food and farm produce sellers will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays,” the commissioner explained.
While stressing that there will be zero tolerance for all forms of street-trading, Mr Ahmed disclosed that all market leaders also promised to ensure that their members abide by all the stated guidelines, while the Ministry, Chairmen of LGs/LCDAs, Office of Iyaloja-General and the State Enforcement Agencies will ensure strict compliance with the directives.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Stocks Slump as Minister Warns of ‘Painful’ Measures Ahead</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Arabian stocks dropped the most in almost eight weeks after the kingdom’s finance minister said “painful” measures -- including deep spending cuts -- were needed to respond to the coronavirus crisis and crash in oil prices.
The Tadawul All Share Index closed down 7.4%, the most since March 9. Oil giant Saudi Aramco retreated 5.2% to 30 riyals per share, while major lenders including Al Rajhi Bank, National Commercial Bank and Saudi British Bank plunged at least 6.7%.
The world’s biggest oil exporter hasn’t witnessed “a crisis of this severity” in decades, Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in an interview with Saudi television station Al-Arabiya on Saturday, adding that government spending will have to be cut “very deeply.” His comments were a sharp change in tone from more reassuring remarks he gave about the economy one week before.
Al-Jadaan “is the voice of the Saudi government and leadership,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital Ltd. in Abu Dhabi. Investors “took it as a warning of much higher spending cuts to come than the original 20%-30% expected earlier in the crisis.”
On Friday, the government’s outlook was cut to negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service, citing “increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia’s fiscal strength.” The rating was kept at A1, the fifth-highest, and one level above that of Fitch Ratings.
The collapse in crude prices and the government’s drawdown of foreign reserves is putting more pressure on the Saudi riyal. Still, prices for 12-month dollar-riyal forward contracts are well short of their all-time high reached in 2016.
A currency devaluation would be too costly for Saudi Arabia and the better option is to adapt to the oil shock through fiscal changes, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GCC markets in red as Saudi Arabia warns of ‘painful’ times ahead</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Gulf stock markets were trading deep in the red on Sunday, with the region’s largest bourse – Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul – leading declines, after the kingdom warned of a much harsher COVID-19 hit to its economy.
Dubai Financial Market (DFM) index dropped 3.96 per cent to 1,946 points, while Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) fell 2.95 per cent to 4,105 points, with losses exasperating minutes after Tadawul plunged over 7 per cent.
Saudi Arabia will need to take “painful” measures and look for deep spending cuts as the kingdom faces a double crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the meltdown in global oil markets, its finance minister said on Saturday.
Investors elsewhere in the GCC were worried that more countries in the region will follow suit in implementing stringent measures against the growing virus outbreak in the days and months ahead.
“The kingdom hasn’t witnessed a crisis of this severity over the past decades,” Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in an interview with Saudi television station Al-Arabiya. “It’s very important that we take very tough and strong measures, and they might be painful, but they’re necessary.”
Investors were particularly jolted as the stance taken by the kingdom was a sharp reversal from just over a week ago. The finance minister's remarks then were reassuring, when he reiterated the kingdom had been through similar crises before, “maybe even worse,” and would pass through this one as it had others.
In contrast, on Saturday, Al-Jadaan said that government spending would need to be “cut deeply”, while adding that the list of budget items that will be affected is “very long”.
Some programs under the kingdom’s “Vision 2030” -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic diversification plan -- will also face spending cuts as their implementation is delayed by measures taken to slow the spread of the virus, Al-Jadaan warned.
Worsening sentiment in the region were more downward rating revisions. International ratings agency Moody's Investors Service on Thursday revised Saudi Arabia's outlook to negative on Saturday.
The world’s largest oil exporter is bracing for a bigger hit from the oil price rout and production cuts negotiated by OPEC and its allies. The price of Brent crude crashed by more than 50 per cent in March, contributing to a record $27 billion monthly drop in the Saudi central bank’s net foreign assets.
The Saudi benchmark plunged as much as 7 per cent in early Sunday trading, while Boursa Kuwait dropped 1.5 per cent and the Qatar Stock Exchange slipped nearly a per cent. The indices in Bahrain and Muscat were trading relatively flat on Sunday.
The ratings agency also changed the outlook for Dubai’s largest listed developer Emaar Properties and its unit Emaar Malls Group to negative from stable, citing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, S&P Global Ratings placed Emaar Properties and Emaar Malls on creditwatch with negative implications.
The Dubai real estate sector has for years struggled with oversupply and sluggish economic growth. On the DFM, Emaar Properties slumped 4.7 per cent in early trade, with its spin-offs Emaar Development and Emaar Malls recording similar sized losses as well.
Also among top decliners were Dubai Islamic Bank which dropped over 4 per cent. On the Abu Dhabi bourse, lenders and real estate firms followed suit, with ADIB dropping 4.4 per cent and Aldar Properties down 4.9 per cent. Lender ADCB fell 2.2 per cent.
Markets were also weighed by renewed wider geopolitical concerns, particularly as the trade relations between the US and China were back in the spot light, worsening after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leading Indian carmakers had zero sales in April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: India’s top carmakers couldn’t ship a single vehicle to dealers in April as they shut production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the world’s biggest stay-at-home restrictions to stop the coronavirus from spreading.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., which produces about half the cars on India’s roads, and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., the nation’s biggest SUV maker, recorded no sales in the domestic market last month. Hyundai Motors India Ltd. too couldn’t sell a single unit last month. Maruti sold more than 120,000 cars a month in the year ended March 31.
“There’s always a first time for everything,” said Maruti’s Chairman R.C. Bhargava in a phone interview. “I can’t say what will happen in May. Whether we will start production or not is not possible to forecast.”
The total lockdown is hurting local vehicle makers, who sold more than 2.8 million cars, SUVs and vans each month in the year ended March, more than peers in other countries. In China, while sales plunged in February, the peak of the pandemic in that nation, companies managed to sell 224,000 cars. Indian carmakers were struggling even before the lockdown. The pandemic and the ensuing stay-at-home orders on March 25 have since disrupted supply chains.
With the economy set for a rare contraction, the outlook for the car manufacturers remains bleak. They are losing 23 billion rupees ($306 million) each day factories remain closed, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The lobby group has written to the government seeking help.
“Considering the fragile health of the automotive industry, as also its economic contribution, we are writing to request you to kindly allow the entire automotive value chain for opening up and re-commencing operations,” car and auto part makers said in a joint letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs on Friday.
The ministry extended the stay-at-home restrictions for most parts of the country for two weeks starting May 4.
Bhargava in a recent interview to Bloomberg had said he expects a car-sales boom after the lockdown is lifted as customers appear more motivated to buy than before the pandemic because they see personal vehicles as safer than public transport.
Although there were no sales in the local market last month, Maruti exported 632 units after a port in the western state of Gujarat resumed operations, while Mahindra sold 733 vehicles in international markets. Hyundai shipped 1341 units in April. These are wholesale numbers as Indian carmakers do not announce retail figures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Buffett Dumps Airlines and His Aerospace Pain Only Worsens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped its stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines but the billionaire investor remains deeply exposed to the collapse in air travel.
Berkshire still owns all of Precision Castparts Corp., a supplier of aerospace parts that’s bracing for lean times as Boeing Co. and Airbus SE cut jetliner production. Berkshire bought Precision Castparts in 2016 in a transaction valued at $37.2 billion, making it one of Buffett’s biggest deals.Now the maker of jet-engine blades and aircraft structural components is facing a double whammy as the coronavirus pandemic all but erases demand for flights, prompting airlines to park jets and slash schedules. That means less need for replacement parts and a big drop in aircraft purchasing. With carriers predicting that flying won’t return to 2019 levels for as long as three years, aerospace suppliers are hunkering down for a protracted slump.
“The current downturn is quite different from regular economic cycles,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners in London. “Normally, there’s an exaggerated short-term impact with a fairly quick return. This time around, the impact seems to be significant as you’re looking at a collapse in air travel around the world.”
In the U.S. alone, passenger totals are down about 95% from a year ago. An index of major U.S. carriers has lost more than half its value this year, paced by a 70% drop for United Airlines Holdings Inc. Buffett said he lost money on his investments in the industry, which also included stakes in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.“The airline business -- and I may be wrong and I hope I’m wrong -- but I think it’s changed in a very major way,” Buffett said. “The future is much less clear to me.”
Airline shares sank sharply in pre-market U.S. trading Monday, with big players like American and United falling more than 10%. Boeing slid 4% while General Electric Co. was down 1.8%.
Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman for non-insurance operations, acknowledged at Berkshire’s annual meeting Saturday that Precision Castparts was getting hit, although its defense business remained strong. The parts maker is working to adjust the business to meet current demand, he said, and Buffett pointed out that the pain is rippling throughout the supply chain.
“We’re going to have aircraft in this country, we’re going to be flying. But the real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not and when you’re likely to need them and it affects a lot of people,” Buffett said. “And it certainly affects Precision Castparts, it affects General Electric. It obviously affects Boeing.”
Boeing and Airbus have also tumbled by more than half, with steeper declines at suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. and Triumph Group Inc.“It’s good for Precision Castparts that they’re not a standalone public company right now, because if they were, they’d certainly have a very low stock price,” said James Armstrong, who oversees investments including Berkshire shares as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. “It’s not great news for them, but I don’t think that business goes away. I think it slows down.”
Precision Castparts has been hit by two massive and unpredictable blows that weren’t in any way its fault.
Even before the Covid-19 outbreak pushed airlines into the worst crisis in industry history, Boeing’s 737 Max was grounded in March 2019 after two deadly crashes. The Chicago-based planemaker halted production of the Max, its best-selling jet, earlier this year as the flying ban dragged on.
The fortunes of Precision Castparts are largely tied to those of Boeing, said Scott Hamilton, a consultant at Leeham Co. who publishes a popular aviation news website. As goes the aerospace giant, so goes its suppliers, he said.“Nobody could have foreseen the airline industry collapse in which 95% of the traffic evaporated virtually overnight,” Hamilton said. “Nobody could foresee the grounding of the Max lasting what may be 18 months. And just as Precision is tied to Boeing, Boeing is tied to the airlines.”
Precision Castparts watched its sales slip in the first quarter across all of its major markets, Berkshire said Saturday in its earnings report. That was partly due to the effects of Boeing’s Max problems as well as reduced shipments to customers hurt by the pandemic. That contributed to a 7.3% decline in pretax earnings in the period.
The parts maker ended up temporarily halting work at a plant in Portland, Oregon, and later said it would “significantly” cut its workforce, according to a report in The Oregonian. Berkshire said that the business faced higher production costs because of “manufacturing inefficiencies primarily attributable to Covid-19.”
Boeing also briefly paused production of multiple aircraft programs. The company has said it will reduce employment by 10%, or about 16,000 jobs, and lower production of jetliners including the 787 Dreamliner.
Precision Castparts, with its advanced technologies for casting and forging metals, will remain a key cog in the aerospace supply chain. In addition to the robust defense business in aircraft parts, the company serves customers in the power and energy industries.But with commercial air travel facing a long and uncertain recovery, Buffett’s bet on Precision Castparts will remain a drag on Berkshire for the foreseeable future.“That’s a big-time dud,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, which owns Berkshire shares. “He obviously in retrospect made a real bad whole-company purchase.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">JPMorgan Chase approved to process $15 billion in new PPP loans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that the U.S. Small Business Administration gave it the green light to make $15 billion in new loans to some 211,000 business customers hurt by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
The largest U.S. bank said it expects to process a total of $29 billion in loans for around 239,000 customers as part of the government’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The average of these loans is for $123,000, according to a press release.
Congress gave the Small Business Administration (SBA) nearly $660 billion over the past two months for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans that businesses hurt by the epidemic could apply for at participating banks.
Faced with high demand from many of the country’s roughly 30 million small businesses, the program’s success was hindered by technology failures, a lack of clarity on the rules and paperwork required, and by banks’ struggles to quickly launch platforms to process the high volume of loan requests.
“Thousands of dedicated (staff) worked tirelessly over the past 30+ days to support the federal government in one of the largest and most ambitious emergency lending facilities in history,” JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
Big banks have faced criticism from policymakers for approving loans to businesses considered to be at the larger end of the small businesses range. This fueled concerns that the program’s funds would be exhausted before smaller, needier companies could apply.
Congress attempted to address this concern this week by ring-fencing $30 billion for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. But pent-up demand meant those funds were exhausted by Tuesday.
For its part, JPMorgan said on Friday that half of the PPP loans it processed went to companies with fewer than 5 employees, and 75% of the loans were for less than $100,000.
“We’ve followed (the government’s) direction to deploy this relief as quickly as possible and agree with their tightening of eligibility requirements so that funding goes to those that need it most,” Chief Executive of Chase Business Banking Jennifer Roberts said in a statement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">JPMorgan Chase approved to process US$15 billion in new PPP loans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that it received government approval to process roughly US$15 billion in loans through the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, bringing its total number of funded loans through the program to about US$29 billion.
The latest batch of loans approved by the SBA will go to 211,000 business customers, the bank said. In total, the bank expects to issue PPP loans to 239,000 business customers, with the average loan amount being US$123,000.
Created as part of a US$2.3 trillion congressional economic relief package, the SBA's program allows small businesses hurt by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus to apply for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans with participating banks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. Official Warns Israel About Chinese Investors Amid Crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A key U.S. official said Israel is among the countries that need better screening of foreign investment to guard against having their companies turn toward China during the economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
“One of the preliminary takeaways from this crisis is that we have to be more cautious in our dealings with China,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said in a phone interview. “There are firms out there that are desperate for capital and could become targets for predatory investment.”
The rhetoric is heating up again between the world’s two biggest economies, with President Donald Trump escalating efforts to pin blame on China for unleashing the pandemic and exploring ways to hold it accountable. Tensions are also playing out elsewhere, with the European Union ushering in the first continent-wide rules for screening takeovers on security grounds.
Chinese companies backed by the government’s financial muscle are already hunting for bargains in Europe, prompting EU countries to increase their powers to veto investment from outside the bloc. Canada is also among countries stepping up scrutiny of foreign investment amid the crisis.
“We’ve taken steps,” Schenker said. “Some of our partner nations have taken steps to bolster investment-screening efforts of late but Israel could also be welladvised to add some of these mechanisms as well.”
After coming under pressure from the U.S. to better scrutinize potential investment from China, Israel last October said it would form a new advisory panel to vet the national security aspects of foreign investment. Schenker said Israel’s new process still falls short because it doesn’t cover the field of high technology and is voluntary.
“It’s necessary but I think they can do a whole lot better and I think they should,” he said.
Others have also raised concerns over the new Israeli body, which was established when an interim government was in charge. A Rand Corp. report published this year said “the committee will likely have legal and structural challenges” and “might not fundamentally change the regulation environment.”
China is a key economic partner for Israel. It plays a major role in local infrastructure projects and is the country’s second-largest commerce partner with $11.8 billion in annual trade between the two sides.
But its role in the Israeli economy has come under pressure during Trump’s administration, with U.S. officials urging Israel to rethink China’s reach. America is Israel’s top strategic ally, and the U.S. has said intelligence sharing and other forms of cooperation could be at stake.
Axios reported over the weekend that U.S officials asked their Israeli counterparts why a Hong Kong-based company’s bid to build an Israeli desalination plant didn’t go through the screening committee. Schenker declined to comment on the specific project.
Schenker singled out a recent U.S. law known as FIRRMA -- which strengthened the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to include some non-controlling investments and real estate deals -- as potentially worth adding for Israel.
“We are working with the Israelis, talking to them about lessons learned,” he said. “But I think now in the aftermath of Covid it should highlight to all of us just how important it is to have these types of mechanisms in place.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">7 jobs that can earn you a 6-figure salary in the $4 trillion auto industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The global auto industry is, to be quite blunt, huge.
It generates trillions in annual revenue and keeps millions employed. 
The pay can also be pretty good. A unionized hourly worker at vehicle assembly plant in the US can bring home a mid-five-figure yearly total, and with seniority and overtime, get close to $100,000.
If you survey the entire industry, which supports everything from engineering to banking to insurance, you could easily find numerous six-figure salaries.
At the moment, with automakers enduring massive manufacturing shutdowns and undertaking layoffs to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, employment in the industry is in limbo. But demand for cars isn't likely to vanish, so these careers remain good bets.
Here's a sampling:
"F&I" is auto-industry shorthand for "finance and insurance." If you've ever bought or leased a vehicle from an auto dealer, you've most likely interacted with an F&I professional. They're the last stage in the purchasing process, where you're walked through the details of your lease or loan, warranty, given the opportunity to buy into extras that are dealership-exclusive, deal with local DMV regulations and paperwork, and can have insurance coverage arranged.
Sometimes, your dealer will introduce you to an F&I staffer during the buying process to review lease and loan options. The dealership, if it's franchised to sell major brands (Toyota, Ford, Cadillac, Mercedes, and so on), should have access to an automaker's captive-finance arm, as well as a bunch of banks that can make loans to buyers of varying creditworthiness.
Almost nobody walks into a dealership with bag of cash, so an F&I manager has a very big job: he or she needs to figure how people from all walks of life can get across the car-buying/leasing finish line.
Dealers make money from selling cars, but they make their real profits acting as loan brokers, insurance brokers, and by selling things like extended warranties to customers. That's why the F&I manager is well compensated — NADA reckons on average almost $133,000 a year — and often has received special training or a certification.
The range is what one might expect here: designers at the beginning of their careers make less than six figures, but the pay is still good, in the mid-fives.
Once you get some seniority, six figures is in sight. And if you become a major name in the field or oversee all design operations for a large automaker, you can rack up a lot more than $100,000.
An experienced designer at a top auto brand should spend his or her days dealing with a team of fellow designers, meeting with the engineers who are determining how a vehicle is going to get built, and spending a lot of time sketching ideas, refining those ideas using computers drafting programs, and in some cases creating physical clay models and even making full-size "tape" drawings on walls. And not all designers work on exteriors — everything from seats to sun visors also have to be developed.
Most car designers have graduated from a transportation-design program, such as the one at California's Art Center College of Design, whose alumni include Tesla's Franz von Holzhausen, Acura's Michelle Christensen, and the controversial Chris Bangle, formerly of BMW.
Becoming an engineer has always been a great path to a good starting salary. But if you stick with the gig and labor in, say, the Detroit area for General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, you could expect to hit $120,000 if you achieve some seniority. (The BLS reports that the top 10% can earn almost $137,000.)
By that point, you won't be tinkering with turbochargers any longer, but rather overseeing a group of tinkerers.
Keep at it and satisfy the boss' demands and you could become the boss yourself. Then you become a manager and might be assigned an entire vehicle to launch. At a company such as Ford, high-pressure engineering roles involve new Mustangs and pickup trucks.
Engineers typically have four-year degrees from colleges that are known for feeding into the car business, but grad-school isn't a requirement. Often, however, those with their sights on becoming executives will get MBAs.
The median salary for an electrical engineer is about $95,000, so more senior folks could easily top $100,000.
Demand for electrical engineers should dramatically increase in the coming decade as automakers shift from internal-combustion powerplants to EVs. The industry already employs electrical engineers, but going forward, battery designs and electric propulsion are going to require additional talent.
The relative simplicity of EVs compared to gas vehicles doesn't mean they aren't complicated in   other ways. Tesla, for example, has battery packs that require thousands of lithium-ion cells, all wired together and managed with software.
Becoming a professional gearhead is actually not a bad career move, as skilled mechanics can make $40-50,000 annually.
But as with other jobs in the rundown, the more experience and expertise you amass, the more you get paid. Master mechanics who have some years under their tool belts and have been trained and certified for complicated service and repair procedures are in demand and can command $100,000-and-up wages.
College degrees aren't requires, and shortage of mechanics has some vocational schools stressing the potentially big-time paydays for trained mechanics.
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median yearly salary for a software developer is $110,000. And while you might think that the auto industry needs mechanical engineers more than folks who can wrangle code, you'd be mistaken.
In fact, as cars become more and more like rolling computers, and as companies such as Cruise, Waymo, and Tesla strive to crack the challenge of autonomous vehicles, a massive talent hunt is on in the world's auto capitals to hire software engineers.
Some professionals could be trying to teach cars to drive themselves, but others could spend their days developing testing programs, supporting manufacturing teams and robotics efforts, or figuring out new ways to provide wireless connectivity to vehicles.
In the good old days, trains loaded with iron ore would roll up to one side of Ford's famous River Rouge factory and finished cars would roll out the other side.
But ever since the 1980s, such highly vertical manufacturing has been supplanted by so-called "lean" or "just in time" systems, with parts arriving as they're needed rather than being stockpiled in inventory.
To make this process work for companies that do business around the world, the supply chain manager has entered the picture and taken on a critically important role. So important that various salary-tracking websites rank this job as one of the industry's best-paying.
A degree in lots of fields can get you started, but areas such as business administration, math, economics, engineering, or science should expose you to the level of detail and organization you'd need to thrive in supply chain management.

College degrees aren’t requires, and shortage of mechanics has some vocational schools stressing the potentially big-time paydays for trained mechanics.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median yearly salary for a software developer is $110,000. And while you might think that the auto industry needs mechanical engineers more than folks who can wrangle code, you’d be mistaken.
In fact, as cars become more and more like rolling computers, and as companies such as Cruise, Waymo, and Tesla strive to crack the challenge of autonomous vehicles, a massive talent hunt is on in the world’s auto capitals to hire software engineers.
Some professionals could be trying to teach cars to drive themselves, but others could spend their days developing testing programs, supporting manufacturing teams and robotics efforts, or figuring out new ways to provide wireless connectivity to vehicles.
In the good old days, trains loaded with iron ore would roll up to one side of Ford’s famous River Rouge factory and finished cars would roll out the other side.
But ever since the 1980s, such highly vertical manufacturing has been supplanted by so-called “lean” or “just in time” systems, with parts arriving as they’re needed rather than being stockpiled in inventory.
To make this process work for companies that do business around the world, the supply chain manager has entered the picture and taken on a critically important role. So important that various salary-tracking websites rank this job as one of the industry’s best-paying.
A degree in lots of fields can get you started, but areas such as business administration, math, economics, engineering, or science should expose you to the level of detail and organization you’d need to thrive in supply chain management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global Oil Demand Starts a Long, Painful and Uncertain Recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Few have a better watchtower over oil demand than Joe Gorder, chief executive officer of major U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp. But this week Gorder didn’t even need his business insight to know that fuel consumption was starting to recover in America.
He only needed to look at the streets of San Antonio, the Texas city where he’s based, to see traffic emerging after weeks of lockdown.
“People are starting to get out more,” Gorder said. “I think there probably is a pent-up demand for folks to get out of their houses and get mobile.”
From the streets of San Antonio to Barcelona and Beijing, traffic data, sales at fuel stations, and pipeline flows all suggest that the slump in oil demand probably bottomed out around the middle of April, and has now started a modest -- and very tentative -- recovery. The signs matter beyond the petroleum industry as they provide a glimmer of hope after a torrent of negative economic data.
“I believe we have seen the bottom,” said Marco Dunand, co-founder of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., one of the world’s top-5 oil trading houses.
But the recovery is extremely slow. Oil traders believe it’s likely to take more than a year, and perhaps much longer, before global demand reaches the pre-pandemic levels of roughly 100 million barrels a day. A growing minority even speculate it may never get there again.
The likely shape of the revival has been a hotly contested topic. A V-shape was discarded a while ago. It’s possible it could be U-shaped, with a relatively long period along bottom, or L-shaped, with demand never returning to where it once was.
Perhaps the Latin alphabet doesn’t have a letter for the right shape. The square-root mathematical symbol may offer, to a point, an alternative: first a V-recovery as lockdowns are relaxed, followed by a long, flat tail as lifestyle changes, such as more work-from-home, become more normal.
Certainly, airlines don’t expect a return to the 2019 level of demand for years to come. It’s what Ed Morse, a veteran oil watcher at Citigroup Inc., calls “the winding, bumpy road to an oil recovery.”
The sheer scale of the demand destruction -- about 30 million barrels a day in April -- means the comeback is going to be a painful process. The International Energy Agency estimates that consumption will be down 25.8 million barrels a day in May, and 14.6 million in June. In December, it would still be 2.7 million a day below 2019 levels.
“We’re seeing improvements really across all three markets, we’ve seen in May volumes trending up in Europe, we see that happening in the U.S., and we see that also in Asia,” Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., told investors on Friday. “There are some, I’d say, encouraging early signs.”
The very gradual improvement comes just as producers, from the OPEC+ alliance to drillers in Texas, accelerate their output cuts. Together they could progressively push supply and demand into balance over time. In the past week, more companies, including big American firms such as ConocoPhillips, have announced fresh production closures.
“Globally, we are at the inflection point where we are past the worst for oil demand destruction but not for supply destruction,” Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultant Petromatrix GmbH. “This should help price stabilization.”
The process will take time, with unsold crude and oil products likely to accumulate well into June and perhaps even July. Storage tanks are nearly full, and brings with it the risk of New York crude gyrating wildly again when the June futures near expiry in the middle of this month, mirroring what happened when the May contract ended and sent prices below zero.
Even so, the physical oil market, where actual barrels change hands, is showing tentative signs of recovery, particularly in Europe. Urals, Russia’s flagship export grade, has risen to a premium over Brent after Moscow cut exports to a 10-year low.
The epicentre of the oil recovery is the same as where the public health crisis started in January: Wuhan. Weekday traffic in the Chinese city has almost returned to pre-crisis levels, although it remains depressed on weekends. It’s completely back to normal during rush hour in other major cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, according to data from navigation company TomTom International BV.
“There are a few green shoots in some places like China,” said Jessica Uhl, finance head at Royal Dutch Shell Plc. “We have some of our retail stations where demand and volume is up above pre-Covid levels.”
Some of these shoots are also visible in one of the most battered industries -- aviation. Commercial operations worldwide are recovering slightly, with Flightradar24 data showing 33,500 flights taking off on April 30, the most in a month. However, that’s still two-thirds lower than from before the pandemic. Most airlines do not plan to fly again until July at the earliest.
In the oil industry itself, the recovery is patchy, and many worry that it could quickly reverse if a second wave of infections hit after lockdowns are relaxed. Diesel, which fuels trucks and industries, is holding up better than gasoline, which is doing a lot better than jet-fuel. Even when demand strengthens, crude consumption may remain low because refiners will have first to get rid of the millions of gallons of oil products that have piled up over the past weeks.
As with many economic indicators, oil demand data comes with a significant lag. So traders rely on proxy estimates for a near real-time view. One is highway traffic. Another is the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s trucked out from pipeline terminals into fuel stations.
In the U.S., the amount of gasoline supplied to the market increased last week to nearly 5.9 million barrels a day, up from 5.1 million in the first week of April but well below the typically more than 9 million before the virus, according to the official data. Early last month, refiners saw gasoline demand at 55% of normal level, which improved to 64% in the latest seven-day average. Valero confirmed on Thursday that it’s seeing some pick-up.
“I do think we’re going to see more activity,” Valero’s Gorder said.
Spain, which had one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, offers a rare window into real-time demand as the nation’s biggest pipeline operator is disclosing weekly information. CLH Group said gasoline demand in the week to April 26 was down 75% from a year ago, a slight improvement from 81% in mid-April and 83% in late March.
In the U.K., demand for road fuels is currently down between 55% and 60% from levels before the crisis, compared with 65%-70% two weeks ago, according to the Petrol Retailers Association.
The data show that the recovery is only marginal. But it also indicates that consumption has, at the very least, bottomed out. Where demand goes, prices follow, and Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd, thinks the worst of oil’s slide is over.
Echoing a widely held view in the market, Tornqvist warns, however, that these subdued prices and demand may remain for a while. Prices aren’t likely to go much above $40 a barrel before the end of 2021, Tornqvist said. Only four months ago, at the start of this year, benchmark Brent crude was near $70. It was at about $26 a barrel on Monday.
“It’s going to take a long time to balance the market,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Venture capitalists reveal the startups that changed everything in the past decade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2010s were a wild ride for startups and the investors who pumped money into them.
As the decade kicked off, smartphones were becoming ubiquitous, connecting billions of people to the internet — many for the first time — and paving the way for a wave of innovative business models.
Online marketplaces and sharing economy platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and many more — demonstrated the power of network effects, and in doing so, completely changed how people and businesses interact with each other.
Companies seized on the stream of constant, real-time, location-based, and personalized data that consumers volunteered via a growing list of smart devices to provide them with faster and more convenient services.
Entrepreneurs had the wind at their backs, thanks to a flood of venture money and access to technical infrastructure —  Amazon Web Services — meaning they could spin up and scale up their startups like never before. Unicorns seemed to appear everywhere, and tech IPOs had investors excited.
But the tides began to turn in the second half of the decade as a flood of scandals chipped away at the idea that tech companies — and tech founders — are inherently good. Public investors became skeptical of the premium price attached to some tech companies, and the batch that went public in 2019 had a rough go of things.
Four months into 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has rocked the global economy and startup world, leading to at least 30,000 layoffs at venture-backed companies and even impacting unicorn tech darlings like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and Peloton as funding and sales have dried up. 
After speaking with five venture capitalists about how things have evolved since 2010, some clear lessons emerged — as well as some clear examples of those lessons. While it would be impossible to include every important startup, below are the companies that investors said have had the most impact on their industry in the past 10 years.
Uber's Travis Kalanick, Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes, and WeWork's Adam Neumann: All were considered charismatic and visionary founders who sought to change the world, but each was eventually forced out of their respective companies amid scandal.
When Holmes resigned in 2018 in the face of criminal charges and reports of fraud at Theranos, "everyone in venture really questioned their own diligence," Kristin Gunther, a principal at Revolution, told Business Insider. Gunther added that it made her reflect on how she engages as a board member.
"Against a background where, for a couple years here, hot deals moved really fast and people could get funded based on two PowerPoint slides, it became even more important to say, 'Hey, fine, this is a hot deal, but I'm going to miss it because it's not worth it to cut the corners,'" Gunther said. 
Kalanick was also forced out for cutting corners. In 2017, investors orchestrated his resignation at a time when Uber's public image had plummeted. Once a company that every investor wanted in on, critics had started alleging that Uber enabled workplace harassment, skirted local regulations, and that Kalanick's own behavior had put the company on a crash course.
Neumann, WeWork's eccentric founder, stepped down earlier this year after the company's failed attempt to go public led to reports of his extensive conflicts of interest, mismanagement, and bizarre behavior.
All three companies epitomized Silicon Valley's obsessive focus on growth and a celebration of ambitious founders, which often ignored problematic behavior and business practices.
"I just think we abandoned values in terms of, not just how we invested, but managed companies," Elliott Robinson, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told Business Insider.
The pervasiveness of social media and digital ads has given companies powerful new ways to connect with their target audience and helped enable the rise of direct-to-consumer brands.
Anu Duggal, founding partner at Female Founders Fund, told Business Insider that social media has "enabled brands to have a direct conversation with those consumers and have that impact their actual product design."
Duggal highlighted brands like Warby Parker and Glossier as companies that have effectively leveraged conversations with those consumers to inform product development.
Jenny Lefcourt, general partner at Freestyle and founding member of All Raise, said another reason these brands have been so successful is that they've created "authentic community" among their consumers.
"Maybe you go to Glossier because you love makeup and you start connecting with the community about that and before you know it, you start becoming friends and you're sharing travel tips," Lefcourt told Business Insider.
These companies didn't initially seem like sure bets, however. Gunther pointed to online retailer Jet.com and its acquisition by Walmart as an important proof of concept, and said it "showed the exit path for some of these direct-to-consumer companies where that was really a question."
It's no secret that venture capital firms — and, as a result, the entrepreneurs they fund — suffer from a lack of diversity. A recent survey by RateMyInvestor found that the typical founding team was a "two person, 'all male,' 'all white,' U.S. university-educated team residing in Silicon Valley."
Over the past decade, however, with several women-led ventures reaching multi-billion-dollar valuations and Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake becoming the youngest female founder to take a company public, investors are finally taking notice.
"Venture capitalists are pattern matchers," Lefcourt said. "Seeing these women take these companies from start to IPO and be incredibly successful enables other venture capitalists — whether they're men or women — to change their view on what successful looks like."
Venture capital firms still have a long way to go both in terms of who they invest in and who is doing the investing, especially when it comes to racial and educational diversity. But, at least when it comes to women-led ventures, Duggal said investors are "recognizing the fact that there are real returns to be made."
RateMyInvestor's survey also found that venture funds have a strong geographical bias, with nearly half of all investments in the past five years going to startups based in Silicon Valley. But in recent years, several companies have revealed the untapped potential of other markets, particularly outside of the US.
"There were always great companies and great innovation outside of the US," Victoria Treyger, general partner and managing director at Felicis Ventures, told Business Insider. But prior to Shopify, she said, "there was a belief that VC-backed companies outside of the US exited earlier."
Shopify, which is based in Ottawa, Canada, is notable for its outsize role in empowering small and medium businesses. Robinson, who invested in Shopify, said that by building ecommerce tools and "multiple revenue streams off of a really large user base, that just really changed the way people thought about [software as a service]."
Atlassian, an enterprise software company out of Sydney, similarly put Australia on the map. "I just see the number of [Atlassian] alums that are in that ecosystem," Treyger said, noting how employees of pioneering companies like Shopify and Atlassian often go on to start their own ventures.
Israel has also become a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity. It has produced household names like Waze (which was acquired by Google) and, in 2018, 61 companies exited at an average deal size of $81 million.
Within the US, cities like Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Portland, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., have also seen massive increases in both investment and startups.
Fintech was another sector this decade that saw major disruption and a flurry of new companies achieving massive valuations. Startups took advantage of the rise of smartphones, digital banking, and machine learning to bring more consumers into the financial system and upend how people spend, make, borrow, and exchange money.
"When you look underneath, there is true technological innovation," Treyger said. "It's really exciting to see that the dollars went into companies that have truly transformed the financial service sector."
As just a few examples, Stripe and Square helped change the way businesses get paid, Lending Club and SoFi took on incumbents in the personal loan space, and Robinhood reinvented how everyday consumers invest.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Venture capitalists reveal the startups that changed everything in the past decade</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 2010s were a wild ride for startups and the investors who pumped money into them.
As the decade kicked off, smartphones were becoming ubiquitous, connecting billions of people to the internet – many for the first time – and paving the way for a wave of innovative business models.
Online marketplaces and sharing economy platforms – Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and many more – demonstrated the power of network effects, and in doing so, completely changed how people and businesses interact with each other.
Companies seized on the stream of constant, real-time, location-based, and personalized data that consumers volunteered via a growing list of smart devices to provide them with faster and more convenient services.
Entrepreneurs had the wind at their backs, thanks to a flood of venture money and access to technical infrastructure – Amazon Web Services – meaning they could spin up and scale up their startups like never before. Unicorns seemed to appear everywhere, and tech IPOs had investors excited.
But the tides began to turn in the second half of the decade as a flood of scandals chipped away at the idea that tech companies – and tech founders – are inherently good. Public investors became skeptical of the premium price attached to some tech companies, and the batch that went public in 2019 had a rough go of things.
Four months into 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has rocked the global economy and startup world, leading to at least 30,000 layoffs at venture-backed companies and even impacting unicorn tech darlings like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and Peloton as funding and sales have dried up.
After speaking with five venture capitalists about how things have evolved since 2010, some clear lessons emerged – as well as some clear examples of those lessons. While it would be impossible to include every important startup, below are the companies that investors said have had the most impact on their industry in the past 10 years.
Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Theranos’ Elizabeth Holmes, and WeWork’s Adam Neumann: All were considered charismatic and visionary founders who sought to change the world, but each was eventually forced out of their respective companies amid scandal.
When Holmes resigned in 2018 in the face of criminal charges and reports of fraud at Theranos, “everyone in venture really questioned their own diligence,” Kristin Gunther, a principal at Revolution, told Business Insider. Gunther added that it made her reflect on how she engages as a board member.
“Against a background where, for a couple years here, hot deals moved really fast and people could get funded based on two PowerPoint slides, it became even more important to say, ‘Hey, fine, this is a hot deal, but I’m going to miss it because it’s not worth it to cut the corners,'” Gunther said.
Kalanick was also forced out for cutting corners. In 2017, investors orchestrated his resignation at a time when Uber’s public image had plummeted. Once a company that every investor wanted in on, critics had started alleging that Uber enabled workplace harassment, skirted local regulations, and that Kalanick’s own behavior had put the company on a crash course.
Neumann, WeWork’s eccentric founder, stepped down earlier this year after the company’s failed attempt to go public led to reports of his extensive conflicts of interest, mismanagement, and bizarre behavior.
All three companies epitomized Silicon Valley’s obsessive focus on growth and a celebration of ambitious founders, which often ignored problematic behavior and business practices.
“I just think we abandoned values in terms of, not just how we invested, but managed companies,” Elliott Robinson, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, told Business Insider.
The pervasiveness of social media and digital ads has given companies powerful new ways to connect with their target audience and helped enable the rise of direct-to-consumer brands.
Anu Duggal, founding partner at Female Founders Fund, told Business Insider that social media has “enabled brands to have a direct conversation with those consumers and have that impact their actual product design.”
Duggal highlighted brands like Warby Parker and Glossier as companies that have effectively leveraged conversations with those consumers to inform product development.
Jenny Lefcourt, general partner at Freestyle and founding member of All Raise, said another reason these brands have been so successful is that they’ve created “authentic community” among their consumers.
“Maybe you go to Glossier because you love makeup and you start connecting with the community about that and before you know it, you start becoming friends and you’re sharing travel tips,” Lefcourt told Business Insider.
These companies didn’t initially seem like sure bets, however. Gunther pointed to online retailer Jet.com and its acquisition by Walmart as an important proof of concept, and said it “showed the exit path for some of these direct-to-consumer companies where that was really a question.”
It’s no secret that venture capital firms – and, as a result, the entrepreneurs they fund – suffer from a lack of diversity. A recent survey by RateMyInvestor found that the typical founding team was a “two person, ‘all male,’ ‘all white,’ U.S. university-educated team residing in Silicon Valley.”
Over the past decade, however, with several women-led ventures reaching multi-billion-dollar valuations and Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake becoming the youngest female founder to take a company public, investors are finally taking notice.
“Venture capitalists are pattern matchers,” Lefcourt said. “Seeing these women take these companies from start to IPO and be incredibly successful enables other venture capitalists – whether they’re men or women – to change their view on what successful looks like.”
Venture capital firms still have a long way to go both in terms of who they invest in and who is doing the investing, especially when it comes to racial and educational diversity. But, at least when it comes to women-led ventures, Duggal said investors are “recognizing the fact that there are real returns to be made.”
RateMyInvestor’s survey also found that venture funds have a strong geographical bias, with nearly half of all investments in the past five years going to startups based in Silicon Valley. But in recent years, several companies have revealed the untapped potential of other markets, particularly outside of the US.
“There were always great companies and great innovation outside of the US,” Victoria Treyger, general partner and managing director at Felicis Ventures, told Business Insider. But prior to Shopify, she said, “there was a belief that VC-backed companies outside of the US exited earlier.”
Shopify, which is based in Ottawa, Canada, is notable for its outsize role in empowering small and medium businesses. Robinson, who invested in Shopify, said that by building ecommerce tools and “multiple revenue streams off of a really large user base, that just really changed the way people thought about [software as a service].”
Atlassian, an enterprise software company out of Sydney, similarly put Australia on the map. “I just see the number of [Atlassian] alums that are in that ecosystem,” Treyger said, noting how employees of pioneering companies like Shopify and Atlassian often go on to start their own ventures.
Israel has also become a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity. It has produced household names like Waze (which was acquired by Google) and, in 2018, 61 companies exited at an average deal size of $81 million.
Within the US, cities like Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Portland, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., have also seen massive increases in both investment and startups.
Fintech was another sector this decade that saw major disruption and a flurry of new companies achieving massive valuations. Startups took advantage of the rise of smartphones, digital banking, and machine learning to bring more consumers into the financial system and upend how people spend, make, borrow, and exchange money.
“When you look underneath, there is true technological innovation,” Treyger said. “It’s really exciting to see that the dollars went into companies that have truly transformed the financial service sector.”
As just a few examples, Stripe and Square helped change the way businesses get paid, Lending Club and SoFi took on incumbents in the personal loan space, and Robinhood reinvented how everyday consumers invest.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting: Five questions Warren Buffett should answer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Tara LachapelleWarren Buffett will address his followers on Saturday for the first time since the U.S. began implementing the state-by-state lockdowns that have upended the economy and life as we knew it. Technically, it’s the annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholder meeting, though much will be missing from this year’s event — people, for starters. Even so, the main draw of the weekend lives on: the chance to pick one of the most brilliant brains in business.
In a live-streamed interview that evening, Buffett will answer questions submitted by investors, including presumably how the conglomerate’s various lines of business have been affected by the pandemic. But what listeners are really tuning in for are the Oracle of Omaha’s broader views on the world during a time like this. Here are five questions for him:
1. Is it time to name a successor?Or has he essentially done so? For the first time, Buffett is doing the Q&A jointly with Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman, rather than his usual sidekick, Charlie Munger, who is 96 years old and resides in California. Buffett, who will turn 90 in August, even joked in his February letter to shareholders that he and Munger are in “the urgent zone.” All signs point to Abel being the next CEO of Berkshire, but Buffett hasn’t spelled out the succession plan yet. It was going to be hard enough for shareholders to get comfortable with anyone other than him someday being the steward of their money. With all the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, now is a good time for Buffett to clarify why Abel is best suited to manage the conglomerate, even through a crisis like this.
2. Could the concept of a “new normal” alter what kinds of investments Berkshire makes in the future?If Buffett isn’t using his enforced isolation at home to hunt for another elephant-sized acquisition, is that because the Covid-19 shutdowns are causing him to reevaluate what types of businesses will recover? Or is he perhaps grappling with the potential for long-term changes in customer behavior? Taking a stake in the Kroger Co. supermarket chain late last year proved to be prescient; buying preferred stock in oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp. not so much. Those circumstances would still seem to be temporary. Air travel, on the other hand, is an example of an industry where a return to normal could take awhile — or never even come.
3. Will the airline industry ever rebound? Buffett has a tormented history with airlines. After getting burned once by a US Airways investment, Buffett swore off the industry in 2001, saying: “Now if I get the urge to invest in airlines, I call an 800 number and I say: Hello, my name is Warren, and I'm an air-o-holic.” Well, Buffett apparently lost that number and went all in on airline stocks in 2016. Berkshire is now the largest shareholder of Delta Air Lines Inc., the second-largest owner of United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co., and has the third-biggest stake in American Airlines Group Inc. They’ve all plunged this year as the pandemic wreaked havoc on air travel — or any travel at all.
On March 10, during a Yahoo Finance interview, Buffett said he “won’t be selling airline stocks.” That was before the shutdowns. A few weeks later, Berkshire reduced its Delta and Southwest positions, although it’s still the No. 1 and No. 2 investor in each. An update on his thinking would be especially illuminating now.
4. Covid-19 has forced the nation to reassess and recognize what it means to be an “essential” worker. Does that warrant new ideas for solving wealth inequality?Buffett himself employs a lot of essential workers: They’re manning freight trains that are still pushing goods around the country, as well as manufacturing Duracell batteries. Lubrizol — which makes chemicals used for everything from coating car interiors to yoga pants — has helped to produce hand sanitizer, while Fruit of the Loom switched to making protective face masks. Berkshire is also the largest shareholder of food giant Kraft Heinz Co., one company helping to keep supermarkets stocked.
In that same March interview, Buffett discussed the wealth gap, saying it’s a reflection of the fact that workers are rewarded based on the skills that are valued by the market:
You get this pushing of extreme rewards to people who are very, very good at something the market demands. And people demand entertainment. They demand people apparently that arbitrage securities. There's certain specialties.
But they demand lots of basic things, too, as this pandemic has shown.
Even though Buffett agrees with letting the system function the way it does, “we don’t want people left behind,” he said. The billionaire has often advocated for an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit as a better way of putting more money in the pockets of low-income families than through hiking the minimum wage. That’s because the latter could backfire by increasing unemployment. The EITC just doesn’t have the same ring to it as $15, and it’s not as easily understood as earning more per hour. Buffett has also called for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy, like himself.
5. Do America’s best days still lie ahead?Buffett has seen his share of crises, and they’ve never seemed to shake his optimism that the U.S. will continue to prosper in the long run. “America’s best days lie ahead,” is a mantra he often repeats in his annual letters to shareholders. But Buffett has been unusually quiet during the pandemic — in terms of a lack of both TV appearances (perhaps due to virus fears) and deal activity. Investors could use a reminder of how the country’s biggest cheerleader and hungriest dealmaker feels about its long-term prospects. Is it possible they are changing?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Speaks (Finally)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett has been silent during the pandemic.
Could this mean he’s uncharacteristically pessimistic about America’s chances this time—unlike his proclamation to “Buy American. I Am” during the Great Recession of 2008? Or could he be putting over $137 billion of cash to work behind the scenes—with no desire to tip his hand?
At today’s Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) meeting, livestreamed from an arena with over 17,000 empty seats, the Oracle of Omaha finally spoke.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway booked a nearly $50 billion loss in the first quarter, the company’s largest loss ever, and one that reflects the profound effect of COVID and lockdowns on the stock portfolio, but one that also reflects the recent accounting rule changes that require unrealized equity losses to flow through to earnings. And this obscures the fact that operating earnings, the profits from the wholly-owned businesses—everything from Dairy Queen to Duracell—rose 6% in the quarter to a healthy $5.9 billion. No doubt, Buffett has to keep significant amounts of cash on hand to ensure his businesses have enough liquidity. The unprecedented nature of lockdowns when owning so many consumer-oriented companies necessitates a cautious approach.
Buffett deployed a relatively small amount of cash to stocks during the quarter, spending just $1.8 billion. Some people are taking this as a sign that he didn’t see enormous value during the S&P 500’s 36% plunge in March—and may have missed the 30% rise that followed. But when you own as many operating businesses as Buffett, many of which are frozen like the rest of the economy, you certainly need to keep ample cash on hand to support them. After all, while Buffett is known for his equity investing, he’s also known for his prudence: he eschews leverage and maintains a fortress-like balance sheet.
But with $137 billion still on the sidelines, what Buffett actually says is most important.
He began by saying Charlie Munger is in fine shape and has mastered Zoom. He also thanked Dr. Fauci.
As to the pandemic situation and its effects, Buffett said, “it’s been a flip of the switch in a huge way.” But he pointed out that the range of possibilities with regard to health has contracted, with the virus neither resulting in the worst-case or best scenarios, given that the coronavirus is more widespread but less lethal than originally thought.
As to economic outcomes, Buffett said the range is unfortunately still enormous but that this is not the greatest challenge America has faced and that “the American magic has always prevailed and always will.”
Buffett stated that regardless of the current crisis, equities will certainly outperform Treasury bills over the long term and will easily “outperform that money under your mattress.”
He punctuated his speech with one particularly compelling slide: “Never bet against America.”
And with that Warren Buffett has spoken (finally).
Disclosure: I own Berkshire Hathaway stock in both my own and client accounts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">3 Insights From Warren Buffett At Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 Annual Meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Note: If you want to dive in deeper and discuss insights from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway 2020 Annual Meeting, please reserve one of the few remaining spots at the free live webinar on Monday.
Warren Buffett is idolized by many as the world’s greatest investor of all time. This is well-deserved based on the amazing amount of wealth that he has created for himself and others over decades. Unfortunately, if you were expecting that Buffett’s wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual meeting was going to yield easy answers about the current investment landscape, you are likely to be disappointed.
There were 3 clear themes that struck me as I listened to the livestream of the meeting on Saturday. They left me with an impression of a man who is cautious and appropriately uncertain about the future developments of the world from here. It was also quite clear that Buffett did not think there were any opportunities of size attractive enough to invest in, either now or earlier this year. This is in stark contrast with the carefree stock-market rebound that has been occurring since the March lows, and should leave you quite a bit worried if you bought in to the narrative that there will be a quick economic and stock market rebound that is sustainable longer-term.
1.      Warren Buffett Does Not Know, And Neither Do You!
Warren Buffett: “The range of possibilities has narrowed now vs. when this started. It is not as bad as it could have been nor is it as good as it could have been.”
Warren Buffett: “The range of possibilities is still extremely wide on the economic side. I don't really know of any parallels of the most productive country in the world sidelining its economy and workforce.”
If you think that you know how this is going to play out, you are kidding yourself. You should always be thinking in ranges, and this time is no different. One thing that is clear is that there are still many surprises that can occur.
The question isn’t even so much about the virus itself. The stock market is reacting, incorrectly, to the evidence that we have gotten that the health impact of this disease is not as bad as initially feared. That is likely to be true. What nobody knows is the second and third order consequences of our approach to the cure.
Will people spend freely once the restrictions on life are relaxed? Will businesses hire workers back? Will there be social unrest as the losers in our society impoverished by the way things have played out through no fault of their own protest this outcome? Will the government’s unprecedented printing of money cause huge unintended consequences? Nobody knows, but the range of possibilities is wider than most of us can imagine.
2.      The Investment Opportunities In Large Securities Were Unattractive At March Lows, Which Means They Are Even Less Attractive Today.
Warren Buffett: “We have not bought anything because there was not anything attractive to do.”
Warren Buffett: “We did not see anything attractive. A lot of companies got the chance to refinance because of the actions of the Federal Reserve.”
Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of equities this year, through the end of April. That should surprise you. It is certainly a very different take than the market’s which has rallied sharply off the March lows.
Many stock market participants are now wistfully talking about the March lows as some kind of once in a generation investment opportunity. It was not, at least not on a wide scale in securities of large companies. At least not according to the man who has been most successful at investing across generations.
That is not to say that there were not or are not good opportunities. There were and there are. However, these are not ones that Buffett can deploy billions of dollars in. Rather, they are only available to those who have much smaller pools of capital to deploy, and even in those circumstances the current opportunity set is far from amazing.
Buffett has shined the light on the carefree complacency of many stock market participants who have not yet fully grasped the severity of our current situation. Those who think that what has happened is only a small bump in the investment road might be in for a rude shock to that perception and the value of their investment portfolios.
Think about it, given the magnitude of the economic shock that we are experiencing, does it make sense that the U.S. stock market is down only 12% year to date? After having started at a very expensive level following a long bull market? I am no market expert – I am a value investor whose expertise is investing in individual securities, not market analysis. However, this picture makes little sense to me and smacks more of wishful thinking than of a sober assessment of all the possibilities.
3.      Berkshire Hathaway’s Intrinsic Value Has Decreased
Warren Buffett: “I don't think that Berkshire shares are a much more compelling value now than they were 3 months or 6 months ago.”
Warren Buffett: “The amount of litigation that is going to be generated out of what has already happened, much less what is still to happen, is going to be huge.”
That Warren Buffett thinks that Berkshire’s value has declined by a roughly similar amount as its stock price (which has declined roughly 19% year to date) is surprising. After all, part of the premise of the company’s construction is its rock-solid balance sheet, its ability to invest for the long-term in times of distress, and its managerial prowess which should allow many of its subsidiaries to increase their competitive advantage while their competitors are retrenching. Buffett talked about almost none of that, at least not in as far as suggesting that there hasn’t been a major hit to Berkshire Hathaway’s value.
The question that you should be thinking about is that if one of the strongest companies in the world has seen such a large value impairment, what does that imply for many other companies that are less resilient?
If there is one punchline from all of this for investors groping for a sense of what the future may hold, it is this: Be careful. The worst is unlikely to be behind us and caution will serve you well in preserving and growing your wealth.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Warren Buffett Said at Berkshire Hathaway's 2020 Shareholder Meeting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffett is the most closely followed investor in the world, and every year, shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) look forward to hearing what the Oracle of Omaha has to say. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the tens of thousands of people who would ordinarily descend on Nebraska's largest city to see Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting have instead had to settle for a live-streamed remote event.
Despite not being able to invite shareholders to join him in person, Buffett nevertheless wanted to be sure to keep the lines of communication with investors open. Berkshire's chairman and CEO had plenty to say, answering questions compiled by well-known financial journalists and addressing some of the most important issues that Buffett's followers have had on their minds lately. Here are some of the most interesting things Buffett had to say at the May 2 shareholder meeting.
Buffett has always believed in America, and nothing about the coronavirus pandemic has changed his views on that. He gave an extended history lesson about the nation, pointing to the challenges it's faced in the past and the way in which it has overcome them.
Buffett has no illusions that he can predict where stocks will be tomorrow, next week, next month, or even next year. But he thinks America in 2020 is in better shape than it's been at any other time in its history, and he believes that investors who put money in stocks for the long run now will be amply rewarded.
Buffett has famously said that he suggests that a perfectly good way for investors to participate in the gradual rise of the stock market over time is to invest in an S&P 500 index fund. With low expenses, index funds can give investors exposure to a wide swath of the businesses that have been responsible for America's economic success over the decades.
Indeed, investing in an index fund isn't just a bet on the success of America. With so many multinational companies in the S&P 500, index funds give you ownership in the companies that are finding success around the globe.
On a related topic, one reason Buffett advises index funds is that they're inexpensive. Too many people pay large amounts of money for financial advice, and Buffett is critical of the performance that most financial advisors are able to achieve. Buffett believes that most salespeople in the financial industry aren't able to deliver superior results, despite the fact that those salespeople generally "believe their own baloney," in his words.
Another reason Buffett likes stocks right now is that the alternatives aren't very good. U.S. Treasury bonds with 30-year maturities yield just 1.25%. Berkshire itself has taken advantage of low interest rates by borrowing money at zero interest rates.
Buffett thinks America's economic tailwinds will persist. But when all it takes to beat 30-year Treasuries is to match the rate of inflation, it's even more of a no-brainer in the Berkshire chief's views to invest in stocks instead.
There's been a lot of speculation about the moves that Berkshire Hathaway has recently made with its airline stock holdings. In early April, Berkshire sold substantial amounts of its holdings in Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), with disclosures necessary because of Berkshire's having held more than 10% of the two airlines' outstanding shares. At the time, it seemed as though Buffett might simply be reducing its positions below 10% to avoid future complications.
However, Buffett reported selling a total of $6.5 billion in stock during April, far more than the Delta and Southwest sales that had been reported and also including shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) as well. Questioned later, the Berkshire CEO said that the company sold off its entire positions in the four airlines. As he explained it, he "just decided I made a mistake." He had initially figured that investing $7 billion to $8 billion to buy 10% stakes in the four biggest U.S. airlines would give him about $1 billion in underlying earnings, which seemed like a reasonable value. However, Buffett said, "It turned out I was wrong about the business."
Buffett didn't blame airline CEOs, who managed their companies well and did a lot of things right. However, the Berkshire leader no longer feels comfortable that airlines will ever recover to their pre-coronavirus levels, and even two to three years from now, it's possible that not nearly as many people will be flying. Unfortunately, even if airlines recover 70% to 80% of their pre-crisis passenger loads, they'll still have far too many planes. With airlines selling stock to raise capital, upside is limited. Buffett concluded, "The world changed for airlines, and we wish them well."
Buffett has an optimistic attitude that investors around the globe find compelling. Even with all the uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic, the Oracle of Omaha's general demeanor was positive.
For those who have been near panic as a result of the bear market in February and March, listening to Buffett can restore confidence in the stock market as a creator of long-term wealth. No matter what happens to the stock market in the months to come -- or to Berkshire's share price on Monday -- Buffett's words will provide reassurance and remind us how we've always managed to overcome difficult challenges in the past -- and will again this time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pretty Little thing founder furloughs staff despite lavish lifestyle and £1bn fortune</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The founder of fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing has placed his staff into furlough - despite being worth £1bn.
Tycoon Umar Kamani, 32, has put 86 members of staff at his Manchester-based company into furlough, while he enjoys a lavish lifestyle in Dubai.
Umar is one of many businesses who have decided to use the government's scheme which uses taxpayers money to pay 80 per cent of their wages.
But Mr Kamani doesn't appear to be phased by the lockdown or the decision to furlough his staff when he posted a photo on Instagram of his Dubai home, along with his girlfriend Nada Adelle, 26, on April 18, with the caption 'isolationship'.
Pretty Little Thing reported a turnover of £374m in 2018, six years after Umar launched the company.
His father Mahmud founded internet fashion company Boohoo, which led Umar to launching his own company in 2012.
Umar lives a luxurious lifestyle - he owns two Rolls-Royce cars, a Lamborghini worth £300,000 and other expensive cars.
He is friends with some of the world's most famous celebrities, such as Denzel Washington, Jennifer Lopez and Kylie Jenner, and others.
Umar also made £5m from an investment company that is developing a news coronavirus antigen test, according to reports.
He spent £1m in shares in Avacta Group. which is working with US-based Adeptrix to develop a Covid-19 test.
Mr Kamani paid 18p a share for stock in the company but shares continue to spike as the company continues to work on a test.
Commenting on the decision to place its staff into furlough, a Pretty Little Thing spokesperson told the Mail Online : "We are entering an unprecedented period and while it is too early to quantify the future impact of Covid-19, we are taking measures to position the business to protect jobs going forward and keep the business on a strong financial footing in what we expect to be a temporary environment.
"It is important to note that Pretty Little Thing staff are still being paid their full salary as a result of the Government furlough initiative and the company's decision to 'top up' salaries so they receive 100 per cent of what they would usually be entitled to each month."
The spokesman added that some staff would be returning to work on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pretty Little Thing founder Umar Kamani worth £1billion took taxpayers' cash to furlough 86 staff... as the playboy tycoon lounges in a pool with his beautiful girlfriend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lounging in a pool with his beautiful girlfriend, fashion tycoon Umar Kamani seems not to have a care in the world. But while the Pretty Little Thing founder enjoys a spa in Dubai, ordinary taxpayers are covering the cost of his employees' wages. 
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the 32- year-old, whose personal wealth is estimated at £1billion, has furloughed 86 members of staff at his Manchester-based company.
He took the decision shortly after the lockdown in order to use the Government's scheme, which uses taxpayers' money to pay workers 80 per cent of their usual income up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. 
Pretty Little Thing had a turnover of £374million in 2018, yet saddling the taxpayer with the cost of paying his workers didn't appear to trouble Mr Kamani when he posted a photograph at his Dubai home with girlfriend Nada Adelle, 26, on Instagram on April 18, with the caption: 'Isolationship.' 
On the same day, one of his employees wrote on Twitter about how missing work had left her feeling 'depressed' and 'bipolar'. Mr Kamani, whose father Mahmud founded the internet fashion firm Boohoo, launched his own company in 2012. 
His wealth has allowed him to buy a fleet of cars, including two Rolls-Royce Phantoms, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador, a £92,000 customised G-Class Mercedes and a high-end Range Rover.
He leads a playboy lifestyle, regularly travelling by private jet to socialise with the likes of P Diddy, Jennifer Lopez and Denzel Washington.
Other pictures on his Instagram account show him with US reality star Kylie Jenner, dining at the plush Nobu restaurant in Malibu and posing at the wheel of a yacht on Italy's Amalfi Coast.
As well as deferring the cost of his staff to the taxpayer, Mr Kamani has made £5million from an investment in a company that is developing a new Covid-19 antigen test. 
Last month, he spent £1million on shares in Avacta Group. Mr Kamani paid 18p a share for stock in the company but the price has risen sharply throughout April on hopes the firm will successfully develop the antigen test. 
Shares closed on Friday at 109p each, giving the company a market capitalisation of £226.7million. That means Mr Kamani's investment is now worth almost £5 million. 
Last night, a spokesman for Umar Kamani, who lives in Alderley Edge, the Cheshire village popular with Premier League footballers, said: 'We are entering an unprecedented period and while it is too early to quantify the future impact of Covid-19, we are taking measures to position the business to protect jobs going forward and keep the business on a strong financial footing in what we expect to be a temporary environment. 
'It is important to note that Pretty Little Thing staff are still being paid their full salary as a result of the Government furlough initiative and the company's decision to 'top up' salaries so they receive 100 per cent of what they would usually be entitled to each month.' 
The spokesman also said a number of Pretty Little Thing employees would be returning to work tomorrow. 
James Corden is taking a £45,000-a-week salary cut to cover the wages of 60 furloughed staff who work on his US chat show. 
The 41-year-old presenter of The Late Late Show took the decision after the CBS TV network said it would only cover the salaries of production workers until tomorrow. 
The show was shut down on March 15 due to coronavirus but relaunched with a skeleton crew from the garage of Corden's £8million Los Angeles home on April 14. 
Pledging to continue broadcasting, the comedian said: 'Socially, we can be as connected as ever. Physically, we can't be together, but socially and mentally we can be together. The world has never been more equipped for us to stay connected to each other.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thyssenkrupp sees coronavirus cash squeeze despite elevator sale: letter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) expects the coronavirus crisis to cause a new financial squeeze, scuppering hopes that selling its elevator business would deliver a swift cash respite for the embattled firm, its management board told staff in a letter.
The elevator division was sold in February to ease financial pressure on the conglomerate which has struggled for years after ill-fated investments. But the coronavirus crisis has dealt a blow before cash from that sale arrives in June.
Sources said last week that Thyssenkrupp had secured about 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) in state aid to tide it over until sale proceeds arrive.
“In the medium term, the cash outflows caused by the corona (crisis) will in all likelihood result in the financial leeway created by the sale of the elevator business becoming much lower than what was originally anticipated,” the board wrote to staff.
“We are preparing solutions for this,” according to the April 30 letter signed by Chief Executive Martina Merz that was seen by Reuters and first reported by German daily Handelsblatt.
Thyssenkrupp agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and Germany’s RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros in February, with proceeds expected to be received in June.
A source said the loan from state development bank KfW would assist the conglomerate, which has suffered from slow demand for auto parts after carmakers shut down production because of the pandemic. The loan expires at the end of September
Car makers and suppliers have scrambled to shore up their liquidity as sales in Europe tumbled by more than 50% in March.
Thyssenkrupp has been pummelled in recent years by a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure. Its shares hit historic lows around 3.20 euros in mid-March.
As well as selling its elevator business, Thyssenkrupp’s restructuring involves seeking buyers for its Plant Technology division, which builds cement, chemicals and fertiliser plants.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel in talks to buy Israel's Moovit public transit app for $1 billion: media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp is in advanced talks to acquire Israeli public transit app developer Moovit for $1 billion, financial news website Calcalist reported on Sunday.
Moovit has raised $133 million from investors including Intel, BMW iVentures and Sequoia Capital.
Officials at Intel Israel and Moovit declined to comment on the report.
Calcalist reported that people with knowledge of the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the deal is very close to being signed.
Moovit’s free mobile navigation app provides transit information to more than 750 million users in 100 countries.
Last month it launched an emergency mobilization service, which was created for transit agencies and enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The technology transforms vehicle fleets into an on-demand service to get essential employees safely to work and has been implemented in a number of cities by large corporations.
Intel has made significant investments already in Israel, having acquired autonomous vehicle technology provider Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017. In December it bought Israeli artificial intelligence firm Habana Labs for $2 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla to extend furlough for some employees by another week: internal email</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) told furloughed employees on Friday that they will remain out of work for at least another week, postponing a plan to resume normal operations on May 4 at its San Francisco vehicle-assembly plant, according to an internal email.
“For furloughed employees, unless you are contacted by your manager about a start date, you will remain on furlough until further notice, at least for another week,” the company’s in-house counsel Valerie Capers Workman said in the email, which was sent to employees and seen by Reuters.
Tesla suspended production at its Fremont, California plant on March 24.
The extension comes days after health officials from San Francisco County, along with five other Bay Area counties, said they would revise “shelter-in-place” orders that are set to expire on Sunday.
The new orders will keep the restrictions in place and extend them through May, with limited easing for a small number of low-risk activities.
The company was not immediately available to a Reuter’s request for comment.
The electric carmaker last month furloughed all non-essential workers and implemented salary cuts during a shutdown of its U.S. production facilities because of the coronavirus outbreak.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale expects to have to provision 3.5 billion euros to 5 billion euros ($3.84 bln-5.49 bln) this year because of losses due to the coronavirus crisis, its chief executive said in an interview on Saturday.
Frederic Oudea also said he expected the bank’s equity ratio to drop to between 11% and 11.5% percent, which would remain 200 to 250 basis points above minimum legal requirements, he said.
Shares in France’s third biggest listed bank fell sharply on Thursday after it surprised investors with a quarterly loss, hiking provisions for bad loans and suffering a revenue wipeout at its equity trading division.
“It is by far the most serious crisis we have had to face,” Oudea told Les Echos. But Oudea added that, unlike during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, banks had enough provisions to cope.
“During the previous crisis, banks were the problem. Today, they have a driving role to play and are taking part in the solution,” he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors’ sales in China saw double-digit year-on-year growth in April, its two local ventures said on Sunday, as the world’s biggest auto market recovers from the coronavirus.
GM’s (GM.N) joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (600104.SS), which manufactures Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles, said its sales in China grew 13.6% compared to a year earlier. It said it had sold 111,155 units in April, including exported cars.
Meanwhile, SGMW, a separate GM venture with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group which produces no-frills minivans and has started to make higher-end cars, said its sales jumped 13.5% to over 127,000 units last month.
U.S. automaker GM, which is China’s second biggest foreign car company after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), said its sales in China fell 43.3% in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year.
To attract customers, GM and SAIC have hired social media celebrities to promote its new models and are offering free medical masks to customers.
China’s biggest automaker SAIC, which sold more than 6 million cars last year, said its sales rose 0.5% compared to the same period last year. As well as the GM venture, it also builds its own brand cars and operates a venture with Volkswagen.

GM's (N:GM) joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104), which manufactures Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles, said its sales in China grew 13.6% compared to a year earlier. It said it had sold 111,155 units in April, including exported cars.
Meanwhile, SGMW, a separate GM venture with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group which produces no-frills minivans and has started to make higher-end cars, said its sales jumped 13.5% to over 127,000 units last month.
U.S. automaker GM, which is China's second biggest foreign car company after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said its sales in China fell 43.3% in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year.
To attract customers, GM and SAIC have hired social media celebrities to promote its new models and are offering free medical masks to customers.
China's biggest automaker SAIC, which sold more than 6 million cars last year, said its sales rose 0.5% compared to the same period last year. As well as the GM venture, it also builds its own brand cars and operates a venture with Volkswagen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett remains optimistic about future despite coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Investor Warren Buffett doesn't know how the economy will recover from the coronavirus outbreak shutdown, but he remains optimistic in the long-term future of the United States.Buffett said Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's online annual meeting that there's no way to predict the economic future right now because the possibilities are still too varied.In the six weeks since the pandemic shut down much of the U.S. economy, more than 30 million American workers have filed for unemployment insurance. All types of businesses are cutting workers, with the hospitality, restaurant, retail and travel industries being some of the hardest hit.Buffett has even sold his holdings in U.S. airlines."Unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events beyond their control," he said.Yet long term, Buffett expects the economy to rebound."World War II, I was convinced of it. During the Cuban missile crisis, 9/11, the financial crisis -- nothing can basically stop America," he said.Berkshire's meeting was being held without any of the roughly 40,000 shareholders who typically attend. Instead of answering questions in a packed arena filled with shareholders, Buffett spoke in front of a camera for the online meeting. The normal shareholder celebration Berkshire holds each spring was canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak.ABC News contributed to this report.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Warren Buffett Says Berkshire Sold Its Entire Position in US Airlines Due to Virus Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Warren Buffet confirmed during the 2020 Annual Shareholders Meeting on Saturday that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc had sold its entire position in the US airlines due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Buffet explained that certain businesses, like the airline industry, have been really affected by the COVID-19 induced lockdown and are "far beyond our control".
He also said that the conglomerate has not made any investments during the pandemic, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, because they haven't "seen anything that attractive".
The billionaire said that the virus is a "huge unknown", so it is unpredictable how the American public will react in case there is a second wave of the epidemic several months from now.
Buffett's comments follow the report by his company, which also owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, insurer Geico and chocolate maker See's Candies, of losing $50 billion in net worth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, Berkshire's operating profits were 6 percent higher than in 2019, reaching $5.87 billion.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Business was booming for people who owned cars, trolleys and wheelbarrows in Olievenhoutbosch, Centurion, on Saturday.
As thousands of residents queued for food parcels, they used this opportunity to charge people to transport their food parcels home.
The Mahlasedi Foundation has been handing out food parcels to residents over the past few days outside Walter Sisulu Primary School.
Vehicle owners charged between R20 and R30 per person, depending on the distance they were travelling, while wheelbarrow and trolley pushers charged between R10 and R15 per load.
Honest Ndebele, who owns a wheelbarrow, grabbed the opportunity after receiving his food.
"Yesterday after receiving my food, I noticed that people were struggling to carry their food and I then started charging them. Many have now joined us. We are pushing their loads to taxis as they are not allowed near the school.
"This is a good opportunity to make something during this period. Our challenge is people who don't want to pay us after boarding a taxi," said Ndebele.
Kabelo Motloung said he and his friends were taking a walk when they saw people waiting outside the school.
"I asked them if they needed someone to push their food and they agreed. We quickly ran home and returned pushing our wheelbarrows and trolleys. We have been working since this morning and so far have made some money.
"I would rather push a wheelbarrow the whole day than rob people. This is an honest way of making money legit," he added.
Pule Netshilaphala said he was waiting for someone who was queuing for food when he was approached by people asking for a lift.
"I asked others who were already transporting people how much they were charging and they told me that we must charge people the same amount. I have taken about five loads. I think by the end of the day, I would have taken more loads," added Netshiphala.
Thabo Sikhosana said he had transported two loads with his private vehicle.
"I am helping people who are desperate for transport. People here need transport and I am not going to miss this opportunity to make cash to feed my family. I would rather be here than to sit at home without money," Sikhosana added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Exxon, Chevron slam brakes on shale as oil demand tumbles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.
HOUSTON: Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.
Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world's top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70per cent this year to under US$20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever.
Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts.
"We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover," Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.
The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output.
Exxon's biggest cuts will come in the Permian, "where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted," said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.
He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is "beneficial in long term" to ensure "we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive." Exxon will sideline 75per cent of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.
The company posted a US$610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly US$3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a US$3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.
(For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ygdpzydkyvw/index.html)
Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30per cent this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to US$14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at US$23 billion, the lowest in four years.
Even though their results topped Wall Street's reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7per cent to US$43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8per cent to US$89.44.
Chevron’s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it "a defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas," said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Exxon’s balance sheet "is strong enough to withstand the current environment," but it needs oil prices around US$75 per barrel this year to break even versus around US$50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.
U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around US$19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around US$26 per barrel.
Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.
Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc's first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.

Exxon’s biggest cuts will come in the Permian, “where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted,” said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.
He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is “beneficial in long term” to ensure “we’re bringing those high production rates into a market that’s more conducive.” Exxon will sideline 75% of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.
The company posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just 29 of Japan’s 47 municipalities hosting prefectural government offices are planning to start emergency cash handouts within May, a Kyodo News tally has shown in a sign that the coronavirus pandemic has complicated administrative efforts to swiftly implement relief measures.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been aiming for the distribution of ¥100,000 ($936) per resident this month. But many municipalities are also busy implementing steps to contain the virus under the nationwide state of emergency, which is almost certain to be extended for another month through early June, the tally showed Friday.
The Diet enacted Thursday a ¥25.69 trillion budget for fiscal 2020 to finance an emergency policy package, including the cash handouts.
The municipal government of Wakayama is aiming to provide the money this month, saying officials there are working to that end without taking days off.
Kobe is also one of the 29, saying it is planning to first send application forms to households with children to ensure that families in need will receive necessary documents quickly.
The 29 municipalities include Aomori, Morioka, Sendai, Akita, Yamagata, Fukushima, Mito, Utsunomiya, Maebashi, Chiba, Kanazawa, Kofu, Nagano, Gifu, Tsu, Kobe, Nara, Wakayama, Matsue, Okayama, Yamaguchi, Takamatsu, Matsuyama, Kochi, Fukuoka, Shiga, Nagasaki, Kumamoto and Miyazaki.
Among other municipalities, eight including Shizuoka, Osaka and Hiroshima said they are aiming to start distributing the handouts in June or later, while 10, including Sapporo, Nagoya, Yokohama and Tokyo’s Shinjuku Ward, said they were unable to clearly state when they would start.
Many of the municipalities grappling with the coronavirus said it will take time to create and send necessary documentation to households.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO — Just 29 of Japan's 47 municipalities hosting prefectural government offices are planning to start emergency cash handouts within May, a Kyodo News tally showed Friday, in a sign that the novel coronavirus pandemic has complicated administrative efforts to swiftly implement relief measures.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been aiming for the distribution of 100,000 yen ($936) per resident this month. But many municipalities are also busy implementing steps to contain the virus under the nationwide state of emergency, which is almost certain to be extended for another month through early June.
Parliament enacted Thursday a 25.69 trillion yen extra budget for fiscal 2020 to finance an emergency policy package, including the cash handouts.
The municipal government of Wakayama in western Japan is aiming to provide the money this month, saying its officials are working to that end without taking days off.
Kobe is also one of the 29, saying it is planning to send application forms to households with children first to ensure that families in need will receive necessary documents quickly.
Among other municipalities, eight including Shizuoka, Osaka and Hiroshima said they are aiming to start distributing the handouts in June or later, while 10 including Sapporo, Nagoya, Yokohama and Tokyo's Shinjuku said they were unable to clearly state when they would start.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kickstarter union reaches agreement with management for laid-off workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The union for Kickstarter employees reached an agreement with management on Friday which provides protections for laid-off workers, the union said in a press release. The crowdfunding company announced in an internal memo April 20th it would likely seek layoffs, along with other cost-cutting measures. CEO Aziz Hasan wrote in the memo that Kickstarter had seen a 35 percent drop in new crowdfunding projects on the site in the past several weeks, with “no clear sign of rebound.”
Kickstarter United, the union that represents 60 percent of the company’s 140 employees, said the agreement includes four months of severance pay for all laid-off employees, a release from any non-compete agreements for anyone who accepts severance, and recall rights for one year. The company will continue healthcare coverage for any laid-off employees for up to six months, depending on salary.
Kickstarter spokesperson David Gallagher said in an email to The Verge on Saturday that the company was offering voluntary buyouts to union members, which includes the ability to opt out of health insurance coverage and receive partial payment instead.
“We need to put Kickstarter in a stronger position to ride out this uncertainty so it can continue to support its mission, which is to help bring creative projects to life,” Gallagher said. He added that non-union employees were receiving a similar offer. Once the company knows who is interested in a buyout it will be able to determine how many layoffs may be required, Gallagher said.
Kickstarter workers successfully voted to unionize in February. They’re represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU).
Hasan said in the April 20th memo that Kickstarter brought in $1.27 million in after-tax profit last year, which has been reinvested back into the business. He mentioned other cost-cutting measures besides layoffs, including a reduction in senior management salaries and not hiring for some vacant positions.
“While we are disappointed with the layoffs announced by Kickstarter management, we are proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our entire union family in this multifaceted fight for our families’ futures, and thankful for Kickstarter management’s willingness to negotiate a fair deal for their impacted employees,” OPEIU President and Local 153 Business Manager Richard Lanigan said in a statement.
The union said layoffs may include up to 45 percent of Kickstarter employees, but Gallagher said the company “hasn’t made any statements about the potential scale of the layoffs.”
UPDATE May 2nd 10:45AM ET: Added comment from Kickstarter and statement from OPEIU representative.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Saudi Gazette reportRIYADH — Moody’s Investors Service, one of the world's leading rating agencies, affirmed Saudi Arabia’s sovereign credit rating at “A1”, however, it modified Kingdom’s outlook to “negative” from “stable”, Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday.The change in future outlook was the result of the outbreak of the coronavirus coupled with the crash of oil prices in the international market, according to Moody’s.“The negative outlook reflects increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia's fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term,” Moody’s said in a statement.Moody's noted that Saudi Arabia is the second largest oil producer in the world, and has significant oil reserves and low extraction costs, providing the Kingdom with a high degree of competitive advantage over other oil producers.In its report, Moody's stressed that the Saudi Arabia's “stable” rating reflects its effective monetary policy, credibility of the exchange rate, overall financial and economic stability, and signs of improvement in fiscal policy resulting from structural financial reforms with plans to diversify the economy away from oil.Moody's raised its estimate for the 2020 fiscal deficit from 8.7 percent to 12 percent of GDP.This will cause government debt to increase to around 38 percent of GDP by the end of 2021 from less than 23 percent of GDP in 2019, according to the statement.It is noteworthy that Fitch Ratings announced its rating for the Kingdom last week, which confirmed the long-term credit rating of Saudi Arabia at “A” with a stable future outlook.These positive estimations by the global rating agencies confirm the great confidence enjoyed by the Saudi economy, as well as the strength of its financial position in facing challenges, especially in light of crises in general and the current exceptional circumstances the world is currently experiencing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Saudi Arabia’s outlook cut to negative by Moody’s</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Saudi Arabia’s outlook was cut to negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service after the crash in oil prices exposed the vulnerability of the kingdom’s finances amid the global pandemic and its reserves plunged to the lowest level in almost a decade.
The rating company kept the sovereign at A1, its fifth-highest grade, according to a statement on Friday. Moody’s last downgraded Saudi Arabia in 2016, and now has its assessment above those of Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings.
“The negative outlook reflects increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia’s fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term,” Moody’s said.
Under strain from the coronavirus and collapsing oil prices, Saudi Arabia is headed for an economic contraction this year while increasingly drawing down its savings. In March alone, the central bank’s net foreign assets fell by more than 5%, or more than 100 billion riyals ($27 billion).
The government is looking to its largest-ever debt program to keep the depletion of reserves at up to 120 billion riyals, as originally planned in the budget. Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan has also laid out plans to scale back spending after already cutting 50 billion riyals in expenditure.
Moody’s projects that Saudi’s fiscal deficit will widen to more than 12% of GDP in 2020 and more than 8% in GDP in 2021 from 4.5% of GDP in 2019. This will cause government debt to increase to around 38% of GDP by the end of 2021 from less than 23% of GDP in 2019, according to the statement.
The price of Brent crude crashed by more than 50% in March and has fallen further since then. It’s now trading around $25 a barrel - far short of the $76.1 the International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi Arabia needs to balance its budget.
Assuming a base case scenario of Brent averaging $35 and Saudi Arabia implementing further spending cuts this year, its fiscal deficit could widen to just under 15% of gross domestic product, according to Bilal Khan, senior economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Dubai.
“Limiting the drawdown in net foreign assets to pre-announced levels is certainly possible but would likely require additional borrowing, deeper spending cuts or further divestment of state assets,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">For Fed Chair Powell, March was pure madness as coronavirus response intensified</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: A half-hour staff meeting in a secure location.
A 40-minute consultation with an infectious disease specialist.
Multiple days of "unscheduled telephone calls from home with staff and other government officials," including Saturdays and Sundays.
These are just a few of the items on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's March calendar, released on Friday, that chronicle a dramatic shift from warily watching the coronavirus to an all-out effort to bring policymakers, government officials and lawmakers on board for an economic support effort of unprecedented size and scope.
Though the calendar gives no details on what was discussed, it suggests an explosion of activity at the US central bank unseen since the darkest days of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
Powell's sudden ramp-up in activity began on Feb 28, with a flurry of calls to his central banker counterparts at the European Central Bank, among others. Those calls - including a 17-minute one with the head of the central bank in China, where the coronavirus outbreak had begun - continued for another two days as the Fed prepared its first concrete response to the coronavirus crisis: an emergency interest rate cut on Mar 3.
But that was only the beginning of a month packed with an exceptional number of meetings, some of which were quite unusual by the standards of Fed chair calendars, published monthly with a lag of four to six weeks.
Take, for instance, a Friday, March 6, late-afternoon phone call with someone identified only as an "outside expert."
A Fed spokeswoman later said it was a telephone briefing with University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's infectious disease chief, Trish Perl.
Two days later, Powell held an hourlong Sunday morning meeting with fellow central bankers, and a second hourlong call that evening with staff.
The next day he and the staff met for a half hour in a "sensitive compartmented information facility," a secure room usually reserved for classified information.
Fed policymakers met the following Sunday, conferencing by video their far-flung colleagues who participated from Fed regional banks across the country.
They slashed interest rates to zero and launched the first of nearly a dozen lending and other programs designed to keep financial markets from imploding.
They also aimed to cushion the economy from the oncoming shock of mass layoffs and business closures as the country began to shut down to slow the spread of the virus, the extent of which has only lately become clear as states report 30 million people sought unemployment insurance over the past six weeks.
Over the course of March, as cases of the coronavirus mounted and policymakers began to express more public concern, Powell spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at least 11 times, the calendar shows. That is surely an undercount as the two worked out a range of corporate lending programs, some of which had never before been tried, to keep previously healthy businesses afloat.
Mnuchin told CNBC on March 26 that he had been speaking with Powell 30 times a day.
Powell met with two titans of markets: Larry Fink, chief executive of Blackrock and Ron O'Hanley, CEO of State Street. Both firms later were assigned roles helping to administer emergency Fed programs to help financial markets.
And he spoke with several lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who later said he had told her to "think big fiscally."
Congress passed a US$2.3 trillion rescue package in late March that included grants to small business and loans to firms in critical industries, as well as cash payments to American households and for the newly unemployed.
Powell also spoke once with President Donald Trump on March 23, during which it was reported that Trump, usually a vociferous Powell critic, gave him rare praise.
Powell's calendar also shows how he personally adapted to stay-at-home orders that by the end of the month covered most of the U.S. population.
Powell's last engagement that took place at the Fed's Washington headquarters was the Mar 15 policy-setting meeting. After that he worked from home every day that month, his calendar shows, including weekends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Malaysian economy could shrink more than earlier forecasts, says finance minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's economy in 2020 could shrink more than initially forecast due to extended curbs on movement imposed to stem an outbreak of the new coronavirus, the finance minister said on Saturday (May 2).
Malaysia's central bank had forecast in April for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of between -2 per cent and 0.5 per cent this year.
"But that forecast was made after just two weeks of movement curbs. We're now more than five weeks in ... so our GDP could shrink even more," Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said in an interview with a local television channel.
Malaysia, which has announced a stimulus package worth 250 billion ringgit (US$5.8 billion) to help cushion the economic blow from the outbreak, will also announce an economic recovery plan later this month, the minister said.
Malaysian authorities on Saturday defended plans to ease coronavirus lockdown measures next week even as the number of new infections jumped to a two-week high.
Most businesses will reopen on Monday, although schools, cinemas and nightclubs will remain closed, along with the country's borders. Mass gatherings will still be banned.
Security minister Ismail Sabri said Malaysia was not being hasty in relaxing the curbs, stressing that businesses reopening will have to implement hygiene and social distancing measures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US aviation sector cuts more jobs amid travel meltdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: The ongoing US travel crisis is causing thousands of job cuts as the aviation sector waits for passengers to return to the skies but braces for years of lower demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
US airlines are slashing hundreds of thousands of flights, cutting schedules by 80 per cent or more through at least June and parking thousands of jets as demand for tickets has plunged by about 95 per cent. Airlines are requiring facial coverings and implementing new cleaning procedures to try to convince passengers it is safe to fly again, but also fear the weakened economy may further drag down demand.
Late Friday, Spirit AeroSystems said that in response to lower production rates from Boeing and Airbus it would layoff 1,450 workers in Kansas.
"This sudden drop in air travel has forced our customers to adjust to lower demand from airlines, many of which are seeking to defer or cancel airplane orders," Spirit AeroSystems chief executive Tom Gentile told employees in an email seen by Reuters. "All indications right now tell us this lower demand for new commercial airplanes is likely to last for several years."
On Wednesday, Boeing announced it would cut some production rates and eliminate about 16,000 jobs worldwide, or 10per cent of its workforce by year end.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said he expects it will "take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends." The cuts in some areas, such as commercial airplanes, will be more than 15per cent, Boeing said.
Delta Air Lines Inc said last week it does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years. More than 37,000 Delta employees have volunteered to take unpaid leave lasting from one month to a year.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the airline will be "smaller than we intended to be certainly into 2021."
Labor union SEIU said Thursday at least 13,000 union members at airports have been laid off and another 1,000 layoffs are planned. The US Treasury has not yet awarded US$3 billion in payroll assistance cash grants approved by Congress for airport contractors such as baggage handlers and airplane caterers.
US airlines last month collectively were awarded US$25 billion in Treasury cash grants but as a condition must not fire workers or reduce through Sep 30.
Numerous airlines have warned that without a dramatic turnaround in passenger numbers they will be forced to make new significant cuts before year end.
JPMorgan Chase said in a research note on Friday that "Oct 1 is likely to emerge as one of the darkest days in history for airline labour" - though it noted that Congress could opt to extend additional assistance.
United Airlines is reducing working hours by 25 per cent for 15,000 employees starting May 24, drawing criticism from an employee union and some U.S. lawmakers who contend that the move violates the terms of the US$5 billion payroll assistance United is receiving from the Treasury.
"The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honour this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ," Republican Senator Josh Hawley wrote United on Friday.
United declined to comment on Hawley's letter on Saturday but its chief operations officer Greg Hart told employees in an email on Friday that the reduction in hours does not violate the terms of the government assistance.
He said United is "making similar changes for our management personnel" and that those changes will be announced on Monday.
Last month, General Electric said it was furloughing 50 per cent of workers in US engine assembly and component manufacturing operations, a move that impacted thousands of employees. That followed the 2,600 US job cuts announced in March by GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus.

“The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honor this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ,” Republican Senator Josh Hawley wrote United on Friday.
United declined to comment on Hawley’s letter on Saturday but its chief operations officer Greg Hart told employees in an email on Friday that the reduction in hours does not violate the terms of the government assistance.
He said United is “making similar changes for our management personnel” and that those changes will be announced on Monday.
Last month, General Electric Co said it was furloughing 50% of workers in U.S. engine assembly and component manufacturing operations, a move that impacted thousands of employees. That followed the 2,600 U.S. job cuts announced in March by GE’s aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Air New Zealand Signs Government Deal To Take Cargo To The World</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Air New Zealand Cargo is entering a partnership with the Government to ensure critical cargo transport lines are maintained.
The International Airfreight Capacity agreement with the Ministry of Transport will allow exporters and importers the ability to access key markets in a world where available air freight capacity is reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Air New Zealand General Manager Cargo Rick Nelson says cargo customers will be able to access capacity across Air New Zealand’s traditional network, with a handful of exceptions.
“The new agreement means Air New Zealand can publish scheduled cargo services into key markets which will allow freight forwarders, exporters and importers to plan and operate their logistics supply chains with certainty.
“We are working to offer connectivity to and from the United Kingdom and Europe, as well as Houston and Chicago via Los Angeles and San Francisco, Hong Kong and Narita gateways.
“This agreement will add significant value to New Zealand’s air cargo community, and we encourage the New Zealand forwarding, export and import communities to get behind these cargo options. Naturally, we hope the need to operate under an agreement of this nature will be a short-term business model and in time we’ll be able to revert to our traditional model as demand for passenger travel begins to pick up.”
Ports the airline will not operate cargo flights to under the agreement are London and Buenos Aires. Singapore is also not included in the initial phase.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Emirates SkyCargo has announced that that will be launching four weekly cargo services to New Zealand from May 3, 2020 to help connect businesses in the country to key trading partners across the globe.
The air cargo carrier is working with the Government of New Zealand as part of its International Airfreight Capacity (IAFC) scheme to help facilitate the exports of key commodities from New Zealand to the rest of the world while ensuring that essential cargo continues to be transported into the country.
Emirates SkyCargo will be operating 3 weekly Dubai-Auckland-Melbourne-Dubai flight rotations and a once a week Dubai-Sydney-Christchurch-Sydney-Dubai flight service operated by the carrier’s Boeing 777-300ER passenger freighters.
Emirates SkyCargo will be providing a vital cargo lane for the exports of high quality exports from New Zealand including food items such as chilled meat, honey, dairy products, and seafood to various destinations in the Middle East and Europe. The flight service is also expected to help transport pharmaceuticals and medical appliances to markets in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
“Emirates SkyCargo is delighted to working with the Government of New Zealand to help connect fresh produce of the highest quality and other key exports from Auckland and Christchurch. We consider it our responsibility to ensure that we are able to facilitate adequate supply of food and other essential commodities to markets that we serve and also support exporters in New Zealand at the same time,” said Nabil Sultan, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Cargo.
Emirates SkyCargo is operating dedicated cargo flights on its Boeing 777 freighters and Boeing 777-300ER passenger freighters to more than 60 destinations across six continents. Through a mix of scheduled flights and charter operations, the air cargo carrier has helped transport thousands of tonnes of vital protective equipment and food across the world during the Covid-19 pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You recently wrote that I can change our family home to joint ownership by doing this "personally". Could you tell me how to do this? Our house in Melbourne is in my name because my husband was in business and requested that I be the nominal owner. He conducted this business in a home office on the ground floor of the residence. If we sell the house, which has appreciated somewhat since we occupied it, the office part will attract a sizeable Capital Gains Tax (CGT) amount, as it is about one third of the "footprint" of the property. My thinking is that if the house was in both our names we could spread the CGT between our two incomes, a small part of which is from the aged pension. J.T.
In NSW, the State Revenue website is informative, telling us that if a family home is also used for other purposes, the duty exemption for transfers between spouses will only apply to the residential part of the home, unless only one room was being used for the business.
In Victoria, the State Revenue Office is less helpful and its 21 page "Guide to Spouse/Domestic Partner Property Transfers in Duties Online", which you can download from the SRO website, says nothing about using part of a home for business purposes.
The SRO’s client adviser (on 13 21 61) didn’t know the answer and its technical branch believed that as long as you meet all other requirements and the house is now wholly used as a principal residence, nothing in the law would reduce the exemption.
Assuming you obtain an exemption, go to the website, propertyandlandtitles.vic.gov.au and look for "Transfer of Land Forms" to download the "Guide: Transferring property between spouses or domestic partners".
It will give you the option for a non-monetary transfer under the quaint title "Natural love and affection".
Having gone through all that, it is a grey area whether you will save on CGT when you sell.
If you bought your home after 1985 and started using part of it to produce income for the first time after August 20, 1996, you are assumed to have bought the dwelling at its market value at the time.
However, CGT will not apply if the business was run through a company or trust. Also, you may be able to apply one or more of the small business CGT concessions to reduce your capital gain.
It's best to talk to a tax accountant, or seek a private ruling.
Regarding your recent comments on the Australian Taxation Office's treatment of foreign pensions, our tax accountant in WA was apparently not aware of the deductible amount you mentioned in your answer. My wife and I have both been receiving defined-benefit pensions for a number of years from our Canadian employers and also from the Canadian Pension Plan. We are citizens of both Australia and Canada, are non-tax residents in Australia and spend more than half the year in Canada. We may follow our children back to Australia in future. Would the deductible amount from the Canadian defined-benefit pensions be tax exempt? P.C.
As long as you are a non-tax resident, your Canadian pension is not taxable here.
Once you live here for 183-days of a financial year, whether continuously or with breaks, you would be considered a tax resident and your foreign pensions would be taxable.
Where tax is withheld in Canada, you can claim a foreign income tax offset, unless you are entitled to seek a refund there.
Your personal after-tax contributions to the pension fund form the Undeducted Purchase Price (UPP). That part of your annual pension, which represents a return to you of your UPP, known as the deductible amount, is untaxed and is calculated by dividing the UPP by your life expectancy factor at the start of the pension.
Should you move back to the much warmer Land of Oz, and want to claim a deductible amount, Google "ATO Request for a determination of the deductible amount of UPP of a foreign pension or annuity".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel is reportedly close to buying transit app creator Moovit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel’s autonomous driving ambitions may soon get a boost from a well-known app developer. Calcalist, The Marker and TechCrunch sources claim Intel is close to acquiring transit app developer Moovit in a deal that would be worth around $1 billion. The deal would reportedly fold Moovit into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub (currently led by Mobileye) and help with its overall self-driving strategy.
Moovit told TechCrunch it had no comment “at this time.” A deal is supposedly near enough that it could be unveiled within days.
It’s easy to see why Intel would be interested in Moovit, and not just because of existing financial backing. The startup uses a mix of AI and data analytics to monitor real-time traffic and offer transit directions to roughly 800 million people. That could be valuable for robotaxis and other driverless vehicles that need to consider live traffic to choose the fastest routes. If your Intel-powered ride avoids gridlock to reach your destination on time, you’ll know who to thank.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel reportedly acquiring smart transit startup Moovit for $1 billion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel is reportedly close to acquiring Moovit, which is an Israel-based startup that uses AI and data analytics to track traffic and provide transit insights.
TechCrunch reports that the deal is expected to close in the next few days for around $1 billion USD (about $1.4 billion CAD).
The deal would reportedly combine Moovit into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub and advance its self-driving strategy. Although it’s not clear what Moovit would do in that space, its traffic data and intelligent routing would help advance autonomous vehicles services.
Moovit’s data analytics would be useful for driverless vehicles that need to understand live traffic to determine the more efficient routes.
The company has also reported significant recent growth in the past few years. In 2018, Moovit reported that its apps were used by 120 million people around the world in 2,000 cities and 80 countries. Now in 2020, that number has increased to 800 million people in 3,100 cities in 102 countries.
Nothing has been confirmed about the acquisition yet, but sources say that Intel is expected to make an announcement soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">White House adviser won’t rule out more money for U.S. states, small businesses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday he would not rule out anything in a new relief bill to ease the “tremendous hardships” of the coronavirus outbreak, including more money for state and local governments and small businesses.
More than 30 million Americans have joined the unemployment benefit rolls over the past six weeks and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are discussing a fourth coronavirus relief bill.
Democrats are pushing for additional aid to help cities and states cope with lost revenue from a shutdown economy and some governors have warned of massive layoffs if they fail to get it.
Some advisers to Republican President Donald Trump have said the need for another stimulus bill is not yet clear. But Kudlow said “there may well be additional legislation” as officials study how the billions included in the last bill take effect.
“We know the economy is still in a terrible, contractionary phase, tremendous hardships, everywhere,” Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“We’re trying to work through this. I don’t want to rule in or out anything right now. We are in discussions internally and with leading members of Congress.”
Congress has not met in regular session since March, though it has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $3 trillion. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said money for states and cities would be the core of the next legislative package Democrats draft.
Trump has considered linking such aid to sanctuary cities’ immigration policies, Kudlow said.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Sunday federal help to states that have taken a big revenue hit from coronavirus would make a “huge difference.”
“This is about firefighters, police, EMS, teachers at the point of attack. We’re already seeing some layoffs in New Jersey,” Murphy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We need a big slug of federal, direct cash assistance.”
All 50 states are suffering from the lack of revenue over the past two months, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in response to Trump’s argument that states with budget woes before the coronavirus outbreak should not get bailed out.
“Coronavirus has caused that. All of us are having to spend more on social services and health care to take care of people,” Pritzker said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Kudlow said authorities need to see the results of the previous funding efforts before deciding on the next steps.
“Then we’ll see, we will see in a couple of weeks, what needs to be done and perhaps how to do it,” Kudlow said.
Kudlow was asked whether more aid would be given to small businesses.
“It may be,” Kudlow said. “We haven’t made a decision yet.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scott Morrison says that Australia’s success in containing the spread of the coronavirus entitles Australians to an “early mark” from the social distancing restrictions. But, as suggested by the Morrison government’s spat with Victoria over schools, the early easing of the health emergency shutdown will challenge the Team Australia unity in national politics.
A looming federal by-election in the NSW seat of Eden-Monaro caused by the unfortunate early retirement from Parliament due to the ill-health of Labor’s Mike Kelly is set to provide the first ballot box insight into post-COVID-19 politics. That will take place as the Australian economy has plunged more sharply than even during the Great Depression of the 1930s, with unemployment set to double to 10 per cent or more.
The labour market recession means Mr Morrison will probably run his signalled pro-growth reform agenda around getting Australians back into jobs, repaying a massive government debt build-up and rebuilding prosperity.
It is also a chance for Labor under Anthony Albanese to put the Bill Shorten era firmly behind it and move back towards the mainstream economic reform traditions of the successful Hawke-Keating governments of the 1980s and early-1990s that opened up the economy and led to almost three decades of unbroken growth.
As Sam Crosby, the head of the McKell Institute said on these pages last week, now is the time for Labor to abandon the political style of the wasted past decade and to constructively engage with the "well-thought-out centrist reform that was abandoned because the political class decided a disingenuous political scrap was just too tempting".
The weekend’s knee-jerk anti-immigration intervention into the debate about post-COVID-19 joblessness by Labor senator Kristina Keneally might, therefore, have been expected from Pauline Hanson rather than the alternative government. Labor’s home affairs spokesman is calling for a “migration program that puts Australian workers first” and wants the “cheap supply of overseas, temporary labour” cut by slashing the number of temporary visa holders permitted to work in Australia so that Australian workers get “a fair go and first go at jobs”.
Such language recalls the comments made last year by former NSW Labor leader Michael Daley about Asians stealing jobs from young Australians.
Yet as Senator Keneally admits, with the border likely to remain shut for an extended period – and the permanent migration intake forecast for 2021 of 270,000 now expected to fall by 85 per cent – migration poses little genuine threat to jobs during the recovery. Australia’s immigration system is largely demand-driven by growth, prosperity, and job-availability.
Blaming unemployment, underemployment, and youth joblessness on “young and unskilled” migrants working in hospitality and other service industry jobs is also simplistic and overlooks the disincentive effects of welfare dependence and the social problems that affect the willingness and ability to work.
Temporary migrant workers are among the jobless who are ineligible for JobSeeker or JobKeeper payments and so are being forced to return home. Yet even after the recovery, Australia will still need immigration including temporary workers to do jobs such as fruit-picking that Australians won’t do and to provide the highly-skilled STEM trained employees for high-tech jobs that Australia’s underperforming education system fails to produce in sufficient numbers.
Senator Keneally says that high immigration was used before the pandemic as the “lazy” way to boost growth. But Labor, with its tax and spend and anti-big end of town policies, was part of the complacency that left the economy sub-par with low investment, poor productivity and sluggish wages growth.
So where is Labor’s taxation reform plan to encourage investment in job and productivity growth? Where is Labor’s industrial reform policy to fix Paul Keating's enterprise bargaining system that was broken by the Rudd-Gillard government’s union-demanded "better off overall" test that insisted that no worker could conceivably be worse off, even if the great majority would gain?
Or will Labor step up to the burning platform and help the private sector achieve the workplace flexibility that former Productivity Commission boss Gary Banks says will be needed to create jobs in the post-COVID-19 world.
Now is not the time for pale imitations of One Nation-style anti-immigration populism because as Labor’s trade spokesman Madeline King says, it is globalisation that “will be an integral component of our economic recovery” and the rebuilding of the thriving economy on which restoring and increasing jobs for all Australians depends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain needs a New Deal-style recovery model</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The writer formerly served as MP for Grantham and Stamford
The coronavirus pandemic is going to inflict far greater damage on the UK’s fortunes than anyone anticipated when it began. Optimism that the economy might “snap back” after the end of the lockdown has faded. Many economic forecasters believe that the crisis will leave a legacy of higher unemployment and lower incomes that will last into 2022.
Having put in place a comprehensive package of measures to support people and businesses during the lockdown, British chancellor Rishi Sunak will be focusing on the next challenge: how to jump-start the economy and engineer a rebound in growth and employment after the lockdown ends.
In this, he should take inspiration from US president Franklin D Roosevelt, who assumed control of the American economy in 1933 when it was in the grip of the Depression. “The country needs . . . bold, persistent experimentation,” FDR said back then. “It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all try something.”
The first thing the chancellor should try is a wage subsidy scheme for new employees. When the government lifts the restrictions stopping people from going to work, it will want to withdraw support for furloughed employees. There is a big risk that this will cause a spike in lay-offs, as employers conclude they cannot afford to pay the full cost of all the staff they sent home.
To minimise this, the government should announce that support for furloughed workers will be phased out over several months (with the percentage subsidy reduced each month). In parallel, it should introduce a wage subsidy scheme for newly-hired employees: up to half of their wage costs would be paid by the government on condition that they are retained for a full year and that their employer makes no further redundancies during that time.
The second thing the chancellor should target is what Roosevelt would have called “public works”. Investment in broadband infrastructure should be doubled. The crisis has revealed the value of as many people as possible being able to work from home. The government should also renew its commitment to solving the climate crisis by announcing two big investments in cutting carbon emissions. The rapid installation of a comprehensive national network of electric car charging-points and a massive programme of home insulation. In these initiatives, the emphasis must be on speed of delivery, getting money out of the door and into the pockets of British tradesmen and women.
How should all of this be paid for? This will require the boldest experiment of all.
The Covid-19 pandemic is what insurers call an act of God. It has hit us like an asteroid strike and unleashed an economic downturn in which governments and central banks are mere bystanders. In 2008, during the financial crisis, it was obvious that the disaster was man-made. What makes this crisis so terrifying is that it has happened to us, not been done by us. But therein lies an opportunity.
The usual objection to printing money to pay for government spending is that it will unleash inflation. That would be true if the spending being financed were increasing the overall level of demand in the economy, and if markets expected the government to resort to monetary financing as a matter of course. Neither of these conditions holds true today.
The huge increase in government spending is an attempt to compensate for a far greater collapse in private demand. And no government in its right mind will ever want to engineer another crisis like this. The catastrophic and unprecedented nature of the pandemic gives the government the chance to reach for a once-in-a-lifetime method of fixing it.
Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, should declare that it would not be fair to ask future generations to carry a greater burden of debt, or enjoy permanently lower living standards as a result of the crisis. He should ask parliament to pass an act giving the Bank of England the specific, time-limited mandate to undertake a programme of monetary financing of up to £400bn. Any borrowing envisaged before the onset of the crisis should still be financed through bond issuance and monetary financing for additional spending should only be available until the end of 2021.
Thatcherites and other disciples of economic orthodoxy will argue that monetary financing is reckless. The new governor of the BoE rejected the idea soon after his appointment. But unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. The governor is right that “helicopter money” (as it is known) should never be a regular weapon in the armoury of a central bank governor. At this perilous moment in our history, however, as we grapple with the greatest threat to our peace and prosperity in 75 years, Mr Johnson should think the unthinkable and, like Roosevelt before him, put the country back to work.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In its lockdown avatar, yoga has gone online — and it means big business</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Delhi-NCR’s first novel coronavirus patient, 45-year-old Rohit Datta, jokes that the only yoga he did in the pre-pandemic days was kapal bhati, a breathing technique, because someone told him that each expulsion of breath burnt one calorie. “So if I did 300, I’d be burning 300 calories and save time walking,” he says laughing. But when he found himself in hospital with the dreaded COVID-19, taunted by the media for having ‘infected’ others, he grappled with both the physical effects of the infection and the mental anguish of cruel words. “People started sending me all kinds of WhatsApp messages about cures,” he says; they ranged from eating an onion with salt to performing a havan. The only message that got him thinking was one from his mother, who suggested he do anulom-vilom pranayama.
In the isolation unit, Datta made a mental list of five breathing exercises he needed to do: om, anulom-vilom, kapal bhati, bhastrika, and kumbhaka. “The first time I tried, I couldn’t do any for even two seconds. I felt like an old man who had smoked through his life,” he says. But he persisted, doing them twice a day for seven days, gradually increasing the duration. “I didn’t have the strength for physical exercise,” says Datta, who runs a technical textile business in Rajasthan. He had just returned from a work trip to Europe when he was diagnosed positive. Today, a pranayama loyalist, Datta says he will be one for the rest of his life. “It is both preventive and curative,” he says.
In Karnataka, Ashwini Shrinivas G.S. made a YouTube video on her COVID-19 journey, speaking about how yoga and pranayama helped her come through. A Pune couple, who have also recovered from the infection, said it was yoga that kept them engaged in the ward.
Something new
The yoga frenzy that engulfed the world a few years ago has suddenly seen a shift: in these times of COVID-19, it is no longer saffron-tinged and shloka-accompanied; nor is it about ‘celebrating’ the body with white people on Instagram performing the perfect vrschikasana (scorpion pose) on a beach. Today, it is seen as a form of mind-body control in a world where an invisible force bars us from stepping out of our homes.
“The pandemic has given us a different perspective on things we considered important; we’re now asking ourselves, ‘Are they really so important?’ We are looking for answers,” says Anju Dhawan, a professor at the psychiatry department of Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Some three weeks ago, she started a yoga-pranayam-meditation session over Zoom, which she conducts twice a day for students. She says the reason the class sees this level of engagement — there are 150 in the group — is probably because “some people are interested in stress reduction, and others have opened up to exploring the spiritual realm. Also, maybe this is a time they want to learn something new, have a new experience.”
It’s also a reflection of how the world came to yoga in the first place. It was a way to find a few minutes’ pause in our over-stimulating environments — long commutes, buzzing work schedules, nonstop entertainment. For Lakshmy Vijayan, a second-year student at AIIMS, yoga has helped regulate her sleep-wake cycle. “It also anchors you to the present,” she says.
Finding answers
In the second week of March, when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the number of COVID-19 cases outside China had increased 13-fold and the number of countries affected had tripled, the Harvard Medical School’s health blog published an article titled ‘Coping with coronavirus anxiety’. The writer, John Sharp, suggested yoga, meditation, and breathing as three distinct ways of relaxing. He even offered names of apps such as Yoga Studio and Pocket Yoga, Headspace and Calm, ironically all owned and developed in the West.
The West has studied yoga and found that it boosts flexibility and strength, and in some cases aerobic power too. Its attention to syncing breath with movement and its focus on different breathing exercises helps both physically and mentally, improving lung capacity and helping calm the mind, all of which make it almost prescription-worthy for COVID-19 times.
The WHO, in its media briefing on March 20, days before India’s lockdown, listed yoga as one of the ways of “making time for exercise”.
Soon the floodgates opened; Google recorded a surge in searches. For instance, on April 27, at 4.20 p.m., searches for clothing brand ‘Alo Yoga’ spiked 4,150% in the U.S. over a 30-day period compared to the previous 30 days. Searches for ‘yoga poses for kids’ went up by 3,650% in India, ‘sun salutation’ in the U.K. shot up by over 5,000% — this jump in numbers made it what Google Trends calls a ‘breakout’. The biggest traffic in India came from Sikkim, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Uttarakhand.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for whom yoga has been a top soft-power subject, tweeted that he practises yoga nidra whenever he gets the time.
Whether the popularity of yoga nidra stems from this is anyone’s guess, but on the Cure.fit app, this, along with pranayama classes, is among the two most popular yoga sessions. In fact, yoga is the highest rated among all their online classes. Naresh Krishnaswamy, who heads growth and business at Cure.fit, says that both yoga and other workout formats are growing at a 5x rate. “It wasn’t a surprise — yoga is a big market,” he says. Alistair Shearer in his book, The Story of Yoga: From Ancient India to the Modern West, talks of it being a “$25 billion-a-year wellness industry”.
Business of yoga
And as it goes online in the time of lockdown, the business is bound to only grow.
Abhishek Sharma, who calls himself a holistic fitness coach, decided to do a Facebook Live every morning during lockdown from his Mumbai home. A trainer to celebrities, including Dia Mirza and Rajkumar Hirani, he started conducting classes at 8:30 a.m., only to find that people were engaging with him even after the sessions and reaching out to him from Nepal, Pakistan and Singapore.
“I realised there’s a lot of anxiety, even though people were putting on a brave face,” he says. “I have been anti-online. I’m very old-school,” he adds. Sharma, who learnt raj yoga, considered the highest form of yoga that focuses on the inner self and its oneness with the universe, adapted to the urban needs of yoga for weight-loss, back problems or as a balm for stress. He now focuses on helping people make yoga part of their daily lives. He sees his classes as a comfort zone for people, where they feel like they are in touch with regular life. “A lot of people are bingeing on Netflix and food, so just waking up and attending a morning session puts the day in some order,” he says.
Sarvesh Shashi, founder, SARVA and Diva Yoga, Mumbai, a chain of yoga studios, says that on the SARVA app, 63% of the high intensity yoga is consumed by women, whereas the guided meditation has a 55% male audience. “In yoga terms, women are moving from asana to dhyana, and men are moving from dhyana to asana,” he says, noting the difference in entry point to the practice. Both he and Sharma talk of the immunity that yoga offers, something particularly relevant for the time. In fact, SARVA even has a sequence for this.
But is the new focus on yoga, with its online avatar, going to turn into something entirely commercial? “Purchasing health virtually is going to become the norm,” says Vijay Raaghavan, Director, Management Consulting, PwC India, who works on digital health and wellness. “We used to seek management of illness. Going froward, people will become cautious about how to manage health.” He says offers will now be linked to points that ‘buy’ you more than just products. For instance, if you sign up for a yoga class, it may be linked with a health insurance policy, but may also be linked with an intangible benefit like gaining access to an international flight that has stricter health norms, for instance. It is the sense of having access to ‘privileges’ that yoga may boom on.
Much like the LinkedIn Social Selling Index which measures the user’s profile and engagement across five parameters, Dr. Raaghavan thinks that if a company can draw up an index that fixes parameters for yoga engagement (such as yoga clothes, footwear, food, level of skill), it may be able to take yoga to the next level of commerce. “Instant gratification, say completing an hour-long session, gets you cumulative worth — your breathing gets better — which also leads you to a certain entitlement, say, being able to join a club run by a yoga clothing brand. This is the future of yoga.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The lucrative trade in human blood samples</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After 10 terrible days of chills, nausea, a fever of 103 and a headache of such intensity that her nose bled, Aleacia Jenkins knew she had been stricken with the coronavirus even before she tested positive.
So when a friend told her about an obscure California company that was asking for blood donations from people who have recovered from the virus to help researchers develop tests for antibodies, she didn’t hesitate.
“If my blood donation could help save someone’s life who is older or more vulnerable,” said Jenkins, 42, of Shoreline, Washington, “it would be crazy not to want to help do that.”
But what she did not know at the time was that the company, Cantor BioConnect, was selling those donations to laboratories and test manufacturers at sometimes exorbitant prices: from $350 up to $40,000 for a rare sample from a single donor.
Cantor BioConnect said its prices were directly related to the “high costs” of its supply chain, which includes finding donors, testing the samples, safety costs and shipping logistics.
Around the world, scientists are racing to develop and mass-produce reliable antibody tests that public health experts say are a crucial element in ending the coronavirus lockdowns that are causing economic devastation. But that effort is being hamstrung, scientists say, by a shortage of the blood samples containing antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, that are needed to validate the tests.
Recognising a rare opportunity, some companies are seeking to cash in on the shortages, soliciting blood donations and selling samples at rich markups in a practice that has been condemned by medical professionals as, at the very least, unethical.
While the trade is happening worldwide, there is a particular shortage in Britain, which has only a small number of positive COVID-19 blood samples, public health officials said, because it was slow to roll out testing.
Traditionally, blood samples have been provided at low cost by Britain’s largely centralised public health system to labs and clinics. In contrast to the private market in the United States, the British system is not set up to distribute samples to a large network of labs and test manufacturers, leaving many of them now to fend for themselves.
Strict rules govern the collection and use of human samples in the country, banning the payment of donors (past a small expense fee) and prohibiting third parties from making a profit from blood samples sourced from the National Health Service.
But that has not stopped businesses from trying to make a profit by selling blood donated in other countries to Britain and elsewhere, which they can do legally.
Documents, emails and price lists obtained by The New York Times show that Cantor BioConnect is one of several companies throughout the world offering to sell COVID-19 blood samples to labs and test manufacturers at elevated prices. The higher the level of antibodies in the blood, the higher the price.
From March 31 to April 22, prices asked by Cantor BioConnect for its cheapest samples — always sold by the millilitre, the equivalent of less than one-quarter of a teaspoon — rose more than 40%, to $500 from $350. In addition to the $40,000 sample, the company also increased the amount of blood samples for sale for $3,000 and introduced new prices of $1,000 to $2,000 for other “premium” stock.
“I’ve never seen these prices before,” said Dr Joe Fitchett, medical director of Mologic, one of the British test manufacturers that was offered the blood samples. “It’s money being made from people’s suffering.”
Stymied by the soaring prices, scientists in Britain say they have been forced to turn to personal connections and word-of-mouth to procure the blood donations they need.
Human tissue samples are critical for virologists, medical researchers and pharmaceutical companies trying to develop vaccines, cures, treatments and tests. The samples include things like organs and bones as well as blood.
“Any drug or vaccine or test kit being developed needs to go through trials and tests and validations, and to do that you need to have positive samples,” said Kelly Sapsford, who manages blood collections for Clinical Trials Laboratory Services, a private blood donation centre in London. “They’re critical.”
All of the companies mentioned in this article have denied any profiteering.
Cantor BioConnect was founded in 2016 in a San Diego suburb. Its creator, David Cantor, was following in the footsteps of his father in what was then a sleepy business. He said in a statement that he was “proud to be playing a role in the scientific research that will eventually help neutralise this deadly virus.”
Cantor was early to spot a gap in the market. On March 18 of this year, he posted on Facebook, “As you know, the war against coronavirus is currently hampered by lack of testing availability.”
He added, “I’ve been flooded with requests for this blood, and we need to find 50 patients willing to help the cause by donating some tubes of blood.”
Cantor and his employees began contacting coronavirus patients on social media to solicit blood donations. In a since-removed online advertisement, they said they were working “in conjunction” with the White House COVID-19 Task Force and offered $100 for each donation.
Dozens of donations began to flood in from across the United States. Within days, he was shipping out vials of blood to customers across the world.
The greatest demand, Cantor said, came from US labs and antibody test manufacturers. But the company also drew major demand from Japan and Europe, he said, including several “middlemen” in Britain.
Some of Cantor BioConnect’s blood samples are reasonably priced for the US market, industry experts said. But many said that the “premium inventory” price of $3,000 per millilitre was far higher than normal. And they all described the company’s price of $40,000 for a “seroconversion panel” of three blood donations from one patient as exorbitant.
The company said that its overall profit margin on the project was 30% to 40%, which it said was in line with industry norms. It said that the $40,000 price tag was for a “single transaction” of an extremely rare and valuable sample and that it did not track the profit margin of each individual sample sold.
Cantor outlined his costs per sample as the $100 donor fee, a maximum of $200 to ship the donation to his company and payment for a phlebotomist to collect the blood sample.
In response to further questions, he said in a statement that the process of collecting blood from COVID-19-positive donors was “complex” and “extremely difficult and costly” because of safety protocols and the small number of coronavirus cases known when he first started sourcing blood donations.
“There are ways to do things well and safely, and then there are other ways to do them cheaply,” he said, adding that the company had sold samples to “one of the world’s largest test manufacturers,” helping it to “save lives.”
In a final step, Cantor BioConnect relies on a web of middlemen, companies that find buyers for its products around the world. Cantor declined to name his customers or partners, but documents show that Advy Chemical, a major biotech manufacturer in Mumbai, is one of his middlemen.
The Indian company produces diagnostic kits and materials needed to develop tests for various diseases, which it then sells through its worldwide network of customers. It is certified by Germany’s safety regulator and licensed by India’s Food and Drug Administration.
According to emails and price lists reviewed by the Times, in the space of a single day its price for the cheapest blood samples more than doubled, to $950 a millilitre from $350, while “premium” inventory increased to $5,000 from $3,000. The most expensive blood sample was $50,000, an increase of $10,000 over Cantor BioConnect’s.
Advy Chemical said in a statement that the company did not sell any blood samples itself but that it helped facilitate connections for products that other manufacturers might need. It said it had not yet sold any of the Cantor BioConnect samples.
Asked why it had inflated the prices so greatly if it was merely a facilitator, the company cited “strict” nondisclosure agreements and said it would not comment on “business speculation and business specifics.”
The company strongly denied increasing prices by the amounts shown in the emails and price lists.
“Our only intention was to help bring more accurate tests and more quickly,” it said in the statement. “We had hoped this would help humanity, in a small way, in these trying times.”
There is no doubt that market pressures are severe. In Britain, where the cost of a human sample is usually low, scientists and manufacturers were shocked to be quoted $925 for a blood sample by a Scottish company called Tissue Solutions — far higher than the maximum $50 that they said they would normally pay hospitals.
Tissue Solutions’ chief executive, Morag McFarlane, said the company was not making a profit from the samples, which would violate England’s ban on third parties profiting from NHS blood collections.
He said that its higher price was a result of hospital biobanks charging more to collect blood because of the complex nature of gathering potentially contagious COVID-19 samples.
Such explanations, whatever their validity, did not go far with Jenkins, the would-be blood donor. After being told by a reporter how much money was being made from blood donations solicited by Cantor BioConnect, she said she had decided that she wanted “no part of it” and would instead donate her blood to a non-profit clinic in Seattle.
“Anyone trying to take advantage of a pandemic,” she said, “I think that’s really sad and wrong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week:
AIR CANADA EARNINGS
Air Canada will hold a conference call to discuss its first-quarter results on Monday. The airline announced on April 8 that it planned to rehire 16,500 laid-off workers via Ottawa's emergency wage subsidy, though the vast majority would remain at home amid the collapse of global travel triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
LATEST FROM THE OILPATCH
Thursday is a big earnings day in the oilpatch, with results expected from Enbridge, Canadian Natural Resources, Inter Pipeline, Pembina Pipeline and more. Results last week from Husky Energy, Cenovus, Imperial Oil and Precision Drilling portrayed an industry in crisis amid plummeting demand and sinking oil prices.
SHOPIFY UPDATE
Shopify Inc. will release its first-quarter results and hold a conference call with financial analysts on Wednesday. The Ottawa-based technology company recently began offering interest-free cash advances to help companies that use its e-commerce products cope with the impacts of COVID-19. The initiative is meant to provide fast relief to cash-strapped businesses without having to take on debt.
BCE EARNINGS
BCE Inc. will release its results Thursday. Rival Rogers Communications recently revealed that it felt the first financial bite from the COVID-19 pandemic during the tail end of its first quarter and senior executives said they expect conditions will get worse in months to come.
APRIL JOB NUMBERS
Statistics Canada will release the findings of its labour force survey for April on Friday. More than one million Canadians lost their jobs at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March, pushing the national unemployment rate up 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent, the highest it has been since October 2010. Economists are expecting the April numbers to be even worse, with up to three million jobs lost.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO — Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week:
Air Canada earnings
Air Canada will hold a conference call to discuss its first-quarter results on Monday. The airline announced on April 8 that it planned to rehire 16,500 laid-off workers via Ottawa's emergency wage subsidy, though the vast majority would remain at home amid the collapse of global travel triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Latest from the oilpatch
Thursday is a big earnings day in the oilpatch, with results expected from Enbridge, Canadian Natural Resources, Inter Pipeline, Pembina Pipeline and more. Results last week from Husky Energy, Cenovus, Imperial Oil and Precision Drilling portrayed an industry in crisis amid plummeting demand and sinking oil prices.
Shopify update
Shopify Inc. will release its first-quarter results and hold a conference call with financial analysts on Wednesday. The Ottawa-based technology company recently began offering interest-free cash advances to help companies that use its e-commerce products cope with the impacts of COVID-19. The initiative is meant to provide fast relief to cash-strapped businesses without having to take on debt.
BCE earnings
BCE Inc. will release its results Thursday. Rival Rogers Communications recently revealed that it felt the first financial bite from the COVID-19 pandemic during the tail end of its first quarter and senior executives said they expect conditions will get worse in months to come.
April jobs numbers
Statistics Canada will release the findings of its labour force survey for April on Friday. More than one million Canadians lost their jobs at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March, pushing the national unemployment rate up 2.2 percentage points to 7.8 per cent, the highest it has been since October 2010. Economists are expecting the April numbers to be even worse, with up to three million jobs lost.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bangladesh 9th strongest economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bangladesh ranks ninth in a global league table of 66 emerging economies measured according to their financial strengths to cope under the strain of Covid-19 outbreak.
The Economist, a globally acclaimed magazine for economic and political analyses, placed Bangladesh even before China, which has been ranked 10th, for Bangladesh has fared relatively better in all indicators.
Botswana topped the list and it was followed by Taiwan, South Korea, Peru, Russia, the Philippines, Thailand and Saudi Arabia.
South Asian giant India ranked 18th, Vietnam 12th, Indonesia 16th, Malaysia 25th, Pakistan 43rd and Sri Lanka 61st.
The ranking examines the economies across four potential sources of peril -- public debt as percentage of GDP, foreign debt (both public and private), cost of borrowing and reserve cover.
It also calculates their foreign payments owed by the countries this year (their current-account deficit plus their foreign-debt payments) and compares them with their stock of foreign-exchange reserves. A country's rank on each of these indicators is then averaged to determine its overall standing.
Bangladesh is not weak in terms of any of the four criteria.
The strongest countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, are overqualified for the role of emerging markets, said the report titled "Which emerging markets are in most financial peril?"
Many bigger economies, including Russia and China, also appear robust. Most of the countries that score badly across all the indicators tend to be small. The bottom 30 account for only 11 percent of the group's GDP, and less than a quarter of both its foreign and its public debt, the Economist report said.
Over the course of 2020, the 66 economies will have to find over $4trn to service their foreign debt and cover any current-account deficits.
Excluding China, the figure is $2.9trn. But this leaves out the buffers that emerging economies have accumulated. The governments hold over $8trn in foreign-exchange reserves.
Half have enough reserves to cover all of their foreign-debt payments due this year and any current-account deficits, the report added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Economist sees Bangladesh as 9th strongest among emerging economies in coronavirus peril</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Economist has placed Bangladesh on the ninth position in terms of different indicators of financial strength among 66 emerging markets in peril over the coronavirus crisis.
China is just behind Bangladesh while Botswana has been placed first, according to the rankings published by the magazine on Saturday.
The others ahead of Bangladesh are Taiwan, South Korea, Peru, Russia, Philippines and Thailand.
The Economist has ranked the countries using four potential sources of peril. These include public debt, foreign debt, and borrowing costs.
It has also calculated their likely foreign payments this year and compare this with their foreign exchange reserves.
“The damage to exports will be acute. Thanks to low oil prices, Gulf oil exporters will suffer a current-account deficit of over 3% of GDP this year, the IMF reckons, compared with a 5.6% surplus last year,” the magazine said of the economic impacts of the pandemic.
When exports fall short of imports, countries typically bridge the gap by borrowing from abroad, it said.
To weather the crisis, emerging economies may need at least $2.5 trillion, the IMF reckons, from foreign sources or their own reserves.
One way to ensure countries have more hard currency is to stop taking it from them, The Economist said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Afterpay dismisses security fears after WeChat owner builds $300m stake</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Afterpay chief executive Anthony Eisen has dismissed suggestions the emergence of the $800 billion owner of Chinese messaging app WeChat on its shareholder register could expose the buy now pay later platform to security risks.
The Australian payments juggernaut disclosed late on Friday that one of China's biggest companies, Tencent, had picked up a 5 per cent stake in the company for $300 million. Tencent owns the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat which has reportedly been banned by the Australian Defence Department due to security concerns.
But Mr Eisen said Afterpay was not concerned about security risks and more excited about the collaboration opportunities its new shareholder might bring to the table.
"There’s no board representation. It’s purely a financial investment," said Mr Eisen in an interview.
"So we’re not contemplating that relationship to be of a different form to that. And in terms of opportunities, as they arise, we’ll approach it in what you would typically expect to be the right governance formats of any publicly listed company," he said.
Tencent's investment into Afterpay comes after it last month launched a buy now, pay later platform of its own on WeChat, which has more than 1 billion monthly active users. But Mr Eisen said Afterpay would maintain its focus as a consumer finance provider. “We’re maintaining our consumer and retail focus it’s not about deviating from that for us,” he said.
Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar said Afterpay could learn from Tencent's global scale. “I think there's a combination of, 'how do we learn from people who have scaled globally and understand deeply the payments infrastructure at a global level'. And then just also what potential collaboration opportunities to give the most value to our retail partners,” said Mr Molnar.
Tencent spoke of developing a long term partnership with Afterpay.
"Afterpay's approach stands out to us not just for its attractive business model characteristics, but also because its service aligns so well with consumer trends we see developing globally in terms of Afterpay's customer centric, interest free approach as well as its integrated retail presence and ability to add significant value for its merchant base," Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell said in a statement to the ASX released on Friday.
"We look forward to a deep and long-term business partnership between Tencent and Afterpay," he added.
Tencent's substantial shareholder notice revealed that it started acquiring Afterpay shares in late March.
This was just after Afterpay shares hit a multi year low of $8.90 as market concerns grew about the company's ability to deal with its first ever economic downturn and potential bad debts if its customers were not able to pay their bills.
The fintech told investors last month that it could insulate its business model from high-risk clients and avoid any uptick in bad debts from cash-strapped customers.
Tencent paid just over $300 million for a five per cent stake in the buy now pay later provider. The stake is now worth $390 million.
Afterpay shares closed at $29.16 on Friday. The stock is flat so far in 2020, compared to a 22 per cent fall for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Private donors match crisis cash for artists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A crisis fund for artists has been set up with the aim of gifting $1000 to 1000 unemployed creatives across the nation.
Creative Partnerships Australia, a Commonwealth corporation that encourages a culture of private sector support for the arts, will provide seed money for the campaign, offering to match donations up until $110,000, potentially doubling the impact of donations.
CPA will also extend its offer to the National Association of the Visual Arts’ Artists’ Benevolent Fund that offers eligible artists a one-off payment of $2000 for immediate assistance following a disaster or catastrophic event such as COVID-19.
Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said the funding initiative from Creative Partnerships Australia would complement the federal government's existing 0support measures. CPA provides Australian government funding as co-matched contributions with private sector contributions to fund activities in the arts sector.
But artists continue to report loopholes in the JobSeeker and JobKeeper wage subsidy program.
Casuals and contractors working for state entities such as the Art Gallery of NSW, the Sydney Opera House, National Gallery of Victoria, and Melbourne Arts Centre are ineligible for the JobKeeper scheme due to a long-standing convention between state and federal governments, according to the Members Entertainment and Arts Alliance.
The 1000 X 1000 Crisis Cash for Artists aims to provide stop-gap support for those arts workers slipping through the JobKeeper or JobSeeker safety nets.
It is to be promoted through more than 40 arts organisations affiliated with Theatre Network Australia including Sydney Theatre Company, Belvoir, Force Majeure, Circus Oz, and Circa with the campaign to raise $1 million to provide grants of $1000 to 1000 independent artists in the performing arts who can demonstrate loss of income as a result of COVID-19.
Theatre Network Australia chair Jill Smith said CPA's matched funding would act as an incentive for more donors to come on board, knowing that a donation of $1000 would support two artists instead of one.
"The independent sector has been devastated by the shutdown of the arts due to COVID-19, and a small grant can pay for urgent materials, technology, or just pay a gas bill."
Creative Partnerships Australia chief executive officer Fiona Menzies said the offer to match funds acknowledged the adversity and isolation that artists felt and the impact of the temporary closure of venues and postponement of events were having on livelihoods.
Matched funding was a proven way to attract additional funds from the private sector to the arts, she said.
"It is our hope that this funding will assist to immediately respond to the critical situation facing Australia’s artists, and to help sustain our vibrant creative sector."
Casuals at the Sydney Opera House have been without shifts since the closure of its public spaces in mid-March. These workers were provided with six weeks of income maintenance support up until April 26 when wage-subsidy schemes came into full effect.
"We are calling on the federal government to work with the states on a solution so these hundreds of thousands of workers, also local government, are not left in the cold and forced to go onto social security," a Media and Entertainment Alliance Australia spokesperson said.
"The federal government could fix this by amending the eligibility criteria for JobKeeper, or the states could step into the breach to subsidise the income of public sector employees stood down because of coronavirus."
Art Gallery of NSW confirmed it was not eligible to apply for the JobKeeper payments.
"Our permanent, full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public," a gallery spokesperson said.
"During this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery."
The Opera House's chief executive officer, Louise Herron, said the venue was committed to supporting staff as much as possible.
No full-time, part-time or casual staff had been stood down as a result of the pandemic.
"All casual employees remain important members of the Opera House’s workforce and will be offered shifts when activity resumes," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Private donors match crisis cash for artists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A crisis fund for artists has been set up with the aim of gifting $1000 to 1000 unemployed creatives across the nation.
Creative Partnerships Australia, a Commonwealth corporation that encourages a culture of private sector support for the arts, will provide seed money for the campaign, offering to match donations up until $110,000, potentially doubling the impact of donations.
CPA will also extend its offer to the National Association of the Visual Arts’ Artists’ Benevolent Fund that offers eligible artists a one-off payment of $2000 for immediate assistance following a disaster or catastrophic event such as COVID-19.
Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said the funding initiative from Creative Partnerships Australia would complement the federal government's existing 0support measures. CPA provides Australian government funding as co-matched contributions with private sector contributions to fund activities in the arts sector.
But artists continue to report loopholes in the JobSeeker and JobKeeper wage subsidy program.
Casuals and contractors working for state entities such as the Art Gallery of NSW, the Sydney Opera House, National Gallery of Victoria, and Melbourne Arts Centre are ineligible for the JobKeeper scheme due to a long-standing convention between state and federal governments, according to the Members Entertainment and Arts Alliance.
The 1000 X 1000 Crisis Cash for Artists aims to provide stop-gap support for those arts workers slipping through the JobKeeper or JobSeeker safety nets.
It is to be promoted through more than 40 arts organisations affiliated with Theatre Network Australia including Sydney Theatre Company, Belvoir, Force Majeure, Circus Oz, and Circa with the campaign to raise $1 million to provide grants of $1000 to 1000 independent artists in the performing arts who can demonstrate loss of income as a result of COVID-19.
Theatre Network Australia chair Jill Smith said CPA's matched funding would act as an incentive for more donors to come on board, knowing that a donation of $1000 would support two artists instead of one.
"The independent sector has been devastated by the shutdown of the arts due to COVID-19, and a small grant can pay for urgent materials, technology, or just pay a gas bill."
Creative Partnerships Australia chief executive officer Fiona Menzies said the offer to match funds acknowledged the adversity and isolation that artists felt and the impact of the temporary closure of venues and postponement of events were having on livelihoods.
Matched funding was a proven way to attract additional funds from the private sector to the arts, she said.
"It is our hope that this funding will assist to immediately respond to the critical situation facing Australia’s artists, and to help sustain our vibrant creative sector."
Casuals at the Sydney Opera House have been without shifts since the closure of its public spaces in mid-March. These workers were provided with six weeks of income maintenance support up until April 26 when wage-subsidy schemes came into full effect.
"We are calling on the federal government to work with the states on a solution so these hundreds of thousands of workers, also local government, are not left in the cold and forced to go onto social security," a Media and Entertainment Alliance Australia spokesperson said.
"The federal government could fix this by amending the eligibility criteria for JobKeeper, or the states could step into the breach to subsidise the income of public sector employees stood down because of coronavirus."
Art Gallery of NSW confirmed it was not eligible to apply for the JobKeeper payments.
"Our permanent, full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public," a gallery spokesperson said.
"During this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery."
The Opera House's chief executive officer, Louise Herron, said the venue was committed to supporting staff as much as possible.
No full-time, part-time or casual staff had been stood down as a result of the pandemic.
"All casual employees remain important members of the Opera House’s workforce and will be offered shifts when activity resumes," she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian industry need to undertake technological upgradation and import substitution to attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday. 
The minister has been exhorting the industry to capitalise on growing "hatred" against China amid coronavirus pandemic.

Interacting with members of the Ficci Ladies Organization in a webinar, the minister for MSME and Road Transport and Highways said recommendations for "another big package" have been shared with the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, and said he was "hopeful of a declaration soon".
Gadkari also expressed confidence that 25 lakh MSMEs will be restructured by the end of the year. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extended the restructuring of debt schemes beyond the deadline of March 31, 2020, to December 31, 2020. 
Observing that big industries from nations including Japan, the US, Germany and other European nations do not want to deal with China anymore and want to shift their businesses out of the country, the minister termed it a "golden opportunity" for Indian industry and entrepreneurs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Referring to the economic crisis across the world, Gadkari said that it is a golden opportunity for Indian industries and entrepreneurs to explore new businesses and attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China
The central government is likely to announce a relief package for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that have been affected due to the coronavirus lockdown, Union MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Saturday. He said that the financial package is expected to be announced in due course.
"We have sent recommendations for a relief package to the Finance Minister and Prime Minister, and I hope it will be announced soon," Gadkari said while addressing a webinar in New Delhi today.
He urged Indian industries to have a positive attitude and asked them to adopt an integrated approach to overcome the crisis while ensuring the lives and livelihood of people.
Referring to the economic crisis across the world, Gadkari said that it is a golden opportunity for Indian industries and entrepreneurs to explore new businesses. He suggested that Indian Inc must  adopt technological innovation and import substitution to attract investments from global businesses that look to exit China.
Interacting with members of the FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) in a webinar, the minister expressed confidence that 25 lakh MSMEs will be restructured by the end of the year.

Last week, during an interaction with the representatives of Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (ASSOCHAM) on impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs, Gadkari had said that the government was working on a dedicated fund to address delayed payments of MSMEs.
"We have prepared a fund of Rs 1 lakh crore and government will pay for the insurance. We will fix a formula on how to coordinate between all 3 stakeholders - the one who has to receive money, the one who has to pay money, and bank," Gadkari had said. The fund will provide some relief to the MSME sector to tide over the negative impact of novel coronavirus-related disruption in their businesses and revenue losses. The corpus will be a mobile fund that will help increase liquidity in the market, he said.

MSMEs contribute to 29 per cent of GDP in the country and employ over 11 crore people.
On April 17, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did try to ease the liquidity crisis among MSMEs by announcing a targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) of Rs 50,000 crore to help small and medium-sized non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and micro-finance institutions (MFIs).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charities warn funding loss will affect vital services</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Irish charity and voluntary sector has warned it will not be able to provide vital services if funding lost due to Covid-19 restrictions is not replaced.
The sector expects fundraising income to be down at least 40% this year and has asked the Government for an urgent assistance package.
Next weekend hundreds of thousands of people would have been getting out of bed at 4am for the Darkness into Light Walk in aid of Pieta House. The annual event raises over €5 million to help combat mental illness.
Over 60 cyclists would have been preparing to travel to northern Italy for the Irish Hospice Foundation, and countless other fundraising events and challenges would have been in full swing across Ireland.
Instead, everything has stopped. Whether it's the Laura Lynn Children’s Hospice, the Irish Cancer Society, or your local meals on wheels, the charity and voluntary sector is hurting – and it's a vast sector.
"There are 200,000 people working in the sector," says Liz Hughes, CEO of Charities Institute Ireland (CII). "There are nearly 10,000 registered charities and many other community and voluntary organisations."
A recent survey by CII and The Wheel predicts a drop in funding of 40% this year. Some individual charities are bracing for much worse, up to 87%. "It will be in the hundreds of millions," Liz Hughes told RTE’s This Week.
"We are worried," said Kieran Stafford, national president of St Vincent De Paul. "We had to close our 230 retail shops so we lost that income. Our main source of fundraising is our monthly collections at church gates."
With over one million people now on some kind of social welfare income support, Mr Stafford expects to see an increase in requests for help to SVDP.
"People are going to struggle with rents, with their mortgages, their utility bills, and with education costs once kids get back to school."
He predicts a similar fallout to the financial crash of 2008. "Many people who would once have been donors to us were forced to come seeking assistance for the most basic things."
The Irish Hospice Foundation is also trying to meet growing demand, even as funding has collapsed.
"We provide professional end-of-life home care for those with a non-cancer diagnosis," said Helen McVeigh, head of fundraising. "With this crisis, we are seeing a 20-25% increase in demand for our night nurse service."
A number of local hospices have joined under the banner Together for Hospice and they, too, are reporting increased demand since the Covid-19 crisis began.
"Demand is up for our inpatient and home care services, and we also deliver into the acute hospitals," said chairperson Audrey Holohan. "We also support nursing homes, so that is under pressure too."
It's not just the big name charities that are suffering. Local groups such as Clare Cancer Support near Ennis provide a lifeline for patients and families.
"We provide counselling, a breast cancer support group, reflexology, meditation, and we also assist people with travel to and from their hospital appointments," explained Anne Murphy, an oncology nurse with Clare Cancer Support. She said government assistance is needed or these vital services will stop.
"For little centres like ours in rural Ireland, we don't get a huge voice to ask for help because we are not on a national network. We are not out there with media, we don’t have huge money. We are a small group that’s very active in our community in Co Clare."
Despite the crisis, neglected or abused animals still need rescuing and the ISPCA has been busy this weekend. "Our inspectors have been out rescuing a number of equines from very poor circumstances," said Dr Andrew Kelly, CEO of the ISPCA.
Without regular funding, he said the work of his nine inspectors could be in jeopardy. These inspectors are the main enforcers of the Animal Welfare Act. Without regular donations, the future is uncertain.
"We need regular donations coming in to do the job," he told RTÉ's This Week. He said the ISPCA was starting to re-home animals again and still had to respond to calls about suspected cruelty.
"It's the long term we are most worried about," Dr Kelly said, pointing out that the animal charity needs to know how much is coming in, in order to make future plans.
Staff across the charity and voluntary sector are continuing to work on phones and online to maintain vital services, such as addiction and mental health counselling.
The Government leans heavily on all these groups. They are benefiting from the wage subsidy scheme but CII and the Wheel are pushing for an urgent aid package. "We will need this to keep cash flow going," said Liz Hughes.
While fundraisers have stopped, individuals, corporations and private groups have stepped forward. Garden marathons and cycles within 2km have become the norm. Even 90-year old Kathleen Lynch from Blackrock, Co Louth raised thousands for Age Action by dancing on her birthday!
This Tuesday, 5 May, is Giving Tuesday. This is a global response to the Covid-19 crisis and an opportunity to donate what you can to your favourite charity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pieta offers redundancies and all staff salaries have been cut by up to 30%</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MENTAL HEALTH CHARITY Pieta House has said that due to the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic, it has a budget shortfall of around €6.5 million this year.
Pieta provides free therapy to those engaging in self-harm or who have loved ones who died by suicide. The vast majority of the charity’s income is received through fundraisers and donations.
Due to this “significant” deficit, it has introduced cuts across the organisation, including letting workers for the organisation go and implementing a salary cut of up to 30% for all its staff.
“Up to 28 full-time equivalent compulsory redundancies taking place in the area of clinical support. There will also be further reductions in a number of areas through temporary lay-off and non-renewal of contracts,” the organisation said.
“These measures are needed to ensure that the delivery of services to clients can be protected now, and over the long term, when our vital services will continue to be needed.”
A significant amount of funds have been lost due to the postponement of the Darkness into Light event, which was due to take place on 9 May.
Pieta said that it is currently undertaking a number of fundraising campaigns to try to keep up public donations as much as possible. 
All departments in Pieta have been required to cut costs and redundancies have already taken place across the organisation as a result of the Voluntary Severance Scheme that was managed in April. 
“We have not come to these decisions lightly and it is with great regret that compulsory redundancies will also be required as a result of the restructuring of our Clinical Services team,” a statement said.
Pieta CEO Elaine Austin said: “We understand this is a very difficult time for our dedicated staff and we deeply regret having to take this step.
“With the loss of our flagship annual fundraising event, Darkness into Light, we have been left with a very significant funding gap and in order to keep our doors open to clients, we must make these very difficult decisions.
Pieta remains committed to helping vulnerable people who are experiencing suicidal ideation, self-harm or who are bereaved by suicide through our 24/7 crisis helpline

    <h5 class="mb-1">JAMB makes interim remittance of N7b for 2020 to FG</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board(JAMB) says it has made an interim remittance of N3.5billion to the Federal Government consolidated account for the 2020 expected remittance.
A statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by Fabian Benjamin, Head of Media at JAMB explained that the remittance was in  line with Professor Is-haq Oloyede’s avowed commitment to remit wholly, excess funds generated from its operations to the Federal Government.
The remittance was part of the money realised by the examination body from the sales of form for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), direct entry and all forms payment related to the examination.
Benjamin said the Board had earlier made the payment of over N3.5billion to candidates by way of reduction of N1,500 from the cost of each ePIN sold to each candidates as directed by  President Muhammadu Buhari, totaling over N3.5billion and bringing the total remittances this year to over N7billion with the assurance to remit more as soon as its operations are concluded and proper audit of its books done.
Benjamin explained that it has been the intention of the present leadership of the Board to return to federal coffers, whatever is left unutilised from its operational imperatives.
“The immediate benefit of the move manifested in the reduction by President Muhammadu Buhari of the UTME Registration fee payable by candidates from N5000 to N3500 which entails the transfer of over N3billion to candidates and guardians annually via the reduction in the cost of application documents,” he said.
“Before the reduction in the cost of application EPINs, the Board had remitted over N7billion in 2017 and replicated same in subsequent years until the gracious action by the Buhari administration’s unprecedented decision to give back to candidates a percentage of the cost of registration.”
He further stated that the Board would continue to come up with innovations on ways to ensure that candidates are provided with world-class services at modest cost as obtained anywhere in the world.
It would be recalled that the total amount the  JAMB remitted to the Federal Government coffers between 2010 and 2016 was just N 50,752,544.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Summer festival virus cancellations deal blow to local Japan areas</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO — The forced cancellation of major festivals and fireworks events this summer in Japan due to the coronavirus pandemic is frustrating for the host towns and cities that rely on the cultural and financial contribution they make to their local areas.
The pneumonia-causing virus has forced major events that were to be part of Kyoto's Gion Festival to cancel for the first time in 58 years, while the Nebuta Festival in Aomori was called off for the first time in 62 years. Kochi's Yosakoi Festival was also canceled for the first time in its 66-year history.
Ikujiro Kimura, head of the Gion Festival's organizing committee, explained the dilemma his organization faces.
He says people in Kyoto would like to hold the annual Yamahoko float procession as normal, but that the ancient capital cannot afford to run the risk of becoming a coronavirus group infection hot-spot.
The procession, often described as a "moving art gallery," is the highlight of the festival, which is said to date back to the year 869 when a ceremony was held to pray for driving off epidemics.
"It was the most gut-wrenching decision," Kimura said, in reference to the cancellation of the parade, which is held every July 17 and 24 and attracts tens of thousands of tourists each day from Japan and overseas. "Now is supposed to be the time when we should put on a big festival," he said, touching on the festival's origin in wishing for people's good health.
Ryuho Tatsuta, an Aomori resident who manufactures gigantic lantern floats featured in the Nebuta Festival, was similarly pained when the festival in northeastern Japan met the same fate.
"The festival is part of our lives," Tatsuta said. "I cannot imagine our lives without those scenes because people in Aomori say we feel autumn after the festival."
Held every year from Aug 2 to 7, the festival draws about 2.85 million people from Japan and abroad to watch floats, some measuring up to 5 meters in height, parade through the city of Aomori while surrounded by dancers.
Besides local disappointment, cancellations of annual summer events have dealt a blow to businesses involved such as manufacturers of fireworks.
The cancellation of fireworks for the Tenjin Festival in Osaka in July has caused a significant fall in revenue for Gunsmith of Kunitomo Co, a gunpowder manufacturer in Kyoto.
Before Osaka Temmangu Shrine announced the cancellation in mid-April, the company had started producing firework shells for the festival which draws around 1.3 million people every year.
"I know it cannot be helped (due to the coronavirus), but most of our annual revenue is generated in a few months of summer," said Masaki Ueno, a director at Gunsmith of Kunitomo.
Citing cancellation of fireworks for the Ise-Jingu National Dedicatory Fireworks Festival in July in Mie Prefecture, central Japan, and other firework events in Japan, Tomohiro Yamazaki, a director at a fireworks shell manufacturer in Ibaraki Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, said, "Our firework revenues have fallen to nearly zero."
Some of the firework shells will need to be disposed of because they are vulnerable to humidity and the amount of gunpowder a manufacturer can store is regulated by law, according to Yamazaki.
He said the impact of the coronavirus on business will be more significant than what the company suffered after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan and left about 16,000 people dead.
Further disappointment will be felt by residents of Tokyo and neighboring areas who normally attend the annual Sumida River Fireworks Festival in July. Canceled for 2020, the event usually draws around a million spectators to the river that runs through the east and north of the capital.
Referring to the cancellation of the Nebuta Festival, the Aomori prefectural government said it will have a significant impact on the prefecture's economy, most notably in the transport and tourism sectors.
"The number of tourists traveling exclusively for the festival will be zero, and the impact will be serious," said Kenichi Tsubo, a prefectural official for tourism affairs, citing the damage that transport companies, souvenir shops, restaurants and hotel operators will sustain.
Aomori Kokusai Hotel said reservations for its 67 rooms in the festival period have all been canceled.
"It is usually the peak period for our business. It has dealt us a severe blow," a hotel staffer said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ATF price slashed 23%, costs one-third of 'frozen' petrol, diesel rates</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jet fuel (ATF) prices have been slashed by a steep 23 per cent in line with a slump in international oil prices and it now costs about one-third of petrol and diesel whose rates continue to be frozen for the 50th day on Sunday.
Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price has been cut by Rs 6,812.62 per kilolitre, or 23.2 per cent, to Rs 22,544.75 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification by state-owned oil marketing companies.
ATF, which is used as a fuel in aeroplanes, now costs less than one-third of the price of petrol used in cars and two-wheelers. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for Rs 69.59 while jet fuel is priced at Rs 22.54 per litre.
Diesel, used mostly in trucks, buses and tractors, is priced at Rs 62.29 per litre.
In fact, even market priced or non-subsidised kerosene is much cheaper than petrol and diesel after its rates were cut 13.3 per cent to Rs 39,678.47 per kl (Rs 39.67 per litre), according to the notification.
This the steepest cut ever and sixth reduction in ATF prices since February.

Since February, jet fuel prices have been cut by almost two-thirds. ATF price in Delhi before the reduction cycle began in February was Rs 64,323.76 per kl and now costs Rs 22,544.75 per kl.
Similar reduction has been effected in other metro cities as well.
While the oil PSUs have regularly revised ATF prices, they have since March 16 kept petrol and diesel prices on hold ostensibly on account of extreme volatility in the international oil markets.
Petrol and diesel prices were frozen soon after the government raised excise duty on the two fuels by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates.
Oil companies, instead of passing on the excise hike to consumers, decided to adjust them against the reduction required because of the drop in international oil prices. They used the same tool and did not pass on the Re 1 per litre hike required for switching over to ultra-clean BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.
Market analysts, however, said the same volatility was witnessed in ATF prices as well but that has not stopped the oil companies from passing on the cut to airlines.
More importantly, no airline has been operating since mid-March in view of restrictions placed to check the spread of coronavirus, yet oil companies have continued to revise downward jet fuel prices.
In fact, oil companies used to revise ATF prices on the 1st of every month but they on March 21 adopted fortnightly revisions to pass on the benefit of falling international oil prices to the airlines.
Even non-PDS or market priced kerosene cost has seen rate reduction similar to ATF. It was priced at Rs 65,815.47 per kl in January.
Though the government had deregulated petrol and diesel prices, rate changes have been in the past put on hold by public sector oil companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for reasons that appear to be non-commercial.

There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of the Karnataka polls in May 2018 despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 a barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, they rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase -- over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018, petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38.
Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.
These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017, and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states -- Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur -- were held.
During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said. And rates began to rise a day after the final phase of polling for Lok Sabha elections ended.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian bank bad debt could double in coronavirus crisis -sources</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI/NEW DELHI — India expects bad debts at its banks could double after the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a sudden halt, a senior government official and four top bankers told Reuters.
Indian banks are already grappling with 9.35 trillion rupees ($123 billion) of soured loans, which was equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets at the end of September 2019.
“There is a considered view in the government that bank non-performing assets (NPAs) could double to 18-20% by the end of the fiscal year, as 20-25% of outstanding loans face a risk of default,” the official with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A fresh surge in bad debt could hit credit growth and delay India’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
“These are unprecedented times and the way it’s going we can expect banks to report double the amount of NPAs from what we’ve seen in earlier quarters,” the finance head of a top public sector bank told Reuters.
The official and bankers declined to be named as they were not officially authorized to discuss the matter with media.
India’s finance ministry declined to comment, while the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Banks’ Association, the main industry body, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The Indian economy has ground to a standstill amid a 40-day nationwide lockdown to rein in the spread of coronavirus cases.
The lockdown has now been extended by a further two weeks, but the government has begun to ease some restrictions in districts that are relatively unscathed by the virus.
India has so far recorded nearly 40,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,300 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
‘RIDING THE TIGER’
Bankers fear it is unlikely that the economy will fully open up before June or July, and loans, especially those to small- and medium-sized businesses which constitute nearly 20% of overall credit, may be among the worst affected.
This is because all 10 of India’s largest cities fall in high-risk red zones, where restrictions will remain stringent.
A report by Axis Bank said that these red zones, which contribute significantly to India’s economy, account for roughly 83% of the overall loans made by its banks as of December.
One of the sources, an executive director of a public sector bank, said that economic growth had been sluggish and risks had been heightened, even ahead of the coronavirus crisis.
“Now we have this Black Swan event which means without any meaningful government stimulus, the economy will be in tatters for several more quarters,” he said.
McKinsey & Co last month forecast India’s economy could contract by around 20% in the three months through June, if the lockdown was extended to mid-May, and growth in the fiscal year was likely to fall 2% to 3%.
Bankers say the only way to stem the steep rise in bad loans is if the RBI significantly relaxes bad asset recognition rules.
Banks have asked the central bank to allow all loans to be categorized as NPAs only after 180 days, which is double the current 90-day window.
“The lockdown is like riding the tiger, once we get off it we’ll be in a difficult position,” a senior private sector banker told Reuters. (Reporting by Nupur Anand and Manoj Kumar; additional reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alexander Smith)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stocks closed sharply lower Friday in an ugly start to the month of May as investors showed disappointment with earnings from big tech companies and with President Donald Trump’s threat to impose import tariffs on China in retaliation for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.55% fell 622.03 points, or 2.6%, to end at 23,723.69, while the S&P 500 SPX, -2.80% gave up 81.72 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 2,830.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.20% retreated 284.60 points, or 3.2%, closing at 8,604.95. NQ00, -0.18%
After gains Monday through Wednesday that helped the major indexes post their best April in years, losing sessions Thursday and Friday left the benchmarks with losses on the week, with the Dow and S&P losing 0.2% and the Nasdaq ending the week 0.3% lower.
U.S. stocks posted sharp losses as investors reevaluated the corporate earnings picture and the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, after the major benchmarks notched their best monthly performances in years in April.
“After one of the best months in history, it’s not overly surprising to see some profit taking here,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in an interview.
“We started off earnings season on fire — there was a big start to the tech results and last night it was more mixed,” he added. “Markets were pricing in near perfection from the tech giants and now we’re seeing some downward pressure on the market as there’s a bit more realistic view of these results.”
Analysts said it was the guidance — or lack thereof in the case of Apple — that appeared to unsettle investors. Apple reported that profits slipped slightly but sales grew amid the spread of COVID-19, while promising investors billions more in stock repurchases and dividends, but declined to provide an outlook. Shares of Dow component Apple Inc.AAPL, -1.61% closed 1.6% lower Friday.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -7.59%. , the second-largest company by market capitalization in the S&P 500, ended the session down 7.6% after it said late Thursday it topped $75 billion in sales in the first quarter as COVID-19 swept across the globe, but profit declined and the company said it might lose money in the current period as it spends to keep up with demand.
Both Apple and  Amazon are among the companies that led the S&P 500 index’s comeback from the March 23 lows and were two of the best performers in April. Amazon rallied nearly 27% in April while Apple jumped 15%.
The magnitude of the rebound from the market’s March 23 lows also has left valuations at very high levels during a time when the ongoing coronavirus epidemic makes forecasting future corporate profits difficult. The S&P 500 ended Friday with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19.8, well above historical averages, according to FactSet.
Meanwhile, global equities were pressured after President Donald Trump indicated he may consider imposing import tariffs on China.
The Washington Post on Thursday reported that U.S. officials are beginning to explore proposals for punishing China for its handling of the pandemic, including punitive import tariffs, adding to bearish sentiment on Wall Street.
“Supply chains were already in a tough place given the pressure to global growth, the lack of transport of goods around the world, and hearing that there could be even more strains to supply chains in the form of tariffs is rightfully being priced into the market negatively,” Miskin said.
Stocks saw little movement after the Institute for Supply Management said its April manufacturing index came in at 41.5%. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch, on average, had looked for the gauge to plunge to 35% from a 49.1% reading in March. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.
Crude oil prices closed out the week higher, with the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude for June delivery CLM20, -0.45% gaining 94 cents, or 5%, to settle at $19.78 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In precious metals, June gold GCM20, +0.54% rose $6.70, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,700.90 an ounce on Comex.
The yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.615%edged 2 basis points higher to 0.63%.
Many global exchanges were closed Friday in observance of International Workers Day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, -2.84% closed 2.8% lower and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 UKX, -2.34% ended its session down 2.3%.
The U.S. dollar was unchanged relative to a basket of trading partners, according to the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, -0.33% .

    <h5 class="mb-1">Consumers' focus shifts to packaged, high-value food items amid coronavirus lockdown 2.0</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The second phase of the coronavirus lockdown saw a considerable shift in buying patterns of consumers from basic necessities to high-value items like snacks, processed food, packaged meat and frozen desserts, retailers said.
Retailers such as Future Group, Metro and Lots Wholesale said they witnessed a spike in demand for packaged food products like biscuits and noodles, resulting in an increase in the average purchase value per customer.
People also sought critical non-food products such as kitchen appliances, electrical goods, stationery and storage containers at Metro.
"Yes, the second phase witnessed a growing demand for processed food, packaged meat and frozen desserts. People are working from home. Hence, snack items, biscuits and hot beverages are also in demand amongst customers," Metro Cash & Carry India MD and CEO Arvind Mediratta told PTI.
As the restrictions started easing, customers saw they could get easy access to their daily essentials and so panic buying stopped, he added.
"Initially, customers were unsure of what the trickle down effect of the lockdown would be. Consumers started becoming vigilant and began hoarding essential commodities. There was a sense of panic.
"But gradually, everyone was made aware that all essential products will continue to be available and people will not face a shortage. Currently, there is less panic buying and more need base buying," he said.
As most people are working from home, Metro is witnessing enquiries from customers for IT products such as computers, mouse, keyboard, chargers and other accessories.
Future Group President Food & FMCG Kamaldeep Singh said in the first phase people were buying basic necessary items such as atta, pulses and sugar, but in the second phase they focussed more on food items like biscuits, noodles and pasta.
"The definition of basic necessity has changed in couple of weeks from basic foods to snacking and munching items," he said.
According to Singh, people are not willing to travel long distances, hence footfall of large format stores is down but sales of convenience stores like EasyDay have picked up considerably.
Though people are not hoarding goods, they have cravings for snacks and other items as they are staying at home, he said.
"In the second stage, people are buying products which can be cooked at home like pasta, noodles etc. Sales of frozen non-veg and home snacking and processed food have gone up to a large extent, such as French fries, baked items and ready-to-cook meals," he said.
As restaurants are closed, people are cooking many dishes at home, Singh said, adding "the trend in the second phase has shifted from pure basic essentials to instant food and snacking items."
Lots Wholesale Solutions Managing Director Tanit Chearavanont said the demand in the second phase is majorly coming from both the "food and non-food FMCG categories" as compared to commodities which had seen a spike in the initial phase of lockdown. "Overall, the average purchase value per customer has gone up," he said.
"There is a marked difference between consumer behaviour between the first phase and the second phase of lockdown. The first phase of lockdown was fuelled by panic buy resulting in bulk purchase in categories like commodities and FMCG food products. Panic buying continued for an initial 7-10 days of lockdown, slowly giving way to consumer's confidence in the availability of essential goods," he said.
Also, with the summer season kicking in, another category seeing major demand is insecticides, Chearavanont added.
According to value fashion and lifestyle products retailer V-Mart Retail, now consumers are "trusting" their retailers and have faith that goods would remain available.
"Though, we are not operating many stores but have observed a shift in the consumer buying pattern in the second phase of lockdown. Earlier, we had noticed panic buying by the customer, purchasing whatever they can do but now people are assured about availability. That trust has come and now people are purchasing as per their requirement," said V-Mart Retail Chairman and MD Lalit Agarwal.
Meanwhile, several retailers have reported an increase in sales of their private labels, which filled the gaps as supply lines from other manufacturers were disrupted.
Asked whether the trend is likely to continue, Singh said consumers in the lockdown period are brand agnostics. "Right now the consumer is not very brand conscious, he simply wants products," he said.
According to Mediratta, due to the disruption in the supply chain, there were several FMCG companies that were not able to deliver their goods as their production was interrupted, leading to a shortage of branded goods such as instant noodles.
"However, customers were not bothered even if favorite brands were not available and were happy to transition to a private label brand. This gave a lot of boost to private labels whose stocks were available locally and so their supply remained steady without hindrances," he said.
The government first imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown on March 24 to curb the spread of coronavirus infections. On April 14, the lockdown was extended till May 3.
The government has further extended the lockdown till May 17, but with considerable relaxations based on zones.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Strategic brand positioning for SMEs during coronavirus and beyond</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Click to read all about coronavirus →
The Youth Business Network Foundation (YBN) and the Ghana Startups Network on Wednesday commenced a series to engage entrepreneurs and its key stakeholders globally.
Dubbed the Entrepreneurs101 Dialogue, this series seeks to engage, inform and educate entrepreneurs, particularly SMEs across the globe, in this hard times of Covid-19 and beyond.
In his opening remarks, the Executive Director of YBN and the Host of the Dialogue, Solomon Adjei opined that this is the right time to engage the Small and Medium Scale businesses more, to empower and motivate them, while offering them all the necessary support needed for them to be able to sustain their businesses beyond Covid-19.
The maiden edition of the Dialogue, aired on social media, hosted the CEO of BrandE, a branding company, to discuss how SMEs can position themselves and be able to sustain their businesses.
In her presentation, Henrietta Adjetey outlined some key things necessary for every entrepreneur, focusing on branding as adding value and identity to something, of which I will be sharing a few with you.
Branding starts with the individual: who you are, defines how you deliver.
Character is key: be known for the true person you are. Deliver on your promises, and always honor your words, irrespective.
Appearance matters: how you dress and present yourself has a way of attracting suitable customers.
Customer Service matters: How you treat your customers ensure your brand is sustained.
Choose a brand name carefully, considering the MSR rule – Mention, Spell and Remember. Is the name you are choosing easy to be Mentioned?
Can it be Spelt easily, and most importantly, can people Remember it?
Always try to avoid ambiguity and confusion with your brand name. For instance, you might have to consider using the word “Food” instead of “Fuuud”. Though same pronunciation, the latter is seeming to pose confusing challenge.
Always think global when deciding on business names. For instance, using a name such as “Esi Breakfasts”, will definitely limit your options to expand and provide lunch or dinner services later on. Again, using names such as “CrownPower Ghana (or Gh)” have a way of limiting your reach to offer certain services beyond Ghana when an opportunity arises. So why don’t you avoid such names now and save the cost of a possible rebranding in the near future?
On brand positioning: Get a simple but catchy logo, business cards, website, social media accounts, brochures, flyers among other logistics needed to make your brand known.
Tag lines: your taglines assure your potential clients of your offer. When you use “Delivery with speed” as your tagline, ensure you don’t deliver late, and be sure to communicate to your clients in case of any incident that might cause delay.
Have Foresight: always think ahead and add new knowledge.
Sell: always remember to sell, irrespective, because people buy every day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sebi directs mutual funds to share data on holdings in unlisted bonds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In order to meet redemption pressure, fund managers are struggling to either sell or pledge top-rated liquid papers to raise money
Market regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has directed mutual funds (MFs) to disclose data of all holdings in unlisted bonds - securities that cannot be traded in a frozen bond market. The move comes a week after one of the country's oldest asset management companies (AMC), Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, voluntarily decided to close its six debt schemes effective from April 23, 2020. The AMC had cited redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in bond markets for the shutting of schemes.
In order to meet redemption pressure, fund managers are struggling to either sell or pledge top-rated liquid papers to raise money.
Sebi has asked the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) to furnish details - such as the assets under management of schemes holding unlisted non-convertible debentures (NCDs), unlisted bonds these have pumped in money and the share of such bonds in the scheme.
Will RBI's Rs 50,000 crore boost for mutual funds allay investors' fears?
The mutual fund body has also been asked to disclose investment break-up of portfolio of schemes holding unlisted NCDs, according to a report in The Economic Times. Funds have to give the details of residual maturities of all bonds (listed and unlisted) in each such scheme and whether an issuer holds other listed securities such as stocks, bonds, or CPs.
In 2019, Sebi asked MFs to reduce their investment limit in unlisted NCDs to 15% by March 31, 2020, and 10% by June 30, 2020.
However, considering a rise in bond yields, SEBI earlier this week eased the deadline by six months for MFs to comply with the cap on investments in unlisted NCDs. Unlisted NCDs have been facing a shortage of liquidity during the past few months as MFs were not allowed to invest in such securities (as well as unlisted commercial papers) since October 1, 2019.
The worth of unlisted papers in six schemes that were closed by Franklin Templeton was 32% as of April 22, 2020.
"Not all listed bonds are liquid, particularly in the current market. Probably SEBI is trying to assess the risk in the system and stress it could have if redemptions continue," said an industry person. "There are mid-sized companies, including NBFCs, which do not list their NCDs. In unlisted papers, the terms and conditions may not be readily available," said the person.
Sebi had asked  MFs to share details by Friday evening. "It's a bank holiday, exchanges are shut. We were not expecting any email from Sebi asking for data. The regulator has not said why it needs the information," a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Amid coronavirus crisis, funds are facing redemption pressure which is denoted by a rise in bond yields.
Many funds have sought a month-long loan line from banks - in place of the intra-day overdrafts they use in normal situations to meet the temporary cash-flow mismatch.

On April 30, RBI decided to extend the regulatory benefits announced under the Standing Liquidity Facility-Mutual Fund (SLF-MF) scheme to all banks. To claim regulatory benefits, the banks would be required to submit a weekly statement on loans and advances extended to eligible entities.
The decision came merely three days after the RBI on April 27 announced a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity facility to ease pressure on mutual funds, which are facing liquidity crisis amid heightened volatility in capital markets in reaction to COVID-19 outbreak.
This liquidity facility is available till May 11, 2020, or up to utilisation of the allocated amount, whichever is earlier. "When a scheme borrows, the interest cost to the extent of average portfolio yield is borne by the scheme. Most borrowings are at higher than portfolio yields and the spillover is borne by the AMC," a fund manager told ET.
MF schemes are allowed to borrow up to 20% of the assets under management.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sebi asks funds to give info on holdings in all unlisted bonds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mumbai: The Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked mutual funds (MFs) to share information of all holdings in unlisted bonds — securities which have become untradeable in a frozen bond market where fund managers, grappling with redemption pressure, are struggling to either sell or pledge top-rated liquid papers to raise money.
The capital market regulator has asked the fund industry body to give details — such as the assets under management of schemes holding unlisted non-convertible debentures (NCDs), the various unlisted bonds these have invested in, and the share of such bonds in the scheme.
Last year, MFs were told to lower their investment limit in unlisted NCDs to 15% by March 31, 2020 and 10% by June 30, 2020. However, faced with a risk-averse market and surging bond yields, Sebi, earlier this week, extended the deadline by six months for MFs to comply with the cap on investments in unlisted NCDs. The liquidity in unlisted NCDs have come down over the past few months as MFs were restricted from investing in such securities (as well as unlisted commercial papers) since October 1, 2019.
The value of unlisted papers in the six schemes that were recently shut down by the top asset manager Franklin Templeton was 32% as on April 22, 2020.
In its communication to the Association of Mutual Funds in India, Sebi has also asked for investment break-up of portfolio of schemes holding unlisted NCDs. For each such scheme, funds have to give the residual maturities of all bonds (listed and unlisted) and whether an issuer has other listed securities like stocks, bonds or CPs.
“Not that all listed bonds are liquid, particularly in the current market. Probably, Sebi is trying to assess the risk in the system and stress it could have if redemptions continue,” said an industry person. “There are mid-sized companies, including NBFCs, which do not list their NCDs. In unlisted papers, the terms and conditions may not be readily available,” said the person.
The fund houses were told to share the data by Friday evening. “It’s a bank holiday, exchanges are shut. We were not expecting any email from Sebi asking for data.The regulator has not said why it needs the information,” said a source.
According to market circles, funds are dealing with redemption and this is reflected in the rise in bond yields. Many funds have approached banks for a month-long loan lines – instead of the intra-day overdrafts they typically draw in normal times to tide of temporary cash-flow mismatch. “When a scheme borrows, the interest cost to the extent of average portfolio yield is borne by the scheme. Most borrowings are at higher than portfolio yields and the spillover is borne by the AMC,” said a fund manager. Rules allow an MF scheme to borrow up to 20% of the assets under management.

Sebi has imposed a total penalty of Rs 1.05 crore on 21 entities for executing fraudulent trading in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd.
The regulator had conducted an investigation in the scrip of Jolly Plastic Industries Ltd between February 2012 and November 2014.
During the probe, it was found that these entities were connected and indulged in manipulating the price of the scrip downwards through a complex web of accumulating and distributing shares in the off-market.
Thereafter, executing market transactions among themselves at lower circuit filters price to bring down the price to facilitate certain entities to acquire shares at a lower price for various manipulative purposes.
Besides, they contributed to negative LTP (last trading price) by executing trades at lower circuit price every day.
The entities by trading amongst themselves below the LTP in the scrip manipulated and created a misleading appearance of trading in the scrip by such trade, the regulator noted.
Hence, the entities by indulging in fraudulent trade practices have violated the provisions of the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations.
The regulator has levied a fine of Rs 5 lakh each on 21 entities -- Aavia Buildtech, Aavia Softech, Accurate Buildwell, Aglow Financial Services, Anchal Goel, Ashok Kumar Jain HUF, Ashvin Verma, Bluechip Fincap Serve, Capital Securities, Century Buildmart, Lalit Mohan Gupta, Laxmikant Gaggar, Kanchan Bastimal Jain, Mould Trading, Ocean Share Brokers, Poonam Mittal, Ram Kumar Goyal, Steady Capital Advisory Services, Sure Portfolio Services, Surya Medi Tech, and Usha Jaiswal.

Separately, the regulator has imposed a penalty totalling Rs 15 lakh on auditor M V Damania & Co (currently known as DNV & Co) and its partner Bharat Jain for wrongly certifying that Paramount Printpackaging utilised the IPO proceeds as per the objects of the issue.
They indulged in fraudulent trade practice by publishing such information that is not true and indulged in misleading advertisement as well as planted misleading news.
By doing so, they have violated the provisions of PFUTP norms.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Protests see sale of .org suffix to investment firm shelved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The proposed 1.1 billion dollar (£880 million) sale of the dot-org online registry to an investment firm has been shelved following widespread opposition.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) board voted not to allow the sale to Ethos Capital of the website suffix that is widely used by non-profits and community groups.
Activists, politicians and hundreds of organisations had protested that costs for non-profits would rise and freedom of expression would be at risk if a for-profit company were in charge of dot-org, one of the original domains created in the 1980s.
Vetoing the sale is “reasonable, and the right thing to do,” said ICANN’s chairman Maarten Botterman in a blog post.

He also expressed concern over what the debt involved in the transaction would mean for those dot-org users, which include public radio broadcaster NPR, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and medical humanitarian group Doctors without Borders.
Ethos Capital and the Internet Society, the nonprofit founded by many of the internet’s early engineers and scientists that currently runs the registry, had said concerns were misplaced.
The investment firm said in a statement that the decision “will suffocate innovation and deter future investment in the domain industry” and that it is evaluating its options.
The Internet Society said it is disappointed “that ICANN has acted as a regulatory body it was never meant to be”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sale of internet's dot-org suffix nixed after protests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — After widespread opposition, the organization overseeing internet domain names has voted against the $1.1 billion sale of the dot-org online registry to an investment firm.
The board of the Los Angeles-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers voted not to allow the sale to Ethos Capital of the website suffix that is widely used by non-profits and community groups.
Activists, politicians and hundreds of organizations had protested that costs for non-profits would rise and freedom of expression would be at risk if a for-profit company were in charge of dot-org, one of the original domains created in the mid-1980s.
Vetoing the sale is “reasonable, and the right thing to do,” said ICANN's chair, Maarten Botterman, in a blog post .
Botterman noted the “fundamental public interest nature” of the organization that currently oversees dot-org. That would have been transferred to one “bound to serve the interests of its corporate stakeholders” had the sale gone through, he said.
He also expressed concern over what the debt involved in the transaction would mean for those dot-org users, which include public radio broadcaster NPR, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and medical humanitarian group Doctors without Borders.
Ethos Capital and the Internet Society, the nonprofit founded by many of the internet’s early engineers and scientists that currently runs the registry, had said concerns were misplaced. Ethos had offered concessions including capping price hikes.
The investment firm said in a statement that the decision “will suffocate innovation and deter future investment in the domain industry” and that it is evaluating its options. The Internet Society said it is disappointed “that ICANN has acted as a regulatory body it was never meant to be.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gov't to set guidelines on economic restart on Monday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO — A set of guidelines on how to restart economic activities amid the coronavirus epidemic for certain areas of the country will be made public next week around the time an extension of the current nationwide state of emergency will be decided, a Japanese minister said Saturday.
The guidelines will cover areas other than the 13 prefectures that have already been singled out by the government for stepped-up measures against the virus. The 13 are Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ibaraki, Ishikawa, Gifu, Aichi and Kyoto.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday he will make a final decision Monday on extension of the state of emergency by about a month, following recommendations by a government panel to keep the restrictions in place for a while.
The initial state of emergency was declared on Tokyo, Osaka and five other prefectures on April 7, after which it was expanded on April 16 to cover the rest of the country. The declaration has resulted in business suspensions, and the government has been pushing for a reduction in person-to-person contact and more teleworking.
Economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of issues related to the state of emergency, spoke about the guidelines during a Saturday teleconference with Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike and Osaka Gov Hirofumi Yoshimura.
In a press conference afterward, Nishimura said, "We have to do it for the long stretch," referring to efforts to curb the spread of the pneumonia-causing virus.
At the same time, he said reopening economic activities in stages is possible, if the new cases of coronavirus infections are few and there are no problems in the regional health care systems.
According to a draft obtained by Kyodo News on the government's basic policy on the virus, while the use of facilities in the 13 prefectures will remain in place, restrictions for the other areas with few infection cases will be eased based on the situation on the ground. It will likely lead some shops to resume operations.
The draft on the policy, which will be revised Monday, also says classes will resume in phases, taking into account the situation of infections in the regions.
Meanwhile, the government will continue asking the public to avoid closed spaces, crowded places and close contact with others, and ask people not to go out of their prefectures, according to the draft.
Nishimura also urged the various sectors to take the initiative to create their own guidelines based on the government's basic ones.
Also on Saturday, the Osaka prefectural government decided at a coronavirus countermeasures task force meeting that it will decide on whether requests for business suspensions and calls to refrain from going out could be eased, based on the number of virus infections in the prefecture as of May 15.
On Friday, Yoshimura said he intends to create his prefecture's own guidelines that could help businesses to restart.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Japan to release plans on Monday for restarting economy hit by Covid-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Japan will release details on Monday of its plan to restart economic activity hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said Saturday.
The 34 prefectures that aren’t designated as “special alert” will see a partial easing of restriction requests once the spread of the virus comes under better control, Nishimura said in a video conference with the governors of Tokyo and Osaka. The 13 prefectures that do have that status can expect a more concrete explanation on Monday, he said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said yesterday he is leaning toward extending the country’s national virus emergency into June with a final decision on any such move likely on Monday. Japan has 14,305 confirmed coronavirus cases and 455 deaths from the disease, far below levels seen in the US and parts of Europe.
The country’s state of emergency, which enables regional governors to instruct businesses to close down and ask people to stay at home as far as possible, was initially set to end May 6.

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura asked Nishimura for the national government to swiftly put support measures into law, including assistance for businesses’ rent payments. They also asked that regional administrations be given more power to seek cooperation on responding to the pandemic.
Nishimura said Saturday that the government has begun the process for getting special approval for the antiviral drug Remdesivir. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said in a separate briefing that related ordinances are being revised as part of this process.
“I’ve given orders so that the environment is there to enable the drug to be approved in around a week’s time,” Kato told reporters.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla Stock Nosedives After Elon Musk's Twitter Meltdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Generally speaking, and with all due respect, automotive CEOs don't tend to be all that interesting. Ford's Jim Hackett and GM's Mary Barra are about as controversial as white bread, their every word vetted by teams of PR professionals to avoid any potential missteps - like, say, the sort of comments that attract lawsuits from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But if there's one US auto exec who consistently manages to deliver tremendous entertainment value, it's Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and this past week, shortly after delivering a report on the EV manufacturer's Q1 financials, the 48-year-old billionaire appeared to have a full on Twitter meltdown in full view of everyone - one that sent his company's stock tumbling by more than ten percent.
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737
Tesla
Here's what happened: at just after 11 am on Friday, completely unprompted, Musk tweeted that he was "selling almost all physical possessions," and "[w]ill own no house." He followed up with the one stipulation: that late actor Gene Wilder's old house, which Musk owns, "cannot be torn down or lose any its [sic] soul."
It only got more bizarre from there, as Musk tweeted: "My gf @Grimezsz is mad at me." He also found the time to fire off a tweet simply reading "Tesla stock price is too high imo," which prompted a sell-off from investors and caused Tesla's share value to plummet ten percent, to $701.32 at market close.
So what, exactly, is going on here? Is Musk's girlfriend, 32-year-old recording artist Grimes, "mad" at him for pledging to rid himself of his houses and other earthly possessions? Or is she upset with something else - like his recent railing against US stay-at-home orders - and his newfound unmaterialism is an attempt to get back in her good graces?
Or, as many have speculated, has the Tesla CEO's Twitter simply been hacked?
We don't care to guess. But it's worth noting that Musk's comments come just after Tesla, carried mostly by Model 3 deliveries, posted a surprise profit for the first quarter - albeit a modest one due to the global coronavirus pandemic. The company reported a gross profit margin of 25.5 percent across the lineup, even including a small margin on the brand new Tesla Model Y, whose production ramp-up was interrupted by the US health emergency.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla stock crashes after Musk tweets price too high</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk's Twitter account is rapidly turning into his shareholders' worst nightmare. 
The $131-billion electric carmaker's stock dived as much as 12 per cent on Friday after the eccentric founder's Twitter handle exploded into a flood of random tweets. 
It began with a statement that would be unthinkable for a CEO of any publicly listed company to utter. 
"Tesla stock price is too high (in my opinion)," Musk's official handle tweeted. 
And then it went on -- "Now give people back their FREEDOM"; verses from the US national anthem; and a line from Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' famous work: 'Do not go gentle into that good night'. 
Later tweets also claimed that Musk would be selling "almost all" physical possessions and would "own no house". 
Neither Tesla nor Musk have clarified or commented on the tweets since they were posted so far. 
While the tweets were random and jumped from topic to topic, the post about Tesla's stock price being overvalued had immediate monetary consequences for Tesla shareholders. The scrip was trading lower by 9 per cent on the NASDAQ as of 11 pm IST. 
This is not the first time Musk's Twitter account has resulted in financial consequences for both the company he heads and its shareholders. 
Tesla had got into trouble with the US Securities Exchange Commission after he tweeted in August 2018 that he would take Tesla private if stock prices hit $420 per share. The tweet resulted in the scrip soaring and breaking several upper circuits before Tesla officially said that there was no such plan in place. 
The investigation by the SEC that followed resulted in an agreement between Musk and the market regulator. 
Under this deal, Musk had agreed to submit any public statements -- such as tweets -- on Tesla financials and related topics for vetting by legal counsel before publication. It is unclear whether Friday's tweets were cleared as per the stipulations of the agreement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost 23 million US jobs were created in the last decade. In a single month, they were all but wiped out.
The US labour department’s April employment report will further detail the swift and extensive toll of government efforts to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists calls for an eye-popping 21 million plunge in payrolls, the most in records back to 1939. That’s about 10 times the previous record decline in September 1945, when the nation demobilized with the end of World War II.
The US unemployment rate is projected to surge to more than 16 per cent, the highest in monthly data back to 1948.
The April jobs report will provide a fuller picture of the labour market impact after nationwide shutdowns aimed at limited the spread of the coronavirus. In March, employment slumped by 701,000 and the jobless rate climbed to 4.4 per cent, the highest since August 2017. It was just in February that the unemployment rate matched the lowest level since 1969.
Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims data have been abysmal. In the six weeks ended April 25, more than 30 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits.

In the UK, with the government trying to figure out how to ease the lockdown, the Bank of England will decide whether the emergency measures it has taken so far are enough for the time being to sustain the economy. In a rare move reflecting the magnitude of the crisis, officials will release their monetary policy and financial stability reports on the same day, giving insight into their outlook for the economic and assessments of the state of the banking system.
The European Central Bank faces a legal hurdle on Tuesday when Germany’s constitutional court publishes its verdict on whether the ECB’s QE program is compatible with the country’s law. An adverse ruling, or one which imposes strict limits on purchases, could spark turmoil in markets, potentially undermining the institution’s fight to help the economy weather the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Commission will be the latest institution to give its official view of the virus impact on the bloc’s economy. The forecasts for individual countries matter because they will form part of the basis on which aid will be granted to different EU states to support their recovery.
Hungary’s central bank will make its first government purchases as part of its QE program on Tuesday, while two days later, Czech policy makers are expected to lower interest rates again.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unimaginable U.S. Jobs Report Takes Center Stage: Eco Week Ahead</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Almost 23 million U.S. jobs were created in the last decade. In a single month, they were all but wiped out.
The Labor Department’s April employment report will further detail the swift and extensive toll of government efforts to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists calls for an eye-popping 21 million plunge in payrolls, the most in records back to 1939. That’s about 10 times the previous record decline in September 1945, when the nation demobilized with the end of World War II.
The U.S. unemployment rate is projected to surge to more than 16%, the highest in monthly data back to 1948.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say…
“The unlocking of the economy has started to varying degrees in different parts of the country, but the hemorrhaging of jobs will persist for at least a few more months, pushing unemployment toward 20% and in turn stifling prospects of a vigorous recovery.”

Data out of Europe will focus on industrial production, and Canada will also issue figures on the damage done to its labor market. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia, Norway’s Norges Bank and the Bank of England will set policy, with the latter releasing both its latest economic forecasts and financial stability assessment.
Click here for what happened last week and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the world economy.
U.S. and Canada
The April jobs report will provide a fuller picture of the labor-market impact after nationwide shutdowns aimed at limited the spread of the coronavirus. In March, employment slumped by 701,000 and the jobless rate climbed to 4.4%, the highest since August 2017. It was just in February that the unemployment rate matched the lowest level since 1969.
Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims data have been abysmal. In the six weeks ended April 25, more than 30 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits.
A handful of Federal Reserve speakers including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard are scheduled to comment on the economy.
Also on Friday, Statistics Canada will issue its April jobs report. In March, employment fell a record 1.01 million and the unemployment rate rose to 7.8%.

Europe, Middle East and Africa
In the U.K., with the government trying to figure out how to ease the lockdown, the BOE will decide whether the emergency measures it has taken so far are enough for the time being to sustain the economy. In a rare move reflecting the magnitude of the crisis, officials will release their monetary policy and financial stability reports on the same day, giving insight into their outlook for the economic and assessments of the state of the banking system.

The European Central Bank faces a legal hurdle on Tuesday when Germany’s constitutional court publishes its verdict on whether the ECB’s QE program is compatible with the country’s law. An adverse ruling, or one which imposes strict limits on purchases, could spark turmoil in markets, potentially undermining the institution’s fight to help the economy weather the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Commission will be the latest institution to give its official view of the virus impact on the bloc’s economy. The forecasts for individual countries matter because they will form part of the basis on which aid will be granted to different EU states to support their recovery.
Hungary’s central bank will make its first government purchases as part of its QE program on Tuesday, while two days later, Czech policy makers are expected to lower interest rates again. Policy makers in Norway also set rates on Thursday, while Russia’s central bank governor gives a briefing on Friday, amid one of the world’s fastest-growing virus outbreaks and surveys suggesting that the economy may contract by almost 10% in the second quarter.
Turkey may report on Monday that inflation slowed to 10.7% in April after Central Bank Governor Murat Uysal lowered his year-end forecast to 7.4% — a move that may hint at further interest-rate cuts. Countries across Africa and the Middle East will also release purchasing managers index data throughout the week, giving an indication of the extent of the deterioration in market conditions due to coronavirus lockdowns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Fed Doesn't Believe In A V-Shaped Recovery And Neither Should You</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
The FOMC met this week for its first Fed funds interest rate decision since the two emergency cuts in March. As expected, the policy rate was left unchanged at 0% with the markets focusing more on the various relief measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic and now looking ahead towards the economic rebound.
Indeed, judging by the market action over the past month, financial conditions have at least stabilized with asset prices rallying significantly from the lows in March. That being said, the policy statement included some of the darkest languages you'll ever see from a central bank citing the coronavirus outbreak as causing "tremendous human and economic hardship and inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses." Comments made during the press conference by Chairman Powell made it clear that the Fed expects a long road to recovery with considerable risks. We argue that this outlook is deeply bearish for stocks with risks tilted to the downside.
(Virtual press conference)
This Won't Be a V-Shaped Recovery
There was an interesting exchange during the press conference with Powell responding to questions from Heather Long with the Washington Post. The reporter pointed to a comment in the Fed statement mentioning "medium-term risks to the pandemic", noting that it sounds like the Fed expects a long recovery.
Powell explained that the medium-term here refers to the "next year or so" and added some color to the risks it sees to the outlook over this period. The response to this question from the video replay begins at the 16-minute mark. To summarize, the Fed sees the following challenges and risks to the outlook including:
Don't Underestimate COVID-19
We think the comments here are important as it may have poured some cold water on the broader enthusiasm financial markets have been exhibiting in recent weeks. In our view, Powell and the Fed do not expect a "V-shaped" recovery and see longer-lasting disruptions to economic activity through 2021 as the base case.
We'll break down each part of Powell's response based on our transcription.
Our take here is that the market has underestimated COVID-19 since the earliest headlines back in January and the outbreak in China which continues to defy expectations. In February, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow famously said the virus was "contained" and pretty close to "airtight". That turned out to not be the case.
In early April, markets rallied as the estimates for cumulative deaths in the U.S. through August were revised down to around 60k from a prior 100k to 200k based on the leading IHME model, regarded as evidence that social distancing measures were working.
Unfortunately, through April the U.S. death toll has already reached the 64k figure with the original target of 100k likely back on track. Even as data shows new cases are slowing consistent with guidelines to begin reopening the economy, the concern here is that relaxing restrictions may reignite a new outbreak. The official death toll continues to be alarming with 2,201 on April 30th.
(Source: Worldometers.info)
The big headline this week was some positive trial data from Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 patients that may be able to shorten recovery time in seriously ill patients. It was also reported that the FDA is set to allow an emergency use exemption for the drug.
While we're all hoping for the best outcome here, keep in mind that it's still unclear how effective the treatment is. We argue that even it turns out remdesivir can indeed save lives and reduce the mortalities by a certain percentage, it does not eliminate the risk or solve the public health crisis.
Beyond remdesivir, a combination of other drugs that can reduce deaths by any amount would be a breakthrough. Still, we argue this may not be enough to restore consumer spending behaviors which is crucial for maximum productivity. The result is that the longer the disruptions last, the more pressure it adds to economic activity and financial conditions. Regardless of how the next couple of months play out, we believe the damage has already been done and will last even after the virus has been contained.
Structural Unemployment
The next risk that Powell brings up is labor market dynamics. While he avoided estimating a peak unemployment rate, it's likely to head into the double digits during Q2. From the press conference:
Powell points to the potential damage to the "productive capacity of the economy". What Powell is referring to here is the risk of structural unemployment, which is based on companies reorganizing following a major change. This is more serious than just temporary layoffs as it can keep out many workers who previously had jobs but are no longer needed once businesses are adapted to the new realities in a post-COVID-19 world.
The understanding is that many furloughed workers in service industry jobs like restaurants and hospitality will eventually be brought back when those businesses can reopen. The risk, however, is that not all those jobs will come back, and people will be unemployed for longer. Jobs in other industries are at risk too.
A business may find they need to reopen with fewer employees to remain profitable. Companies will also face uncertainties related to trends in demand and be hesitant to add new hires or expand operations. A negative feedback loop in the economy between unemployment, consumer spending, investment sentiment can spread to various sectors. Unemployed or under-employed people simply have less discretionary spending power which ultimately leads to lower corporate revenues, earnings, and investment capacity in the economy. This is bearish for all companies.
The other problem that can pressure long-term unemployment is the threat of small- and medium-sized businesses closing permanently. Much of the efforts of the relief efforts right now on the fiscal side are based on liquidity or loans for payroll protection. It also came up in the press conference that these measures may not reach the companies most in need as they may not be able to repay the loans or have larger liabilities. The Fed sees the potential for a wave of defaults as a real possibility. From Powell's comments:
The key phrase for us in this quote is "not perfectly" in regards to policies that can be used to address the stress environment. This means that the Fed expects there to be leakages or companies falling through the cracks. Again, going back to our original point, the consequences here appear to go beyond just the public health crisis and will linger through 2021.
We sense that some investors are losing track of the bigger macro picture. The reality here is that the economic collapse is just as bad or worse in most other regions of the world that have resorted to the same lockdown measures in their effort to stop the coronavirus. Powell sees weak global economic conditions as also pressuring the U.S. economy.
In regards to economic conditions in foreign economies, there is little the Fed can do. In contrast to the U.S. with the government and Fed moving quickly with relief efforts, the reality is that most other countries cannot afford such measures. This means the crisis will be worse in other parts of the world and this has major implications for corporate earnings as a bearish trend.
Data suggests that an average company in the S&P 500 has over 40% of revenues coming from international markets. Some sectors like Technology and Consumer Staples are even more exposed to foreign countries. The International Monetary Fund, "IMF," is forecasting a global recession of 3% this year and only a "partial recovery" in 2021. Even giving the recovery in the U.S. a benefit of the doubt, companies will still be challenged by weaker trends in international markets.
(source: FactSet)
The Next Move Is Lower
We believe that we are entering a new phase in the market cycle and the next major move is lower. There is too much complacency regarding the long-lasting economic implications separate from the public health crisis. While the initial sell-off in March included a level of panic and extreme market volatility based on the uncertainty regarding the pandemic, we think the market can now focus on cyclical headwinds and implications to valuation.
A real "V-shaped" recovery in the economy implies only transitory or temporary impacts that can be brushed aside for a quick rebound. If we accept that the underlying fundamental strengths of the U.S. and global economy have been materially damaged, the long-term growth trajectory of companies needs to be discounted. Equities should now be less valuable compared to where the market was at the beginning of the year.
The S&P 500 (SPY), NASDAQ 100 (QQQ), and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 (IWM) have each gained 29%, 27%, and 30% off their lows in March, respectively. Incredibly, over six months, QQQ is up 10%. SPY has seen only a moderate decline of 4% since November even as small caps have lagged.
The dynamic has been an outperformance among the mega-cap tech leaders like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) which have large weightings in the major indexes. These five stocks together represent 22% of the S&P 500 and 48% of the NASDAQ 100 and are each up over the past six months with a significant 32% gain in AMZN and 25% by MSFT.
We bring this group up because we think the mega-cap market leaders can drive the market lower going forward. This group carries extreme market optimism and exuberance which have led to lofty valuations. At current levels, these stocks may already be pricing in a best-case scenario for the "medium-term". Each of the big 5 stocks has at least a 20% downside in our view.
No company is immune to a recession. When you hear discussions regarding the recovery in 2021, it's obvious that comparables and growth rates will appear amazing on a year-over-year basis considering the current low base. It will be more relevant to consider trends on a stacked two-year basis compared to 2019 which may have represented a "peak" for the economy and corporate operating measures. We expect measures like same-store sales and organic growth to be down in 2021 compared to 2019. Companies will struggle to reclaim the dynamic momentum observed in previous years.
We are particularly bearish on consumer staples which may have seen a temporary windfall from early-stage consumer buying trends during the pandemic. As a group, staples became a defensive trade, but we don't see a reason for that momentum to continue. Companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), General Mills (NYSE:GIS), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) are trading near their all-time highs, but we expect to have a weaker outlook from here.
Watch the VIX
We're looking at S&P 500 at 2,600 as a near-term downside target. Our message here is that the March low at 2,191 and 25% lower from the current level is still in play over the next year. The VIX peaked at a level of 85 in mid-March and has since declined to a more moderate 35 level which is still consistent with a high-risk environment.
Many investors may point to the currently declining VIX as evidence the worst is over and we can only rebound from here. We don't believe that to be the case and highlight the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 as an example where the market continued lower many months after the VIX peaked. Indeed, the VIX peaked at 89.5 on October 24, 2008, while the S&P would subsequently fall another 33% to its low on March 9th, 2009. On that day the VIX closed at 50.
The point here is that we expect renewed volatility, but that doesn't mean we need to or will see more "13% limit down days" like what occurred in March. In our view, the next stage of this bear market will be based on a realization that the consensus "recovery" is not materializing as expected. The market will need to discount valuations to reflect the deeper structural cyclical pressures that are set to impact all sectors of the economy.
What to Trade
We are recommending investors reduce equity risk exposure and increase allocation to fixed-income, favoring low-duration bond funds. The worst thing investors can do is chase momentum in stocks at their all-time high in this environment. This is the time to trim winners and rebalance your portfolio. We are overweight materials, energy, and commodity names. These sectors have already been beaten down and present more compelling valuations. That's also the case with EM stocks that have underperformed and may have priced in a worst-case scenario. Despite some recent volatility, we are also very bullish on gold and precious metals miners.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why you should hold on to Axis Bank till Covid-19 impact blows over</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid the Covid-19-caused disruption in businesses and the market mayhem, it has been a rough ride for investors so far in 2020.
With uncertainty persisting in corporate earnings, investors could face more pain ahead in the coming months.
Axis Bank’s commentary post its March quarter results is indicative of the challenging times ahead for the banking sector.
The management stated that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis and the financial impact could be high across sectors. Therefore, in a bid to be conservative and prudent, Axis Bank made large Covid-19-related provisions during the March quarter, which led to the bank reporting losses for the January-March period.
The key takeaway for investors from the bank’s March quarter results is that, aside from loan growth faltering in the coming months, stress is likely to build up, weighing on earnings.
The Covid-19-induced slowdown would delay the normalisation of the bank’s stressed book and could lead to further downgrades into the BB and below-rated book this fiscal.
On the positive side, the bank has significantly ramped up its provision cover and sported a healthy capital adequacy ratio, which can help it tide over the increased stress in the coming quarters.
At the current price, the stock is trading at 1.5 times price-to-book, much below the 2.7 times it traded a year ago. While the stock has lost about 41 per cent so far this year and is trading at attractive levels, near-term risks to earnings estimates persist, owing to slowdown in loan growth, lower fee income, higher slippages and provisioning in the coming quarters. Hence, investors can continue to hold the stock and wait for more clarity around the Covid-19 situation before accumulating the stock.
Also ReadAxis Bank: Healthy core performance, but Covid related provisions weigh on earnings
 
Based on an internal stress-testing exercise, the bank has made large provisions related to Covid-19 during the March quarter. From ₹3,471 crore in the December quarter, total provisions more than doubled to ₹7,730 crore in the March quarter. Of the ₹7,730 crore of provisions made, ₹1,338 crore pertains to standard assets, which include RBI-mandated 10 per cent provision on overdue loans where moratorium is granted. Another ₹2,116 crore of provisions include additional provision for Covid-19. In effect, Axis Bank made ₹3,000 crore provisions related to Covid-19 during the March quarter. This, along with additional ₹4,200 crore of bad loan provisions, resulted in the bank reporting a ₹1,388-crore loss during the March quarter.
However, the bank making huge provisions is a prudent move and will provide some buffer if credit quality across corporate firms worsens. The bank’s provision cover has increased substantially to 69 per cent in the March quarter from 60 per cent in the December quarter.
That said, provisioning could continue to move up in the coming quarters.
Much before the Covid-19 caused disruption, asset quality for Axis Bank had been under pressure, owing to its relatively high exposure to stressed sectors. Since the March 2019 quarter, slippages for the bank have been steadily rising. In the previous December quarter, slippages had spiked to ₹ 6,214 crore.
While in the latest March quarter slippages have fallen to ₹3,920 crore, in the absence of the moratorium, slippages could have been higher by ₹691 crore.
A better picture on the overall asset quality can be ascertained only after the three-month moratorium is lifted in June. As of March 2020, the bank’s GNPA ratio stood at 4.86 per cent.
A sizeable portion of loans falling under the moratorium and a notable stressed book (BB and below-rated book) warrant a close watch in the coming quarters. The management stated that as on April 25, 10-12 per cent of customers in number and 25-28 per cent of customers by value opted for moratorium.
During the March quarter, the bank’s BB and below book (fund-based) increased to ₹6,528 crore from ₹5,128 crore in the December quarter. Significant downgrades during the quarter include clients in the cement, medical services, automobiles and ancillaries sectors. The top four sectors (infrastructure construction, cement, power generation and distribution, hotels) comprise 61 per cent of the fund-based BB and below outstanding book.
The ongoing Covid-19 crisis could lead to significant downgrades in the stressed book in the coming months.
On the core performance front, Axis Bank has been delivering a healthy performance thus far.
As of March 2020, the loan book grew by 15 per cent y-oy, led by 24 per cent growth in retail.
Within the corporate book, the bank has been focussing on better-rated entities and short-term loans. The bank’s net interest income for the full year (FY20) grew by 16 per cent YoY.
Loan growth is most likely to moderate substantially in the coming quarter, as the full impact of Covid-19 is felt. This will impact earnings significantly, along with higher provisions.
Axis Bank’s strong capital position, healthy deposit flow and liquidity position lend comfort.
The bank’s total capital adequacy stood at 17.5 per cent as of March 2020, with tier 1 at 14.5 per cent. The bank’s liquidity coverage ratio stood at 120 per cent.
 
Unlike some of its peers in the private sector, Axis Bank has not seen a drawndown in its deposits, which is a positive.
In fact, deposits grew by 8 per cent q-o-q to ₹6.4-lakh crore in the March quarter.
Axis Bank announced its decision to acquire an additional 29 per cent stake in Max Life, the fourth-largest private life insurer.
Also ReadA win-win deal for Axis Bank and Max Life
 
Axis Bank currently has a minor stake (about 2 per cent) in the life insurance company and would hold 30 per cent in Max Life, post-transaction.
For Max Life, its bancassurance partnership with Axis Bank has been a key growth driver, contributing about 55 per cent to its new business APE (annualised premium equivalent).
Axis Bank’s entry into the life insurance space can add significant value to its underlying business, besides providing a boost to its fee income.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla falls after Elon Musk's 2018-style tweets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York | Tesla shares plunged after Elon Musk said the electric-carmaker's stock is too high in a stream of tweets reminiscent of the posts that securities regulators sued him over in 2018.
The chief executive posted more than a dozen times in a span of less than a 75 minutes on Friday, claiming he's selling "almost all" of his physical possessions and won't own a house. He also renewed his call for reopening the economy.
Hours later, Tesla's head of human resources for North America told employees that furloughs would be extended at least another week. The carmaker's shares fell 10 per cent to close at $US701.32 ($1091.50).
Mr Musk, 48, told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he wasn't joking and his tweets weren't vetted before he posted them. Tesla's stock is still up 68 per cent for the year, an advance that's put him in position to meet the final performance threshold he needs to receive stock options that would yield a windfall of about $US730 million.
"We view these comments as tongue-in-cheek and it's Elon being Elon," Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst with a hold rating on Tesla, said in an email. "It's certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot-button issue."
Mr Musk's Twitter burst followed a profane rant during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call. He railed against shutdown orders aimed at containing the coronavirus, telling analysts he was worried about not being allowed to reopen the company's assembly plant in Fremont, California. He compared shelter-in-place measures with forcible imprisonment.
"Musk is frustrated, and he has a pattern when he's under pressure to turn to Twitter," Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures. "It's his form of therapy. But he also has an agenda, which is to get the Fremont factory back open."
Tesla's environmental, health, and safety team has been working "non-stop" on procedures to facilitate the return to work, Valerie Capers Workman, the North American human resources chief, said in an email to staff. San Francisco Bay area counties have extended their stay-home orders through to the end of May.
In December, Mr Musk joked about Tesla's stock being "so high" when it climbed above $US420. That's the price at which he said Tesla would go private in 2018, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission said he picked the number to make a marijuana-related joke that would impress his girlfriend.
On Friday, Mr Musk said his girlfriend, the musician Grimes, is now mad at him. They have a baby due this week, he wrote.
Mr Musk and Tesla each paid $US20 million to settle the securities fraud lawsuit the SEC brought in September 2018 over the CEO's tweets claiming that he had the funding to take Tesla private. But the dispute carried on into last year after Mr Musk posted that the company would make roughly 500,000 cars in 2019 without advance approval from a Tesla lawyer.
The two sides amended their earlier agreement that aimed to set limits on his tweeting by adding specific topics that Mr Musk isn't supposed to post about without pre-approval. The subjects include the company's financial condition, potential mergers or acquisitions, production and sales numbers, new or proposed business lines, projections and forecasts that haven't been previously published, and Mr Musk's purchase or sale of Tesla securities.
While Mr Musk's statements may have run afoul of the SEC agreement, the agency might not reopen the case against him, according to Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman who now leads the advisory firm Kalorama Partners.
"The SEC has bigger fish to fry," Mr Pitt said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
Mr Musk has made similar comments before about Tesla's stock being overvalued. In May 2017, when Tesla had a roughly $50 billion market capitalisation, the CEO said it was higher than the company deserved.
"We can only guess at motivations behind his sequence of tweets," Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst, said in a note to clients. He has a $700 price target for Tesla's stock but warns that there could be "significant uncertainty over the next 2-3 quarters" regarding the company's efforts to restart production.
When asked if he was selling his possessions because he needed cash or was protesting, Mr Musk responded that the answer was neither. He's long sought to reach Mars with his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp, and is devoting himself to that effort, and to the Earth, he wrote.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Musk’s opinion probably falls within the subject matter that must be preapproved by a securities lawyer. Yet there’s an argument that the opinion is based on past results.
Musk has made similar comments before about Tesla’s stock being overvalued. In May 2017, when Tesla had a roughly $50 billion market capitalization, the CEO said it was higher than the company deserved.
“We can only guess at motivations behind his sequence of tweets,” Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst, said in a note to clients.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SABC’s above-inflation salary increases under scrutiny</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fury mounts at 5% pay rise offered during an economic bloodbath by a broadcaster that has already been bailed out to the tune of billions
The cash-strapped SABC has come under severe criticism after giving its employees above-inflation increases of between 5% and 6%.
This decision has raised questions about the prudence of the public broadcaster, which has been in financial turmoil for a number of years.
A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, decried the move as shocking, given the SABC’s weak financial state.
The official added that the broadcaster would most likely return to government with a begging bowl within months.
The source also said the increases would not go down well with National Treasury.
“Can you imagine if Treasury reverses the increases while the employees have already spent the money?” asked the official.
An independent newspaper journalist, who also asked to remain anonymous, said: “The SABC is reliant on taxpayers’ money and should be responsible in the way it spends state bailouts – which are, in effect, our tax contributions. It is unfair that staff are getting increases while some of us are receiving only 60% of our salaries. What makes them special when all other companies are cutting costs and not giving any increases?”
The broadcaster, which has not made a profit in six years, said it was expecting to record a loss for the current financial year.
The SABC has been struggling financially for a number of years. The situation worsened in June last year, when the broadcaster could not afford to pay its staff or its service providers, including the production houses.
The salary increases come at a time when several media houses are shutting down operations and others are cutting employee salaries because of the financial squeeze forced on them by the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.
The increases are being awarded merely six months after the SABC received a massive R2.1 billion bailout from the state.
The broadcaster’s management confirmed the increases, but said the money did not come from the bailout; rather, it was part of a three-year wage agreement that was struck with workers.
The SABC’s chief executive, Madoda Mxakwe, said management had adopted a policy of negotiating salaries for a three-year period to avoid labour unrest and having to negotiate on an annual basis.
The bailout funds were not used for these increases.SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe
He said the SABC had already entered into agreements with labour unions before the current economic downturn.
“In April 2018, the SABC board approved a three-year settlement with organised labour for the period of 2018 to 2020. This included an increase to management of 1% lower than the bargaining unit. The bargaining unit percentage increase was a conservative 5% and 6%, respectively,” Mxakwe said.
“These projected increases were included in the respective approved corporate plans over the period. The percentage increases were substantially less than the 10 years preceding this agreement, when increases ranged mostly between 8% and 11.5%.
“It must be noted that these salary increases are self-funded from operational cash generated.
“The bailout funds were not used for these increases. They have been ring-fenced and utilised for the priority areas that were identified with the shareholder and Treasury.
“The SABC holds a monthly monitoring meeting with Treasury and the department of communications on the utilisation of the bailout fund.”
Several media houses, including Independent Newspapers and Arena Holdings, have slashed workers’ salaries by anything from 20% to 40%.
Media24, which owns City Press, Rapport and Daily Sun, among other publications, informed its workers last month that it would not be offering salary increases this year.
The SABC has been struggling financially for a number of years.
The situation worsened in June last year, when the broadcaster could not afford to pay its staff or its service providers, including the production houses.
In October, Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams announced that the national broadcaster was to receive R2.1 billion as part of a R3.2 billion bailout package.
She said the state had set stringent conditions for the SABC to adhere to before releasing the money, including implementing several cost-cutting measures and revenue enhancements.

Prior to releasing the funds, Ndabeni-Abrahams said the public broadcaster had met most of the conditions outlined by government.
One of these conditions was that the SABC conduct a skills audit and other forensic investigations into how it was losing money.
The SABC has been struggling financially for a number of years. The situation worsened in June last year, when the broadcaster could not afford to pay its staff or its service providers, including the production houses.
The broadcaster has since conducted several investigations of this nature.
One such probe revealed that employees allegedly used the SABC as their personal fiefdom by irregularly awarding huge discounts – sometimes up to 85% – to big corporate clients, resulting in the public broadcaster losing at least R1.5 billion in much-needed revenue.
A forensic investigation into the SABC’s commercial enterprise division scrutinised 35 top advertisers who had contributed the lion’s share of the R6.6 billion in net airtime sales over 18 months.
The report, by Nexus Forensic Services, was finalised in October.
It found that clients – including advertising agencies, network providers, insurance giants and fast-food franchises – were handed discounts totalling R1.517 billion between January 2018 and June last year.
In one instance, an insurance firm only paid 15% of the advertising rate after an official unilaterally gave a discount of 85% – against the broadcaster’s own policy on advertising discount rates.
The SABC was also found to own several properties, including a flat in the UK and farms that were liabilities, and therefore adding no value to the broadcaster.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SABC gives “shocking” salary increases to staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The SABC has come under fire for giving staff above-inflation increases at a time when the country is under massive financial pressure, according to a report by the City Press.
The state-funded broadcaster has given staff salary increases of between 5% – 6%, with government sources stating the move was “shocking” and that the National Treasury would not be pleased.
The SABC’s long history of financial problems – it has not made a profit in six years – and large bailouts received from the government are more reasons the pay increases have been met with disbelief.
The government source added the SABC will “likely return to government with a begging bowl within months”.
Independent journalists who spoke to the City Press said that a time when some of them are only receiving 60% of their salaries due to the COVID-19 lockdown, it was upsetting to see that taxpayers’ money was being used to give SABC staff salary increases.
The SABC confirmed the salary increases in the report, and said they were part of a three-year wage agreement with employees.
This agreement was entered into with labour unions before the lockdown, stated the SABC. It added that the “bailout money” from the government was not used for the increases.
The latest salary increases come after the government gave the SABC a bailout of R2.1 billion in October 2019.
Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said at the time the R2.1-billion lifeline was part of a short-term turnaround plan.
The bailout followed the SABC stating it was technically insolvent and was struggling to honour payments to service providers and contractual obligations.
The SABC reported in September 2019 it had suffered a net loss of R482 million for the 2018/19 financial period.
Private traditional media companies, particularly in the print space, have been hit hard by South Africa’s COVID-19 lockdown.
Associated Media Publishing, which published Cosmopolitan, House & Leisure, Good Housekeeping, and Women on Wheels, shut its doors on 1 May.
The company was founded in 1982 by Jane Raphaely, who was succeeded by her daughter Julia Raphaely.
Raphaely said they made every effort to continue operating, but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic killed the company.
This major factors which negatively impacted the company were:
Other private media companies including Independent Newspapers, Arena Holdings, and Media24 have either told staff there will not be salary increases this year, or salary reductions would be implemented, added the City Press.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What will the new economic ‘normal’ look like?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The current pandemic has quickly turned from a public health crisis into an economic crisis; and the latter is likely going to worsen. Hence, it is time we reconsider our vision of the post-pandemic economic scenario. Will our hopes of the global economy returning to its pre-pandemic state fall short? Let us consider the different components likely to be impacted.
Consumption
With consumption being the largest component of the gross domestic product (GDP) for most of the world, a hit to consumption expenditure would lead to a direct hit to the overall GDP. And given the deteriorating circumstances, consumption will suffer a big dent and the overtly optimistic forecasts of a V-shaped recovery may be nothing more than a distant wish. It is increasingly likely that post-pandemic spending patterns will change drastically as people take a more prudent approach towards consumption. Frugality will likely become the norm as consumers will first want to pay off the extensive debt they are accruing, along with wanting to build better insulated safety nets to accoubt for future inconsistencies and uncertainties. Additionally, the pandemic will lead to a stark bifurcation between essential and non-essential consumer spending. Increased consumer saving in a bid to pay off debt will result in a further downward spiral in the GDP because of the paradox of thrift. The paradox of thrift states that when people start to save more, it leads to a decline in aggregate demand and hence a decrease in the GDP, which in turn further lowers saving capabilities. And with consumer spending at all-time lows, how will businesses be able to generate revenues to kick-start their operations?
Investment
Companies are borrowing like never before, and governments will want them to invest once the dust has settled. But what about the massive debt companies are accumulating to help stay afloat? This will have to be paid off first before further investment plans can be made. The truth is, the stimulus the government is pumping in is necessary but that money has to be paid back in the future. Global fiscal stimulus for the duration of the pandemic now tops $8 trillion; and most of the stimulus is in the form of loans, bank guarantees and other financial instruments that aren’t handouts by any means.
Government Spending
The Pakistan government under the recently introduced “Chota Karobar Imdadi Package” agreed to pay off 3 months worth of electricity bills for small businesses upon the resumption of business activity, in a bid to ease their financial burden. Up to the advent of the pandemic, governments were already spending extraordinary amounts of money, and as a result debt was sky high. According to World Bank data, global GDP stood at $85.911 trillion in 2018. At the same time, global debt (public and private – financial and non-financial sector) hovered around $250 trillion; almost 300% of the GDP. And with governments borrowing more, they are putting themselves in a vulnerable position i.e. in a position where they might have to default. Italy, Argentina and Greece are just some examples of countries that are set to default if the pandemic persists any longer. Add a few more months of lockdowns and extensive borrowing, and many other countries are likely to follow in their footsteps.
Lebanon became the first country to default on debt (the Eurobond) as a result of the pandemic. This is the first time Lebanon has defaulted since its inception. More than 100 countries have asked their creditors for some form of debt relief. Temporary relief may be helpful for developing countries but ultimately servicing that debt will mean forgoing future expenditure.
Unemployment and Inequality
According to the International Labour Organisation, given the escalating situation, nearly half of the global workforce is at risk of losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19. Moreover, the detrimental economic effects of the lockdowns worldwide are felt more strongly in countries which have a low average income. Even though many white-collar jobs have still managed to stay afloat by initiating work-from-home programmes, it is low income workers that are in a quagmire and daily wage earners have been hit the hardest. Even with the Ehsaas programme giving out Rs12000 to 12 million low income households, a lot more will need to be done to help these families financially. And once the dust has settled, the gap between the rich and the poor will widen, both on an individual level and on a national level, and will further exacerbate the existing inequality.
On the other hand, financial obligations cannot be deferred perpetually; hence, mortgage and rent payments will need to be made, electricity and power bills will need to be paid since creditors will only be patient for so long.
Central Banks around the world have brought their portfolio’s to record highs by buying up bonds and injecting money into the economy. And by bringing interest rates to all time lows, there may not be further wiggle room for them in case the investment doesn’t turn out to be enough to stimulate the economy. After a few recent tweaks, the official interest rate has been brought down to 9% by the State Bank of Pakistan. This will need to be brought down further if investment is to be encouraged. America may be fortunate enough to pump as much money as it wishes into its economy. However, the majority of the world will be less fortunate, including the industrialised developed nations.
Hence, the question stands: considering the uncertain longevity of the pandemic, with governments and central banks going all out and doing whatever it takes to keep their economies afloat, will the post-pandemic financial structure of the global economy be able to sustain this or will it collapse and send economies into a further downward spiral? If the latter is true, we will need to be ready, and we will need to be armed to the teeth with innovative resuscitative economic policies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How worried should we be about South Africa’s ability to recover from Covid-19?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Covid-19 crisis is going to put South Africa’s economy into a deep recession. Finance minister Tito Mboweni believes that the economy could contract as much as 6.4%, and the budget deficit could swell to more than 10% of gross domestic product.
Much discussion revolves around the shape of the recovery. The Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE) has published a new report: Are we asking the right questions about… The nature of the economic recovery?
The report argues that if “recovery” means “return to the growth trend evident before the crisis”, South Africa never recovered from the global financial crisis, and should not happen again.
It is very likely that the damage done by the epidemic will necessitate very significant economic reforms if South Africa is ever to fully recover, the CDE said.
“No-one knows what the long-term economic effects of the Covid-19 epidemic will be. The massive disruption attendant on a global lockdown has thrown supply chains into turmoil, pushed tens of millions of the workers into (at least) temporary unemployment, and caused financial markets to gyrate wildly.
“What is certain is that South Africa’s economy will shrink this year relative to last year. In this context, two key concerns for policy-makers, firms and banks is what effect it will have on South Africa’s economic output and how quickly will we recover,” it said.
Estimates of the size of the contraction range between 4% to 15% of GDP depending on whom you ask and whether you look at their most optimistic or most pessimistic scenarios.
South Africa post financial crisis
Between 1999 (the year after the Asian financial crisis) and 2008 (the year before the global financial crisis – or GFC), South Africa’s economy grew, on average, at around 4% annually.
That was brought to a crashing halt in 2009, when, as a result of the GFC – the economy contracted by 1.5%.
The effect of the GFC was short-lived, however: growth in excess of 3% in 2010 meant that the economy returned to 2008 levels within a year, and another year of growth in excess of 3% in 2011 suggested a return to parity, the CDE said.
However, since 2011, growth rates have declined almost annually. Growth has averaged 1.7% over the past decade – a nearly 60% reduction in average annual growth compared to annual growth in the decade before the GFC, the CDE said.
Annual GDP: 1995 to 20
South Africa’s failure to recover has been costly, the Centre for Development and Enterprise said.
One way to think about the cost of this is to think about how much larger the economy would have been had we returned to pre-GFC growth rates, it said.
It noted that GDP in 2019 would have been about R700 billion larger had our trajectory followed the pre-GFC trend, a figure that would have risen to R1 trillion over the next five years.
“Effectively, this means that between 2009 and 2020, South Africa missed out on aggregate output valued at around R3.7 trillion in 2019 rands,” it said.
In the first two scenarios, the economy returns to its pre-Covid trajectory (either in one year or over three years of recovery), but in three other scenarios, this does not happen.
In the first two scenarios, in other words, there is no permanent shock to GDP, though, of course, there is some lost output during the recovery-to-trend.
In the third scenario, however, a three-year recovery takes the economy back to the level of GDP 2019, after which is grows at the same rate as the pre-Covid trend.
“There is, in other words a permanent shock to South Africa’s income, with output each year lower than it would have been if there had been no Covid-related recession,” the CDE said.
Scenario four is even bleaker: here there would be a return to pre-Covid growth rates but without a rapid recovery to 2019 GDP levels and only after a two year recession, it said.
Are there reasons to worry that growth will not rebound?
“One of the most terrifying aspects of this crisis is the extent to which it threatens to decimate whole industries that employ tens or hundreds of thousands of people.
“Apart from anything else, disruption of global trade and value chains pose risks to growth to all economies. In addition, it is a reasonable bet that some industries will never wholly recover,” the CDE said.
It seems likely, for example, that aviation will emerge radically transformed, as will tourism, leisure industries (restaurants, sports events) and some aspects of retailing.
This will partly be a consequence of fundamental changes in the way goods and services of these industries are produced and consumed.
“But it will also be because there is a large probability that many firms will emerge so weighed down in new debt that they will struggle to survive and grow.
“In addition, hundreds of thousands of people may already have lost their jobs, and many more might lose them in the next few months. If their unemployment persists for any length of time, there is every reason to worry that skills and capabilities will decay, reducing future productivity,” the CDE said.
It warned that public debt is likely to weigh heavily on government and it will struggle to service the costs of that debt.
“If any of this turns out to be true, then there is every reason to worry that South Africa would have permanently lost some fraction of its industrial and commercial capabilities.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">High telecom taxes hindering digitalisation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI: Mobile phone services sector has urged the government to rethink mobile taxation during Covid-19 as importance of telecom services has risen in this difficult situation and the plethora of taxes imposed on them are impacting those at the bottom of the social pyramid.
Recently, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh chaired a meeting to discuss the issues faced by the telecom sector following which, the government constituted a 14 member committee to address the issues and present recommendations to the prime minister.  One of the main issues discussed and deliberated during the meeting was taxation on the telecom sector.
According to a research published by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), Pakistan is considered to be among the highest taxed telecom markets in the world while it ranks second highest in telecom taxation in South Asia.
The cost of ownership of a basic handset and connection in Pakistan is above 30%.
Mobile phone services play a critical role in supporting economic growth and social inclusion.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, telecom sector of Pakistan is playing a vital role by providing connectivity and digital services across the country as people have moved to work remotely and adopting e-health and e-education while other online services are becoming rampant.
Despite this, there are a number of consumer taxes levied on mobile services, which the telecom industry has recommended to be rationalised and abolished.
Before analysing the impact of these taxes, it is important to understand what they are and how they impact the consumer. The first is 12.5% withholding tax or advance income, which is deducted at the time of recharge. Consumers are expected to pay this tax and claim it when they file tax returns.
The problem is that majority of Pakistanis who fall under the tax net do not pay taxes and hence cannot claim it. In other words, those who are at the bottom of the pyramid and require assistance from the government turn out to be the ones that end up paying taxes to the government.
Considering this tax unfair, the Supreme Court of Pakistan suspended all taxes on mobile recharge in 2018 because the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was unable to address the issue.
For comparison purposes, air tickets are taxed at 5%, sale of property 1%, functions and gathering 5% and banking transaction 0.4%.
On the other hand, the general sales tax and federal excise duty on telecom services stand at 19.5% and 17% respectively, however, majority of the population resides outside the federal territory hence it pays 3.5% more than it would pay on other services ie a fixed 16% tax.  On a recharge of Rs100, consumers pay to withhold tax of Rs11.11 and sales tax of Rs14.51.
The latter can be reduced by Rs2.6 if sales tax is brought down to 16% and if data tax is removed.
According to the latest available statistics, the government collected Rs48 billion in withholding taxes from telecom companies in 2015 out of which only 4 billion was claimed by tax filers. The rest of the Rs44 billion was consumed by the government.
A source in the telecom sector told The Express Tribune that if the data tax is abolished, it will encourage the uptake of data services, increase smartphone penetration, form a digital ecosystem and create a knowledge-based economy. He was of the view that the ambition of a true ‘Digital Pakistan’ will remain a wish if people are unable to afford digital services and solutions.
At a time when lockdowns are in place and the average consumer’s disposable income is decreasing, their need to stay connected is increasing further hence there is a dire need to provide relief to 165 million mobile consumers, he argued.
The country has seen a surge in data usage during the past few months and a reduction in sales will alleviate burden on consumers and they will be able to enjoy cost-effective services.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PM-led meet dwells on crop biotech, format for capital infusion in farming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, the government deliberated on the possibility of a uniform statutory framework in the country for infusing capital and technology in the agriculture sector through newer ways.
It also discussed pros and cons of biotechnology in the crop sector, along with fast-tracking reforms in agriculture marketing, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
Developing the Electronic-National Agriculture Market (e-NaM) platform into a ‘platform of platforms’ for e-commerce trade was discussed in the meeting as well.
Yesterday, the government added 200 new mandis to the e-NaM platform taking the total to 785.
The meeting is part of the series of such deliberations that Prime Minister Modi is having on various sector in the aftermath of Covid-19 crisis. Sources said in today's meeting apart from the Prime Minister and PMO bureaucrats, Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also participated. Both the Home Minister and Finance Minister have been part of earlier deliberations on other sectors as well.

Officials in the know said that these sectoral meetings are doubling up as forums to discuss relief measures for various sectors and stakeholders.
There will be some more sectoral meetings on Sunday as well.
“There are no separate meetings to discuss the package. The needs of various sectors, small and medium enterprises, farmers, workers and others are being discussed in the relevant sectoral meetings. These discussions will find their way to any package that is announced,” said an official.
Meanwhile, according to the statement, Prime Minister Modi in today's meeting on agriculture stressed on the need for management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit.
He also underlined the need for freeing agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of statute.
The focus of the deliberations was also on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms.
Issues related to cheap credit to agriculture infrastructure, special drives to saturate Kisan Credit Card penetration and PM-KISAN beneficiaries along with facilitating inter-state and intra-state trade in agriculture produce to ensure fairest return to farmer were some of the important areas covered.
Agriculture accounts for 15 per cent of India's gross domestic product and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the country's 1.3 billion population.
The government has maintained that the country's farm sector is functioning smoothly despite the Covid-19 lockdown and there will not be much impact on its growth in the current fiscal, unlike other sectors.

The challenges of the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016 and how to protect the interest of small and marginal farmers was discussed in detail.
Ways to make the Essential Commodities Act compatible with present times so that large-scale private investment in post-production agriculture infrastructure is incentivized, and how it has a positive effect on commodity derivative markets, was also discussed.
Developing ‘Brand India', creation of commodity specific boards/councils and promotion of agri-clusters or contract farming are some of the interventions that were deliberated to boost agriculture commodity export.
The use of technology in the agriculture sector is of paramount importance as it has the potential to unlock the entire value chain for the benefit of farmers.
Modi emphasised on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain.
It was decided to further strengthen the role of Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs) to bring vibrancy in agrarian economy, transparency in agriculture trade and enable maximum benefits to the farmers.
Overall emphasis was on revisiting the existing laws governing market for better price realisation and freedom of choice to the farmers, the statement said. The growth rate of agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla's Stock Drops Billions After Elon Musk's Tweetstorm Friday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Friday Techcrunch reported Elon Musk tweeted to his 33.4 million followers that Tesla's stock price "was 'too high' in his opinion, immediately sending shares into a free fall and in possible violation of an agreement reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year." Tesla's shares plummetted nearly 12% over the next 30 minutes, which reduced Tesla's valuation by over $14 billion, the BBC reports, while reducing Musk's own stake by $3 billion, according to an article shared by long-time Slashdot reader UnresolvedExternal. "In other tweets, he said his girlfriend was mad at him, while another simply read: 'Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness.'"Even at the end of the day Tesla's shares were still down 7.17%. But Techcrunch called Musk's stock-price tweet "just one of many sent out in rapid fire that covered everything from demands to 'give people back their freedom' and lines from the U.S. National Anthem to quotes from poet Dylan Thomas and a claim that he will sell all of his possessions."Rolling Stone has more on what they're calling Musk's "quarantine tantrum," noting that in a Wednesday earnings call, Musk had also complained about restrictions on non-essential businesses and ordinary people. "To say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist... give people back their goddamn freedom." The magazine notes this drew a scathing rebuttal on nationwide TV from The Daily Show's Trevor Noah: "Finally, someone has decided to call out this fascist American government that's asking people to please stay in their houses to try and save their own lives," Noah said sarcastically. "I mean, you're not even allowed to go to the grocery store anymore! Well, actually, you can go to the grocery store, but you can't even go for a walk! I mean, you can do that too, but what about the beach? You're not allowed to go to the beach, except for all the states where you're allowed to go to the beach. But you definitely can't go to H&M, and that is the definition of fascism."CNN Business writes that Musk, "heralded for years as a pioneer in space travel and transportation, has recently veered into disseminating coronavirus misinformation," adding that Musk's comments "also come in stark contrast to those made by some of his peers in Silicon Valley, who have urged caution on reopening." "I worry that reopening certain places too quickly, before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels, will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worsen longer-term health and economic outcomes," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an earnings call Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tesla tumbles after Musk tweets that stock is too high</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) — Shares of Tesla tumbled 9% on Friday after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker’s high-flying stock was overly expensive. “Tesla stock price is too high,” Musk said on Twitter in one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the U.S. national anthem and saying that he would sell almost all his physical possessions.
The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla’s market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk’s stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.
More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, “No.”
Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led to a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer prescreen tweets with important information about the company.
Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them. In April 2019, Musk tweeted, “My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.”
“We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek, and it’s Elon being Elon. It’s [certainly] a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email.
Tesla’s stock has surged in recent weeks but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Musk’s latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla’s quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak “fascist.” Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.
“Musk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.
Musk’s iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla. Tesla’s recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla’s market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package.

    <h5 class="mb-1">INTERVIEW: Saudi Arabia is open for business despite the pandemic </h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DETROIT: For a dozen years, Johnny Gyergyou has sold meat, poultry and eggs from his Berlin Township livestock farm at Eastern Market in Detroit in the US.
Lately, he’s been staying home as fear of the COVID-19 virus has kept thousands of shoppers away from the popular venue northeast of downtown. “The crowds are small and there aren’t many vendors,” said Gyergyou, adding that it’s just not cost-effective to haul the loads 33 miles to Detroit where they may or may not sell.“We’ve been doing fairly well (selling) at the farm. It’s not Eastern Market sales by no means, but at least it’s helping us along here,” said Gyergyou, 72.Farmers, growers and operators of open-air markets are heading into a busy time of the year as many states still are under stay-at-home orders for residents and non-essential businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus which has killed more than 60,000 people in the US and at least 230,000 worldwide.Shoppers venturing out this year are just as likely to come across tables of hand sanitizer and face mask-wearing produce peddlers as they are to see bushels of corn, quarts of blueberries or flats of petunias. Many venues have moved to drive-thru shopping, reduced days or hours, and fencing to control crowds.At the farmers market near London, England’s, Primrose Hill neighborhood, shopping is restricted to a few people at a time who are given gloves upon entering. Vendors are spread out and work behind plastic shields.Detroit’s Eastern Market is considering fencing. Six-foot by six-foot grids will be painted on floors as a reminder to social distance.About a dozen vendors are participating in drive-thru shopping on Tuesdays. “It’s my feeling after listening to people that they’re scared to go down to Detroit with it being a hotspot (for the COVID-19 virus),” said Gyergyou, hoping for a return to normalcy soon. “I’m anxious to get back there.”Detroit has topped 9,000 confirmed virus cases and more than 1,000 deaths.The farmers market in Overland Park, Kansas, outside of Kansas City, Missouri, has been relocated to the city’s convention center where patrons drive past vendors who bring produce to their vehicles.Vermont officials are requiring all farmers markets to be held outdoors. Entertainment, children activities and cooking demonstrations have been suspended to prevent people from congregating in small spaces.The Bennington Farmers’ Market was scheduled to reopen on Saturday as a pre-order drive-thru market.In Montpelier, the Capital City Market was prepared for both pre-order pickups and in-person shoppers with no more than 10 people in the market at a time. Vendors must be spaced 12 feet apart and wear face coverings and gloves.Such precautions can take some of the joy out of outdoor shopping, but that is the price of safety.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farmers markets scaling down with eye on safety due to virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DETROIT (AP) — Johnny Gyergyou has been selling his farm’s meat, poultry and eggs at a Detroit farmers market for more than a decade, but like many of his regular shoppers, he’s been staying home in recent weeks to wait out the coronavirus crisis.
Gyergyou, 72, said the crowds at Eastern Market just aren’t big enough to make it cost-effective for his typical 33-mile (53-kilometer) Saturday trips into the city from his farm in Berlin Township.
“We’ve been doing fairly well (selling) at the farm. It’s not Eastern Market sales by no means, but at least it’s helping us along here,” said Gyergyou, who added that he’s heard other vendors say they were scared to sell in Detroit, which has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus.
Farmers, growers and operators of open-air markets are heading into one of their busiest times of year while facing the added challenge of the coronavirus. The disease has led to stay-at-home orders and the closure of nonessential businesses in many places, and has killed more than 60,000 people in the U.S. and at least 230,000 worldwide.
Shoppers venturing to farmers markets this spring are likely to see a lot fewer vendors and fellow customers. The ones they do see will be taking precautions to guard against the spread of COVID-19, such as the wearing of face masks and frequent use of hand sanitizer. Many markets have already taken other steps, including turning to drive-thru shopping, reducing their hours of operation and using fencing for crowd control.
Nearly all of the hundreds of Saturday morning shoppers at Eastern Market wore masks and there was ample spaces between vendors.
“Three weeks ago, it was nearly empty,” said Carrie Simpson, 48, of Wyandotte outside of Detroit.
Saturday was her fourth visit to the market since fears of the virus forced businesses to close and people to stay home. Simpson bought eggs, plants and herbs and said she drives to Gyergyou's livestock farm for her meats.
“I want to support the farmers. Their sales are down,” she said.
The farmers market in Overland Park, Kansas, has been relocated to the city’s convention center, where patrons drive past vendors who bring produce to their vehicles. About 35 vendors participated on April 25 and vehicles were at the gate when the market opened at 8 a.m. About 700 drove through before a 2 p.m. closing, said Meg Ralph, a city spokeswoman.
In Vermont, officials are requiring all farmers markets to be held outdoors and have banned entertainment, children’s activities and cooking demonstrations to prevent people from congregating in small spaces. The Bennington Farmers’ Market was scheduled to reopen on Saturday as a pre-order drive-thru market. And in the state’s quaint capital city of Montpelier, the Capital City Market was prepared for pre-order pickups and in-person shoppers, with no more than 10 people allowed in the market at a time. Vendors must be spaced 12 feet apart and wear face coverings and gloves.
Such precautions can take some of the joy out of outdoor shopping, but that’s the price of safety.
“They won’t be able to talk about recipes (or) their families — converse about the kids, like they normally do,” said Myra Gorman, market manager for the farmers market in Evanston, Illinois. “Some of them will share phone numbers so they can do that stuff later.”
The market just north of Chicago typically attracts as many as 7,000 people on a Saturday. This weekend, 35 vendors will be set up and only 105 or so customers will be allowed inside at any time. Once inside, all the thumping, touching, smelling and grabbing of fruits and vegetables will be replaced by pointing by mask-wearing customers to mask- and glove-wearing vendors.
No farmers have backed out, said Gorman, adding that “this is their business, their livelihood.”
One of the vendors, Todd Nichols, said he couldn’t skip the market even if he wanted to. Nichols is an owner of Nichols Farm & Orchard in Marengo, a community about 55 miles (90 kilometers) northwest of Chicago. He said about 90% of his income comes from farmers markets and restaurants. Restaurant sales have fallen through the floor during the pandemic, he said.
“Farmers markets are just too important not to go,” Nichols said.
Gorman said things were going smoothly in the first few hours Saturday at the new-look farmers market.
“We passed our first thousand customers, everybody is doing social distancing and there is a big open space in the middle of the market so there’s enough space to walk around and feel safe,” she said.
The Saturday market in Collingswood, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, launched 20 years ago. The 2020 edition, which was set to open Saturday, won’t have live music or some of the other attractions that has made it a festival-like destination in years past. Like so many other markets trying to survive the pandemic, it will be a stripped-down “farm-to-car” market that has moved to a big parking lot.
Continuing the market provides normalcy for area residents and help for some now-struggling farmers, said Collingswood Mayor Jim Maley.
“Their crops didn’t know there was a pandemic going on,” he said.
Meanwhile, Detroit’s Eastern Market is considering putting up fencing to maintain social distancing. Grids are painted on the floors to remind people to keep space between themselves and others.
About a dozen vendors are participating in drive-thru shopping on Tuesdays at the market.
“We feel safe,” said Mark Thomas, who along with his wife, Jill, were trying to sell bottles from their Unwined Winery.
But things were slow Saturday morning. “It's easier when you can get samples to people,” said Jill Thomas. “We're not allowed to do that now.”
The restrictions aren’t limited to the U.S., either. At the farmers market near the Primrose Hill neighborhood in London, shopping has been restricted to a few people at a time who are given gloves upon entering. Vendors are spread out and work behind plastic shields.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CAIRO: The Egyptian government has ordered the shutting down of the National Circus to counter the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Following the closure, Ashraf El-Helw, 26, who belongs to the famous lion taming El-Helw family thought of a new idea to entertain people: He decided to bring his lions home.El-Helw transported the lions using his own jeep. Once home, he allocated a special space for them to live and performed with them. The performance was shot on video by El-Helw and posted on his official Instagram account.“The show was easy since I usually hold lots of performances and take part in entertainment shows and pranks that depend on lions. I grew up with lion cubs at home,” he said.Although he now trains his animals at home, El-Helw admits it is not easy. “Changing the venue was rather hard for the animals because they are used to the circus.“The family encouraged me to hold an online performance via social media. However, they did not expect me to be in such good control of the situation because it was the first time to have the lions at home.”When El-Helw posted videos of the home performance he was naturally asked about having lions inside the house. He said it was unsafe for the animals to be in the house “because they need special care and attention and a special way of dealing with them that is different from dealing with household pets.”El-Helw added that he had thought of the idea of performing at home with the lions after becoming bored due to the lockdown. He said he felt the animals were also bored after live performances were halted because of the pandemic.“I rehearsed many times before the show at home,” El-Helw said, adding: “In the beginning, the lions felt the surroundings in the house were strange, but eventually they started interacting with me.”“The family owns about 50 animals,” El-Helw said. “When the virus crisis erupted, the family divided the animals into groups. Some of them are in the National Circus while others are in the ranch” on the Cairo-Alexandria desert road.He said he has decided to hold future performances in the ranch since the venue is better-equipped than his home.Zaghloul Khedr, a researcher at the Animals Health Institute, shared concern over El-Helw’s videos. He said that they could encourage people to buy wild animals and raise them at home, “which is very dangerous.”He added: “It is very hard to trace the trade of wild animals in Egypt since the deals are done behind closed doors and come in various forms and prices.” Khedr said that some animals are sold for thousands of dollars.He said there were special ranches for breeding tigers and lions and that some are licensed to sell the big cats internationally in circuses, but not to individuals.A source in the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture told Arab News that the ministry was the only body authorized to issue licenses for sheltering and breeding wild animals. According to the ministry’s website, the General Authority for Veterinarian Services issues private licenses for wild animal ranches including lions, tigers, and cheetahs. The ranches are licensed following the approval of the environment and interior ministries.Conditions include sending a special committee from the authority to draft reports on the location of the ranch, which must be 500 meters away from urban communities. Moreover, special committees are set up to examine the ranch in terms of safety rules and regulations and meeting health and environmental standards.Dina Zulfakkar, an animal rights activist and board member of the Giza Zoo, told journalists that bringing wild animals into homes was a violation of the law. She added that the video posted by El-Helw on social media “gives the wrong impression regarding how dangerous lions can be.”El-Helw started dealing with animals, especially lions, at the age of six when he started taking part in circus rehearsals. He said he ditched a promising career as a footballer for Al-Ahly because of his passion for the circus. Before he started performing under the big top, El-Helw learned how to deal with animals, how to care for them and also understand their nature.The El-Helw family has been in the circus business for more than 100 years. Ashraf El-Helw’s grandmother, Mahasen, was the first Arab female lion tamer.El-Helw, Egypt’s youngest lion tamer, is the grandson of famed lion tamer Mohamed El-Helw who died after being mauled by a lion inside a cage in 1972.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Egyptian lion tamer brings circus show home during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unable to go out and perform at the circus because of the new coronavirus, an Egyptian lion tamer has brought the show home.
Ashraf El-Helw, who comes from a long line of famous lion tamers, could not stay away from the big cats any longer.
Gimana, the lion, quietly sits on command when told and when it is time perform, she skillfully glides over the house furniture.
Her latest Cairo performance is not in the circus, it is in El-Helw’s home.
Like many recreational and entertainment spots around Egypt, the circus closed its door because of the coronavirus.
Since then, the lions were moved to a park where they can swim in pools and roam around spacious gardens, Ashraf said.
Ashraf has been urging people to stay home on social media but when the boredom of staying indoors got to him, he thought of Gimana.
“She is a female lion, she is four and a half years old, she performs with me in the circus and is very clever,” he said.
The show she puts on at his apartment in Cairo is only part of her performance at the circus and comes without the theatrics.
For this show, tables and chairs are the stage and there are no circus props.
Despite the simple setting, El-Helw performs routine tricks with Gimana, even teaching the lion new moves.
The big cat gracefully jumps through a hoop, leaps over a trainer and performs other tricks in exchange for food.
Ashraf said he does it to entertain people, the lion, and himself.
His sister Boshra, a lion tamer as well, is involved in the simple shows held at home.
Boshra says it takes plenty of training to become a lion tamer.
“There has to be a good foundation to know what to do in case the lion attacks during a show, or how to handle a lion that is not in a good mood,” she said.
The brother and sister lion tamer duo belong to a family whose name is almost synonymous with lion taming and circus performances.
They are descendants of Mohamed El-Helw whose first venture into circus shows dates back to the late 19th century.
Today, many animal welfare organisations around the world are calling for an end to circus shows involving big cats.
The US-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, (PETA), describes it as animal cruelty.
“The stressful, unnatural environment can cause some to pace back and forth or even mutilate themselves,” the organisation said.
The Captive Animals Protection Society said the “animals suffer in the name of entertainment” and that animals perform circus tricks out fear, not out of choice.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Corporate Ransomware Payments Up In Remote Working Environment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Corporate ransomware payment amounts rose sharply in the first quarter of this year, with a wave of coronavirus-related attacks and other peripherally-related cases because of complexities with shifting to remote work for many people, according to a Coveware blog post.
The average ransomware payment, according to Coveware, a cybersecurity company, hit $111,605, a 33 percent jump from Q4 2019.
Attacks typically targeted larger businesses that could afford to pay those kinds of sums, and the attacks tended to be successful more often. Payments of that size weren’t the majority — the median was more around $44,000 — but the few large payments did increase the overall average.
Sodinokibi was the top type of ransomware on the market with 26.7 percent of the total showing. Close behind was Ryuk with 19.6 percent, and then Phobos with 7.8 percent.
Mamba, a combo of a boot-locker program and full-disk encryption, shot up sharply this quarter, sitting at 4.8 percent now, an increase of 4 points overall.
The top industries targeted by ransomware were professional services with 18.1 percent, healthcare with 13.8 percent and the public sector with 12 percent. Professional services firms include law firms, IT managed service providers and CPA firms.
The increase in attacks on the public sector could have had to do with the coronavirus pandemic. Public sectors like schools (which were almost 50 percent of that category targeted by attacks) can sometimes be vulnerable to ransomware attacks over the summer while school is out. But because of the rapid school closings and moves to online classes due to the virus, the schools left themselves open to attacks.
One common method of ransomware is data exfiltration, in which data downloaded from victims’ computers is threatened to be released publicly. That method was more popular in the first quarter than it was before — previously, data exfiltration was almost never used at all.
Despite the focus on larger businesses, ransomware is mainly a problem for smaller businesses. According to stats from Coveware, the average companies targeted by ransomware have fewer than 1,000 employees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sodinokibi, Ryuk ransomware drive up average ransom to $111,000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first quarter of the year recorded an increase in the average amount ransomware operators demand from their victims. Compared to the previous quarter, a 33% swell was noted, driven by the Sodinokibi and Ryuk ransomware operators.
Behind this are successful attacks against large enterprises that can afford to pay top dollar to get their data back.
The details come from Coveware, a company that handles ransomware incidents and tracks threat actors with a high likelihood of keeping their word and decrypt files after getting their ransom.
Coveware noticed that in Q1 ransomware operators focused more on large enterprises, forcing payments out of them to get unlock keys for their data. On average, the ransom payment for Q1 2020 was $111,605.
In the same time frame last year, the average paid amount had exploded by 89% from the preceding quarter. Even so, it reached only $12,762, which is almost 3.5 lower than the latest median.
Smaller businesses were also targeted for significantly lower ransoms, which is given by the $44,021 median observed by the company, slightly higher from the $41,179 registered in Q4 2019.
“Large enterprise ransom payments are the minority by volume, but the size of the payments dramatically pulled up the average ransom payment,” reads a report from Coveware.
A contributing factor to these unprecedented figures is the tactic of making public the data stolen from compromised hosts unless the ransom was paid. At least seven actors are exfiltrating files before encrypting the systems, specifically to squeeze the money out of the victim.
Several operators have created leak sites to post files from their victims. Among them: Sodinokibi, Maze, DopplePaymer, Clop, Sekhmet, Nephilim, Mespinoza, and Netwalker, Nemty.
The top three ransomware in Q1 2020 remained unchanged, with Sodinokibi, Ryuk, and Phobos being the most prevalent. According to the report, new variants of Mamba ransomware (a.k.a HDDCryptor) have started to gain traction and become more used in attacks.
Sodinokibi accounted for a little more than a quarter (26.7%) of the incidents handled by Coveware while Ryuk had another big chunk of the attacks, 19%.6, but dwindled towards the end of the period.
Phobos and Dharma share the third place but another ransomware family, Mamba, is catching up, jumping ahead four spots since the previous quarter. This threat emerged in January 2016 and started to become more active later that year.
A new variant of Mamba was found in the second half of 2019. The malware uses the open-source DiskCryptor to encrypt files and then writes a custom boot loader to the master boot record.
Breaching the victim networks differs from one ransomware to another and reflects the sophistication level of each actor. Remote desktop credentials purchased from underground forums are the preferred method for less elaborate actors.
At the opposite end are more subtle approaches that rely on complex distribution models, spear-phishing, and lateral movement to find valuable targets. This is the style of Ryuk and Sodinokibi; the latter moved from attacking smaller managed service providers (MSPs) to carefully picked large enterprises.
According to Coveware, the average ransom payment for the top three threats shows how they moved to more valuable targets. Ryuk is leading the chart with more than $1.3 million as its operators started to ask more from victims.
Sodinokibi is quite far behind with an average demand of a little over $300,000. Their spectrum was wider and included both large organizations, holding their computers for ransom’s as high as $1 million, and individual MSP‌ clients from which they demanded $5,000-$10,000.
Phobos maintained its strategy and limited to small companies negligent enough to leave their RDP service open. The average payment was close to $16,000.
The Coveware report also notes that the data recovery rate was 96% in incidents where victims paid the ransom. This was one percent less than in the previous quarter.
“The drop reflected lower data recovery rates for a few specific variants of ransomware that have a tendency to corrupt data upon encryption. Specifically, variants like Mesponinoza, DeathHiddenTear, and Buran caused data loss upon encryption and also delivered decryption tools with bugs that lead to additional data loss” - Coveware
It is worth noting that the data recovery rate was as low as 40% in some cases, so victims got less than half of their files, despite paying the ransom.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MCO: Sarawak will not reopen businesses on 4 May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced that most businesses including restaurants will be allowed to open starting 4th May under the conditional movement control order (CMCO). However, the Sarawak State Government has just announced that they will not reopen businesses on Monday.
According to the State Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) Chairman, Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah, Sarawak has opted to maintain all directives under the three phases of the MCO to remain in force for now. He added that Sarawak will announce in stages the reopening of economic activities and other sectors.
According to the statement, the state government respects the decision by the Prime Minister but they have decided to study the various implications if economic activities are to re-open, and this includes which sectors will be permitted and to what extent those companies can operate. The SDMC will make a decision after it has studied the changes to the regulations in Act 342 in accordance to the announcement made by the Prime Minister.
The deputy chief minister said that SDMC must ensure that the re-opening of economic activities and sectors suits Sarawak’s situation. This includes the state’s logistics capability and the capacity of the health department and geographical circumstances. He also reminded all businesses that have received Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) approval during the 4th phase of the MCO to get state government approval through the SDMC before they are allowed to operate.
According to the Sarawak Public Communications Unit, there are a total of 518 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sarawak with 17 deaths so far (3.28%). The state currently has 271 recoveries (52.32%) while 227 cases are still receiving treatment. 3 cases are in ICU and 3 require respiratory support. At the moment, both Kuching and Samarahan are still categorised as red zones with 137 and 47 active cases respectively.
The Ministry of Health has reported 105 new cases nationwide today, which is the highest since 16th April 2020. Prior to this, Malaysia has been recording double-digit daily numbers for 15 days straight. Among the 105 new cases, 60 are from EMCO areas while 11 are imported cases.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bucking Putrajaya, Sarawak won’t reopen for business on Monday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUCHING, May 2 — Sarawak has decided not to allow the reopening of businesses on May 4 under the conditional movement control order (CMCO) Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced yesterday, the State Disaster Management Committee (SDMC) said today.
SDMC chairman Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah said the state government has opted to maintain all the directives under the three phases of the movement control order (MCO) to remain in force for now.
“However, Sarawak will announce in stages the re-opening of economic activities and other sectors.
“This will be done after every minute detail of the standard operating procedures and guidelines are studied on the re-opening of the economic sectors,” Uggah said in a statement.
He said the Sarawak government fully respected the prime minister’s announcement on the need to relax the MCO in order to re-open the economy on Monday.
“However the state government has decided to study the implications of the re-opening of such economic activities, such as which sectors are allowed to re-open, when and to what extent they will be allowed to re-open.
“For this purpose, the SDMC intends to make a decision after it has studied the changes to the regulations in Act 342 pursuant to the announcement by the prime minister,” he said, referring to the latest gazette notification on the enforcement of CMCO issued under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases 1988.
Uggah, who is also the deputy chief minister, said the SDMC must ensure that the re-opening of the economic activities and sectors suits Sarawak’s circumstances.
“Taking into account Sarawak’s local situation in terms of the Covid-19 cases, logistic capability, the capacity of the Health Department and its geographical circumstances, the SDMC has found that many of the standards of compliance of the re-opening of the economic activities will not be conducive in the state,” he said.
Uggah reminded that any economic sectors that have received approval from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) during the fourth phase of MCO, are required to get the state government’s approval through the SDMC for their applications to be reviewed before they are allowed to operate.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The U.K. will take a gradual path out of the coronavirus lockdown even though the government will soon publish guidance on how to return to work, a minister said.“It’s definitely not going to be business as usual, but we do want to make sure that people understand where the route map lies,” Transport Minister Grant Shapps said on Sky News on Sunday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is preparing to give advice on different activities, including working outdoors or inside someone else’s home, a report said Saturday.
He will also say whether employees need to wear protective equipment and how transport should be used.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought economic activity to a halt all over the world. The U.K. has reported more than 28,000 deaths linked to the virus, second only to the U.S. and Italy. Two-thirds of Britons opposes lifting the lockdown now, a poll in the Observer showed.
Nevertheless, the rate of infections is now past the initial peak, said Ian Diamond, the nation’s chief statistician. He wouldn’t say whether the U.K. was doing poorly in fighting the disease because international comparisons are “an unbelievably difficult thing to do.”
The government’s response has been criticized as slow and not transparent enough. The U.K.’s former chief scientific adviser is setting up a group to counter advice from government’s current advisers, the Sunday Times reported.
Separately, the Times cited the British Medical Association as saying that older people shouldn’t be held under lockdown longer than others. Those considered especially vulnerable to the disease, including people over 70 years old, have been advised by authorities to stay indoors for another 12 weeks.
The BMA also published a survey showing that half of U.K. doctors have had to buy their own protective gear.
Johnson, who’s now leading the plans to reopen the country, was himself hospitalized with the coronavirus and nearly died, he said in the Sun newspaper. The prime minister has set forth five tests for ending the restrictions on travel, work and socializing, including that there’s no risk of a second spike in cases.
Primary schools could start reopening on June 1, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Johnson will give his next three-weekly review of the lockdown on May 7.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK to publish work plans once curbs are lifted as firms press for support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK government will give companies guidance within days on returning to work safely once the coronavirus lockdown is eased, as it comes under pressure from business not to withdraw its financial support too soon.
Firms will get advice on different types of workplace activity, including operating outdoors or inside someone else’s home, according to two people with knowledge of the government’s plans. The guidance will also address whether employees need to wear protective equipment and how transport should be used, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Boris Johnson has pledged a “comprehensive plan” to lift the lockdown that has crippled the British economy now the country has passed the peak of the disease.

As the prime minister eases the restrictions, he will have to tread a path between bankruptcies and mass unemployment if the lockdown lasts too long, and a second wave of the virus if curbs are lifted too soon. The next review of the Covid-19 strategy is due on May 7.
The government is reviewing whether it could relax the two-meter social distancing rule, which could allow more businesses and schools to reopen, The Daily Telegraph reported today. Ministers have asked scientific advisers whether people need to stay so far apart, the paper said. The Sun paper, meanwhile, reported that the UK could begin relaxing restrictions on May 26.
The government’s website already offers guidance for critical businesses that have remained open, such as food retailers, freight transporters and pharmaceutical firms. They have been instructed to put social-distancing measures in place and stagger workers’ shifts.
Government Talks
The latest advice for different workplace settings, which is being drawn up in consultation with labor unions, lobby groups and relevant employers, will be similar, the people said.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak
“It is only right that we work together with industry and unions to ensure workplaces are safe for both those in work now and for those going back to work as government measures develop,” a government spokesman said by e-mail.
With discussions turning to how the UK economy might start ramping up again, industry lobbyists are concerned the government may soon withdraw some of its unprecedented financial support for business. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has rolled out 104 billion pounds ($130 billion) of measures to keep firms afloat and prevent mass firings.

Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that it will take time for normal levels of consumption to resume due to social distancing and weak consumer confidence.
“If any of these schemes are simply ended with a day’s notice, you’re going to see a lot more businesses heading into insolvency,” he said. “Their cash position will simply become untenable.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why the European stock market’s losing to the US in this rally</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once again, when stocks rally, it’s Europe that’s left behind.
With the S&P 500 about 30% above its March lows, the Stoxx 600 index has lagged behind with a 21% bounce, despite having fallen more than the U.S. in the global selloff sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.
The reason? For starters, there’s the market’s makeup: Europe has a large presence of cyclical sectors, such as banks and energy, which have underperformed during this crisis. On top of that, the region has led the recent wave of dividend cuts by major companies. Investors have also been disappointed by the scale of fiscal and monetary support measures as Europe faces its deepest recession in living memory.
The rebound in stocks around the world has been driven by companies with reliable earnings growth and solid balance sheets as investors seek safe havens amid slowdown fears. The U.S. technology sector has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend, with the five biggest names such as Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. constituting 18% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, more than double the value of the U.K. FTSE 100 Index and five times larger than Germany’s DAX, according to Sanford C. Bernstein data.
“In order for Europe to take the lead regionally, we really need a rotation into more cyclical and value areas of the market,” Nathan Thooft, Manulife Investment Management’s head of global asset allocation, said by email. “I am not convinced we have the necessary level of economic clarity for that to happen.”
And although Thooft, who is overweight U.S. equities, sees “decent value” in European stocks in the longer term, he says the market lacks a catalyst. Earnings in the Stoxx 600 companies are projected to slump 23% in 2020, compared with a 19% contraction in the S&P 500, Bloomberg data show. The euro-area economy could shrink as much as 12% this year and fail to return to its pre-coronavirus size until the end of 2022, the European Central Bank says.
While the ECB and major European economies, including Germany, the U.K. and Italy, have been stepping up support measures to help consumers and companies weather the slump, investors feel that the U.S. has acted swifter and pumped more money into the system.
“The fiscal response in the U.S. has been so big relative to everybody, that’s a big piece of how the recovery is going to look in terms of who comes out stronger on the back of this,” Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist and manager at Natixis Investment Managers, said by phone. “And that’s why you’ll continue to see the U.S. outperform.”
Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., agrees with this sentiment, but at the same time said on Bloomberg TV that once market players get more confident about “a genuinely strong” recovery in activity, European stocks can outperform.
GRANOLASThe Goldman team this week released a list of European companies, dubbed GRANOLAS and which include GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Roche Holding AG and ASML Holding NV, that can beat the market during the next cycle thanks to their strong balance sheets, stable growth and good dividend yields. The strategists, including Guillaume Jaisson, point out that while 20 years ago Europe’s ten biggest companies were telecoms and oil firms, these along with banks are now absent from the top stocks by market value and the tech sector has grown to exceed energy, rising closer in size to the banking subgroup.
Still, the European stock market has been held back by last month’s historic slump in the oil price, which also weighed on mining shares. And the region’s banks continue to be hurt by low interest rates and increased concerns about corporate defaults.
European firms have been much swifter in slashing or suspending dividends than their U.S. counterparts, with at least 189 companies in Europe’s Stoxx 600 benchmark having canceled or postponed payouts. Part of the reason is that the ECB has recommended that lenders delay dividends in response to unprecedented support measures while certain governments, like France, have made it a clause in receiving state aid.
“Most investors entering Europe are chasing dividends,” Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at Societe Generale SA, said by phone. “And now, Europe is losing its key appeal because of all the dividend cuts over the last several weeks. Yes, it’s great news for the bond holders, but not for the shareholders.”
SocGen is overweight credit and underweight stocks in the region.
Investor flows also show little love toward European stocks, even though the Stoxx 600 gauge just had its biggest monthly bounce since 2015. The region’s stock funds had their largest outflows in six weeks of $2.7 billion in the week through April 29, according to Bank of America Corp. data, adding to a year-to-date toll of about $24 billion.
“The U.S. will likely lead the rest of the world until we start to see expectations and signs that global growth differentials begin to narrow in favor of the rest of the world,” Manulife’s Thooft said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barbers, hairstylists sign petition to not be in first phase of B.C. economic reopening</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 2,000 barbers and hairstylists in B.C. have signed a petition asking to not be among the first businesses to re-open.
The Change.org petition, which had 2,039 signatures as of Sunday (May 3) afternoon, said opening hair salons and barbershops would put stylists and customers at risk.
Our government has made incredible strides in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and must understand that a decision to reopen salons first would put our communities and economy at greater risk than benefit,” the petition said.
The petition cited Alberta’s reopening plan, which has some personal services like hairstyling and barber shops scheduled to open on May 14.
The authors of the petition posed a series of questions which they said must be answered before hair salons and barbershops reopen.
“Will stylists have continued, unfettered access to personal protective equipment in B.C.? Will access to widespread testing be made more available?” the questions began. Others touched upon support for infected workers and the risk to the lives of staff and their families.
Speaking Saturday, Dr. Bonnie Henry said hair salons would not be opened lightly.
“We won’t be opening up barbers and stylists… until we’re all comfortable that we have an appropriate plan to be able to do that safely for everybody involved.”
Hair stylists and barbers are not regulated in B.C. as their governing body was disbanded in 2003.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hairstylists launch petition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hundreds of B.C. barbers and hairstylists have signed a petition asking the provincial government not to single them out when COVID-19 restrictions begin to ease.
Premier John Horgan is expected to announce B.C.’s plan for reopening the economy next week.
However, the petition, launched on Change.org Friday (May 1), is urging the provincial government to not include hairstylists and barbers in the first phase of that economic reopening. Businesses in the personal service sector — including hair, nail, wax, spa and esthetician practices — have been closed since mid-March under a provincial health officer order.
As of 2:45 p.m. Saturday, 994 people, and counting, had signed the online petition.
The petition notes that it’s not possible for personal service businesses to practice social distancing with clients.
“Our government has made incredible strides in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and must understand that a decision to reopen salons first would put our communities and economy at greater risk than benefit,” reads the petition.
“We hope that businesses who operate in as close proximity to the public as nurses continue to remain closed at this time.”
It’s worrying, notes the petition, that hair salons and barbershops are allowed to reopen in the first phase of Alberta’s plan, while the rest of that province’s personal service industry will remain closed.  
The petition questions whether hairstylists and barbers will have “continued, unfettered” access to personal protective equipment and whether there will be better access to more widespread testing.
“Will workers and their families who are compromised be supported? Will people in a non-essential sector have to risk illness, death and heightened community spread because they have no choice but to touch large volumes of clients in enclosed areas?” the petition asks.
“It is essential that these questions are answered before hair professionals return to work."
However, B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the province won’t reopen sectors such as hairstylists and barbershops until they’re confident they can operate safely, and can implement health and safety protocols.
“We will not move forward with opening up different sectors until we’re ready, until we’re sure that they have a plan that is workable that have these precautions and protections in place,” said Henry Saturday.
Henry said the outbreaks at poultry plants are a “cautionary tale” for the province.
“That tells us that we need to make sure that we have the right safety measures in place in each different area of our economy to make sure we can all be comforted and understand that we are opening up safely, and slowly and methodically,” she said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The number of breweries has stalled for the second year in a row as growth in the craft beer sector slows after a period of explosive growth, a new study suggests.
Accountancy group UHY Hacker Young said the total had fallen by one over the last year to 2,273 amid increased competition from multinational brewers, and a trend away from drinking beer among younger generations.
Multinationals have increased their market share by launching their own craft beer varieties, as well as acquiring many of the emerging independent craft breweries, said the report.
UHY Hacker Young predicted the craft beer market may be reaching “saturation point” among its existing core customer market.
James Simmonds of UHY Hacker Young, said: “Stalling growth in the number of UK breweries is not the whole story, with the UK remaining one of the world leaders in craft beer.
“In order to help the sector bounce back as quickly as possible from coronavirus, the Government should consider expanding the Small Brewer Relief to include a wider group of breweries.
“An increase in the level of business rate relief for brewers and pubs would also be welcome.
“Brewers should make use of this support available to them to scale up their online platforms, in order to increase their online sales directly to customers.
“Consumer habits are likely to change even after the lockdown has ended, and brewers need to be able to capitalise on where consumers are now looking to buy their goods.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commercial rates waiver and €10k restart grants: Government outlines supports to try help businesses recover</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE GOVERNMENT HAS agreed a series of measures at a special Cabinet meeting today to support small, medium and large businesses recover after the impact of Covid-19.
After the announcement of the phased reopening of the Irish economy, the government said today it “recognises that businesses require significant additional supports”. 
Businesses who were forced to cease trading and others affected adversely from Covid-19 had been calling on the government to provide supports to help them deal with the unprecedented crisis. 
The measures to support business announced today include:
Speaking today, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that he appreciates “the massive economic and social challenges” for those out of work and said these measures today would help to rebuild “our jobs, our incomes and our economic health”. 
He added: “We believe these are significant measures that will make a difference to the retention of jobs, and the creation of new jobs.”
On the specific call from pubs, restaurants and tourism sectors to reduce the VAT rate on the hospitality industry, Minister Donohoe said a decision had not been taken on that measure yet as – according to the roadmap - it’ll be some time before they reopen. 
The measures will cost around €6.5 billion in all.
The government has also committed to local authorities to make up the shortfall on rates, so that these local authorities can still provide services to the public.
Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said: “We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst our SMEs.”
Humphreys said advice from Health and Safety Authority is available to those businesses looking to ensure they can enforce health guidelines when they go back to work.
SME credit supports
The credit guarantee scheme for SMEs will cost €2 billion. 
Under this scheme, it’ll provide an 80% guarantee on leding to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between three months to six years. 
SMEs will be able to go directly to the banks in the Scheme, and the guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between €10,000 and €1 million.
The loans will have interest rates below current market rates, and the government said this is a “major component” of its strategy to support SMEs.
It will require legislation, and the drafting of this has already been approved. However, for legislation to pass, a new government must be formed as the Seanad cannot sit until the new Taoiseach nominates new members to the upper house.
Minister Donohoe acknowledged this was the case, and said a number of decisions had been made and would be made that would have to be ratified by the Dáil and the Seanad. 
Reaction
Business group IBEC said it welcomed the measures announced by government today.
Its CEO Danny McCoy said: “The scale of business collapse in recent weeks has been spectacular and unprecedented and the significant low interest loan guarantee; other liquidity and investment measures; grants; and tax deferral and waiver supports; are an important further step in addressing the cashflow crisis which so many businesses are dealing with.
Dublin Chamber and the Small Firms Association were among others who welcomed the measures.
However, the Family Business Network however said the measures are a “missed opportunity to maximise jobs and accelerate re-employment”.
Its executive director John McGrane said: “Neither more loans nor unworkable state equity investment are what businesses need to reopen and re-hire. What will get the recovery moving fastest is the extension of the Covid-19 Temporary Wage Supplement Scheme until a reasonable period after the State’s current restrictions on businesses are ended.”
Fianna Fáil’s Business spokesperson said while the measures unveiled today will provide some relief for businesses, they do not tackle the very urgent need to address the high interest rate being charged on government loans, business interruption insurance and rent payments.  
“I have been listening to and working with business owners since these restrictions were implemented and three of the main issues that came up time and again was access to low interest loans, insurance and rent.  And unfortunately, today’s government announcement does little to address any of these.
“Today’s measures do not address the high interest rate that the government is charging on its microfinance and loan guarantee schemes.  These offer rates of around 4%; despite the fact that government can borrow at rates of less than 0.25%.  Small and medium businesses are paying the price at a time when they cannot afford to,” he said. 
When put to the Minster Humphreys that some government loans in the UK have interest rates as low as 2.5% she said the full suite of measures on offer must be viewed together before comparisons can be made. She said they would continue to monitor the supports put forward by other countries.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Government to outline further measures to help businesses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Government is to outline further measures to support businesses impacted by COVID-19.
The Ministers for Finance, Business and Housing - Paschal Donohoe, Heather Humphreys and Eoghan Murphy - are to give further details on Saturday.
It follows on from the publication by the Government of theroadmap for easing restrictions and re-opening the economy.
Chambers Ireland chief executive Ian Talbot said: "The past several weeks have been tremendously challenging for communities, so indications that some restrictions will be eased in the coming days will be warmly received."
"Chambers Ireland reiterates its call for liquidity funds and grant aid for business to cover overheads such as rent, utilities and working capital.
"The deferral announced in March was found to be insufficient by three-quarters of business who responded to our earlier survey published on May 9th.
"If action on commercial rates is to have any meaningful impact, they will need to be waived for impacted businesses for at least six months, if not a full year."
He added: "Without additional aid to support working capital, liquidity and cash flow, the chance of businesses successfully re-opening and maintaining employment is significantly reduced. We await Government clarity on these matters over the weekend."
Earlier this week, Minister Donohoe told Newstalk that COVID-19 payments and wage subsidy schemes could not continue indefinitely.
He said: "We cannot sustain this indefinitely - these are interventions that are costing between €200m and €400m per week.
"And what I will do now in the coming weeks... is will explain the future of a scheme like that.
"The two principles I have is number one: we cannot sustain this indefinitely - but I also know turning it off abruptly will undo much of the good work that we've put in place.
"And then secondly, to try and change it in a way that ties in with income and jobs recovering in our country".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PĀNUI PĀPĀHOMEDIA STATEMENT
The Government has announced a major element of its COVID-19 rebuild plan with a law change that will fast track eligible development and infrastructure projects under the Resource Management Act to help get New Zealand moving again.
Environment Minister David Parker said the sorts of projects that would benefit from quicker consenting included roading, walking and cycling, rail, housing, sediment removal from silted rivers and estuaries, new wetland construction, flood management works, and projects to prevent landfill erosion.
The changes were approved by Cabinet last week and new legislation is expected to be passed in June.
“We are acting quickly to get the economy moving again and our people working. Part 2 of the RMA will still be applied. Projects are being advanced in time, but environmental safeguards remain,” David Parker said
“We went hard and early to beat the virus and now we’re doing the same to get the economy moving too.
“The consenting and approval processes that are used in normal circumstances don’t provide the speed and certainty we need now in response to the economic fallout from COVID-19. The new processes will get projects started sooner and people into jobs faster.
“Investment in infrastructure is central to the Government’s economic plan to keep New Zealanders in jobs. We have already signalled major projects as part of the $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade project.
“Ideas from district and regional councils as well as NGOs and the private sector will be considered.
“Job-rich projects like core infrastructure, housing, and environmental restoration are crucial to the Government's plan to stimulate the economy and help us recover from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Some large-scale government-led projects, including those in the NZTA’s Land Transport Programme, will be named in the legislation to go through the fast-track consent process. Some works by government agencies will be able to start “as of right”.
“Projects that help alleviate housing challenges, encourage active transport and enhance the environment are prioritised under the proposal,” David Parker said.
A number of “shovel-ready” projects identified by the Infrastructure Industry Reference Group are likely to be accelerated under the fast-track consenting process. These are “ready to go” developments which can start once the construction industry returns to normal.
The fast-track process is designed as a short-term intervention to help with economic recovery from COVID-19 and the legislation will be repealed in two years. Existing Treaty of Waitangi settlements will be upheld, as will sustainable management and existing RMA national direction.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: 'Shovel-ready' projects to bypass RMA in effort to reboot economy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cabinet has approved the fast-tracking of large shovel-ready projects, largely bypassing the Resource Management Act.
The announcement Sunday morning, from Environment Minister David Parker, comes as the Government continues to identify projects which could be begin sooner with a large injection of public money.
The aim is to boost the economy as it enters a sharp downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new act, due to be passed in June, would take away the ability of the public and councils to have an input into whether projects proceed and instead hand this power to small panels of experts, chaired by an Environment Court judge.
Parker said the sorts of projects that would benefit from quicker consenting included roading, walking and cycling, rail, housing, sediment removal, new wetland construction, flood management works, and projects to prevent landfill erosion.
Parker said projects that include transport, environmental benefits, and housing will be prioritised under the plan.
He said the changes were approved last week and new legislation is expected to passed in June.
"We are acting quickly to get the economy moving again and our people working. Part two of the RMA will still be applied. Projects are being advanced in time, but environmental safeguards remain," Parker said.
"The consenting and approval processes that are used in normal circumstances don't provide the speed and certainty we need now in response to the economic fallout from COVID-19. The new processes will get projects started sooner and people into jobs faster.
"Investment in infrastructure is central to the Government's economic plan to keep New Zealanders in jobs. We have already signalled major projects as part of the $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade project."

Parker said ideas from district and regional councils, as well as NGOs and the private sector, will among those considered.
"Job-rich projects like core infrastructure, housing, and environmental restoration are crucial to the Government's plan to stimulate the economy and help us recover from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here are the Two Reasons Why Bitcoin Investors are Fleeing Exchanges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin’s intense uptrend seen in the time following its mid-March meltdown has ushered in a significant influx of new capital to the market – a sign that retail traders largely thought that the crypto was undervalued at its recent lows.
This can be seen while looking towards the fact that margin traders have largely moved to the sidelines while spot traders take the reins.
Many of these spot buyers have also been moving their BTC away from centralized exchanges and into cold storage wallets, and it appears that there are two primary factors driving this trend.
Bitcoin’s explosive rally seen throughout the past few weeks has reached a turning point as the crypto struggles to surmount its overhead resistance within the lower-$9,000 region.
It is important to keep in mind that this recent uptrend was driven primarily by spot buying pressure from retail traders, which makes this movement different than the margin-driven ones seen in previous months.
It appears that the bulk of these retail investors who drove this rally are taking a long-term investment strategy as well, as data from research platform Glassnode shows that exchange’s BTC balances have dived throughout the course of this rebound.

This means that this Bitcoin has been moved away from exchanges and towards cold storage wallets – a sign that the investors who drove this movement aren’t planning to sell their BTC anytime soon.
According to a recent research report from Arcane, it appears that there are two primary factors driving the massive decline in exchanges’ BTC balances.
They explain that the first reason could be due to degrading trust in centralized exchange platforms, as many investors have blamed BTC’s mid-March meltdown on the BitMEX “hardware issues” that led investors to see an overwhelming cascade of liquidations.
It could also be rooted in the bullish possibility that investors turning to long-term investment strategies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Perfect Storm is Brewing for Bitcoin as Confluence of Bullish Factors Emerges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has seen some relatively involatile trading in the time following its recent rejection at $9,500, as the cryptocurrency has been able to stabilize within the upper-$8,000 region.
It is important to note that this stability has favored buyers due to the crypto being able to show some tempered signs of bullishness as it pushes up towards $9,000.
In order for it to see a continuance of its recent uptrend, it is imperative that the cryptocurrency’s bulls are able to push it past the heavy resistance that has been established within the lower-9,000 region.
Analysts are noting that there is a confluence of factors that could be just enough to give the crypto some serious momentum that sends it surging even higher in the days and weeks ahead.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading up over 2% at its current price of $8,970 – just a hair below its key near-term resistance at $9,000.
This marks a notable climb from daily lows of $8,700 that were set yesterday, and it does seem as though buyers have been able to establish this price level as a strong support region for the cryptocurrency.
BTC has faced a few notable rejections within the $9,000 region over the past couple of days. It first was rejected at $9,500 during the peak of its latest uptrend, before then facing another swift rejection at $9,200 yesterday.
It doesn’t appear that these were enough to thwart buyer’s momentum, however, as another test of this region is imminent.
One popular pseudonymous trader on Twitter explained in a recent tweet that there are a few factors that lead him to believe the crypto is bound to see further upside in the days ahead.
This analyst isn’t alone in being bullish on Bitcoin in the near-term, as another trader recently explained that the recapture of BTC’s 200-day moving average is likely to provide bulls with some serious near-term strength.
The same trader further went on to add that he doesn’t believe there are any legitimate reasons for Bitcoin to drop prior to its mining rewards halving – which is slated to occur in under two weeks from now.
The confluence of Bitcoin’s technical and fundamental strength seems to suggest that further upside is imminent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Every Time Bitcoin Flashed This Signal Since 2015, a Boom Followed. It’s Back</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bitcoin has been on an impressive run over the past few weeks, mounting past resistance after resistance despite a harrowing macroeconomic backdrop. Since the March lows of $3,700, BTC is up 150%, a stellar performance that puts almost any other $100 billion+ asset to shame.
Although impressive, Bitcoin continuing to set new local highs and holding above key support levels has allowed the cryptocurrency to print a confluence of extremely positive technical signs.
This trend continued on May 1st when Nunya Bizniz, a Bitcoin chartist and analyst, observed that the signal that preceded some of Bitcoin’s most important rallies over the past few years has just been spotted again.
Because Bitcoin’s value is largely derived from its network effect — which suggests that the value of a good or service is directly related to the number of consumers, often on an exponential scale  — BTC has long traded in a parabolic fashion.
Just look to the asset’s chart, which is filled to the brim with parabolic rallies and parabolic crashes, much unlike the slow-and-steady price action most often seen with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds.
This has made the Parabolic Stop-and-Run Reversal Indicator (PSAR) a natural fit for analyzing Bitcoin, according to a recent observation by Nunya Bizniz.
Referencing the chart seen above, he explained that in the wake of the six times this indicator has appeared in the past five years, Bitcoin saw “substantial upside.”
Such was the case at the start of 2019, when just prior to the 25% breakout on April 1st, the PSAR flipped bullish, marking the start of an over 300% rally. Similarly, the PSAR flipped bullish multiple times in the 2,000% 2017 rally to mark local highs and bullish continuations.
History repeating will see Bitcoin strongly break to the upside yet again in the coming weeks. Accentuating how strong this sign could be, Bizniz rhetorically asked: “Can this be interpreted any other way than bullish?”
Yet the PSAR flipping bullish is only one sign of many indicating that Bitcoin may soon benefit from a longer-term bull trend.
For one, Bitcoin’s strong rebound in April saw the cryptocurrency close its monthly candle above a key level of the Ichimoku Cloud on the one-month chart.
This is relevant for BTC because the last time Bitcoin claimed this technical level was in early 2016, when the cryptocurrency was trading around $500 and prior to the 4,000% rally that brought the cryptocurrency to $20,000 just 20 months later.
Adding to this, one trader noted that the leading crypto recently broke above a rising wedge formed from March’s lows until now. This is the exact same pattern hat marked the start of 2019’s bull run, which brought prices from the $4,000s to $14,000 in three months’ time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Even After 90% Crash from Highs, Analyst Thinks XRP is “Wildly Overpriced”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Since the blow-off top at $3.30 seen at the start of 2018, XRP has been in a consistent macro downtrend. Even as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies roared higher in mini bull markets, the cryptocurrency’s price has been muted, trending lower and lower over time with seemingly no bottom to speak of.
Chart from TradingView.com
XRP remains more than 90% below its all-time high as of the time of this article’s writing, despite the more than 100% rally from March’s capitulation lows.
Despite this harrowing macro performance, a crypto trader thinks the altcoin isn’t done bleeding out yet, recently writing:
It was an assertion that has been echoed by other crypto traders in recent weeks.
One pseudonymous derivatives trader explained that while the cryptocurrency may have “promising technology,” there is no guarantee that the promise of the technology will result in XRP experiencing gains that match those seen in 2017.
Referencing how the charts below look like XRP, the analyst wrote:
Chart from @CanteringClark (Twitter)
In terms of technicals, a top chartist warned that the cryptocurrency’s macro chart is one of the “scariest charts” out there, referencing the lack of historical liquidity on the downside and pointing to how XRP was rejected a key horizontal.

This bearish sentiment was echoed to a “T,” so to say, by Peter Brandt, a long-time commodities trader and Bitcoin bull. Brandt explained that the long-term chart of XRP is extremely bearish because there is only “white space below” its price, with little historical support or liquidity.
Brandt didn’t convey a prediction for XRP in accompaniment with the chart, but many took this statement as a sign that he sees the cryptocurrency falling to a price in the single-digit cents, and maybe even lower.
While it may seem like XRP is being singled out, a growing sentiment in the cryptocurrency trading community is that all altcoins are poised to underperform.
An analyst working for crypto research firm Blockfyre shared that he is reducing his exposure to altcoins because he believes Bitcoin’s block reward reduction will cause volatility that results in altcoins “getting rekt.”
The analyst continued that from how he sees it, altcoins are always a “game of musical chairs” as the reasons they are rallying are all “red flags,” not fundamental developments:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Coal India Ltd.’s shipments in April slumped 25.5% from a year earlier after more than a month-long nationwide lockdown halted economic activity, eroding demand for India’s most dominant energy source.
Shipments dropped to 39.1 million tons in the month, the Kolkata-based miner said in a filing late Friday. Output declined 10.9% to 40.4 million tons.
Global coal demand is heading for its biggest annual drop since World War II with burning the fuel to make electricity becoming unprofitable and socially untenable in several countries. The pandemic has only served to hasten its demise. The lockdown in India has shut factories and offices slashing electricity demand by about a quarter, affecting the use of coal and causing inventories to swell to record levels.z
India extended the stay-at-home restrictions for most parts of the country for another two weeks starting May 4.
“Coal India’s output is expected to remain muted until demand starts picking up,” Rupesh Sankhe, an analyst at Elara Capital India Pvt. in Mumbai, said before the company reported the data. “It will probably look at new customers, especially those that depend on imported coal, to shore up shipments.”
Despite the demand for the fuel crashing, the miner has set a higher output and shipments target for the fiscal year that began April 1 on expectations of a revival after the lockdown is lifted, coal minister Pralhad Joshi said last week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russia's Oil Output Rose Slightly in April Ahead of OPEC+ Cuts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Bloomberg) — Russia slightly increased its crude oil and condensate production in April ahead of the biggest-ever output cuts under the new OPEC+ deal.
The country’s producers pumped 46.45 million tons of oil last month, Interfax reported, citing preliminary data for April from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. The figure, which may be rounded, equates to about 11.349 million barrels a day on average, based on the standard 7.33 barrels-per-ton conversion ratio. Russia produced 11.298 million barrels a day in March.
That means, that like Saudi Arabia, Russia took the option of pumping more crude last month after the collapse of the previous pact between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, but the increase in output was much smaller. Saudi Arabia’s move to hike production, to an unprecedented 12 million barrels a day in early April, coincided with nationwide lockdowns amid the coronavirus outbreak and exacerbated a global oil glut.
Last month, OPEC+, spearheaded by de facto leader Saudi Arabia, agreed to joint output cuts across the group of 9.7 million barrels a day in May.
Saudi Aramco has already begun reducing oil production, ahead of the May 1 start, to achieve the agreed level of 8.5 million barrels a day, according to a Saudi industry official familiar with the matter.
Russia’s share of the cuts, which is equal to Saudi Arabia’s, is set to reach 2.5 million barrels a day of crude — condensate is excluded — in May and June. Constraints in output will be divided between all Russian producers, including small oil companies and operators of product-sharing agreements, proportionally to their share in nation’s total output, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in an interview with Interfax news agency earlier this week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Russian oil output jumped to 11.35 million bpd in April, ahead of cuts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia raised oil and gas condensate output in April to 46.45 million tonnes, or 11.35 million barrels per day (bpd), from 11.29 million bpd in March, Interfax reported on Saturday, before it makes cuts this month under a global supply pact.
The report, which cited Energy Ministry data, showed April's figure was the highest monthly average output since January 2019, when it was 11.38 million bpd.
Reuters uses the barrels/tonnes ratio of 7.33.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allied producers, a group known as OPEC+, agreed last month to cut their combined oil output by about almost 10 million bpd, or 10% of global supply in May and June to tackle the economic fallout from the new coronavirus.
The United States, Norway, Canada and Brazil may add cuts that would bring the total reduction to 20 million bpd, or 20% of global supply, although the coronavirus crisis has driven down demand by as much as 30%, driving down prices.
Russia is expected to cut its oil production by 2.5 million bpd from a baseline of 11 million bpd in May and June.
This number exempts production of gas condensate, or light oil. Russian energy ministry does not disclose gas condensate production separately.
TATNEFT'S REDUCTION
Russia's mid-sized oil producer Tatneft (MM:TATN) said on Saturday it produced 1.994 million tonnes of oil in April, down from 2.442 million tonnes in March.
The reduction amounted to around 90,000 bpd, or 16% from March. It did not say why it reduced output last month.
Tatneft cut output because storage capacity is full and European demand is weak, according to sources and data seen by Reuters last week.
The company operates in Tatarstan in central Russia which became the country's main oil province in the 1970s with output of 2 million bpd, helping the Soviet Union fund its arms race with the United States.
Russia has pledged to meet its commitments in full with output projected to fall to between 480 million and 500 million tonnes, or 9.6 million to 10 million bpd, this year, its first annual decline since 2008.
Natural gas production in April reached 55.14 billion cubic metres, a decline of 14.3% from the same month a year earlier, the Interfax news agency also reported.
It also said Russian oil exports increased 2.2% year on year to 83.79 million tonnes in the January-April period.

The company said it would return the funds due to the SBA’s “recently changed rules” and “inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore minister says RCEP trade deal on track for year-end signing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE — The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal is still on track to be signed by the end of 2020, Singapore’s Minister of Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said on Sunday.
RCEP brings together the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The countries have made an offer to India, which pulled out of talks last November, to see if it is prepared to rejoin discussions.
“If India is unable to rejoin the discussions in the coming month, then plans will continue to proceed with the legal scrubbing for the preparation for the siging at the end of the year,” Chan told reporters.
“At this point in time we are still on track for the signing by the RCEP countries at the end of the year,” he added.
Chan was speaking to reporters on Sunday to outline plans to restart Singapore’e economic activity after curbs put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Separately he said troubles at Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, one of Asia’s top oil traders, were not a reflection of the wider situation in the Singapore oil trading market. However, he said the wider oil trading market will be hurt by global oversupply issues. (Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by Michael Perry)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Singapore minister says RCEP trade deal on track for year-end signing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade deal is still on track to be signed by the end of 2020, Singapore's Minister of Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said on Sunday.
RCEP brings together the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The countries have made an offer to India, which pulled out of talks last November, to see if it is prepared to rejoin discussions.
"If India is unable to rejoin the discussions in the coming month, then plans will continue to proceed with the legal scrubbing for the preparation for the siging at the end of the year," Chan told reporters.
"At this point in time we are still on track for the signing by the RCEP countries at the end of the year," he added.
Chan was speaking to reporters on Sunday to outline plans to restart Singapore'e economic activity after curbs put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Separately he said troubles at Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, one of Asia's top oil traders, were not a reflection of the wider situation in the Singapore oil trading market. However, he said the wider oil trading market will be hurt by global oversupply issues.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LUSAKA — Glencore’s Zambian subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) will resume mining operations for 90 days but still expects to go ahead with its initial plan to place its mining operations on care and maintenance, the local firm said on Sunday.
Glencore’s original announcement that it planned to put MCM under “care and maintenance” sparked a backlash from Zambia’s government, which threatened to revoke the firm’s mining licenses saying it had not given enough notice.
Mopani said in a statement that constructive discussions had taken place with the Zambian government.
“During the 90-day period, Mopani will continue to engage with the government on potential solutions to its current challenges,” the statement said.
It said the health and safety of the workforce and surrounding communities was a top priority and Mopani would engage with its employees, relevant contractors and local communities regarding the restart of operations.
Mines ministry permanent secretary Barnaby Mulenga said Glencore had told the government last month that it wanted to keep operating its Zambian copper mining subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) rather than shutter operations. (Reporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Edmund Blair)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The wood artisans in Thammampatti are going through a rough pace during lockdown and they are pinning their hopes on government support to tide over the situation.
Known for their craftmanship internationally, most of the craftsmen are now struggling to make their ends meet.
P.Sengotavel, president, Thammampatti Wood Carvers Association, said that the business had been dull and with the lockdown, most of the workshops had halted work. They were not getting orders from foreign countries as well in the current situation.
N.Durairaj, a National Award winner from here, said that unlike previous years, they had not received much orders from the beginning of the year due to COVID-19. A few cases had been reported from their locality as well and this area had been marked as containment zone. Some of the craftsmen were hopeful of temple chariot works and those too had been affected. Some craftsmen were fulfilling previous orders. Most of them had taken loans to meet the needs, he said.
Currently, they did not have sufficient wood to carry out the work. While some craftsmen worked on their own, others had assistants and work had to be stopped as they could not follow physical distancing norms.
C.Srinivasan, an artisan, said the cash and ration relief announced by the government would not help them. There were over 150 craftsmen here and their families were struggling. With tourism being affected, they did not receive many orders and there were payment dues as well. “We usually bring wood from Thanjavur and Cuddalore districts and currently we do not have means for that as well,” he said.
He said the Central Cottage Industries Corporation and Poompuhar should procure their works directly from them. It would help them manage for the moment and procure raw materials for the next set of orders.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All the stores in Nakasero and Katwe are closed. People are instead bringing their old bicycles for repair, but we too have run out of spare parts. Some people have even resorted to using children’s bicycles,” he said
COVID-19 | TRANSPORT BANWhen President Yoweri Museveni announced the first 14-day lockdown period on March 18, there was a spike in demand for bicycles, according to several dealers on Market Street, Energy Centre, and Katwe in Kampala.However, they could not access their stores, because of the prevailing lockdown, which was in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Kampala City Traders Association spokesperson Issa Sekitto, most of their members who include bicycle dealers were taken unawares and had not made any contingency plans.Sekitto, who is an avid cyclist and former national cycling champion said he too was caught flat-footed when the ban on vehicular public and private transport was announced.
 “I tried to get my sports bicycle repaired, but could not access the spare parts needed. I am also stuck. I had hoped I would use my bicycle for going to the market to buy foodstuff,” he said.Meanwhile, Julius Ssali, a resident of Luteete in Wakiso said he was forced to retrieve a bicycle he bought some years ago to enable him go and supervise work in his gardens. “I had to bring it to Kasangati to get it fixed first,” he said. Another bicycle owner said somebody had offered him sh400,000 to buy his old bicycle, but he declined because it is what helps him carry stuff like matooke and charcoal to his home.According to sources, a dealer who imported a container full of bicycles, but kept them away from the prying eyes of the authorities run out of stock within a couple of days.
 Emmanuel Natuweta, a bicycle repairer and dealer in Wakiso’s Kasangati township said previously the average cost of a bicycle was sh250,000, but one could get a second-hand bicycle at sh100,000.“There are no bicycles for sale now. All the stores in Nakasero and Katwe are closed. People are instead bringing their old bicycles for repair, but we too have run out of spare parts. Some people have even resorted to using children’s bicycles,” he said.Simon Kafeero Ssegawa, another bicycle repairer at Kyetume in Wakiso said the cost of bicycle spare parts had more than doubled in recent weeks because they are not available on the market.  “Can you imagine tyres that used to cost between sh15,000 and sh25,000 now go for up to sh50,000. You can’t find pedals for less than sh10,000 anymore,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Utqiagvik sees record low after unusually warm April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UTQIAGVIK, Alaska — The temperature in Alaska’s northernmost city of Utqiagvik reached 20 degrees below zero on Wednesday, a record low for April 29 and the first record low since 2007.
“It’s also the latest in the season with a low of -20F or lower,” Rick Thoman said in a post on Twitter. Thoman is a climatologist with the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks. The previous record was a low of 24 degrees below zero on April 28, 1964.
“Of course, the record low is really just one day,” Thoman said. “For April as a whole, this was the sixth warmest April in the last century at Utqiagvik.”
Utqiagvik has also set or tied record high temperatures as well.
Thoman told the Alaska Energy Desk that “112 daily record highs have been set or tied.”
The most recent occurred on March 24, when a high of 22 degrees beat the previous record of 21 set in 2019, he said.
Utqiagvik is not the only one seeing this trend.
Sea ice plays a huge role in the fluctuations of temperatures, and with lower sea ice in the Arctic, record lows are harder to come by, opening up the Arctic to absorb sunlight and warmth, prolonging the warmer months and leading to a series of records high, KTVA-TV reported.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted a higher chance of warmer-than-normal temperatures for Utqiagvik during the month of May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hoteliers call for permanent reduction in VAT for tourism sector</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A group representing Irish hoteliers is calling for a permanent reduction in VAT for the tourism and hospitality industry.
The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) says it welcomes additional measures, announced on Saturday, to help businesses after the coronavirus pandemic.
The €6bn package of measures includes commercial rates being waived for three months, low-interest rate loans and the ‘warehousing’ of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months.
But the IHF claims they fall short, given the challenges facing Irish tourism.
IHF President Elaina Fitzgerald Kane says: "Specific sectoral supports are required for the tourism sector, particularly in relation to Government controlled costs, to mitigate the devastation that the COVID-19 crisis has caused the industry.
"We are calling for a permanent reduction in the tourism VAT rate, a waiver on local authority rates and charges until the impact of COVID-19 restrictions has abated and for a minimum of 12 months, as well as targeted liquidity measures to provide working capital for tourism businesses to survive and restart."
The group is also asking for a continuation of the job subsidy scheme.
It says about 85% of hotels across the country are closed, with many people laid off or on short-time.
"The priority must be to safeguard the 260,000 livelihoods supported by tourism businesses", Ms Kane adds.
It echoes comments from the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI), which last week called for a 0% VAT rate for tourism and hospitality for the period of the crisis - and for 12 months thereafter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hoteliers call for scrapping of Tourism Vat for 12 months during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Irish Hotels Federation is calling for a permanent reduction in the Tourism Vat rate.
Reacting to the Government's €6bn fund to support businesses after Covid-19, it says while welcome, the measures fall short.
At the moment about 85 per cent of hotels across the country are closed, with many people laid off or on short-time.
Irish Hotels Federation President, Elaina Fitzgerald-Kane said a number of steps are needed to help the hotels' sector:
Ms Fitzgerald-Kane said: "A big, big part for us is continuation of the wage subsidy scheme into recovery and equally VAT to be reduced, and what we are suggesting is 0% for 12 months and returning then to an increased rate thereafter.
"In some countries it has been 7%, it has previously been 9% in Ireland."
ICTU has said it will only support the Government's package to help businesses during Covid-19 if it is used to protect and create jobs.
While it says the supports announced yesterday are positive, it says it is important State aid applicants do not forget their responsibilities to workers.
More than 427,000 are having their wages subsidised by the State and 43,000 employers have already received subsidy payments.
Fergal O'Brien from business group IBEC has indicated that some firms will need yet more support to pay wages.
Mr O'Brien said: "For some companies particularly that are going to be facing a much higher cost base and lower revenue as a result of social distancing measures, Government will probably need to support those companies in very significant ways, possibly through a wage subsidy-type model."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Utqiagvik sees record low after unusually warm April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">UTQIAGVIK, Alaska — The temperature in Alaska’s northernmost city of Utqiagvik reached 20 degrees below zero on Wednesday, a record low for April 29 and the first record low since 2007.
“It’s also the latest in the season with a low of -20F or lower,” Rick Thoman said in a post on Twitter. Thoman is a climatologist with the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks. The previous record was a low of 24 degrees below zero on April 28, 1964.
“Of course, the record low is really just one day,” Thoman said. “For April as a whole, this was the sixth warmest April in the last century at Utqiagvik.”
Utqiagvik has also set or tied record high temperatures as well.
Thoman told the Alaska Energy Desk that “112 daily record highs have been set or tied.”
The most recent occurred on March 24, when a high of 22 degrees beat the previous record of 21 set in 2019, he said.
Utqiagvik is not the only one seeing this trend.
Sea ice plays a huge role in the fluctuations of temperatures, and with lower sea ice in the Arctic, record lows are harder to come by, opening up the Arctic to absorb sunlight and warmth, prolonging the warmer months and leading to a series of records high, KTVA-TV reported.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted a higher chance of warmer-than-normal temperatures for Utqiagvik during the month of May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dave Rubin is out of ideas, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dave Rubin, the YouTube talk show host with over a million subscribers, an audience that rivals many cable news shows, is probably best known as the “Why I Left the Left” guy.
That was the title of a video he did for the conservative site PragerU, which has been viewed more than 13 million times on YouTube and which Rubin says was the original title of his new debut book, since renamed “Don’t Burn This Book: Thinking for Yourself in an Age of Unreason.”
Now a self-described “freethinking classical liberal” or “old-school liberal,” he’s become the right’s favorite ex-leftist, an identity he uses to warn right-leaning audiences that the left will come to destroy all the freedoms they hold dear. He knows, he says, because he was one of them.
His publisher writes that “in a time of madness” the book will give “you the tools you need to think for yourself.”
A representative passage reads: “I want you to walk into a bar and order a full-bodied opinion. I want you to get absolutely wasted on facts until 3:00am, and then, when you’re just about ready to pass out, I want you to get another glass of reality and chug it.”
With that level of humor and sophistication, “Don’t Burn This Book” seems to signal that there’s nowhere for Rubin to go from here, because for all his relentless use of the word “ideas,” he doesn’t appear to have many.
In the book, Rubin proudly repeats a story he’s told many times before, about how he changed his entire worldview on racism after it was clear he was hopelessly unprepared for an interview with a black conservative radio host. He calls it “the best and worst moment” of his career.
Rubin, a former comedian, was only a few months removed from hosting his eponymous show for the progressive The Young Turks online network. He described the original version of the show as “a comedy panel talk show…like ‘The View’ meets ‘SportsCenter.'” For a political network, the show wasn’t particularly political.
Now hosting a new iteration of his show featuring long-form interviews with iconoclastic guests, in 2016 Rubin interviewed Larry Elder, a veteran conservative talk radio pugilist.
Elder challenged Rubin’s use of the phrase “systemic racism” by rattling off a series of contextless statistics about black-on-black crime and anecdotes about misreported incidents of police brutality.
Rubin, visibly flummoxed, folded.
Elder in just a few minutes had completely changed Rubin’s thinking about racism in America, namely that he now believes there basically is none, except that which comes from the woke left.
But Rubin’s newfound “freethinking” would not include challenging his new viewpoints by, for instance, hosting a Black Lives Matter activist or an expert on police brutality to express ideas that ran counter to Elder’s.
His mind had been changed, and no further discussion favorable to those bad “regressive” ideas he once held was necessary.
Through interviews on his show, Rubin linked up with the “Intellectual Dark Web,” a loosely affiliated group of online personalities generally bound together by a mutual loathing of left-wing censorship and “woke” identity politics. Then, as Jordan Peterson’s hype man on an international tour, he was able to reach a massive audience of mostly young people.
Now he’s a regular on various Fox News shows, and his YouTube show is re-broadcast on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze network. He also does regular paid appearances with Turning Point USA, the pro-Trump student group with close ties to the administration.
Though he’s very careful to never fully endorse President Donald Trump, he won’t articulate any meaningful criticism of him. In fact, Rubin recently gushed about briefly meeting President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and hosted the president’s son, Don Jr., for a backslapping appearance on his show.
Rubin’s interviewing style is to rely on “civility,” which in practice serves as a platform for the guest to present their arguments unchallenged. But that idea seems to apply only for one side.
In a 2019 interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, Rubin scolded her for making what he called “a “slippery slope” argument in comparing the Holocaust to slavery.
Guests like far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos (who said Jews control the banks and media), Stefan Molyneux (who said blacks have smaller brains than whites), and Lauren Southern (who defended Richard Spencer’s “white nationalism” as distinct from “white supremacism” – and whom Rubin later called “fearless“) were met with no pushback at all when making egregious statements on “The Rubin Report.”
If you’re at all familiar with Rubin’s show or Twitter feed, “Don’t Burn This Book” is unlikely to contain any surprises. Despite its provocative title, it’s hard to imagine anyone being so angered by a book loaded with the same milquetoast arguments that he’s been hammering for years.
He again posits that “classical liberalism” – essentially libertarianism in US political terms – is the true form of “liberalism,” which he says has been bastardized by progressives or anyone affiliated with the Democratic Party.
In a chapter titled, “Learn How to Spot Fake News,” he again refers to non-right-wing news outlets as being hopelessly inundated with left-wing “activists” and repeatedly puts the word “journalists” in scare quotes. True to form, he levels no criticism whatsoever for institutional bias or even the occasional inaccuracy at right-leaning outlets like Fox News.
Though he says he hates identity politics, Rubin never misses an opportunity to remind the reader that he’s a married gay man as evidence of his “liberal” bona fides.
Rubin touts his paid appearances at conservative events as proof of their open-mindedness and tolerance, especially compared to the rigidly dogmatic left.
And even when presented with an easy lay-up of an opportunity to take issue with Trump, he demurs. Writing about Trump’s border wall, something generally opposed by libertarians, Rubin refuses to take a stand, literally writing that he’s not advocating for it but also doesn’t oppose it. He adds with comedic flourish, “you could say I’m sitting on the fence – waka! waka!”
He makes gobsmackingly reductive arguments. Among them, the Nazis were actually of the left because the word “socialist” is in the National Socialist Party name and Hitler was an “art-loving vegetarian.” He argues that the disastrous and immoral US military intervention into Vietnam was good because “our contribution secured much-needed freedoms.”
Rubin the “old-school liberal” even deploys the old Republican saw about the “Democrat Party” being the party of slavery 160 years ago, as if neither party had undergone substantial philosophical and demographic shifts in the century-and-a-half since.
“Don’t Burn This Book” contains one of Rubin’s most oft-repeated lines about discussing “ideas, not people.” The point, if I surmise correctly, is that one should not attack one’s opponent with ad hominems, but engage their ideas.
He rarely lives up to this stated principle, or any of them.
His Twitter feed is loaded with name-calling and personal attacks on his political adversaries and the “mainstream media.” Rubin saves particular venom for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who he has called “an extraordinary idiot” and “a genuinely terrible person,” and outlets like Vox, The Daily Beast, and HuffPost, which he refers to as “Pox,” “The Daily Barf,” and “HuffPoop.”
Relatedly, he’s a self-described “free speech absolutist” who like Trump supports “mass lawsuits” against media organizations for libel. His book contains not even a passing mention of the many government-imposed conservative assaults on free speech.
He hates identity politics and the left, but presents himself as the “gay liberal” when flattering conservative audiences. He’s the former progressive and comic who now makes jokes about “HuffPoop.” He’s a brave freethinker, who keeps himself hermetically-sealed from potentially contentious interviews and debates.
And he’s branded himself as a paragon of “civility,” despite not being particularly civil to people with ideas that offend him.
Dave Rubin has one tune to play: “Why I Left the Left.” Given the opportunity to explore new ideas across more than 200 pages, it’s clear he hasn’t learned any new chords.
If you never criticize Trump or the right, but relentlessly shriek about “mainstream media,” the “Democrat Party,” and “social justice warriors” as threats to Western civilization, it’s hard to convincingly make the case that you’re not just a basic tribalist conservative media personality.
There’s only so long you can trade on a former political identity as the main credential for a new one, without offering any new ideas.

His mind had been changed, and no further discussion favorable to those bad “regressive” ideas he once held was necessary.
Through interviews on his show, Rubin linked up with the “Intellectual Dark Web,” a loosely affiliated group of online personalities generally bound together by a mutual loathing of left-wing censorship and “woke” identity politics. Then, as Jordan Peterson’s hype man on an international tour, he was able to reach a massive audience of mostly young people.
Now he’s a regular on various Fox News shows, and his YouTube show is re-broadcast on Glenn Beck’s The Blaze network. He also does regular paid appearances with Turning Point USA, the pro-Trump student group with close ties to the administration.
Though he’s very careful to never fully endorse President Donald Trump, he won’t articulate any meaningful criticism of him. In fact, Rubin recently gushed about briefly meeting President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and hosted the president’s son, Don Jr., for a backslapping appearance on his show.
Rubin’s interviewing style is to rely on “civility,” which in practice serves as a platform for the guest to present their arguments unchallenged. But that idea seems to apply only for one side.
In a 2019 interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, Rubin scolded her for making what he called “a “slippery slope” argument in comparing the Holocaust to slavery.
Guests like far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos (who said Jews control the banks and media), Stefan Molyneux (who said blacks have smaller brains than whites), and Lauren Southern (who defended Richard Spencer’s “white nationalism” as distinct from “white supremacism” – and whom Rubin later called “fearless“) were met with no pushback at all when making egregious statements on “The Rubin Report.”
If you’re at all familiar with Rubin’s show or Twitter feed, “Don’t Burn This Book” is unlikely to contain any surprises. Despite its provocative title, it’s hard to imagine anyone being so angered by a book loaded with the same milquetoast arguments that he’s been hammering for years.
He again posits that “classical liberalism” – essentially libertarianism in US political terms – is the true form of “liberalism,” which he says has been bastardized by progressives or anyone affiliated with the Democratic Party.
In a chapter titled, “Learn How to Spot Fake News,” he again refers to non-right-wing news outlets as being hopelessly inundated with left-wing “activists” and repeatedly puts the word “journalists” in scare quotes. True to form, he levels no criticism whatsoever for institutional bias or even the occasional inaccuracy at right-leaning outlets like Fox News.
Though he says he hates identity politics, Rubin never misses an opportunity to remind the reader that he’s a married gay man as evidence of his “liberal” bona fides.
Rubin touts his paid appearances at conservative events as proof of their open-mindedness and tolerance, especially compared to the rigidly dogmatic left.
And even when presented with an easy lay-up of an opportunity to take issue with Trump, he demurs. Writing about Trump’s border wall, something generally opposed by libertarians, Rubin refuses to take a stand, literally writing that he’s not advocating for it but also doesn’t oppose it. He adds with comedic flourish, “you could say I’m sitting on the fence – waka! waka!”
He makes gobsmackingly reductive arguments. Among them, the Nazis were actually of the left because the word “socialist” is in the National Socialist Party name and Hitler was an “art-loving vegetarian.” He argues that the disastrous and immoral US military intervention into Vietnam was good because “our contribution secured much-needed freedoms.”
Rubin the “old-school liberal” even deploys the old Republican saw about the “Democrat Party” being the party of slavery 160 years ago, as if neither party had undergone substantial philosophical and demographic shifts in the century-and-a-half since.
“Don’t Burn This Book” contains one of Rubin’s most oft-repeated lines about discussing “ideas, not people.” The point, if I surmise correctly, is that one should not attack one’s opponent with ad hominems, but engage their ideas.
He rarely lives up to this stated principle, or any of them.
His Twitter feed is loaded with name-calling and personal attacks on his political adversaries and the “mainstream media.” Rubin saves particular venom for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who he has called “an extraordinary idiot” and “a genuinely terrible person,” and outlets like Vox, The Daily Beast, and HuffPost, which he refers to as “Pox,” “The Daily Barf,” and “HuffPoop.”
Relatedly, he’s a self-described “free speech absolutist” who like Trump supports “mass lawsuits” against media organizations for libel. His book contains not even a passing mention of the many government-imposed conservative assaults on free speech.
He hates identity politics and the left, but presents himself as the “gay liberal” when flattering conservative audiences. He’s the former progressive and comic who now makes jokes about “HuffPoop.” He’s a brave freethinker, who keeps himself hermetically-sealed from potentially contentious interviews and debates.
And he’s branded himself as a paragon of “civility,” despite not being particularly civil to people with ideas that offend him.
Dave Rubin has one tune to play: “Why I Left the Left.” Given the opportunity to explore new ideas across more than 200 pages, it’s clear he hasn’t learned any new chords.
If you never criticize Trump or the right, but relentlessly shriek about “mainstream media,” the “Democrat Party,” and “social justice warriors” as threats to Western civilization, it’s hard to convincingly make the case that you’re not just a basic tribalist conservative media personality.
There’s only so long you can trade on a former political identity as the main credential for a new one, without offering any new ideas.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple provided its first glimpse at how the coronavirus has impacted its business on Thursday when it reported its second-quarter earnings. While Apple generated more revenue than analysts had expected, the quarter still looked far different than Apple had expected before the COVID-19 crisis upended daily life and rattled the economy.
The report provided some answers about how Apple’s core business segments are performing. But there’s still a big question lingering over the company’s business as the second half of 2020 approaches. And it didn’t come up once on Apple’s earnings call with analysts: How will the pandemic impact the development and reception of Apple’s anticipated 5G iPhone?
Recent reports have painted an unclear picture of what to expect from Apple’s typical fall iPhone launch. That’s critical because although Apple’s services and wearables divisions are growing, the iPhone still generates far more revenue for Apple than any other product. And the long-rumored iPhone 12, expected to be Apple’s first 5G iPhone, is projected to drive significant upgrades.
Some analysts, like those from JPMorgan and Wedbush Securities, think it’s plausible that Apple’s anticipated 5G iPhone could be delayed by a couple of months. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who has become the most reliable source of Apple leaks, has said some versions of Apple’s next iPhone may launch a few weeks later than planned, but will still likely debut in the fall timeframe.
If this is true, it wouldn’t be the first time Apple has launched new iPhones outside of its typical September release window. The iPhone X launched in November 2017 after being unveiled that September, while the iPhone XR debuted in October 2018.
Should that be the case this year, Apple would still benefit from launching its iPhone before the all-important holiday holiday season.
A bigger potential issue for Apple may not be whether the iPhone 12’s launch is delayed, but whether there will be enough demand for a high-end iPhone. With jobless claims in the US reaching 30 million over the past six weeks as the coronavirus has disrupted the economy, it’s unclear whether those in the window of an upgrade would be willing to pay nearly $1,000 for a new iPhone.
The Japanese financial news site Nikkei Asian Review reported in March that Apple has discussed delaying the release of the expected iPhone 12 because it’s concerned that “the current situation would significantly lower consumer appetite.”
Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed the current state of consumer demand on the call, saying that it has seen an uptick across the board in the second half of April. But for the most part, analysts didn’t question how the pandemic could impact future product development and demand.
Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, believes weak demand could be a risk for Apple and most other companies. Still, he doesn’t think Apple will be hurt in the long term.
“I think what’s important though is that [Apple] has a very strong balance sheet, and you have a management team that’s continuing to innovate and invest in their products and services,” Flax said to Business Insider. “It is likely that Apple is going to come out stronger on the other side.”
Given the high expectations around Apple’s 5G iPhone’s, it’s a little surprising that such concerns were not brought up when Apple executives fielded answers from analysts on Thursday. Even before the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro were announced last fall, analysts had pegged the upcoming 5G iPhone as being the jolt the company needed to pull Apple out of its iPhone sales slump.
It’s possible that the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro’s better-than-expected performance in Apple’s fiscal first quarter has calmed some of these concerns. Apple’s iPhone sales fell again in its fiscal second quarter, but expectations were already low considering Apple previously said it didn’t expect to meet its initial second-quarter revenue guidance.
Another possibility is that analysts didn’t want to bother asking a question that Apple wouldn’t be willing to address- or even have the answer to yet. When the subject came up on last quarter’s earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said global 5G deployment is still in its “early innings.”
Plus, there’s still time for production on a fall iPhone to ramp up, says Robert Muller, enterprise hardware analyst for RBC Capital Markets.
“The late July call will probably have questions on the issue,” Muller said to Business Insider via email. “However, again we know the answer will be ‘we don’t comment on future products.'”
While it’s true that Apple rarely if ever discusses upcoming products before they’re announced, that hasn’t stopped analysts from probing the tech giant about its roadmap in the past. Even on Thursday’s call, some questions about Apple’s forward-looking strategy did come up – just not as it relates to the 5G iPhone.
Overall, Apple’s second-quarter earnings didn’t reveal much that wasn’t already known. Yes, like just about every company, the COVID-19 crisis has posed challenges to Apple’s business. Yes, Apple’s services and wearables businesses are still doing very well, and are serving as a bright spot amid slowing iPhone sales as they have in other recent quarters.
And, above all, there’s still a lot of uncertainty about what the future may hold for the iPhone and Apple’s business more broadly. In an unusual move, Apple did not offer revenue guidance for the June quarter because of uncertainties around the virus in the near term.
Cook did say, however, that the company has adapted to working from home and that the iPhone SE and iPad Pro have proved the company’s business is continuing even during these difficult times.
“And so, while we can’t say for sure how many chapters are in this book,” Cook said, “we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Customers skip the line as warehouse, sample sales shift online amid pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER - Last year, more than 2,000 shoppers descended on a Toronto pop-up store, looking for deals at undergarment maker Knix's first warehouse sale. It was a success: the company sold out of most items during the three-day event and needed to double its staffing.
Knix planned a bigger event for April 2020 at a space four times larger, but scrapped that plan in favour of a virtual sale as the COVID-19 pandemic created insurmountable challenges for an in-person event.
"That became clear when we went to remote work and closed our stores," said founder and chief executive officer Joanna Griffiths.
Some retailers known for annual warehouse or seasonal sample sales are shifting those events online amid the pandemic and finding the digital switch offers new benefits such as broader customer reach, lower overhead and more consumer insights.
For Knix, the virtual event outstripped last year's in-person sale.
About 3,000 customers waited for the Knix site to go live at 10 a.m. April 23, the company said.
It sold more items in the first 10 minutes of this year's sale than over the three-day event in March 2019, and in just over an hour its sales outdid all of Black Friday. In the first 30 minutes, it rung up $500,000 in sales.
The success was welcome after the scramble to quickly shift the event online.
The company hustled to build two new websites for the virtual sale — one for Canadian consumers and one for Americans. It worked with its fulfillment centre, which was originally going to transport garments to the warehouse sale, to move inventory into the online system instead.
One of the biggest challenges to navigate would be managing the assortment of items.
The company had to work to remove or hide products from the website quickly as they run out, said Griffiths, to avoid frustrating customers.
Customers also couldn't try items on before committing to a final sale, meaning no returns allowed. Knix planned to make staff available for online support to help shoppers select sizes.
Sizing items virtually was also an issue for Hilary MacMillan, a Toronto-based womenswear brand, at a digital sample earlier this month.
The fashion brand founded in 2013 holds several such in-person events each year and had one planned for the end of April, said Lindsay Ditkofsky, the company's vice-president of brand development.
The coronavirus pandemic prompted the label to shift the sale online. The label, which sells runway samples initially created to clothe models much taller than the average consumer, knew sizing could be problematic in the virtual space.
"There's always a challenge when it comes to how does something fit a body," said Ditkofsky, adding the company attempted to overcome that problem by providing detailed item descriptions and accurate size charts.
Knix realized the online process would be smoother for customers in some ways.
In 2019, eager customers lined up around an entire block of downtown Toronto. With a virtual sale, there's no waiting in line, Griffiths said.
Shoppers didn't have to navigate a large space filled with clothes either. All the products were laid out neatly online with about 20 staff available over live chat to answer questions.
This makes for an easier shopping experience, said Griffiths.
Hilary MacMillan saw some benefits to the business as well.
"Any time you do something digital, there's sort of a paper trail," said Ditkofsky.
Website analytics showed the company where visitors were located, how many were coming to the site for the first time and other metrics that a brick-and-mortar sale doesn't provide, she said.
It also allowed the company to reach more customers than just those near its Toronto studio space, which it uses for the sales and personal appointments.
"We reached a totally new level of customer that we haven't been able to touch before with this kind of event."
Griffiths has started suggesting to her industry peers that they should think about moving warehouse sales online as well, though she's yet to hear of another company planning a similar move.
Vancouver-based clothing retailer Aritzia Inc. holds an annual, multi-day warehouse sale in Vancouver. The company declined an interview request.
"At this point, no decisions have been made regarding our warehouse sale," wrote Anna Cordon, senior manager of public relations.
For Knix and Hilary MacMillan, the switch to a virtual warehouse sale may become permanent.
Griffiths expects the company will hold next year's event online regardless of whether physical distancing restrictions are still in place.
"Now that we've done all this work and ... we think it's better for so many reasons, I think this will be a virtual, annual thing," she said.
The fashion label, on the other hand, wants to incorporate the digital component while continuing in-person events, said Ditkofsky.
Both women believe Canadian consumers, who are often criticized for lagging behind Americans in e-commerce, will become more comfortable shopping online during the pandemic, especially as more retailers move their stores online and finesse the digital experience.
"I think that Canadians are more comfortable shopping online than we give them credit for," said Griffiths.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 2, 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Customers skip the line as warehouse, sample sales shift online amid pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER — Last year, more than 2,000 shoppers descended on a Toronto pop-up store, looking for deals at undergarment maker Knix's first warehouse sale. It was a success: the company sold out of most items during the three-day event and needed to double its staffing.
Knix planned a bigger event for April 2020 at a space four times larger, but scrapped that plan in favour of a virtual sale as the COVID-19 pandemic created insurmountable challenges for an in-person event.
"That became clear when we went to remote work and closed our stores," said founder and chief executive officer Joanna Griffiths.
Some retailers known for annual warehouse or seasonal sample sales are shifting those events online amid the pandemic and finding the digital switch offers new benefits such as broader customer reach, lower overhead and more consumer insights.
For Knix, the virtual event outstripped last year's in-person sale.
About 3,000 customers waited for the Knix site to go live at 10 a.m. April 23, the company said.
It sold more items in the first 10 minutes of this year's sale than over the three-day event in March 2019, and in just over an hour its sales outdid all of Black Friday. In the first 30 minutes, it rung up $500,000 in sales.
The success was welcome after the scramble to quickly shift the event online.
The company hustled to build two new websites for the virtual sale — one for Canadian consumers and one for Americans. It worked with its fulfillment centre, which was originally going to transport garments to the warehouse sale, to move inventory into the online system instead.
One of the biggest challenges to navigate would be managing the assortment of items.
The company had to work to remove or hide products from the website quickly as they run out, said Griffiths, to avoid frustrating customers.
Customers also couldn't try items on before committing to a final sale, meaning no returns allowed. Knix planned to make staff available for online support to help shoppers select sizes.
Sizing items virtually was also an issue for Hilary MacMillan, a Toronto-based womenswear brand, at a digital sample earlier this month.
The fashion brand founded in 2013 holds several such in-person events each year and had one planned for the end of April, said Lindsay Ditkofsky, the company's vice-president of brand development.
The coronavirus pandemic prompted the label to shift the sale online. The label, which sells runway samples initially created to clothe models much taller than the average consumer, knew sizing could be problematic in the virtual space.
"There's always a challenge when it comes to how does something fit a body," said Ditkofsky, adding the company attempted to overcome that problem by providing detailed item descriptions and accurate size charts.
Knix realized the online process would be smoother for customers in some ways.
In 2019, eager customers lined up around an entire block of downtown Toronto. With a virtual sale, there's no waiting in line, Griffiths said.
Shoppers didn't have to navigate a large space filled with clothes either. All the products were laid out neatly online with about 20 staff available over live chat to answer questions.
This makes for an easier shopping experience, said Griffiths.
Hilary MacMillan saw some benefits to the business as well.
"Any time you do something digital, there's sort of a paper trail," said Ditkofsky.
Website analytics showed the company where visitors were located, how many were coming to the site for the first time and other metrics that a brick-and-mortar sale doesn't provide, she said.
It also allowed the company to reach more customers than just those near its Toronto studio space, which it uses for the sales and personal appointments.
"We reached a totally new level of customer that we haven't been able to touch before with this kind of event."
Griffiths has started suggesting to her industry peers that they should think about moving warehouse sales online as well, though she's yet to hear of another company planning a similar move.
Vancouver-based clothing retailer Aritzia Inc. holds an annual, multi-day warehouse sale in Vancouver. The company declined an interview request.
"At this point, no decisions have been made regarding our warehouse sale," wrote Anna Cordon, senior manager of public relations.
For Knix and Hilary MacMillan, the switch to a virtual warehouse sale may become permanent.
Griffiths expects the company will hold next year's event online regardless of whether physical distancing restrictions are still in place.
"Now that we've done all this work and ... we think it's better for so many reasons, I think this will be a virtual, annual thing," she said.
The fashion label, on the other hand, wants to incorporate the digital component while continuing in-person events, said Ditkofsky.
Both women believe Canadian consumers, who are often criticized for lagging behind Americans in e-commerce, will become more comfortable shopping online during the pandemic, especially as more retailers move their stores online and finesse the digital experience.
"I think that Canadians are more comfortable shopping online than we give them credit for," said Griffiths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Federal Reserve is no longer the central bank it used to be.
In a matter of weeks, the steadily expanding US economy slipped into its worst recession in nearly a century. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, spending froze, and credit health tanked. While the Fed’s response began with its traditional financial-crisis playbook – pushing interest rates to the floor and buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities – a shift was brewing.
Then, on March 20, the monetary authority’s role changed. The Fed announced it would begin buying corporate bonds for the first time in its 107-year history, offering aid for cash-strapped businesses large and small. That facility marked a paradigm shift to the central bank’s code and separated the Fed from its originally intended role in the US economy.
“The big concern is that the line between the function of the Fed and the Treasury is getting blurred,” Bruce Mizrach, professor of economics at Rutgers University, said, adding past bailouts, commercial or municipal, were handled by the latter and not the former.
He added: “That’s a larger function than what was envisioned for the Fed, and once you assume those responsibilities, it then becomes harder to back away.”
Until the financial crisis, the Fed’s primary tool was its benchmark interest rate. When the 2008 meltdown hit and rates were pushed to zero, the Fed turned to the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and other unconventional assets.
To combat the coronavirus downturn the central bank expanded its toolbox once more. The Fed’s corporate bond purchases were initially exclusive to investment-grade debt before an expansion incorporated so-called fallen angels, companies that recently slipped from high-quality ratings to junk status.
“The use of high-yield purchases is designed explicitly to say, ‘look, if you were an investment-grade company before March 223 and you got downgraded because of COVID, that shouldn’t have happened,'” Lauren Goodwin, economist at New York Life Investments, said in an interview.
The Fed’s own leaders have acknowledged the shift, with Dallas branch president Robert Kaplan telling Fox Business on Friday that the bank’s role includes serving as “a lender of last resort.”

Still, experts worry that the move into risky debt purchases will make an eventual recovery more turbulent than usual. The Fed doesn’t want to be seen as impeding market dynamics, but its move from stable Treasury bonds to corporate credit has already changed valuations across the board.
In the days following the Fed’s March 23 announcement, corporate bonds retraced sharp declines. The stock market enjoyed an indirect boost, as investors viewed the policy as a strong backstop for risk assets.
“The problem with official intervention in markets is you’re no longer letting the market determine prices. So what is the right valuation?” Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon, said, adding “the possibility that the Fed will broaden the scope of its interventions” is even affecting prices in sectors ineligible for Fed lending.
Even if market valuations normalize and account for the Fed’s policy, closing its facilities in the wake of the economic downturn will drive violent price swings all over again, Goodwin warned.
“The rollback of these programs and the timing of that rollback is going to be an enormous focus for investors and it will absolutely prompt market volatility,” she said.
Where some are worried about the scope of the Fed’s latest measures, others point to their size as a serious long-term risk.
Through quantitative easing programs from 2010 to 2015, the Fed’s balance sheet roughly doubled to $4.5 trillion. It took until September 2019 to unwind about $800 billion from its balance sheet, yet the subsequent repo crisis and coronavirus pandemic undid four years of progress in a matter of weeks. From February 24 to April 27, the Fed added another $2.5 trillion to its balance sheet.
The race to pad markets resulted in “a buying spree of epic proportions,” JPMorgan economists wrote in a Tuesday note. The central bank’s purchases show no signs of stopping, with five of its nine lending facilities yet to begin operations. Experts expect the Fed’s holdings to land between $7 trillion $10 trillion by the end of the year, dwarfing the expansion seen during the financial crisis.

Reversing the balance sheet explosion poses its own threat. Shrinking it before the economy has stabilized could drive price volatility and impede the Fed’s efforts to avoid market influence, Reinhart said. He also noted that acting too late puts the environment at risk of deflation, where prices stop increasing at a healthy rate.
The central bank must also gain approval from the Treasury to close its lending facilities, and the department’s leaders may decide against pulling back on corporate aid.
“Facilities are going to be tough to unwind and they will linger. They are going to wait until it’s absolutely the case that the economy is on solid footing and the expansion is underway,” Reinhart said.
There’s still hope among experts that the Fed can return to its independent, market-independent state. Much of the Fed’s emergency measures were made at the behest of Congress and the Treasury. Placing the onus on elected officials leaves the Fed and its appointed leaders from venturing too far out of its historic jurisdiction, Goodwin said.
“If you think this is a huge overstep and you’re worried about free markets, it’s really important to know this isn’t just the Fed acting on its own,” Goodwin said.
He concluded: “The next crisis will probably look different. What policymakers have shown is not only that they can be creative in addressing an acute market functioning issue … but that they’re willing to adapt and adjust the policies as necessary.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The charity’s director general Hilary McGrady has said ‘a sharp drop in income’ is threatening the future of nature sites and staff.
The National Trust is set to lose up to £200 million this year due to the coronavirus crisis, the charity says.
The conservation organisation is now appealing to the Government for “urgent, practical” support after they had to halt a number of projects due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Director general Hilary McGrady has said “a sharp drop in income” is threatening the country’s environmental sector.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, the charity boss estimated the trust “lost about 50% of our annual income literally overnight” when they closed earlier this year.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Ms McGrady urged ministers to step in and “address nature, wildlife and environmental organisations with an immediate offer of support,” given that they had thanked a number of manufacturing businesses.
She also called on Government to be environmentally-minded in its economic recovery plan, and added: “Delivering green infrastructure will create new jobs and makes economic sense and there have been some encouraging signs from Government.
“No doubt some will argue for high-tariff fixes […] in some cases cutting back on environmental checks and spending to deliver these.
“Others will want the Government to dilute its proposed new nature-friendly farming legislation. They must not win.”
The boss of the largest conservation charity in the UK believes “if we sacrifice the environmental progress we have made, everyone will suffer.”

She also called on Government to be environmentally-minded in its economic recovery plan, and added: “Delivering green infrastructure will create new jobs and makes economic sense and there have been some encouraging signs from Government.
“No doubt some will argue for high-tariff fixes […] in some cases cutting back on environmental checks and spending to deliver these.
“Others will want the Government to dilute its proposed new nature-friendly farming legislation. They must not win.”
The boss of the largest conservation charity in the UK believes “if we sacrifice the environmental progress we have made, everyone will suffer.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: Why Elon Musk’s tweet on Tesla stock price is problematic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla lost $14 million in valuation hours after co-founder and CEO Elon Musk Friday tweeted, “Tesla stock price is too high imo”. Musk personal stake too went down by about $3 billion following the tweet.
This is not the first time that Musk has given statements about his company through social media. In 2018, Musk tweeted he was thinking about taking the company private, which cost him his role as chairman. “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,” he tweeted in August 2018. After his tweet, Tesla’s stock price increased by more than 6 per cent and closed up at 10.98 per cent from the previous day. Recently, a federal judge said Musk and Tesla must face a lawsuit filed by the shareholders regarding this tweet.
How significant are such tweets?
While they are just tweets, their consequences raise questions if it is legal for CEOs of companies to share such information through their social media accounts.
In its 2018 complaint against Musk, the US Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) referred to his comments as “false” and “misleading” and referred to him as “reckless”. As per an agreement between SEC and Musk, his tweets regarding the company’s finances and sales, etc. need to be vetted by a company lawyer.
“Musk’s statements, disseminated via Twitter, falsely indicated that, should he so choose, it was virtually certain that he could take Tesla private at a purchase price that reflected a substantial premium over Tesla stock’s then-current share price, that funding for this multi-billion dollar transaction had been secured, and that the only contingency was a shareholder vote. In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,” SEC noted in its complaint.
In 2012, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was investigated by the SEC after he announced on social media that Netflix subscribers had surpassed 1 billion hours of viewing time.
“Congrats to Ted Sarandos, and his amazing content licensing team. Netflix monthly viewing exceeded 1 billion hours for the first time ever in June. When House of Cards and Arrested Development debut, we’ll blow these records away. Keep going, Ted, we need even more!” Hastings said in July 2012.

So then, are CEOs allowed to make such announcements through social media?
Following their investigation of Hastings’s comments, the SEC came to the conclusion that companies could use social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to announce key information as long as investors have been alerted about where to look for company-related updates and announcements.
In a report prepared by SEC into the investigation, the body noted that prior to Hastings’s comment, he had not received information from the company’s chief financial officer (CFO), the legal department or investor relations department. “Netflix’s stock continued a rise that began when the market opened on July 3, increasing from $70.45 at the time of Hastings’s Facebook post to $81.72 at the close of the following trading day,” the report said.
Essentially, the investigation into his post raised questions regarding the application of Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) to his post and the applicability of the Commission’s August 2008 Guidance on the Use of Company Web Sites to emerging technologies including social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Regulation FD was adopted to check if issuers were selectively disclosing important non-public information to security analysts and selected institutional investors before making full disclosure of the same information.
Regulation FD and the Exchange Act prohibit public companies or persons acting on their behalf “from selectively disclosing material, nonpublic information to certain securities professionals, or shareholders where it is reasonably foreseeable that they will trade on that information, before it is made available to the general public”.
In conclusion, the SEC does not discourage the use of social media by companies or people who represent them to communicate information as long as investors know about these channels of communication.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bizarre Elon Musk tweets wipe almost €12bn off Tesla's share price</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About US$13bn (€11.7bn) was wiped off Tesla's shares after chief executive Elon Musk tweeted that the electric car company's "stock price is too high".
In a series of other tweets, Mr Musk (48) also said he was "selling almost all physical possessions" and "will own no house".
He added his girlfriend was "mad at me".
The subsequent 9% drop in Tesla share prices erased about US$3bn (€2.7bn) from Mr Musk's own stake.
Nevertheless, they remain almost 50% up from the start of April.
The Wall Street Journal said Mr Musk responded to an e-mail asking whether he was joking, or whether his tweet was vetted, by saying: "No."
It is not the first time Mr Musk has sent provocative tweets.
In April 2019, he posted: "My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point."
In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private.
It led to a fraud case by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which Mr Musk settled by agreeing to pay US$20m (€18.1m) and have a Tesla lawyer pre-screen tweets with important information about the company.
The latest posts on social media are not the only controversy Mr Musk has found himself in this week.
He described coronavirus lockdowns as "forcibly imprisoning people in their homes" and "fascist".
Mr Musk said he did not know when Tesla could resume production in California - and called the state's stay-at-home order a "serious risk" to the business.
He added: "To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
"This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom!"

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tesla stocks are too damn high, or something like that. At least that’s what Elon Musk said on Twitter earlier today, “Tesla stock price is too high imo.” It appears that, once again, the stock market was listening.
As Ars Technica points out, before Musk sent that tweet, Tesla stock was around $US760 ($1,184) a share, but 20 minutes later it dropped to $US722 ($1,124), or five per cent lower. As of the writing of this article, Tesla stock sits at $US702 ($1,093) a share, or $US80 ($125) less than yesterday’s closing price. At the moment, about $US14 ($22) billion has been wiped from the market value of Tesla.
This isn’t the first time Musk has tweeted something that got him in trouble. In August 2018, he claimed that Tesla had secured funding to take Tesla private at $US420 ($654) per share. But the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against him for that tweet (and others), saying that he violated market-manipulation laws. In the lawsuit, the SEC sought to remove Musk as Tesla’s CEO as well as one of its board members.
The SEC won the case, resulting in Musk and Tesla being ordered to pay $US40 ($62) million in penalties to harmed investors. The settlement included provisions that required him to have Tesla approve any and all of his communications (including Tweets) that could affect stock price before he made them public. However, the SEC made a second filling against Musk in March 2019 for not having any of his tweets officially approved. It seems like Musk would be in the wrong again here, given that Tesla stock prices fell soon after his ‘Tesla stock is too high’ tweet. (Hey, maybe he got that boneheaded tweet approved!) Tesla did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment, we’ll update this post when we receive a reply.
The original filing did not specify a time frame on that provision, only that Musk would be ineligible to be re-elected Chairman for three years, so not until 2021. It’s conceivable that he’ll still need a Twitter babysitter regardless. Or maybe just a babysitter in general. Today, The Wall Street Journal reached out to Musk to ask if he was joking or if he had his tweet vetted. He responded with a short, “No.”
It’s been a crazy week for Musk, to say the least. He went on an earnings call rant, claiming that covid-19 lockdown policies were akin to fascism, tweeted “FREE AMERICA NOW,” and pulled NASA into the mess by dismissing a reporter for asking a covid-19 related question. Oh, and he claims he’s selling almost all of his physical possessions, including his house, to devote himself to Mars and Earth. His GF is mad at him for saying that, but at least Musk made the stipulation that whoever buys his home can’t tear it down since it was once Gene Wilder’s home, and its soul must remain intact.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MEDIA STATEMENT
Strong international demand for New Zealand’s food, despite the global effects of COVID-19, could help provide a springboard to get more Kiwis into primary sector jobs, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor said.
“The latest provisional trade statistics show our apples and kiwifruit continue to be star performers, with $890 million of fruit exported between 1 February and 22 April 2020,” Damien O’Connor said.
“Our dairy and meat sectors are also holding their own into April and they shipped products to overseas customers worth $6.18 billion over the same period.
“Overall primary sector export revenue remains higher into April than for the same period in 2018, despite the forestry sector essentially being shut down over the past month. Now we’ve moved into Alert Level 3, industries affected by the lockdown such as forestry and wool are back into action and that will help.
“The strength of New Zealand’s primary sector coupled with the success of our health response to COVID-19 gives us a head-start on the world as we get our economy moving again.
“Our primary sector contributes over $46 billion dollars a year in exports to our economy and provides jobs for hundreds of thousands of people in our rural communities. These latest stats show the sector is in a strong position to help us reboot our economy.
Mr O’Connor said the primary sector will need about 50,000 more people in a post-COVID-19 world.
“There are jobs going all over the country ranging from hands on work in orchards, on farms, in forests and fishing boats, to professional roles in engineering, science and management.
“The Government is working alongside the primary sector to help ensure workers get to the places they are needed. We’re currently investigating further ways we can boost the primary sector workforce through the Government’s $100m redeployment scheme.
“I’ve been impressed by the way the primary sector, government agencies and others have come together to support each other, further reinforcing that our team of 5 million is just as important now as during the lockdown,” Damien O’Connor said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kickstarter Prepares To Shed 'Up To 45-Per Cent' Of Staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kickstarter has been transparent that, as a result of the pandemic, the number of fundraising projects on the platform is nowhere near normal. Today, the company confirmed to Gizmodo that shrinking revenues have forced it to drastically reduce staff.
The economic impacts of coronavirus have been dramatic and difficult to predict: massive unemployment is an expectation when whole swaths of the economy shut down overnight, while farmers destroying their food and the collapse of the online ad market were far less obvious. With no physical footprint, Kickstarter would appear to be well positioned to weather this crisis, but that hasn’t been the case.
“While people are continuing to support live projects on Kickstarter as normal, the COVID crisis has led to a 35% drop in live projects from a year ago,” David Gallagher, Kickstarter’s senior communications officer, told Gizmodo in an email. (Less than a month ago, the company stated that “the number of live projects on Kickstarter is down about 25% from this time last year,” suggesting the financial situation is continuing to worsen.) “Fees on funded projects are our only source of income. Our margins were already thin before the crisis, and we don’t know when this situation will turn around,” Gallagher stated.
The news of staff reductions was first made public by OPEIU, the union which Kickstarter employees successfully joined in February, becoming the first major tech company to organise. According to the union, members “voted tonight to ratify a lay-off agreement with the crowdfunding company after CEO Aziz Hasan announced sweeping layoffs of up to 45 per cent of employees.”
Gallagher contests the 45-per cent figure, and while the union solely refers to these reductions as layoffs, Gallagher indicated the staff reductions include some amount of voluntary buyouts. “When we know which employees are interested in leaving voluntarily, we will be able to look at those roles and the company’s strategic needs, and better understand the scale of any layoffs that may be required,” he wrote.
Both Kickstarter and the union agree on the terms which were negotiated for departing employees, however, which include four months’ reverence, up to six months’ health insurance, and the ability to return to their current roles within a year if the company is in a position to hire for them.
“It’s devastating that so many of our brilliant, passionate colleagues are being let go. But I’m incredibly proud that we were able to leverage our collective power to assure that the terms of our severance are generous, uplifting and well-tailored to the specific needs of our unique workforce,” Oriana Leckert, a Kickstarter employee and member of the union bargaining committee wrote in a statement.
“We all wish we could have avoided this situation, but the outcome of these negotiations is better because of the open and collaborative process we undertook with the union,” Gallagher wrote. “We will have to say goodbye to colleagues and that is never easy. But we believe this agreement offers security to those we are letting go, and ensures Kickstarter can weather this crisis and serve its mission.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can I buy non-essentials on e-commerce sites: Here is what you should know</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi, May 02: There have been queries on whether e-commerce sites can deliver non-essentials during the extended lockdown by another two weeks.
The Ministry of Home Affairs issued guidelines for activities which will be permitted and prohibited across India's red, orange and green zones. The guidelines are largely aimed at gradually allowing businesses and individuals to resume their normal life.
The government has said that the sale of non-essential items through e-commerce platforms shall be allowed in those areas which have very few or no cases of coronavirus.
This means that non-essentials will be allowed only in the orange and green zones. The government however makes it clear that sale of non-essentials will not be allowed to resume in the red zones until further notice.
This means if you live in a city such as Delhi, Mumbai or Bengaluru, which have been classified as red zones, then you will not be allowed to buy non-essential items. The non-essential items could include things such as mobiles, laptops etc.
It may be recalled that the government had earlier said that it would ease restrictions on e-commerce websites from April 20 onwards. However that order was revoked.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lockdown 3.0: You can buy smartphones, laptops but here’s the fine print</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">E-commerce platforms can resume the sale of non-essential goods, including smartphones, laptops and personal computers, even after the government extended the lockdown by another two weeks after May 4 amid the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the country.
The Union ministry of home affairs issued guidelines for activities, which will be permitted and prohibited in varying degrees, across India’s red, orange and green zones to gradually allow businesses and individuals to resume their normal life.
However, there are some conditions which apply to the sale of smartphones and other such electronic goods online. The government hasn’t clarified whether brick-and-mortar stores can also start selling phones as well as laptops in green zones.
The sale of non-essential items through e-commerce platforms will only be allowed in those areas which have no or fewer cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to the MHA guidelines.
So, they will be able to deliver non-essential items only in those areas that have been marked under orange and green zones.
However, they have not been allowed to resume sales and delivery of non-essential items in the red zones until further notice.
So if you are in Delhi and Mumbai and under a red zone, you won’t be able to order any non-essential items.
The government had given a go-ahead to e-commerce platforms to resume full operations earlier as well. It had said it would ease the restrictions on e-commerce websites from April 20 but had revoked that order.
