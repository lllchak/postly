    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aries
March 21- April 19
You like to take charge of your destiny but let fate intervene. Accepting a last-minute invitation, ‘talking’ to the new person at work or joining a forum could lead to pleasantly surprising developments. Diversions are where possibilities lay, whether it’s discovering common ground with a colleague or meeting an interesting online mutual friend so stay off the beaten track.
Taurus
April 20-May 20
Patience is a virtue many human beings lack. You however, have it in spades. In recent months though for obvious and less obvious reasons yours has been stretched to the absolute limit. If you don't do something to decompress today you could well blow a gasket. It's your birthday season so do something to spoil yourself.
Gemini
May 21-June 21
Playing it safe isn’t really part of your makeup. You love spontaneity and being a bit impulsive. Today it will pay to take a chance, whether it’s doing something very ‘not you’, making a controversial statement or asking an acquaintance for their phone number. Daring to be different will win admirers, so be brave and bold!
Cancer
June 22-July 22
Has something seemed a little bit amiss or is it you that's actually missing something? If so the mystery piece of the jigsaw puzzle or lost item is bound to present itself. Heightened cosmic clarity will also give you some insight into a friend’s nature or motivation and you’ll probably see that your suspicions weren’t altogether unfounded.
Leo
July 23-August 22
Fire signs, particularly Felines, operate at a brisk pace but today it's best to take your foot off the accelerator and make an effort to ‘live in the moment’. During your 'lunch break' kick off your shoes and walk on lush grass, get your feet wet or scrunch in sand - it'll reset your internal clock.
Virgo
August 23-September 22
Discussions about children or your own 'brain child' whether you’re experiencing your own issues or a friend's using you as a sounding board are likely to occur. Yes it's tricky times, those who can afford to be present whether it involves work or supervising children may be prone to helicoptering. The best thing to do right now is lean out.
Libra
September 23-October 22
The cosmic conditions are ideal for intimate gatherings and all forms of entertaining, preferably at home. How is that going to happen? If it’s been a while since you invited friends for lunch or cooked a Sunday dinner a wave of hospitality will inspire you to showcase your culinary prowess ... in more modern and technical ways.
Scorpio
October 23 – November 22
Today you might need to navigate your way through a tricky situation. And although you're a sensitive water sign that's stronger than most you may engage in a conflict, most likely with a Taurus. The stars are enhancing your assertive qualities so you’ll be able to make your point effectively, but without burning any bridges.
Sagittarius
November 23-December 20
With sexy Venus in your relationship sector it’s unlikely that your love life has been anything but dull. However, if it could use a little extra spice don’t wait for Cupid to strike and take aim yourself. Join a dating app and connect with someone online or plan a romantic evening with your partner.
Capricorn
December 21-January 19
Like most of us you probably have a bit of extra time on your hands and as sentimentality takes hold you could be flicking through old photo albums or reminiscing about a childhood friend. Some of you might go one step further and try to track them down on social media or organise a reunion via Zoom.
Aquarius
January 20-February 18
Creative self-expression is very important to you right now, and while you’re willing to work with others you’ll want the last word on any joint projects. In fact, guidelines of any sort will be stifling so try to be as autonomous as possible. Having said that, also accept situations in which you can’t act alone.
Pisces
February 19-March 20
You’re known for being sensitive, caring and an endless source of support. But, as the empath of the zodiac you sometimes overextend yourself and absorb other people's emotions and problems which can lead to you feeling depleted. Today you may be pulled in several directions so it's time to put some boundaries in place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">May 3: Your daily horoscope</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Week Ahead Stars for Sunday, May 3rd
BIRTHDAY SUNDAY:You cannot possibly be the best at everything, so don't waste your time and energy trying. Cut back on your ambitions this year and focus only on the two or three goals that are easiest to reach. That's not an admission of failure, it's a sign of maturity.
ARIES (March 21 - April 20):A relationship or friendship has been a lot of fun but now it may be time to move on to something new. If you do go your separate ways make sure it is on good terms. You never know when you might want to get back together again.
TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):Just because someone says they will support you does not mean they actually will, so don't get into a position where your success depends entirely on them. You may not want to be cynical but ultimately the only person you can fully trust is yourself.
GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):Listen carefully to friends and family members whose knowledge in certain areas is clearly superior to your own, then make your choice as to whether or not you will take their advice. The final say in the matter must always go to your conscience.
CANCER (June 22 - July 23):If you have kept things hidden from partners and loved ones you must now come clean and let them know what's been going on. It may be no big deal to you but they could lose trust in you if you continue to keep them in the dark.
LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):Your powers of persuasion can get you just about anything you desire, but make sure other people don't lose out as a result. You win best when other people win with you, so whatever you ask for make sure friends and relatives get a fair share too.
VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):You could face a serious problem if you let slip information you should have kept to yourself. The powers that be won't be impressed that you could not be trusted and may decide not to trust you again, so keep your lips zipped over the next 24 hours!
LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):You must not be afraid to make unpopular decisions, but on the other hand you must not make them when there are other options available that could work just as well. Remember too that the quickest route to success is not always the best route .
SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):Something or someone will come into your life over the next few days that does you a power of good. It may be that something or someone else has to go out of your life to make room for it, or them, but that's life. Don't be too sentimental.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):If there is something you would rather be doing than what others expect you to be doing then you need to let them know there are going to be changes. No one can blame you for getting bored with your current regime — and you wouldn't care if they did.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):You should by now have a much clearer idea of what it is you want to be doing over the coming weeks and months. You may not be able to move towards your new goals just yet but you can make detailed plans. Start on them now.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):No matter how eager you may be to press ahead with something that excites you there are a number of other issues that must be dealt with first. Sadly, there are people out there who would love to see you fail. Don't give them a chance to criticize you.
PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):Something has been worrying you for some time and you really do need to sort it out. To start with you must be honest with yourself about why you fear it so much. Once you have done that you may find it has less of a hold over you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">HOROSCOPES: How this week's full moon will affect your week, according to your star sign.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Natasha Weber is an astrology genius and has predicted our horoscopes for the week beginning May 3. For more from Natasha follow her on Instagram and Facebook.
Thursday’s full moon brings change, but not the type that involves a new job, haircut or relationship. No, this shift is on a deep, soulful level. You’re rejigging yourself from the inside out – your wants, needs and above all, your priorities. Embrace this transition as a necessary part of your personal growth and boldly step into the next chapter.
La Luna guides you to a crossroad in your primary relationship. On a positive note, this could mean that the two of you finally come to an agreement or resolve a problem. Or, on another note, some Bulls may decide to sever ties – for good. Singles realise they want depth and intimacy rather than superficial banter and empty promises.
Every 18 months, or so, the Moon's Node changes sign, making this shift a huge deal. And this week, it's your turn Gemini! As the Node enters your sign on Tuesday, you're dealing with a karmic issue. You've signed up to learn a valuable lesson, and although this story takes 18 months to unfold, the class has begun. Look out for your partner in crime – they're waiting for you too.
On Tuesday, Mercury's dance with the Sun encourages you to work with your hands. This cosmic alignment is happening in an earth sign, so throw yourself into an activity where you can get your hands dirty. Cooking, digging in the garden or sculpting clay are brilliant ways to release tension this week. Do these grounding activities mindfully, and they'll double up as a stress-busting movement meditation.
It’s what you do consistently, that really counts. Moving a mountain in one fell swoop is just not going to happen this week. Instead, use Pluto’s influence to reassess what you do on a daily basis. Your everyday routine holds the key to smashing your goals. So, make sure you're chipping away at your objective. Every. Damn. Day.
You might have to walk away from a toxic relationship with a bestie or lover. Or, exit a family scenario that’s been doing nothing but drain you of energy. Don’t worry, the Moon’s Node steps in to support you this week. Prioritise your needs, Virgo. Continually pouring your heart and soul into this person or situation is no longer okay. It’s time to refuel your own tank.
You gain a valuable piece of insight this week, thanks to the full moon's presence in your money zone. Although the news could help you out of a financial tight spot, make sure it doesn't come with strings attached. Read documents and contracts carefully. It's not a bad time to sign on the dotted line, provided you have all the facts at hand. Remember, knowledge is power.
Dream big, Scorpio! Thursday’s full moon makes its annual appearance in your sign, granting you a wish. And then Mercury's kiss with Neptune helps it come true. What should you wish for? Love or a unique, passion project tops the list. Still, don't have to sit back and wait. Hold up your end of the bargain, and do what you can to increase your odds of success.
The Moon’s South Node enters your sign for the first time in over 18 months. Often referred to as the Dragon's Tail, this Node serves to rid you of what's not working in your favour. Ditch a bad habit, frenemy or a toxic person that’s been weighing you down. You'll walk with a little extra spring in your step once you've decided to do just that.
Elevate your wellbeing with information from a website, book or health article. You've been working hard, whether that be at work, at home or with the kids. Now, the full moon asks you to refill your own cup. But first, you need a plan. And that's where education steps in. Reading – everything and anything wellness related – will guide you to what you need to know.
This week sees you entering a new relationship cycle, as the Moon's Node enters your love zone on Tuesday. For couples, this doesn't necessarily mean abandoning your current relationship. But perhaps embarking on a new path, hand-in-hand. For singles, use a lesson learnt from your ex, to improve the quality of a romantic connection.
You're such a gentle, go-with-the-flow type, Pisces, but its time to channel your inner bitch. Let her loose! Exercise your rights and prove that you're no pushover. Being strong doesn't mean you have to bulldoze people, but when your limits are tested, it's healthy to set boundaries. So that next time, bullies will think twice before pressing your buttons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horoscope of the week (May 4-9, 2020): Taurus, Aries, Gemini, Pisces, Scorpio, Aquarius, Cancer, Leo and other signs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Any time from Monday to Wednesday finds you proclaiming your heart’s desire. A sweet smile wins the day in every area of life and could even help you dodge a legal challenge, much to a rival’s annoyance. Follow LIVE updates on coronavirus pandemic
The future has to be bright. With a leap and a bound you’ll soon be free, leaving behind the burdens of work and everyday responsibility, and waving goodbye to a battle with authority. Don’t take on too much, too soon, though, for you’ll have a second chance after another few months.
Mercury is doing its best, and that is cause for rejoicing. For one thing, you’ll have all the best ideas. For another, if you play your cards right, success will be served up while you hardly have to lift a finger.
The Moon will soon be in significant regions of your chart, but not just yet, and that means that you’ll have to wait a few days for social satisfaction. Your new emotional cycle is increasingly secretive, so you’ll be keeping your cards very close to your chest.
You’ve certainly been getting your slice of the action, and now you are ready to reap your share of the rewards. From Thursday onwards, life will slow down, and you’ll take the chance to reflect and weigh up the odds. Creative and artistic individuals are now experimenting with new activities at the moment right now.
You’re going through a mildly bumpy patch currently, though nothing you can’t handle. Family affairs seem to be moving along nicely, even if there have been one or two hold-ups. These, it must be said, have not been your fault. However, the final outcome in a romantic adventure will be very much to your liking.
Your romantic stars are mixed. Tuesday and Wednesday are excellent days for declaring your love, but you’ll have to put up with partners who want it all their own way: if you can’t beat them, you may as well join them. But then, you might not be in a mood to compromise.
You’re stuck in a sort of cosmic waiting room. One phase of life is over, another is waiting to begin, and in the meantime partners and lovers have it all their own way. Yet an increase in your earnings is now a definite possibility, and one which will transform your life.
These are busy days and the more time you spend on all those dull but essential routine chores, the better off you’ll be when your dreams come true, first, next month and then a couple of months later. In love, you may go for broke, insisting that a partner accepts your desires without question.
Your planetary energy is at a peak, but that doesn’t mean that everything will go with a swing. It’s preferable to arrange your own schedule so that you get the right amount of exercise, rest and healthy food. You’re about to take a long, hard look at your spending commitments.
You do love other people so much, but now you want a bit of the attention yourself. Plus, some people reckon that your guiding principle in relationships is ‘don’t do what I do, but do as I say’. However, as you may have found out, that’s not always the best recipe for peace and harmony.
A large cheque, or some other significant saving, might be on the way. Wednesday looks like your most profitable day, but any good fortune has nothing to do with luck. It’s to do with making the most of opportunities while other people waste their time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Today's horoscope — May 3, 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HAPPY BIRTHDAY for Sunday, May 3, 2020. Insightful, clever and charming, you create a winner of a year. New financial opportunities appear in May, August, and December. Make choices and pursue goals on Fridays, your lucky day each week. If single, you postpone the decisive action needed to ensure success in love. If attached, you, who place a lot of demands on your partner, decide to ease up, and romantic bliss ensues. CAPRICORN makes their own decisions.
 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): A former physical complaint manifests itself again, mainly due to stress. You are so brave and you've kept it in for so long. But today, find time to take care of yourself. Good news comes your way, in financial form. Tonight: Take it easy.
This Week: Zero in on a new possibility Wednesday or Thursday.
 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Children are the happy focus of the day. After a few nights of restless sleep, brilliant ideas abound. Fresh personal starts are indicated. Expect to be doing a lot of brainstorming. A creative project will go very well. Tonight: Play more with the children.
This Week: You make a difference because of your abilities.
 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Today finds you redecorating your home. Moods are high, and in keeping with your already expansive way, rather overindulgent. There's nothing small or petty about the way you decorate, especially not now. You go all out. Tonight: Celebrate with a wonderful dinner.
This Week: Speak your mind and expect to get responses.
 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): You seem to be doing a lot of thinking, talking and local running around. Naturally analytical, you use this period profitably by re-examining plans or ideas and discarding whatever or whomever is no longer valuable. This is particularly advantageous for you writers. Tonight: Early sleep.
This Week: You might be more grounded than most people.
 
LEO (July 23-Aug 22): You feel like buying, and could go a bit overboard. Luxury items have a very strong appeal. However, today's aspects are not good for large-scale spending, as you will most likely have to return what you purchase. Tonight: Distract yourself with a beloved movie.
This Week: Others will seek you out.
 
VIRGO (Aug 23-Sept 22): Your personal magnetism is high, and you attract the attention of a VIP. But be careful. You get in over your head, and conflict may accompany an immense sex appeal. Do not use others, nor let yourself be used. Tonight: The emphasis continues on you.
This Week: You decide to take on certain risks.
 
LIBRA (Sept 23-Oct 22): Take care of yourself mentally or physically since you could find yourself more rundown than usual. Sleep, meditate and think. You begin to find your thoughts deepened and intensified as you dig for answers with vigorous determination. Tonight: Avoid power struggles with others.
This Week: You bloom midweek. Cheer in summer with friends.
 
SCORPIO (Oct 23-Nov 21): Communication and enthusiasm from others thrill you today. The focus is on friendship and group activities that you follow online. Accept the many invitations that come your way. You feel more popular than you have in some time. Tonight: Flaunt yourself, Scorpio-style.
This Week: Let others run the show.
 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov 22-Dec 21): Today emphasises fun and good times, particularly with an elderly relative. Make sure you check in and see that everything is all right. Try not to let minor hassles at the workplace upset your equilibrium. Co-workers seem to be in an uproar. Tonight: Take off.
 
This Week: Work toward a goal you have envisioned.
 
CAPRICORN (Dec 22-Jan 19): You seem to have a case of wanderlust today. As you cannot go on a real vacation, take a virtual one. The yearning will also be quenched by browsing through travel books or even just calling a long-distance pal. Tonight: Spend time with a child.
This Week: Focus on what you want.
 
AQUARIUS (Jan 20-Feb 18): Joint income improves today, although there may be a few disagreements with your partner along the way. Obtaining loans is favoured, but some might feel unduly pressured to make a financial decision. You need to do your best balancing act. Tonight: Play nice.
This Week: Kick back and think of summer.
 
PISCES (Feb 19-March 20): A new friendship might be found with a fiery, communicative person. You are likely to share similar outlooks and will learn from each other. Watch out, however, for domestic or romantic discord at home. If attached, your mate is volatile. Tonight: Relax.
This Week: Relate on a one-on-one basis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oakey and Kingaroy shiver below zero as wintry winds blow in</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two south-east Queensland towns recorded below-zero temperatures overnight as gusty, southern cold air blew into Queensland on Saturday.
Oakey, west of Toowoomba, and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, were the coldest places in the state early on a windy Saturday morning.
Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Peter Markworth said the two towns were colder than Applethorpe in the Granite Belt, which was kept warmer by the winds.
"Two locations got to below zero this morning," Mr Markworth said.
"Oakey was the coldest and got down to 0.4 degrees centigrade, and Kingaroy got to 0.1, just a touch below zero.
"Applethorpe got to 4.2 degrees centigrade, but it is quite breezy up through there and that would have played a role."
No reading from Stanthorpe's manually read temperature gauge was available early on Saturday.
The gusty 15- to 20-knot winds over much of Queensland were affecting temperatures, Mr Markworth said.
"A good example is up near Townsville. A lot of the surrounding areas got down to the low teens – like 11 degrees – but Townsville itself was quite isolated [from the winds] and the temperature was 19.6 degrees," he said.
Mr Markworth said the chilly weather was an early taste of a typical winter day in July.
"But while we are moving into cooler temperatures in the longer term, in the short term, we will see temperatures begin to warm back to average – in the mid-20s – quite gradually," he said.
"We should get back to average conditions by the middle of next week."
People using Moreton Bay and the waterways around the coast should be wary of the strong gusty winds over the weekend, he said. Those strong winds will return early next week as well.
"We do have quite a bit of wind over the coastal waters – 15 to 20km/h – and into next week, they are going to pick up again," he said.
Winds could be slightly stronger on Sunday in south-east Queensland, gusting up to 35km/h, but easing in the afternoon.
"It is pretty breezy and gusty over the water already, but it is really an issue for early next week," Mr Markworth said.
"Just south of the border in New South Wales does have some strong wind warnings.
"So it can be quite rough in Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast waters."
Overall, clear, bright days are expected until Tuesday, when a chance of rain emerges.
The maximum temperature in Brisbane is tipped to be 24 degrees on Saturday and Sunday, down to 10 degrees on both nights.
By Wednesday there is a 50 per cent chance of slight rain in south-east Queensland, which could continue until Friday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast – Britain to bask in balmy 17C sunshine to end week-long washout</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITS have been treated to a return of spring weather this weekend, with warm temperatures set to continue.
The balmy sunshine is expected to stick around on Sunday, reaching 17C across much of the country.
After a week of drizzle and gloom in lockdown, the UK has basked in some light relief today.
The low pressure which has dumped torrential rain on much of the country this week has been forecast to move across Europe.
And as the UK spends its sixth weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, weather conditions are expected to be much more settled thanks to building high pressure.
According to The Met Office, the change will result in “dry, fine and settled weather” this weekend and particularly next week.
Saturday was warm with a high of 19C felt by most of the country.
Further dry, fine and settled weather is expected on Sunday, with potential for very light winds - however most places will enjoy “dry and decent weather.”
Sunday
The Met Office predict most of the country will see sunny intervals, however some rain could fall in northern and eastern parts of the nation.
For most of the country, a high of 17C will be felt, and a low of 8C.
Monday to Wednesday
Mainly dry, sunny spells developing, few showers in Eastern England on Monday. Mainly dry, sunny spells in most places, but heavy showers in SW Tuesday. Dry and sunny on Wednesday.
On Sunday, cloudier conditions are expected in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Some parts of the east coast will feel more of a chill in the air.
The high pressure will remain in charge for most of next week, meaning the warm sunny weather is here to stay for at least a few more days.
The Met Office warns that while the weather change will tempt many across the country to spend their weekend outdoors, the UK must continue to adhere to the coronavirus lockdown.
Simon Partridge encouraged people to enjoy the sunshine from their backyards, balconies and daily hour-long walks - though he did add that UV levels will be reasonably high over the weekend, so people must cover up accordingly.
The high pressure build won’t last forever, and is expected to move on by the following weekend and bring with it more wet and miserable weather.
Ministers will be hoping the resurgence of sunshine will not encourage Brits to venture outside of their homes and break lockdown rules as has been seen in the past few weeks.
For the beginning of next week, the weather still appears to be setting with the occasional shower in Eastern England on Monday ad heavy showers in the southwest on Tuesday.
Generally the UK will remain dry with some sunny spells, particularly on Wednesday.
The sunshine comes after Britain experienced as much rain in a day as it did for the rest of April two days ago.
The Met Office is now predicting settled, warmer weather for the beginning of the month, although we can still expect some showers, and it'll be much cooler than last week.
April's sunshine was caused by a high pressure system from the continent - but recently we've faced the opposite, with low pressure systems bringing in colder weather and lots of rain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast: Temperatures to hit 18C as rain gives way to spring sunshine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's set to be a bright and sunny day today with temperatures forecast to reach a balmy 18C.
Brits will be treated to a return of spring weather as the low pressure which has dumped torrential rain on much of the country this week is now forecast to move across Europe.
Many areas are set to see temperatures get warmer, with the Met Office predicting highs of 17 to 18C in the southeast, with 14 to 15C felt across the UK.
Lows of 12C are forecast in Newcastle and Edinburgh.
As the UK spends its sixth weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, conditions are also due to be drier and more settled thanks to building high pressure.
However, the odd shower is possible and some could turn heavy, particularly in the north and east of the country.
Giving the latest forecast, a Met Office spokesman said: "Despite the chilly start it will soon warm up, plenty of sunshine for England, Wales, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland.
"As temperatures build, further showers will develop. It's essentially a day of sunny spells and showers but it's across central and eastern England where the heaviest and most frequent downpours will be.
"Further south, the best of any sunshine 17 or 18C in the southeast.
"Showers will continue to ease away as we head into Saturday evening but still one or two clinging on, a bit more cloud into Cornwall perhaps one or two spots of rain.
"Sunday is looking largely dry with showers easing and a bit more sunshine."
Today:
A chilly start then sunny intervals and showers, some heavy in the north and east. Many western and southern areas remaining dry but becoming cloudier with perhaps a little rain in the far southwest later. Feeling warm in the sunshine.
Tonight:
Showers dying out to leave a chilly night with clear spells for many central parts. Cloudier in the northeast and southwest with some patchy rain in places.
Sunday:
Another day of sunny intervals and showers for many northern and eastern parts. Cloudier in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Monday to Wednesday :
Mainly dry, sunny spells developing, few showers in Eastern England on Monday. Mainly dry, sunny spells in most places, but heavy showers in SW Tuesday. Dry and sunny on Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather: Temperatures to hit 23C by VE Day with blazing sunshine next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain looks set to leave the rainy weather behind this week, swapping it for blazing sun and highs of 23C at the peak.
The last week has seen grim weather, with cooler temperatures as well as heavy rain and clouds. 
But the outlook looks set to be brighter and more spring-like next week, ending in a toasty 23C on Friday for the bank holiday, according to BBC weather.
The week will begin with a dry, sunny Monday, setting a trend for the week ahead. 
Temperatures will peak on Thursday, the day before bank holiday Friday for VE Day.
The day celebrates the Allies formally accepting Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender from World War II in 1945.
The week ahead marks the UK’s seventh week in lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.  
The glorious weather may present yet another temptation to break lockdown rules, but Brits must follow government measures to stay indoors and socially distance. 
The Met Office outlook:
It’s going to be cloudy in the south and east this evening, leading into tonight, while the north-east and south-east Scotland will see outbreaks of rain, some extensive. The north-west will see clearer spells and there may be a ground frost overnight. 
It’s going to be a fairly pleasant start to the week on Monday, with mostly dry and sunny spells in the west while the south will get some fresh, easterly winds. The east won’t be so lucky with some rain and scattered showers.
It’s set to be mostly dry with sunny spells on the lead up to a warm VE Day. Tuesday will see grim weather in parts of the country, with outbreaks of rain and thunder in the south. There will be some showers on Wednesday and Thursday but those days will mostly be dry and sunny.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Texas theater chain to take your temperature as it reopens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a few states have allowed movie theaters to open to the public in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, some that are choosing to get back to business have surprising new security regulations.
One theater chain in Texas, EVO, plans on opening with an "airport security-style check-in" on Monday, EVO Entertainment Inc. CEO Mitchell Roberts told Variety Friday. This includes asking people if they have had flu symptoms or have been around someone with flu symptoms in the last 14 days along with an infrared temperature scan. If theatergoers have a temperature above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, they will be turned away. Patrons will also be required to wear masks. 
Another chain, Santikos, will require employees to wear masks, but not customers, according to Variety. Both chains will implement spaced seating and new cleaning regimens.
The CDC and top infectious disease experts recommend wearing masks as an effective way to help slow the spread of coronavirus.
While some states like New York are requiring people to wear masks in public when social distancing of at least six feet is not possible, Texas does not have the same rules.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott started allowing some establishments to reopen on Friday, including restaurants, retail shops, and movie theaters, with guidelines on limits for the amount of people that can be let in to these spaces. Movie theaters can only operate at 25 percent of their usual capacity (or 50 percent in rural counties) with employees making sure people are social distancing and regularly cleaning parts of the theaters that are frequently touched, the Texas Tribune reported. Although Texas asks that employees at restaurants wears face masks, the state has made it clear that it won't require diners and shoppers to do so. 
However, many business owners have decided to remain closed despite the state's relaxed rules. Larger theater chains like AMC and Cinemark, for example, do not plan to reopen in either state as of right now, and many restaurants have remained closed or stuck to take-out and delivery only.
Texas reported nearly 1,300 new positive cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, the second-highest daily jump since reporting started. The state has a total of about 30,100 cases. Meanwhile, Georgia has about 28,300 cases, with an increase of about 840 cases from Friday night to Saturday night. (While the jump in numbers is worrying, it can't be directly connected to reopening at this point. Both states have also ramped up testing.)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You cannot possibly be the best at everything, so don’t waste your time and energy trying. Cut back on your ambitions this year and focus only on the two or three goals that are easiest to reach. That’s not an admission of failure, it’s a sign of maturity.
A relationship or friendship has been a lot of fun but now it may be time to move on to something new. If you do go your separate ways make sure it is on good terms. You never know when you might want to get back together again.
Just because someone says they will support you does not mean they actually will, so don’t get into a position where your success depends entirely on them. You may not want to be cynical but ultimately the only person you can fully trust is yourself.
Listen carefully to friends and family members whose knowledge in certain areas is clearly superior to your own, then make your choice as to whether or not you will take their advice. The final say in the matter must always go to your conscience.
If you have kept things hidden from partners and loved ones you must now come clean and let them know what’s been going on. It may be no big deal to you but they could lose trust in you if you continue to keep them in the dark.
Your powers of persuasion can get you just about anything you desire, but make sure other people don’t lose out as a result. You win best when other people win with you, so whatever you ask for make sure friends and relatives get a fair share too.
You could face a serious problem if you let slip information you should have kept to yourself. The powers that be won’t be impressed that you could not be trusted and may decide not to trust you again, so keep your lips zipped over the next 24 hours!
You must not be afraid to make unpopular decisions, but on the other hand you must not make them when there are other options available that could work just as well. Remember too that the quickest route to success is not always the best route .
Something or someone will come into your life over the next few days that does you a power of good. It may be that something or someone else has to go out of your life to make room for it, or them, but that’s life. Don’t be too sentimental.
If there is something you would rather be doing than what others expect you to be doing then you need to let them know there are going to be changes. No one can blame you for getting bored with your current regime – and you wouldn’t care if they did.
You should by now have a much clearer idea of what it is you want to be doing over the coming weeks and months. You may not be able to move toward your new goals just yet but you can make detailed plans. Start on them now.
No matter how eager you may be to press ahead with something that excites you there are a number of other issues that must be dealt with first. Sadly, there are people out there who would love to see you fail. Don’t give them a chance to criticize you.
Something has been worrying you for some time and you really do need to sort it out. To start with you must be honest with yourself about why you fear it so much. Once you have done that you may find it has less of a hold over you.

Renowned man of God and Founder of the International Christian Gospel Church (ICGC), Pastor Mensa Otabil, has hinted that for anyone who believes that God is with them, there will be storms but with God in the boat.
During his virtual Sunday service which aired live on the Global Media Alliance Broadcast(GMAbc) platforms, Happy Fm, eTV Ghana and across the Y-Triangle, he stated that currently, a lot of people are facing the storm which is the Coronavirus, but if Christians continue to believe in God, He will be with us on the boat and we will smile at the storm.
“Storms will come to test us and to test the stuff we are made of. If you really believe God is with you, then there will be a storm”, he said.
Ps. Otabil continued, “If you believe God has opened a door for you, there will be a storm. If you believe God is giving you victory in 2020, there will be a storm but with Jesus in the boat”.
The pastor preached referring to the scriptures that even with God, it is very possible that things may not go well with individuals. However, there is always the assurance that things will get better in God’s own time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Go, corona, go: In Telangana, if you close your eyes, corona will go away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hyderabad: According to data obtained from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), Telangana carried out 4,035 tests for coronavirus infection between April 19 and 26.
That number fell to 2,506 in the last four days of the month, that is, from April 27 to April 30.
 
On April 21, in a decision that defies logic, the Telangana government decided not to test anyone without Covid-19 symptoms or those who are not primary contacts of Covid-19 patients.
Any wonder then that it was also in the last week of April that the state began reporting new daily cases in the single digits?
Based on these figures, the government began expressing the hope that the spread of the virus was being contained.
ICMR oversees the testing process across the country. We obtained testing figures from ICMR and correlated them with the number of positive cases detected in Telangana.
In the initial days in Telangana, between March 10 and 22, the number of tests conducted 180 . This number rose dramatically rose to 4,781 between April 5 and 11. That, according to data received from ICMR, was the highest number of tests done in a week in Telangana.
In the period during which the state conducted the most tests, as per ICMR data, the number of positive cases, according to the patient list provided by the state, was found to be 241.
The next testing period for which ICMR provided data, April 12-18, was the also period during which Telangana discovered the most number of positive cases, 322.
After the state issued instructions, April 21, that it will restrict testing as per ICMR guidelines, the positive cases fell sharply. Between April 27 and April 30, when the number of tests came down to 2,506, the positive cases fell steeply to 35.
The government says it will stick to ICMR guidelines on testing. And anxieties over the shrinking circle of testing continue to rise.
In a recent interview, the director for the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Dr. Rakesh K. Mishra, said the importance of testing cannot be ignored and called for sustained testing to determine the extent of the spread of the disease.
His concerns reflect those of many other doctors here as well as the World Health Organization which has repeatedly stressed on increasing the rate and pace of testing to determine the true extent of the spread of the virus in the population.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OVERVIEW: The sun in the sign of Taurus places a stronger focus on finances, the markets and any efforts made to stabilize. Cut losses and pull practical plans together no matter what is needed. Navigate around circumstances. Efforts made will get results on most levels. Those with power behind the scenes add some influence in the right departments as they see they will benefit from this as well. Play the long game if you can do it. Private deals will provide compensation for any up front costs. The full moon in Scorpio agitates those with intense emotions. A poker face is useful right now while negotiating terms or positions. Plan next moves.
ARIES: You can be the key player in any dealings with others as you engage and take charge.
TAURUS: Be the star near or far as your feet-on-the-ground methods calm the anxiety of others. 
GEMINI: Play cards very close to the vest. It's better if others don’t know your level of influence.
CANCER: You need all the information or evidence required to convince others to work with you. 
LEO: You shine in the eyes of others as they see what a trooper you are. Take charge if you can. 
VIRGO: A hands-on approach helps your agenda or clear your path. Brainstorm with others now. 
LIBRA: Clarify details regarding finances or assets that could also be connected jointly to them.
SCORPIO: Measure your words carefully or your intensity could alter the status quo. Just relax. 
SAGITTARIUS: Private deals are a win-win for all involved. Process everything in the right order. 
CAPRICORN: Your steady, stable personality calms others and attracts some good luck to you. 
AQUARIUS: Take a stand if you have to be the one in charge as your leadership is important.
PISCES: Play a bit of a shell game with associates for now. You need to feel your way with this.

    <h5 class="mb-1">So, about Brexit... Where are we now with it?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WE THOUGHT THAT Brexit was an unbelievable, fantastic tale of twists and turns, but it’s been utterly eclipsed by the Covid-19 pandemic – a global moment that could remould our lives and societies. 
But Brexit hasn’t gone to ground either, and the processes to make it a reality have been ticking away quietly in the background. At the moment, there’s still a deadline – of 30 June – by which the UK will have to decide if it’s asking for an extension to the time frame for arranging a trade deal with the EU.
Incredibly, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to entertain the idea of extending the transition period, despite a Covid-19 pandemic sucking up government resources.
Almost 50 of the UK’s top civil servants have been taken off the Brexit trade negotiating team, and instead redeployed to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic response in the UK.
Despite this, senior minister Michael Gove has said he would put the chances of securing a free trade agreement between London and Brussels at “better than two to one”.
The trade deal is going to be integral to the UK’s post-EU future: how easy will it be for British companies to export to EU member states? What tariffs will there be on exports into the UK, which Irish companies will be keenly watching?
How strict will customs arrangements be for Northern Ireland, which will ultimately answer the question of whether there will be a hard border down the Irish Sea? 
Northern Ireland
Speaking to a Select Committee on the future relationship with the European Union and on post-Brexit negotiations this week, Michael Gove, a UK Cabinet minister who is tasked with Brexit preparation in the UK, was asked why Johnson’s government has opposed an EU office in Northern Ireland.
The EU Commission has requested a technical base in Northern Ireland in order to ensure its custom rules and standards are being adhered to after the transition period closes at the end of this year.
It was revealed last week that British cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt had written to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to reject the EU’s proposal for an EU Commission office in the North. 
Speaking about that rejection, Gove said that it “is not necessary” to have a “mini embassy” in the North.
“We hope that we can reach an arrangement that we are doing everything required to make sure the protocol is being adhered to,” he said.
There is a lot we still don’t know about how the Northern Ireland protocol would work in practice – it depends on how close the UK-EU trading relationship will be, and what practice the special committee set up to examine this issue concludes.
For example, it was suggested that tax owed on products destined for Ireland/the EU would be paid to the UK, which would then pass it onto the EU; but it wasn’t clear how much oversight the EU would want, and whether it would need its own officials along the custom and regulatory Irish Sea border.
On this issue, Gove said:
“Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the UK, so while we’ll make sure the EU has all information it needs, these are checks that will have to be carried out by UK officials.”
Meanwhile, businesses in Northern Ireland are left in the lurch. As Wesley Aston, the CEO  of the Ulster Farmers Union told a UK committee this week:
Precious time
There are just two weeks of negotiations between the EU and UK on trade left.
On 15 April, the scheduled talks between Brussels and London were concentrated into just three weeks, on the weeks commencing: 20 April, 11 May and 1 June. 
On the time left to agree a deal, Gove has said: “In some respects it (the outbreak) should concentrate the minds of the EU negotiators, reinforcing the importance of coming to an agreement.”
He said that although a lot has changed, some of the organisations arguing for extensions now, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, had argued for an extension before, “so that while things have changed, they also have not changed”.
“If we accept an extension, the incentive to come to an agreement would dissipate.”
Claiming that extending the transition period would cost “billions” of pounds, he said:
“We’re not going to extend the transition period,” he added definitively.
Other than that, how are negotiations going?
“They regard the UK not as a sovereign state, but on the path to EU membership.”
That is Gove’s impression of how negotiations are going. 
The UK has been asking for an ‘off-the-shelf’ trade deal with the EU – instead of negotiating the tiny minutia of what will be allowed to be traded between the two, what will be subjected to high tariffs, and what regulations the two will need to be agreed, etc.
The UK is looking for a trade deal similar to Japan or Canada, if not a bit closer than that, and fishing arrangements similar to that with Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands.
When asked how prepared the UK was for a no-deal situation, Gove said that because of the Withdrawal Agreement “there’s no such thing now as a no-deal situation”.
When questioned on what the final date was, whereby businesses would be told if there is to be no trade deal struck, Gove initially said that would be an unhelpful thing to do:
But when repeatedly pressured on it by MP Peter Bone, he eventually admitted:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irish weather forecast: Warm and sunny day ahead but country set to be soaked next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the last Spring month upon us Ireland has been treated to an inviting sun soaked bank holiday weekend- but that looks set to end very soon.
Met Eireann has said today will be mostly dry today with temperatures set to hit between 12C and 16C.
However patches of drizzle and cloudy conditions will appear in the south west and the south coast while isolated showers will pop up elsewhere this afternoon.
It will be warmest through parts of north midlands and Connacht with light, occasionally moderate, easterly or variable breezes expected.
Tomorrow will be largely dry with as the country is set to be basked in sunn spells throughout the day.
East to northeast breezes will increase moderate in the afternoon, keeping daytime highs between 12 and 14 degrees near eastern and northern coasts.
Luckily for punters in the west it will be warmer further west with afternoon highs of 15 to 18 degrees.
Sadly Monday night looks likely to mark the end of the sunshine as the country is set to be soaked in the coming days.
A forecaster has warned there is "some uncertainty" for Tuesday but said "latest indications suggest Tuesday will bring rain across parts of Munster and south Leinster."
He said: "Some heavy falls in places in the morning but the rain will tend to ease later in the day.
"Holding mostly dry further north with some sunny breaks in northern parts. Afternoon temperatures of 10C to 13C in southern and eastern areas."
The midlands and the west will be warmer however temperatures reaching highs of 14C to 16C with moderate to fresh southeast breezes.
Unfortunately the rain will persist mainly affecting southern coastal counties.
Further north it will be drier and clearer with temperature hitting lows of 5C to 9C in moderate east to southeast breezes.
The predominant signal is for southeast breezes to bring outbreaks of showery rain especially to southern, western and southeastern counties.
But those further north can rejoice with Met Eireann predicting that northern areas are likely to be dry much of the time.
Temperatures in the afternoon will reach highs of 12C to 16C and potentially 17C or 18C in some central regions of the country on Thursday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">May 2: Your daily horoscope</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BIRTHDAY SATURDAY:You mean more to the people you share your life with than you can possibly imagine, but over the coming year you will begin to understand what kind of effect you have on them, which in turn will encourage you to take care in word and in deed.
ARIES (March 21 - April 20):The Sun and Mercury may no longer be moving through your sign but that does not mean your recent run of good fortune is coming to an end. On the contrary, you may be even better off over the next few weeks, at least financially, than you were before.
TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):With so much positive cosmic activity in and around your birth sign you should be dancing for joy now. You say you can't dance? Of course you can! Switch off your inner critic and let your body guide you. No one will laugh at you — honest!
GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):There seems to be a certain amount of tension in your life at the moment but most likely it's just all those annoying little things that appear to add up to something big. But they don't. It will all come right in the end — somehow it always does.
CANCER (June 22 - July 23):Friends and colleagues will applaud you to the skies this weekend, and with good reason. In their eyes, and in the eyes of the universe in general, you can do no wrong, so follow your fancies and do as you please. You'll get away with almost anything.
LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will boost both your energy and self-belief and it won't be long before you are moving up in the world. Try not to let your success go to your head though. You're not the only big cheese in the neighborhood.
VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):Your sense of adventure, which has been somewhat dormant of late, will suddenly come alive again and in a matter of days you will be flying intellectually and emotionally, and maybe physically too. Give yourself permission to dream — and dream big!
LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):Business and financial matters are under excellent stars now, so be ready to cash in when the opportunity arises. Ignore those who try to tell you that it's wrong to be rich. At the very least they are misguided and may even have their own selfish agenda.
SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):Try not to get worked up about something that is clearly unattainable, at least for the foreseeable future. Focus on the things you can have and, even if they are not all to your liking, find ways to enjoy them, not least by expanding your definition of fun.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):You need to stop worrying about a relationship — the planets indicate there is precious little wrong with it that can't be put right with a little tender loving care. Venus in the partnership area of your chart will, if you let it, bring harmony back into your life.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):You will find yourself being nudged in a new direction this weekend and if you are sensible enough not to resist you could end up in a place that brings out the best in you. Expand your horizons and always believe that life should be fun.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):No matter how awkward a problem may be you will find a solution this weekend, but you will find it quicker if you join forces with those who share your need to make sense of what is going on in the world. You all have something to contribute.
PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):The pace of life is picking up again and it won't be long before you are hurtling along at speeds that in the past you might have found scary. You have lots of lost time to make up for, so get your mental running shoes on and race ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: What you need to know today</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1: 69; April 30: 76; April 29: 69; April 28: 74; April 27: 58; April 26: 51; April 25: 46; April 24: 57; April 23: 38; April 22: 39.
These numbers are the death tolls of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India on the 10 days between April 22 and May 1.
On May 2, the number was 98.
The total death toll in India was 1,319 on Saturday.
In some ways, this is the only number to track. In the absence of a lockdown, the number of infections would have definitely soared, as would have the death toll.
Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage
I have written previously about how data from both Mumbai and Delhi shows that the number of non-Covid-19 deaths has reduced during the lockdown. I have also written about just how difficult it will be to hide a death from that most omnipresent thing in India — a mobile phone camera. This would suggest that the number of deaths is a good metric of just how India is handling the pandemic.
There’s another reason to keep tracking this number. Most diseases are so well understood that we can work backwards from the number of deaths to find the number of those affected or infected. We don’t know enough about Covid-19 now, and the widely varying fatality rates around the world are of no help — not when, as both The New York Times and Financial Times have pointed out, based on their own analysis, the actual number of deaths from Covid-19 was much higher than those attributed to the disease. India wasn’t covered by either.
But this ignorance won’t last. We already know more about the disease than we did a month back, and every day seems to bring new answers. It also brings new questions, as it should with a disease of as recent vintage as this. In a column in The New York Times written in mid-April, Charlie Warzel asked some of these questions. More have been added to that list since (and some have been answered).
Eventually, we will know enough about the disease to arrive at a range, a narrow one, for the death rate. And then work backwards from that.
My guess is that the death rates are nowhere close to what’s being reported. The current global death rate is 7.02% of all infected people. That’s far too high. The real number is likely to be anything between 1% and 3% (again, this is a guess, not science). But this would mean that the actual number of infected people is much higher — which is plausible.
That’s actually another reason to track deaths, not number of cases.
The death tallies for the week before April 22 in India were as follows: April 21: 54; April 20: 32; April 19: 39; April 18: 32; April 17: 40; April 16: 24; April 15: 33.
Over the past forthright, then, the number of deaths has seen a steady increase but the numbers are not alarming — not yet. They are closer to Germany’s trajectory than they are to, say, that of the US.
The worrying thing is that most countries have seen the number of deaths per day follow what’s called a hockey-stick curve — gradual curve upwards, and then a steep rise. Which is why it makes sense to watch the number of daily deaths in India, especially over the next two weeks.
In more cheerful news, it turns out that Gilead’s Remdesivir, a failed hepatitis and Ebola drug, may well be a cure for Covid-19. A study in the US found that it accelerated recovery rates, although it didn’t have a huge impact on death rates (it had some). Still, that promise was enough for the US Food and Drug Administration to allow the use of the drug on Covid-19 patients.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Employers Could Terminate Your 401(k) Plan Due to COVID-19. What to Do if It Happens.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic has essentially brought the economy to a standstill, causing thousands of businesses to close their doors and resulting in millions of layoffs. The organizations that are fortunate enough to stay open have also faced challenges, many of them experiencing cash flow problems as more Americans are asked to stay home.
As a result of these budget strains, some organizations have opted to slash employee benefits, including 401(k) plans. While some companies have simply suspended employer-matching contributions, others have decided to terminate their plans altogether to save money. Here's what to do if that happens to you.
The good news is that relatively few organizations are ditching their 401(k) plans entirely. Only around 1.3% of companies said they plan to terminate their 401(k) plan due to COVID-19, according to a recent survey from the Plan Sponsor Council of America. Approximately 16% are temporarily suspending matching contributions, and nearly 77% said they're not planning on making any changes at all to their plans.
However, the not-so-good news is that workers may not be in the clear just yet. Small businesses, in particular, are at a higher risk of facing financial problems as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, so they may be more likely to have to make changes to their 401(k) plans if money gets tight.
Approximately 42% of small businesses might be at risk of eliminating their 401(k) plans due to COVID-19, according to a report from the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries. That's around 216,000 retirement plans that are at risk of termination, the report revealed.
If your 401(k) plan is terminated, or you're concerned it might be in the future, you can still save for retirement. You have other options, and you shouldn't need to put your retirement plans on hold if you lose your 401(k).
You don't need a 401(k) plan to save for retirement, and if you lose your plan through your employer, you have a couple of options: Roll your money into a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, or withdraw your cash.
The option to avoid is withdrawing money from your 401(k). When you withdraw your savings from your 401(k) before age 59-1/2, you're typically faced with a 10% penalty and income taxes on the amount you withdraw. Under the CARES Act, the 10% penalty is temporarily waived, but you'll still need to pay income taxes on your distribution, although you do have three years to pay these taxes, thanks to the new regulations. If you have a significant amount of cash in your 401(k), though, that can be a hefty tax bill.
In addition, by withdrawing your cash now, you're taking away your money's growth potential. Your retirement investments need as much time as possible to compound, and if you stick them in a checking or savings account, you're essentially pressing pause on your retirement strategy.
To avoid withdrawing your savings, you can either roll your money over into a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Both are strong options, and they differ in one key aspect: Taxes. With a traditional IRA, you'll get a tax deduction when you make the initial contribution, but you'll have to pay income taxes on your withdrawals. With a Roth IRA, you'll pay taxes now, but your distributions will be tax-free.
You can't go wrong with either option, but right now might be a particularly good time to opt for a Roth IRA. You will need to pay income taxes on the amount you roll into your Roth account, but because the stock market has taken a tumble over the past few months, you probably don't have as much in your 401(k) right now as you did a few months ago. That means if you convert to a Roth now, your tax bill will be smaller -- and your retirement withdrawals will be tax-free. If you opt for a traditional IRA, you won't pay any taxes right now, but you may face a higher tax bill in retirement when you start making withdrawals.
COVID-19 has turned the world upside down and affected nearly every aspect of our lives, and it's also having an impact on 401(k) plans. However, even if your 401(k) is eliminated, you don't have to let it derail your retirement. By rolling your money over into a new account, you can ensure your plans stay on track.

    <h5 class="mb-1">10 things you need to know this morning in Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good morning. Today we return to work amid continuing squabbles between federal and state governments on the contentious issue of schools. That’s what everyone is talking about today: schools.
1. Westpac has deferred its dividend after revealing a massive 70% slump in first half cash profit of $993 million. “This is the most difficult result Westpac has seen in many years. It is significantly impacted by higher impairment charges due to COVID-19, as well as notable items including the AUSTRAC provision,” CEO Peter King said. The bank reckons it remains “well provisioned and capitalised” but that it would be prudent to withhold a dividend given the uncertainty of the coming months.
2. Following a weekend of slightly relaxed coronavirus restrictions, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state is “heading to get a bit of normality back in our lives”. Face-to-face learning is set to recommence next week in NSW schools.
3. The above comes as PM Scott Morrison continues to pressure Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to fully reopen the state’s schools. Victorian schools was the nexus of the big political item of the weekend. Education Minister Dan Tehan popped up on the ABC to say Andrews had demonstrated a “failure of leadership” in his cautious approach to schools – but was forced to walk it back when just one hour later it was revealed a Melbourne primary school had shut because a teacher was diagnosed with COVID-19. Timing!
4. In case you missed it at the tail end of last week: Scott Morrison announced the decision on whether to relax Australia’s coronavirus restrictions will now be made on Friday – a week early. “Australians have earned an early mark,” Morrison said. (I’m reliably informed that ‘early mark’ is very much east coast parlance, and some parts of Australia don’t know what that means.) Again, Morrison stressed that any relaxation will be contingent on how many Australians download the COVIDSafe contact tracing app.
5. Australian capital city property prices grew by just 0.2% in April, the lowest growth since they stopped falling in June last year. Melbourne led the market lower, as prices fell 0.3%, while rents fell across all capital cities except Perth, according to CoreLogic. Forecasting 10% price falls, Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said CoreLogic’s numbers were lagging behind where the market is really headed.
6. Uber has rolled out a “temporary” service in Australia, which lets you book a car by the hour so you can get errands done – like going to the supermarket and the pharmacy in one trip. The ‘Hourly Driver’ service has a base rate of $59 an hour and you will be charged per minute thereafter. It’s available in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
7. Tech salaries in Australia have so far proved immune to the COVID-19 downturn.These are the top paying startup jobs in Australia and how much they earn.
8. The US recorded its deadliest day during the coronavirus pandemic on Friday, according to new data released by the World Health Organisation. The organisation recorded 2,909 total coronavirus-related deaths in 24 hours. The figure comes as about half of US states have started easing their lockdown restrictions and others have announced plans to do so. One state, Mississippi, has backtracked on its plan to loosen restrictions after 20 people died in the state on Friday.
9. Normal life is slowly resuming in China, and the way its restaurants operate could provide a glimpse into the future for the rest of the world. Restaurants across China and Hong Kong have made drastic changes to the dining experience, and in many places, temperature checks, masks, and plastic partitions between diners are now the norm.
10. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold the “big four” airline stocks in April, the famed investor revealed at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday. “It turned out I was wrong,” Buffett said about his decision to invest in American, Delta, United, and Southwest. Buffett warned that airline carriers could be left with “too many planes” if people fly less due to the coronavirus.
