    <h5 class="mb-1">Cork tourism chiefs confident of recovery, but not without help from government</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cork tourism is confident of recovery, but "a full package of supports" is vital, writes Áine Kenny
It is no secret that Cork’s tourism sector, like the rest of Ireland’s, has faced massive losses from the Covid-19 pandemic.
With international and internal travel severely curtailed by the lockdown measures, it is hard to see how the industry will recover without serious financial support from the Government.
Another concern for the sector is how to make travel attractive again. 
Cork’s tourist industry leaders are unsure whether people will feel safe travelling when the restrictions are lifted, but are hopeful the Irish public will help them get back on their feet.
They are also concerned that social distancing and the wearing of PPE could disrupt the relaxing experience of staying in a hotel or visiting a tourist attraction.
Fergal Harte, general manager of Cork city’s Kingsley Hotel and the chair of the Cork branch of the Irish Hotels Federation, says the landscape has changed entirely.
Currently, the Kingsley is operating on a skeleton staff, in order to service the fully-occupied apartments on site. The hotel is also being used as accommodation for HSE staff.
"We currently have frontline workers staying with us, so this gives us an insight into what the future holds," said Mr Harte.
The lack of air travel will mean hotels may be targeting Irish guests exclusively. "We will all be looking at the domestic market. It will be a hugely competitive environment. Irish people won’t travel abroad like they normally do."
However, the industry will need a full package of supports from the Government, according to Mr Harte. 
"There will have to be a continuation of the supports, as well as a package of further measures, to support the tourism and hotel industry."
Some of the measures the IHF is currently lobbying for include the waiving of local authority rates and water charges, as well as interest free loans for the industry to help boost cash flow.
"And, in terms of taxation, the tourism Vat rate being reduced to 0% for the duration of the crisis, and being restored to 9% on a permanent basis,” said Mr Harte.
Business interruption grants could also ensure smaller hotels and tourist businesses could reopen, he said.
"If we don’t get supports, many businesses will be unable to reopen as it won’t be viable.” 
Mr Harte said the IHF is devising a list of standard operating procedures for hotels, so they can meet the new public health guidelines and ensure the safety of staff and guests when they do reopen. 
This will include markings on the floor to space out guests by two metres, installing plexiglass barriers at the front desk, and PPE, depending on what the public health advice is. 
"We [at the Kingsley] nearly got a head start on this, from dealing with the HSE, we already had to take these measures."
Mr Harte believes these new measures will be here in the long-term, at least until we find a vaccine or treatment. "The safeguarding of public health is the priority, and to ensure our guests feel secure. Hygiene and safety will be paramount."
Seamus Heaney is the director of Visit Cork, Cork’s tourism body consisting of Pure Cork, which promotes leisure tourism, and the Cork Convention Bureau, which promotes business tourism.
He said on March 15, the industry "fell off a cliff".
He said there were roughly 6,000 people in Cork working in the hotel industry, now there are just 400, who are all relying on the government subsidy to pay their wages.
However, he stressed the fallout is not just about hotels. "There is a knock-on effect. Tourists use coach companies and taxis, they visit restaurants, pubs and tourist attractions, they buy local produce."
Getting the Irish to travel internally may also be challenging. "Will they feel safe to travel? Will they want to go to a hotel now? We don’t want it to look like a hospital. It’s supposed to be relaxing, to get away."
Mr Heaney says when Ireland does reopen, everything will have changed. 
Brian Keegan: Having confidence in Irish industry will speed up path to recovery
If the sector has to operate on a reduced capacity, he believes serious support will be needed for the industry, otherwise it won’t survive.
"Outside of a roadmap to reopening, the Government needs to financially support the industry. We cannot let the industry go. 
For example, we can’t let the likes of Cork’s Cronin’s Coaches, a family brand that is vital to the tourism sector in Munster, go."
The reduction of flights coming in and out of Cork Airport is also worrying for the region’s economy. "There are only two flights a day. The airlines, the hotels... there will be lots of casualties."
However, the industry is very resilient. 
"The positive thing is that the whole world is in this together. It’s not just Ireland.
"Every few years, we are sent something to challenge us. We are very resilient and we always bounced back, whether it was 9/11, SARS, MERS, ash clouds."
Mr Heaney says the most important thing is that Cork is still here, and is looking forward to welcoming tourists and visitors back in time.
Alan O’Callaghan, assistant manager of the Spike Island Development Company, says the shutdown happened very quickly.
"All of a sudden we were closed. But we are remaining optimistic for July and August. We would be good to [reopen] from tomorrow. As soon as we get the go-ahead we will."
The season was over before it began for Spike Island, which is one of Cork’s best known tourist attractions. 
"We only had five full days open, so we never really got up and running fully. St Patrick’s weekend is when we would have come back."
There was a period of a few days where no one was on the island, but staff got permission to travel to the island to look after the goats who reside there, as well as to carry out essential maintenance.
"Someone goes over once a week to feed the goats, and a member of the maintenance team cuts the grass. Nature wasn’t long taking over. The island looks fantastic at the moment. It is a pity no one can see it."
The staff are taking this quiet time to plan ahead.
"We got a grant to improve the walkways, and we plan on improving access to the convict’s cemetery. We also want to put a memorial there, so people can take a moment [to reflect]."
Ideally, Mr O’Callaghan would love to see visitors return to Spike Island in July. 
"That is dependent on the government guidelines. The island is 280 acres, we should be able to implement social distancing, and make alterations to our guided tours."
He also expects Fáilte Ireland and Visit Cork to push for more domestic tourism this summer, which will hopefully bring a boost to the industry.
"It’s happening already, with people talking about staycations. Hopefully this will benefit everyone, the food and hospitality sector too."
However, the downturn in foreign tourists will be hard and he doesn’t expect much foreign travel for the next 18 months.
“But I think people living in Ireland will bounce back. They will head out to restaurants and tourist attractions."
Mr O’Callaghan also recognises that social distancing is here to stay, and the industry will have to adapt to it in order to entice Irish people out of their homes.
"We have so much to offer the domestic market. Hopefully this recession won’t be the same as the last time. People will have some form of income [government subsidies] and will support their local areas."
He is hopeful that people will want to explore Ireland more, as well as revisiting some holidays they took during their childhood.
"There are so many places to see in Cork, there's plenty on our own doorstep."

    <h5 class="mb-1">MoPH Warns of Outbreak of COVID-19 at Bakeries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) warned on Sunday that gatherings around bakeries for government-funded bread distribution could increase the outbreak of the coronavirus among the public.
According to the ministry, the coronavirus has spread rapidly in the past five days and positive cases are increasing day by day.
The Afghan government pledged to distribute bread to poor people via Kabul bakeries and it has started the process.
"Some bread is being distributed in the bakeries, but more people gathering. It has more disadvantages than advantages because the virus is spreading rapidly,” said Wahidullah Mayar, a spokesman for the MoPH.
Some residents of Kabul city also blasted the government policy of distributing bread via bakeries, and said that the gathering will harm people.
“People transfer the virus because for the 'ten breads,'” said Mohammad Bashir, a Kabul resident.
“For every person, $10 is allocated. Every family has 10 members, and they should receive $1,000 but they (officials) distribute only five breads. Ghani and Abdullah take the remaining money,” said Ghulam Bahauddin, another resident of Kabul city.
However, the Kabul municipality urged residents to follow the recommended health measures.
Apparently, the bread distribution process, which has received complaints from the public, is still being worked out.
“The list was made before the start of the process… we want the list to be complete soon,” said Daoud Sultanzoy, Mayor of Kabul city.
According to the mayor, the process will start in other provinces also.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) said that two men were arrested in PD15 and charged with stealing 200 bags of flour.
According to the MOI, the flour was allocated for poor people in Kabul city.
“The people and the issues are under investigation. Police will act seriously against the law-breakers,” said Fardaws Faramarz, spokesman for Kabul police.
The Kabul municipality distributed bread to 250,000 families across Kabul city via 2,500 bakeries, but some poor residents say that wealthy people are also included on the list to receive bread.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zimbabweans play cat and mouse with lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Citizens who were already battling to make ends meet before the lockdown are resorting to flouting regulations to keep food on the table
A low-pitched whistle blown from about 3km away is the first signal for informal traders and currency dealers in the dormitory town of Chitungwiza, 30km south-east of the capital Harare, to get ready to run away from police and military officers enforcing Covid-19 coronavirus lockdown measures in Zimbabwe.
A second high-pitched whistle is the red-light signal that the lockdown enforcers are close by and that everyone has to immediately vacate vending and currency trading positions and run for their lives.
Such is life in the townships of Zimbabwe, where it has become a daily toil for survival for the majority of the country’s urban unemployed populace who rely on daily informal trade and deals.
“The first whistle is for people to get ready because the police and army trucks may go in a different direction and away from our zone,” a 34-year-old man who sells small packs of potatoes by the roadside in Chitungwiza told City Press.
“But when the second whistle, which is high-pitched and long, comes, it means the security officers are in our zone and people have to immediately run.”
Life under lockdown has become unbearable for many in urban townships as they are unable to generate any income.
Moreover, government pledges of financial and humanitarian assistance have not materialised for the majority, who say they have run out of food stocks.

Zimbabwe extended its initial three-week-long lockdown by a further two weeks, which ended on Sunday, as President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration tries to contain the spread of Covid-19.
“Lockdown means that we will starve and I cannot watch my children go hungry, which is why I have to come out here and risk it all to sell vegetables. At least the farmers’ markets are open and we can buy in bulk for resale here in the township locations,” a vegetable vendor, who only identified herself as Edna, said as she served her clients at the Unit L Shopping Centre in Chitungwiza.
“We have heard of cases of Covid-19 from Mhondoro and Murehwa, and we are starting to get scared because these are cases away from those returning from the US and the UK, but there is nothing we can do,” she added.
Midway through the interview, the first low-pitched whistle sounds and she immediately packs up her stock.
After a one-minute interval, the second whistle sounds and everyone runs for cover, disappearing into nearby residential areas and a few closed smaller shops that magnify the longish sunset shadows of nearby trees.
About six armed military personnel disembark from a van, accompanied by a five police officers.
They shout instructions for people to stay indoors and make a few rounds before returning to their trucks and leaving.
But as soon as they turn the corner, the street vendors are back on the streets, restarting what has become a daily struggle for survival in these hard times of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Other outlets such as shebeens, barbers and dealerships have been opening despite clear lockdown regulations prohibiting their operation.
In Mutoko, about 150km from Harare, the 60-year-old friend of a family that is preparing for the burial of a relative has just been to the Mutoko District Hospital where her daughter has been discharged after being treated for malaria.
However, Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Kazembe Kazembe appears to be aware of this, saying on Thursday that this trend was cause for concern during national efforts to contain the further spread of the virus.
He said he was concerned about “some members of the public who are disregarding the lockdown measures” by continuing to gather around central business districts, shopping centres and residential areas.
“This poses a serious risk to the individuals concerned and the public at large … It militates against government efforts to manage the pandemic and, therefore, there is a requirement that people desist from such tendencies.
“We are equally disturbed by reports of people who are having parties at home, operating shebeens and some who are drinking beer in groups while closing themselves inside bars and bottle stores,” said Kazembe.
As many as 15 545 people have already been arrested throughout the country for various offences relating to violating Zimbabwe’s lockdown regulations, Kazembe added.
In rural areas, social norms have been disrupted and this is disturbing villagers, who can bear the restrictions no more.
The dead have to be buried speedily and social mourning gatherings have to be small.
Some rural areas in Zimbabwe are also smarting after an outbreak of malaria, with one malaria patient from Murehwa, about 90km from Harare, also testing positive for Covid-19.
In Mutoko, about 150km from Harare, the 60-year-old friend of a family that is preparing for the burial of a relative has just been to the Mutoko District Hospital where her daughter has been discharged after being treated for malaria.
She arrives at the funeral just before midnight and tells City Press: “She has been discharged; we feared the worst – that it was Covid-19 – but we are relieved that it is only malaria. I have only managed to pay half of the hospital bill.
“I am hoping that my duties as a sahwira [a traditional clan friend who can ridicule or make jokes at a funeral] will help me raise the balance,” she jokingly adds.
All Zimbabwean deaths and hospital admissions now have to be tested for Covid-19 in line with new government requirements. However, this is also clogging government hospitals as it can take up to three days to get the green light for burial after the release of test results.
Senior doctors in Zimbabwe want the government to step up testing for Covid-19 by deploying resources to kick-start community testing.
They are also pressing for the mandatory wearing of masks and for returning citizens to be kept in quarantine for longer to limit associated risks of further contamination.
This follows reports that the government was releasing returning citizens under quarantine earlier than recommendations set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which some government officials argue is necessary as a way of decongesting quarantine centres.
In a letter to Health Minister Obadiah Moyo this week, Dr Shingai Nyaguse wrote: “We do urge the ministry of health to make use of this time during the lockdown to maximise the testing and identification of Covid-19 cases. The current lack of testing at community level might prove to be a missed opportunity.
“We are concerned with the reduction of the quarantine period to an effective eight days, which is contrary to the WHO recommendations.”
As Zimbabweans battle for survival in the face of the Covid-19-induced lockdowns, the elderly population appears to be suffering the brunt of the pandemic as they are unable to fend for themselves.
A few parliamentarians have been able to provide some relief for the elderly, although most of the aid has been distributed along political and partisan lines.
But, for the majority of Zimbabweans, young and old in urban and rural areas, life under lockdown is proving to be a daily tussle for survival.
And it seems it will be like this for a long time to come as Covid-19 infection numbers continue to rise, with winter set to worsen some associated conditions such as pneumonia, according to medical doctors.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When OnePlus announced last month that they would finally add an always-on display feature to OxygenOS and their phones, our excitement could hardly be contained. It’s the one missing feature we have been begging them for for years.Without a timeline for when it might arrive, that joy was somewhat short-lived, but this week, OnePlus provided our first update on the situation.
In a forum post to update everyone on their IDEA program and the ideas adopted from it, OnePlus said that they hope to finish development of always-on display “around June” before going into closed and open beta tests in August or September. Those dates are subject to changes, but give us a rough estimate.
That timing is somewhat curious, as we should see Android 11 also arrive around then. Is OnePlus going to add always-on display as a feature to Android 11 updates or is it simply a coincidence? Tough to tell.
I think what has me scratching my head further here is this idea that they are deep in development of a feature they had previously included in phones as recently as the OnePlus 6. That phone had always-on display out of the box, but was then removed with a day-1 update. Since then, OnePlus has only said that they would consider adding the feature up until now, where they have decided to give it another shot.
Are they really starting from scratch here? Can they not just tweak the previous idea with new battery-saving features that address previous concerns? I still don’t get how every other major phone maker has had always-on display for years and OnePlus is only now starting over on it.
Always-on display is not the only new idea that OnePlus adopted from fan suggestions. They also plan to add more fingerprint-related features, play a sound when batteries are fully charged, add folders to the app drawer, and more.
Here is the full list of upcoming IDEA features:
We’ll let you know once we get closer to beta time this summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Once we've spent big, structural reform is our next weapon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Morrison government’s economic policy response to the COVID-19 shock has so far been about supporting businesses and workers affected by the downturn.
As the government begins to shift from medical emergency management and job stabilisation to plan jobs recovery, it needs to consider the most effective ways to thaw the economy from the deep freeze – the so-called "hiber-cession". It also faces some binding constraints.
Whatever approach the government takes, it cannot rely on further stimulus through either arm of macroeconomic policy. This is because both monetary and fiscal policy levers have effectively been “spent” in crisis management.
What remains? Essentially, structural reform. That is, improving the mix of taxes and spending along with other market structures in a way that enhances competition and/or productivity. Applied pragmatically and fairly, this can be a no-regrets outcome.
What is needed now are initiatives to shore up private capital expenditure. The idea is to help the economy rebound and recover with vigour.
The backdrop to the COVID-19 shock was a decade-long weakness in business capital expenditure in OECD economies, seemingly due to low expectations of future income growth and over-reliance on unorthodox central bank stimuli. This caused a vicious downward cycle. Low business expenditure reduced trend growth, which further lowered investment.
The superannuation sector is a willing partner to assist government in designing, funding and implementing any economic recovery measures. The federal and state governments could consider drawing upon long‑term equity investors such as super funds to help shape their plans to pull the Australian economy out of the COVID-19 downturn.
There are structural reforms the government could announce with the prospect of cross-party support to create jobs and generate wealth in the Australian economy for years to come.
First, infrastructure. Governments could reach out to institutional investors, presenting them with a shopping list or league table of medium- to high-value project priorities and asking who wants to be the long-term owner. The idea is to tender these out to equity participants and leave them to contract out construction activities. This would leave governments to line up planning approvals. Projects that didn't meet super funds' risk-return profiles could be supported by the public in terms of sharing patronage risk until volumes were established.
Second, tax reform. Economists Ross Garnaut and Craig Emerson remind us of the prevalence of "economic rents" in the Australian economy and the need to replace company taxes and stamp duties with a cash-flow tax and land taxes. Such tax reforms could be achieved on a revenue-neutral basis.
A cash-flow tax allows for the immediate write-off of capital expenditure by business. It forces big foreign tech companies to pay their fair share of tax. It leaves most enterprises non-taxable over time. It would also be a huge spur to institutional investors, such as super funds, to fund greenfield investment and so build the industries of the future.
Third, strategic supply chain investments in each major Australian export commodity would help to target infrastructure and industry policy bottlenecks. These should include logistics, processing and distribution channels with a view to enhancing domestic value-adding.
There are some obvious supply chains within the Australian economy that could and should have been dedicated to high-growth markets in commodities (such as wheat, wool, milk and beef).
We should follow the example of many other smaller nations, such as New Zealand, and purposefully fuse these operations into an internationally competitive conglomerate. Super fund investment across supply chains can help to make this a reality.
Fourth, build to-rent and affordable housing. Governments surely realise that if they are not prepared to deliver affordable housing directly via public balance sheets (i.e. public housing), they must provide equivalent subsidy to private balance sheets, probably via not-for-profit community-housing providers. The simple way to fund this is to limit negative gearing to new homes and provide a tradeable tax credit to long-term equity capital to build housing for the community housing sector.
Fifth, small- and medium-size enterprise lending. It seems there is a genuine market failure limiting capital provision (debt and equity) to SMEs. This is supported by RBA firm-level research, which has quantified this funding gap at about 500 basis points, controlling for all other factors including risk. Anthony Pratt has done much to publicise this matter.
Super funds want to work with banks (and possibly others) to provide longer term debt and equity. Funds could outsource credit "assessment" activities to banks or non-banks and specialist investment managers acting on their behalf or investing in other structures (such as RMBS or ABS securitisation) that provide them with exposure to the small business sector.
Looking at the five proposals, they would barely affect federal or state budgets, but all could significantly and speedily affect business investment by way of the private sector. Also, the cash-flow tax would provide a significant upfront stimulus to the economy when it is needed most.
All these proposals could be implemented quickly with the backing of long‑term equity investors such as super funds, which have deep experience in managing infrastructure and property projects.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Slow release: On lockdown 3.0</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Balancing lives and livelihoods, the Centre has extended the national lockdown for COVID-19 for two weeks from May 4, with fewer restrictions on activity. But the highly contagious virus has not disappeared and the weeks ahead present a challenge to States. They must ensure that the gains from the lockdown in terms of a relatively low death toll and a cap on new cases are not reversed overnight in the red, orange and green zones, where normality of varying degrees is to be restored, barring the containment zones. Kerala, lauded for its success in containing the pandemic, has chosen to retain some curbs even in green zones. Allowing some economic activity, though not at full pace, and under safeguards, was inevitable, although the stipulations in the Home Ministry’s orders require a high degree of civic cooperation. The continued suspension of air, rail, inter-State and urban public transport, and the bar on mass gatherings and entertainment venues remove a major source of crowding, although the restrictions on the number of passengers allowed in private vehicles and taxi cabs, and the protocol for personnel in industries call for strict adherence to succeed. Allowing outpatient clinics to reopen and the permission given for plumbers, electricians and other technicians to work with safeguards are welcome. The relaxation process can be eased greatly if States adopt a ‘how to’ approach and communicate to citizens clearly.
In the absence of medical remedies, prevention remains the only option against the virus. Using face masks, now mandatory, hand washing and physical distancing at all times are universally recognised precautions. Such measures were adopted relatively late in India, with politicians initially reluctant to even adjourn legislatures, leave alone impose strict curbs on public activity. It has taken more than a month to move migrant workers back to their home States by train; in the interim, several desperate families have tried to walk home across vast distances and many have perished. Besides ensuring decent conditions for these workers and the education of their children, States must also prepare for the arrival of expatriate workers in large numbers from West Asia and elsewhere. These unprecedented pressures add to the need to maintain the highest vigil against COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, the biggest cities, with a legacy of market-driven housing policies, unplanned densification, rampant pollution and poor health-care access are red zones, with large infection clusters. Their decay is marked by the absence of usable commons, including pavements in normally crowded localities, making it difficult to maintain distancing. This is an appropriate moment to start repairing that damage. What the public must be told emphatically is that the relaxation of the lockdown is not a return to life as it existed before the coronavirus. It is a new reality, one that calls for safe, measured activity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Central bankers open up the pandemic box</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Central banks worldwide have become the white knights in the COVID-19 economic crisis. Having pledged "whatever it takes" to expand liquidity and their balance sheets to fight the economic impact, they have been applauded.
The US Federal Reserve was among the first to act, cutting rates to near zero, by 150 basis points in one early-March swoop, and rapidly escalating purchases of government securities, mortgage paper and other assets, with almost no upper limit.
The European Central Bank (ECB) was initially cautious but added €1 trillion ($1.7 trillion) in credit facilities. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) expanded re-lending and re-discounting facilities by 1.8 trillion yuan ($40 billion) and lowered bank reserve requirements to facilitate greater lending to businesses.
On 27 April, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) delivered a three-part salvo that also committed to purchase Japanese government bonds (JGB) without limit, triple the amount of corporate bond and commercial paper purchases, and fund commercial bank lending to small and medium-enterprises (SMEs).
So far, this "helicopter money" has stemmed financial market panic and engineered bear market rallies. But since a COVID-19 vaccine could be over a year away, what are the longer-term implications of central bank intervention?
War financing aside, the speed and scale of central bank action are unprecedented. Quantitative easing (QE) took root in the global financial crisis as a tool to expand central bank balance sheets by direct funding of government, corporate and bank debt. Come April 2020, the top four central banks’ (Fed, ECB, BOJ and PBOC) balance sheet size was $US21.6 trillion ($33.6 trillion), more than triple that at the end of 2007. By the end of 2018, global central bank assets were $US30 trillion – less than global insurance assets ($US34 trillion) but growing faster.
With the Congressional Budget Office estimating the US federal budget deficit would reach $US3.7 trillion in fiscal 2020, the Fed’s balance sheet will rise sharply – already reaching $US6.6 trillion, or 30 per cent of GDP, by 21 April. The BOJ’s already exceeds 100 per cent of GDP. The ECB and PBOC sit around 40 per cent.
When central banks are that large, their asset purchases significantly affect total resource allocation and market distribution of risks. The BOJ already holds half of all JGBs and 9 per cent of all Nikkei-indexed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the Fed owns nearly 60 per cent of outstanding US mortgage-backed securities.
As central banks ramp up buying all types of assets, including funding SMEs and even pay-cheque loans, have they implicitly become the largest underwriter of credit risk? There is an increasingly significant moral hazard built into investor expectations, that every time financial markets wobble, central banks exercise the "Greenspan put" by cutting interest rates or injecting liquidity.
Central banks have gradually moved beyond "lender of last resort" to become major players and determinants of market prices. Free financial markets operate under the assumption that market prices are determined competitively by many players of roughly equal size. Large-scale QE has proved this a myth.
QE has been blamed for shifting global nominal and real interest rates to or below zero. With the pandemic-induced crisis, it is hard to see how these rates (and very low credit spreads) can be good guides for efficient asset allocation. With limited prospects for growth without a vaccine, private sector investment will remain subdued, so central bank liquidity will be deployed for speculative rather than productive purposes. Consequently, central banks will be blamed for facilitating more asset bubbles and worsening inequalities in the post-pandemic era.
QE seems able to magically conjure resources out of thin air without inflationary consequences. Why bother to tax and why can’t central banks fund global public goods? Why can’t central banks create a special drawing rights-based global climate change fund to tackle climate change?
There is a snag to this QE privilege. It appears confined mainly to reserve currency central banks. Any emerging-market central bank that tries it faces greater domestic inflation or capital outflows.
And who will pay for the pandemic losses when central banks end up holding a large chunk of financial assets on their balance sheet? Won’t this mean the socialisation of losses and privatisation of gains? If these losses are inflated away, won’t the poor and savers bear the losses of credit defaults?
The pandemic has opened a Pandora’s box of unanswered questions to which central bankers have no clear answers. They can act when politicians are reluctant to take tough tax and structural reform decisions and have marched first into the breach, without an exit plan.
QE monetary creation and liquidity are only temporary aspirins to ease crisis pain. They do not address the painful but necessary structural adjustments needed to redesign the high consumption, high debt, just-in-time economy that is fiscally, financially and ecologically unsustainable and socially fragile.
The winner under social distancing is online business. What will emerge post-pandemic is Big Government and Big Tech, with small businesses and workers finding themselves further marginalised if they do not have the wherewithal to transform.
Like the coronavirus, QE can’t be put back in the bottle. Central bankers can no longer pretend that they are apolitical independent institutions. They wield a tool that can make or destroy the social fabric. It is time to have a serious conversation about the post-pandemic social contract that must include the role of central banks.

Quite irreverent, irresponsible, and abrasively effective, these tweets have been the second thing I consume in the morning, imagining how his victims would be writhing in agony.
It is pity that of late he seems to have been prevailed upon to go slow on the delightful stuff.
Mr Donald John Trump is perhaps the most unconventional president ever elected in any democracy.
His victory in 2017 against the better-known Hillary Clinton was so confounding that many Americans are still reeling.
Whether his administration has been effective is best left to Americans themselves, and they will make their views known in November.
But while it is not for us here to make any kind of judgement on the man’s personality or electability, we can certainly continue enjoying all his foibles which are simply out of this world.
Another man whose antics closely echo those of President Trump is our very own Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who is always in the news for negative reasons of his own making.
Given his penchant for theatrics, Mr Sonko is also a most unlikely political leader who erupted from nowhere and stole the show by defeating the establishment, and then proceeded to project acute hubris and ostentatious philanthropy in equal measure.
FANATICAL SUPPORTERS
One might say that comparing Governor Sonko to President Trump is like comparing an apple to an orange because although both are fruits, they live in different worlds and wield different levels of power.
However, in the final analysis, both exhibit traits that baffle their detractors, for the more outrageous their exploits, the more popular they seem to grow among voters. And this is not the only similarity in their behaviour.
For one, not only do they have huge cores of fanatical supporters who will stand by them through thick and thin, they also exhibit disturbing dictatorial tendencies.
They like hiring and firing people at whim, and they cannot stand any contradiction or accept any advice from the people they hire, especially specialists.
Both are absolutely convinced of their infallibility and when they are proved wrong, they like to shift blame to everyone else but themselves.
Instead of consulting experts, they will come up with madcap ideas and solutions to problems that are beyond their ken.
A recent example will suffice. When everyone else is grappling with the problems associated with the novel coronavirus, each one, in his own way, has come up with a cure.
Governor Sonko found a cure in Hennessy, including small bottles in care packages he donated to the poor, arguing that since alcohol is said to kill the virus, the high content in the brandy should do the job.
GRASSROOTS MOBILISER
President Trump, on the other hand, and against the advice of his medical advisers, started by trumpeting the virtues or a “miracle drug”, chloroquine, and then made the matter worse by subsequently advocating the direct ingestion of disinfectants, apparently to clean up the innards and kill the virus.
We can go on in this vein, but it would be more productive to discuss how the two got to positions of authority where they can peddle utter folly and get away with it.
The best way is to start right at home. Before December 2007 few Kenyans knew who Gideon Mbuvi Mike Kioko was.
Under a little-known party, Narc-Kenya, he suddenly erupted into the Nairobi political scene by defeating two seasoned politicians, Mr Dick Wathika of PNU, who was the incumbent, and Mr Reuben Ndolo of ODM, the previous seat-holder who had occasioned the critical by-election through a petition.
He turned out to be a man of the people, a grassroots mobiliser who spoke their language and understood their needs.
He told Makadara constituency voters that he was one of their own and he would articulate all their concerns in Parliament.
He spoke to matatu crews in their lingo, and promised mama mbogas protection from the marauding askaris.
The spiels he delivered about his daredevil earlier life endeared him to all who felt marginalised.
His philanthropy too was legendary, though the source of his enormous wealth was never questioned.
GRAFT CHARGES
By the end of the campaign period, he had won the seat by a wide margin. He never looked back. Three years later, Mr Sonko was Nairobi senator.
Like many others of his ilk, he probably thought a senator was more powerful than a governor, but when he did win the seat he did so with a huge margin — 808,705.
He was to win the gubernatorial seat with an even bigger margin. These massive victories could have turned his head, for he continued behaving in a very erratic manner, until last year when he was caught up in a web of intrigues that landed him in court on corruption charges.
Today, he is battling forces that seek to diminish his clout in Nairobi politics due to his incompetence and cringeworthy antics.
Before his troubles boiled over, his ministers were said to be terrified of him, and they had reason to be.
He was known to hire and fire at whim and the turnover at City Hall has been the highest of any devolved unit.
The fact that he has run the city government without a deputy since 2018 is testimony enough of the bloated state of his ego.
In February, he was beguiled into ceding some of his constitutional functions to a non-elected entity and now that the ramifications of what he did have finally dawned on him — mainly because of the money and power of patronage lost — he has been noisily seeking to take back his powers.
COMPLETE ROOKIE
Buffeted on all sides, Mr Sonko’s braggadocio is slowly waning, but still, you can’t rule him out; he might surprise everyone by winning re-election in 2022, but that is only if Nairobi voters are still swayed by considerations other than competence.
As for Donald Trump, very few people took him seriously when he ran for the presidency in 2016.
His only claim to fame was that he was a self-made billionaire in real estate and hospitality, and also hosted a popular reality television programme, “The Apprentice”, which gave him name recognition.
When he joined politics, he was a complete rookie with less than noble traits that resonated well with a huge number of voters who could never stomach the idea that the most powerful office on earth had been occupied by a Black American with Kenyan roots for eight long years.
The fact that President Barack Obama acquitted himself admirably in those years was never enough to assuage their anxiety.
So Trump’s victory can be attributed to reaction among conservative voters who felt that their country had strayed too far to the left.
Another issue that appealed to his voters was immigration. For years, white America has been swamped by the understandable though exaggerated fear of being overrun by immigrants from Latin American and “s … hole” Third World countries. Mr Trump promised to do something about it.
The immigration issue is too convoluted to deal with here, but the upshot was that many Americans heartily welcomed the often brutal and heartless changes in policy.
ENEMY OF DISSENT
When blended with racism and xenophobia, the result has been toxic to the victims but deeply satisfying to conservative America.
Another trait that President Trump shares with our man from Mua Hills is his intolerance for dissent from the people he hires, firing them at will, not for incompetence or insubordination, but because they dared to tell the king that was naked.
In many ways, President Trump comes across as the most unlikely man to have ever occupied the White House. Yet with all these peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, he is not as daft as he lets on.
Indeed, his IQ is rated to be above average, though you cannot tell by the way he rants.
Some people believe it is all an act, but it would be foolhardy of his political opponents, now reduced to “Sleepy” Joe Biden, to “misunderestimate” him, as George W Bush would say.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: What does a post-pandemic economy look like?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This article, written by Loren Falkenberg, University of Calgary and Jillian Walsh, University of York, originally appeared on The Conversation and has been republished here with permission:
What does a post-pandemic economy look like? Health researchers are indicating that managing this virus will be a long-term game. That means COVID-19 will impact the economy for months, maybe years, but reopening businesses cannot wait until the virus is completely eradicated.
Estimated lost wages from the locked-down Canadian economy range between $3 billion to $6 billion per month. Many Canadians are worrying about more than infection; concerns about affording rent and everyday necessities are pervasive. Restarting businesses is not only important for the social well-being of Canadians but also for restoring investor confidence in the market and generating much-needed tax revenue.
Germany has just started to make small steps by reopening small shops. Understanding when and how to reopen businesses may be the most challenging task of this pandemic. Reopening too soon risks a second wave of infections and a far greater negative economic impact.
However, not allowing companies to promptly reopen will lead to a deep recession and is already fuelling societal unrest. Successfully re-establishing businesses in a COVID-19 economy requires government, health-care and business leaders working together to implement a phased return to employment.
The first phase is the one in which we now find ourselves: working from home or unemployed. Many professional and business-to-business companies have learned to facilitate working from home using web-based technology over the past few weeks.
This has been critical in reducing COVID-19 transmission, but it’s not sustainable in the long term. So what’s next?
Phase 2: Resuming small-scale operations
The next phase is a suppression approach involving reopening and supporting businesses where virus transmission can be easily controlled.
Workplaces that have adequate space for physical distancing, easy access to soap and water and the ability for continuous cleaning of all public areas should be encouraged to reopen. These businesses can learn from those that remained open during the lockdown.
This might require that businesses operate with reduced hours until they can assure regular and thorough cleaning of their workplaces.
In a pandemic, short-term age discrimination may also be justified. Employers should be encouraged to rehire younger people after they’ve been tested, while governments continue to provide financial support to older workers and those with chronic health conditions, since younger people are less likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection.
Success in this early phase is dependent on rapid testing of employees displaying symptoms, including a potential self-testing kit and the quick return of results. Employers must keep reminding employees to stay home if they are not feeling well, while governments must continue to provide easy and quick access to insurance for lost wages.
In the meantime, employees have a responsibility to limit their social exposure when they’re not at work. The goal must be to keep the transmission rate a low as possible.
Phase 3: Expanding to social events
The next phase should begin within a month of lowering the infection rate to acceptable levels, a number that still hasn’t been established. There is ongoing development of models of transmission in different-sized and types of groups, and as more is learned on how to ensure low infection rates, businesses and organizations can expand operations carefully.
This could mean allowing more customers into stores and restaurants at one time, allowing small social gatherings and reopening some education and recreation facilities. Professional sports leagues could resume, either with relatively few or no spectators. Whatever the expansion looks like, maintenance of new cleaning and social and physical distancing practices needs to be ensured.
Phase 4: Domestic tourism
The final phase should focus on rebuilding domestic tourism and Canada’s reputation as a safe country for its citizens to explore.
Airlines and hotels should have appropriate cleaning and hygiene practices ready to go. Reopening the border could be considered for those countries that have also controlled transmission of the virus.
During this phased-in approach, governments need to go beyond providing financial stimulus packages. Businesses also need to be supported in training workers on safety and sanitation precautions, and must facilitate the development of technologies that monitor workplace social distancing and tracking of interactions that could lead to virus transmission.
Governments and health-care experts must also continually monitor and provide updates on transmission rates. Success is dependent on everyone being informed.
Public trust in business is critical. Canadians have effectively responded to this pandemic. To ensure ongoing co-operation, they need to know there’s plan for getting people back to work.
COVID-19 will not be the last health threat to the Canadian economy. Our focus needs to shift from controlling risks through economic shutdowns to managing health-related threats in the workplace. Otherwise disastrous economic downturns will continue.
The response to COVID-19, in fact, should become a learning opportunity on how to develop more illness-proof economies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Malaysian economy could shrink more than earlier forecasts, says finance minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's economy in 2020 could shrink more than initially forecast due to extended curbs on movement imposed to stem an outbreak of the new coronavirus, the finance minister said on Saturday (May 2).
Malaysia's central bank had forecast in April for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of between -2 per cent and 0.5 per cent this year.
"But that forecast was made after just two weeks of movement curbs. We're now more than five weeks in ... so our GDP could shrink even more," Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said in an interview with a local television channel.
Malaysia, which has announced a stimulus package worth 250 billion ringgit (US$5.8 billion) to help cushion the economic blow from the outbreak, will also announce an economic recovery plan later this month, the minister said.
Malaysian authorities on Saturday defended plans to ease coronavirus lockdown measures next week even as the number of new infections jumped to a two-week high.
Most businesses will reopen on Monday, although schools, cinemas and nightclubs will remain closed, along with the country's borders. Mass gatherings will still be banned.
Security minister Ismail Sabri said Malaysia was not being hasty in relaxing the curbs, stressing that businesses reopening will have to implement hygiene and social distancing measures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Atlanta area malls reopen after virus restrictions eased</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATLANTA (AP) - The Atlanta region’s largest malls have begun reopening, though not all the stores inside are restarting business, as restrictions enacted in Georgia because of the coronavirus have been eased.
The Outlet Shoppes in Woodstock opened for the weekend, but some individual stores in the complex stayed closed. John Rampsott was among the few shoppers.
“It ended up just being kind of surreal where you just go and no one’s there,” he told WSB-TV.
At Lenox Square in Buckhead, which reopens Monday, the owners are requiring workers to take safety precautions, such as being symptom-free and wearing masks at the mall. Arbor Place Mall in Douglasville set up sanitizing stations as it opened its doors, and kept the children’s play area and food court seating closed.
Some shoppers think the openings are too soon and too risky.
“I’m fearful of people not taking safety precautions, and (I’d) rather be safe than to shop right now,” Tanya Moor said.
More than 28,600 Georgians have tested positive for the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health. The state’s death toll grew to 1,177 on Sunday, with three additional deaths reported.
The number of infections is thought to be far higher than official counts because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For others, the highly contagious virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 infections at Cologne raise questions over safety of Bundesliga's return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Covid-19 infection of three people at German top-flight football team FC Cologne has raised questions about the safety of a possible Bundesliga restart amid the coronavirus pandemic.
With the Bundesliga battling to convince the government that the season should restart in May, and with daily infection figures dropping, Cologne announced the positive tests on Friday (May 1).
“Likely two players, one staffer infected,” wrote Karl Lauterbach, senior lawmaker with the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition, on Twitter on Saturday.
“The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with Covid-19 risks damages to lung, heart and kidneys,” added Lauterbach, who is a professor of health economics and epidemiology.
“I am surprised that players are allowing this,” he said in reference to Cologne’s training continuing with the rest of the squad instead of them all being quarantined as a precaution.
“Football should be a model example and not ‘bread and games’,” he said.
Cologne had said all three cases were symptom-free and the individuals were placed in a 14-day quarantine, but the club did not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those concerned, nor did it say whether players were involved.
While Bundesliga clubs have returned to training in small groups in the past weeks after the league was suspended in mid-March, they must wait another week to find out about a possible restart to the season.
The German government on Thursday delayed any decision over a league resumption amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The cash-strapped clubs and league had been hoping for the green light to end the two-month suspension so the league can contractually finish by June 30.
The German Football League has also submitted a health safety plan for games without spectators that foresees regular testing of players but no quarantine for entire squads in cases of positive tests.
Chancellor Merkel has said any decision on if and when sports could resume would be taken on May 6.

The Director General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said in a statement on Saturday that NAFDAC had not granted approval for any vaccine for the treatment and cure of COVID-19.
“To put the record straight, no drugs or vaccines have been given approval in the country for cure of COVID-19.

She said that NAFDAC would continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to safeguard the health of Nigerians and that in the event of any approved drug or vaccine for the cure of COVID-19, the agency would not hesitate to inform the public.
Adeyeye, however, advised Nigerians to comply strictly with measures issued by NCDC to prevent the spread of COVID-19, adding that these include the use of face covering masks, social distancing, washing of hands and use of alcohol based sanitisers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray believes there is strong support among leading players on the ATP Tour for a merger with the WTA.
Roger Federer tweeted his backing for a unified tennis tour last month, amid the coronavirus-enforced halt to major sporting action.
Rafael Nadal immediately backed the Swiss star and Murray, another supporter of the idea, is encouraged by the discussion, though he insists female players must also be heard.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," the two-time Wimbledon winner said to CNN.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard."
Murray, who was previously coached by Amelie Mauresmo, has long been an advocate for the women's game, but explained challenges remain in changing the views of some.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal," he said.
"I said, 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me, 'Yeah, actually.'
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Condo residents question city plan to house homeless people in midtown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Residents in the Yonge and Eglinton area are raising questions about a city plan to temporarily house homeless people in two midtown apartments on Broadway Avenue during the COVID-19 crisis.
“This development has caught us by surprise,” says a letter, which was obtained by NOW, from the Republic Residents’ Association. The letter includes questions the association, which represents two buildings, plans to ask city officials, including frequency of resident turnover and whether self-isolation and physical distancing will be enforced.
“While we recognize there are many admirable aspects to this initiative and agree with it in principle, we nonetheless have serious concerns and questions about its implementation and its impact on the safety and well-being of the neighbourhood," the letter states. "While this arrangement is intended to be temporary, it is not a proposal and residents have already begun to move in.”
The letter directs readers to the Toronto Star report on the city’s action to relocate people from makeshift encampments into apartments in two adjoining four-storey buildings owned by the Times Group Corporation. The buildings will be torn down eventually, but the Times Group is leasing 125 units to the city for $55 per unit per day, pledging to donate the proceeds to food banks.
The project’s focus is to immediately relocate people living in encampments, under bridges or near ravines. The efforts are underway just as news broke yesterday that one person has died after a fire broke out at an encampment under a bridge in Rosedale.
The Republic Residents’ Association declined NOW’s interview request, but a representative, Miria Ioannou, provided a statement.
“While our community was not consulted about this decision, the Republic Residents’ Association supports efforts to assist people who need help at this difficult time," the statement reads. "We are very concerned about the implementation of this program and want to ensure that our neighbourhood and the new residents are kept safe from COVID-19.”
The Republic Residents’ Association also says it represents North Toronto Collegiate Institute students, parents and staff. The association has set up a meeting on May 4 with city councillor Josh Matlow and Toronto's general manager of shelter, support and housing Mary-Anne Bedard. According to the letter, the association also reached out to MPP Jill Andrew and councillor Jaye Robinson.
Points to be discussed during the meeting: who is being housed, how COVID-19 testing will be administered, how will social distancing be enforced and how will the temporary residents be monitored. 
“Just as there is not a requirement for security in private buildings, there’s no requirement for security here,” councillor Joe Cressy, who worked on the temporary housing plan, tells NOW. “We are providing comprehensive, 24/7 staffing to support people, not to police them."
Cressy adds the city will provide the temporary residents with food, cleaning, counselling, help towards finding permanent housing and harm reduction support for those dealing with addiction.
“We are in the midst of the most dire global pandemic in a century,” he says. “All of the evidence has shown that the most vulnerable to COVID-19 are those living in congregate settings: the homeless living on the streets, seniors living in long-term care facilities and people living in shelters. We have a fundamental duty right now to save lives. And that means providing immediate pathways to housing for the homeless.”
Cressy worked on the project with Bedard, who was unavailable for comment. Her office has housed 50 people in the apartments (among them studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Detect, isolate and contain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the number of Covid-19 deaths and infected patients keep going up, experts blame it on inadequate case detection and isolation measures taken up by the authorities.
They said although the ongoing shutdown has "slowed" the transmission rate of the coronavirus, the future might be "harsh" if there is no rigorous case detection and isolation measures put in place through the enforcement of a strict countrywide lockdown. 
"The lockdown has slowed down the transmission, but we see the authorities' decision to open garment industries without ensuring certain health measures. Such actions could increase the danger," Dr Mushtuq Hussain, consultant at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told The Daily Star yesterday.
Earlier in the day, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) reported that 552 new cases were detected and five more people died in 24 hours since 2:30pm yesterday.
With it, the total number of detected Covid-19 cases stood at 8,790 while the death toll hit 175.
Like other days, Prof Nasima Sultana, additional director general (administration) at the DGHS, informed about the country's latest Covid-19 situation in a bulletin through videoconferencing.
She said three more patients receiving treatment at hospitals recovered in those 24 hours, taking the total number of reported recovery cases to 177.
Among the five deceased, three were males and two were females. All of them were from Dhaka.
One of the deceased was over 60 years, one between 51 and 60, two were between 41 and 50 and one was between 31 and 40, said Prof Nasima.
The authorities had reported the first three Covid-19 cases in the country on March 8 and the first death on March 18.
Of all the 175 deceased, 73 percent were males, shows IEDCR data.
Some 42 percent of all the deceased were above 60, some 27 percent were aged between 51 and 60, some 19 percent between 41 and 50, some seven percent between 31 and 40. The rest were below 30.
No death has so far been reported from the age group 11-20, shows the data.
Dhaka city continues to remain the worst-affected region in terms of the number of cases and deaths caused by the deadly virus.
As of yesterday, a total of 4,309 cases -- 56.02 percent of all cases -- were detected in Dhaka city alone, according to the IEDCR website.
More than 83 percent of the total cases were from Dhaka division, it showed.
As many as 95 Covid-19 patients who died in hospitals were from the capital, seemingly the epicenter of the outbreak in Bangladesh.
During the last three days, the city saw more than 200 new cases daily -- a continuous upward trend compared to other regions.
Among other regions, Narayanganj saw the highest cases -- 987 --  followed by Gazipur with 322 confirmed cases.
Out of 342 confirmed cases in Chattogram division, highest 104 cases were detected in Cumilla district,  proved to be another epicenter outside Dhaka division.
Mymensingh saw 269 cases as of yesterday while 149 cases were detected in Rangpur division, 147 cases in Khulna, 135 in Sylhet, 123 in Barishal and 112 in Rajshahi.
A total of 5,827 individuals' samples were tested in 24 hours since 2:30pm yesterday, which is 4.56 percent more than the previous day, Dr Nasima said.
One hundred and sixty eight people were put under isolation across the country over the period, she added.
'CASE DETECTION, ISOLATION CRUCIAL'
Recently, thousands of readymade garment workers have returned to work from their village home after the government allowed to operate RMG factories with certain conditions.
Sources, however, said the decision was finalised without fixing any health protocol in coordination with the DGHS.
"Maintaining social distancing is the key to contain the transmission. Now the situation will depend on how we are maintaining it," Prof Nasima told The Daily Star, while replying to a query on the issue.
Asked whether the reopening decision was taken in consultation with the DGHS, she said, "You better ask it our high-ups."
Source said the government office concerned and the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association had sought suggestions from the DGHS and the IEDCR in this regard.
Later, the DGHS asked to ensure social distancing in the living places of the garment workers, while the IEDCR suggested keeping the workers in 14 days of quarantine before they would join work.
"There was a recommendation that those factories which will not be able to maintain the protocol will remain shut down," Dr Mushtuq Hussain told The Daily Star.
In a latest development, an inter-ministerial meeting on "reopening industries and commerce on a limited scale" will be held today . The meeting would be presided over by the health minister at his office, sources said.
Besides, the government is also planning to extend the ongoing lockdown until May 16, the media reported yesterday, quoting state minister for the ministry of public administration Forhad Hossain, as saying.
Experts, however, said the lockdown would not be fruitful unless every case was detected and isolated accordingly.
"Initially, Thailand and Singapore contained the outbreak successfully. But now we see they are on the brink of second wave of transmission. The virus has spread even to remote islands. So we have nothing to feel complacent," Dr Mushtuq Hussain said.
He thinks the DGHS should take prompt actions as it has the legal authority to take any measures to contain the outbreak. "The DGHS has the authority to inspect any place and take action accordingly. The question is whether they are doing or not."
"It is an unknown virus. So, if anyone says the virus will not wreak havoc here, it will be an unscientific statement."
Talking to The Daily Star, Prof Nazrul Islam, member of the National Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19, said, "Reopening economic activity is a necessity. But we have to fix strategy for this. We don't know what the situation will turn after 8-10 days."
Both the experts suggested scaling up the daily number of tests, detecting and isolating the positive cases as early as possible.
The number of daily tests is still around 6,000. The authorities are now planning to increase the number to 10,000 within a week, according to DGHS sources.
However, the tests will be still inadequate, experts pointed out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FC Koln COVID-19 cases raise question on safety of football restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berlin: The news of three FC Koln players testing positive for novel coronavirus has raised questions in Germany of the safety behind restarting the football season in May.
A senior lawmaker with the Social Lawmakers, junior partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, has said that the rest of the squad, who will continue to train, risk damage to lung, heart and kidneys if they are carrying the virus.
"Likely two players, one staffer infected," wrote Karl Lauterbach, who is also a professor of health, economics and epidemiology, on Twitter. "The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with COVID-19 risks damages to lung, heart and kidneys."
Lauterbach expressed surprise that the players are not opposing the continuation of training instead of being quarantined. "Football should be a model example and not 'bread and games'," he said.
The German side recently returned to training in groups and had the entire playing squad, as well as the coaching and background staff tested for the coronavirus this week.
"Three people tested positive, all are symptom-free. After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home," FC Koln said in an official statement on their official website.
"FC Koln will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected. FC Koln's training can continue as planned, according to the hygiene and infection control measures that have been in place since April 6th in group training," it added.
German Football League (DFL) Chief Executive Christian Seifert had last week said that it is hoping to restart league football in the country on May 9 provided they get the green light from the country's government. The German football season was halted on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five ways the coronavirus could change American politics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">How will the coronavirus crisis affect American politics?
The focus, for now, is naturally on the emergency itself. As of Friday evening, more than 1 million people in the U.S. had been infected by the coronavirus and more than 59,000 had died, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
But here are five areas where the crisis could have a political impact over the longer term.
Universal health care
The global nature of the health crisis has been a reminder of the United States’s status as the only first-world nation without universal health care coverage.
Additionally, the underpinnings of the U.S. system — where many people’s health insurance is linked to their employment — is under new scrutiny as enormous job losses scythe across the nation. More than 30 million Americans have filed new unemployment claims in the past six weeks.
There is some evidence that the crisis is shifting public views of health care.
A Morning Consult poll in mid-March, just as the crisis was beginning to hit the U.S. hard, found increasing support for universal, government-provided coverage.
The poll found 26 percent of all adults saying it was “much more likely” they would support such a concept and an additional 15 percent saying it was “somewhat more likely.” 
Fifty-nine percent of Democrats chose one of those options, but so did 25 percent of Republicans. Only 12 percent of adults said the crisis made it less likely they would support universal health care.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a leading proponent of the idea, has asserted that the crisis makes his case. 
In a March op-ed for CNN, written before he suspended his presidential campaign, Sanders asserted that universal health care was vital because people would otherwise be discouraged from seeking medical treatment because of the cost. “When somebody is not treated for the virus, that means the infection can spread to many others, putting whole communities at risk,” he wrote.
Still, there is no guarantee that the coronavirus crisis will move opinions on universal health care in a permanent way. And even if it did so, it is an open question whether legislation to achieve it could be enacted. 
Republicans, including President Trump, are adamantly opposed to such an idea. And even the much more modest Affordable Care Act passed under former President Obama remains divisive. Forty-two percent of voters think it was a good idea, while 35 percent say it was a bad idea, according to a March poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal.
Mail-in voting
The coronavirus crisis may yet herald a change in Americans’ perceptions of voting itself — specifically, the desirability of casting ballots by mail rather than in person.
If the virus were to still be a danger in November, many people would be reluctant to wait in long lines for protracted periods. 
There are already signs that the nation is warming to the idea of voting by mail. 
An AP-NORC poll released last week found almost 40 percent of adults supported holding elections exclusively by mail — an approximate doubling of the popularity of that opinion since 2018. 
In the same poll, an outright majority — 56 percent — said people should be allowed to vote by mail without having to provide a specific reason for doing so. 
Five states currently hold elections entirely by mail, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Several other states permit some elections to be conducted by mail or allow individual counties to decide to hold mail-in elections if they wish.
Trump has been notably skeptical of the idea, asserting at one point simply that “mail ballots, they cheat. ... Mail ballots are very dangerous for this country because of cheaters.” Trump himself, however, voted by mail earlier this year, casting an absentee ballot in Florida.
There are some concerns across the partisan divide that mail-in voting may carry a higher potential for fraud than in-person voting. 
But the states that have adopted it have not incurred wide-scale problems, and the coronavirus crisis could see its acceptability reach critical mass.
Immigration
President Trump announced on Twitter on April 20 that he would move to “temporarily suspend immigration into the United States” in response to the crisis.
He subsequently issued an executive order, but it was not quite so sweeping. It paused green cards from being issued for at least 60 days, but it included a number of exceptions. It did not, for example, affect green card applicants who are already in the United States.
Immigrant advocates blasted the move nonetheless, accusing the president of using the crisis to pursue the kind of hard line on the issue that he has long favored.
Some opinion polls, however, suggest many Americans share Trump’s views — at least for now.
A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted from April 21 to April 26 found 65 percent of adults backing the idea of temporarily blocking “nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak.”
Republicans in that poll supported such a pause overwhelmingly, 83 percent to 17 percent. But Democrats, usually seen as more pro-immigration, were split evenly: 49 percent supporting and 49 percent opposing.
Immigrant groups argue that such results could be a temporary blip in the midst of a crisis and should not distract from the fact that most Americans think immigration is a net benefit to the nation.
But the nature of the crisis — a threat that began in China and went on to cause havoc across the globe — could yet affect views not just of immigration but also of freedom of movement and globalization more generally.
The social safety net
Could the coronavirus crisis — and the sheer scale of the economic devastation it has wreaked — also lead to a reappraisal of the need for a stronger social safety net in general?
The fact that the nation is experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime shock suggests to some people that sizable changes could be made. 
Businessman Andrew Yang held out the idea of a universal basic income during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In April, Yang tweeted that Spain was adopting universal basic income in response to the coronavirus and that “the US should follow suit.” A Washington Post headline around the same time asserted that “the pandemic strengthens the case for universal basic income.”
Others have asserted that the crisis reinforces the need for paid sick leave — a call that Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made at a March news conference. 
There are also new questions about unemployment benefits and whether some states lack the infrastructure to get such assistance promptly to those who need it.
But many experts are skeptical that even such a major crisis will fundamentally alter how most Americans view the social compact.
Joshua Clinton, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, recently told CNBC, “There might be a slight shift, but I don’t think that you’ll see a grand shift in how people think about the structure of the state and the relationship of the state to their own lives.”
Political campaigning
One of the most obvious political impacts of the coronavirus has been on the nature of campaigning.
With mass rallies out of the question, candidates and campaigns have had to think about other ways to reach voters.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has been largely confined to video messages from his Delaware home and has struggled to remain as central to the national political discussion as might be the case in more normal times. President Trump has been accused by critics of using his press briefings on the crisis as a replacement for the rallies that he can no longer hold.
The Democratic National Convention has already been pushed back from its originally scheduled date in mid-July to a month later. Trump has insisted the equivalent Republican event will go on as planned the following week.
It is clear that the crisis will have a profound effect on this year’s presidential campaign.
But it is harder to imagine other changes — such as a shift to virtual campaigning — sticking for good and becoming the norm in future election cycles.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 —  Malaysia’s economy in 2020 could shrink more than initially forecast due to extended curbs on movement imposed to stem an outbreak of the new coronavirus, the finance minister said on Saturday.
Malaysia’s central bank had forecast in April for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of between -2 per cen and 0.5 per cent this year.
“But that forecast was made after just two weeks of movement curbs. We’re now more than five weeks in ... so our GDP could shrink even more,” Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said in an interview with a local television channel. — Reuters

The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) says it has not approved any drug or vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19.
The Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said in a statement on Saturday that NAFDAC had not granted approval for any vaccine for the treatment and cure of COVID-19.
“To put the record straight, no drugs or vaccines have been given approval in the country for cure of COVID-19.
“While the medical researchers globally, the Federal Government of Nigeria and the World Health Organisation (WHO), are working tirelessly on the discovery of vaccines and drugs to cure COVID-19, the agency urges the public to desist from making unsubstantial claims.
“NAFDAC is the only authority in the country to grant approval to such drugs and vaccines,” Adeyeye said.
She said that NAFDAC would continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to safeguard the health of Nigerians and that in the event of any approved drug or vaccine for the cure of COVID-19, the agency would not hesitate to inform the public.
Adeyeye, however, advised Nigerians to comply strictly with measures issued by NCDC to prevent the spread of COVID-19, adding that these include the use of face-covering masks, social distancing, washing of hands and use of alcohol-based sanitisers.

Children as young as 9 broke into car dealerships in a North Carolina city on coronavirus lockdown and stole vehicles to go on joyrides, according to reports.
Winston-Salem police reported 46 thefts at 11 dealerships by 19 children, ages 9 to 16, in a month-long spree. Also targeted was an Enterprise rental facility.
CORONAVIRUS INFECTS NORTH CAROLINA WORKERS AT PICK-YOUR-OWN STRAWBERRIES FARM, FORCING CLOSURE
Many were going for joy rides, probably out of boredom from being out of school, police Lt. Amy Gauldin told the Winston-Salem Journal on Thursday. As in other states, North Carolina closed schools to contain the spread of coronavirus.
“Their success in the early stages certainly exacerbated the problem,” Capt. Steven Tollie said of the young thieves, according to the paper. “These other kids saw them with a new car, and they shared how they acquired it.”

Detectives charged one adult, 19-year-old Mekeal Binns, with possession of a stolen motor vehicle in connection with the thefts, the department said. It was unclear whether he had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.
All but six cars were recovered, according to officials.
The value of the vehicles was more than $1.1 million.
WFMY-TV reported that police took four children into custody Thursday but did not arrest three others.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Super Pixel Racers Review (Switch eShop)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mario Kart has taught us to expect a close-up, over-the-shoulder view of our arcade racers, but it didn't always used to be this way. Back in the NES days, the likes of R.C. Pro-Am and Super Off-Road offered a birds-eye view of the action.
It's this old-school racing spirit that developer 21c. Ducks seeks to evoke with Super Pixel Racers. Looking down on your pixellated rally car, like a drone covering the World Rally Championship, there's an instant warm and fuzzy retro feel to the action. While the cars you'll racing are all pretty grounded approximations of classic rally cars (Subarus and Mitsubishis, you know the drill), this is anything but a racing simulator. Your car auto-accelerates for one thing, while using a drift button to slide around corners will accrue boost for your nitro.
There's a unique feel to the handling model, too. A jab of the aforementioned drift button will send your car's back end out, prompting a long lazy turn. But if you're more aggressive with the button, you can gain traction and use it to carve into the turn and cut off the corner, almost like the motorbike handling in Mario Kart Wii.
The developer recommends that you use a control method whereby your car steers in whatever direction the left Joy-Con stick is pointing, but we found this difficult to get our heads around. Far better, to our mind, is the alternative 'Classic' method, whereby left and right on the stick will rotate your car anti-clockwise and clockwise respectively. It's the method top-down racers used to take, and it works a treat here.
The races you'll encounter during the game's single-player career mode, meanwhile, only occasionally incorporate twisting point-to-point races like real rallying, and rarely leave you alone completely via the odd time trial. Certain challenges even require you to actively ram into your opponent to secure take-downs, like some long-lost 16-bit Burnout prototype. We don't remember Tommi Mäkinen ever powering into the back of Carlos Sainz in such a way.
Other challenges see you using that drift button to rack up as large a score as possible. Then there are the meat and potato rallycross races, which gives you a full field of competitors to pip to the post across a mixture of dirt and tarmac surfaces. In between races you can head into the garage and spend your winnings on improving your ride. Here you must plough funds into four self-explanatory categories: Top Speed, Acceleration, Nitro and Durability. You don't need to worry about saving up to buy alternative cars though, as each unlocked racing class brings with it a single representative car to drive. These automobiles get ever faster, and whisking around the game's thirteen tracks at breakneck speed in one of the nippier classes is a real thrill.
Aside from the Career Mode and Free Race options, Super Pixel Racers supplies a fairly comprehensive multiplayer offering. There's an online mode, but this being a fairly modest indie game, you'll struggle to get a full field at the best of times. Far better to bring out Super Pixel Racers during your next local multiplayer meetup. The game's simple retro charms are perfectly suited to some casual couch competition, and it's well set up to support such a thing, with split-screen for up to four players in both docked and handheld modes. Besides regular races, you can also embark on a Battle Mode of sorts, which plops you into an arena and asks you to 'hunt' your fellow players with a well-timed nitro boost.
Special mention should go to Super Pixel Racers' presentation. There's nothing outrageous here from a technical perspective, but we're fans of the 16-bit pixel art style. Some might find the rudimentary animation a little too crude, but it takes us back to an earlier, more innocent time of arcade racing. The audio, too, is excellent, with the kind of driving synth soundtrack and high-pitched engine noises that speak to the classic era of top-down racers it's trying to emulate.
Of course, Super Pixel Racers isn't the first game to bring retro top-down racing kicks to Switch. Mantis Burn Racing arrived a couple of years ago, and offers a more generous, varied and more technically accomplished take on the sub-genre. Gotcha Racing 2nd took a slightly different route to success, successfully emulating the kind of casual multiplayer hijinks and hidden depths you used to find in the classic Micro Machines games.
If we're being frank, both of these top-down racers are flat out better, richer games than Super Pixel Racers. That said, you might just warm to the 16-bit charm of Super Pixel Racers a little more. Each offers enough of a distinctive experience in terms of handling that you'd be more than justified taking all three for a spin.
Super Pixel Racers offers a simplified brand of top-down arcade racing, with an intriguing handling model that's simultaneously casual and highly demanding. It might not be the richest, deepest or most rewarding game of its type on Switch, but it's a worthwhile experience for those looking for some solo and local multiplayer arcade kicks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweden's gamble on coronavirus herd immunity couldn't work in the US — and it may not work in Sweden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Business Insider

In Sweden, bars and restaurants are open to the public, you can go get a haircut, and primary school is in session.
The coronavirus has arrived, but life goes on.
The country has taken a lighter-than-most approach to social distancing for COVID-19, relying on people to monitor themselves for symptoms, stay home when ill, practice good handwashing, and avoid crowds.
You see very few masks on people's faces in current photos from Stockholm and other Swedish cities.

It's a strategy that hasn't been employed in neighboring Finland or Norway, and it's one that some Swedish parents (keeping their kids out of school) as well as doctors and scientists (writing open letters of protest to the government) do not agree with at all.
The ruling concept relies on a bedrock of trust between the government and its people, an expectation of willing obedience and a mindset of safety first, coupled with a desire to keep people healthy, both physically, and mentally. 
"What every country is trying to do is to keep people apart, using the measures we have and the traditions we have to implement those measures," the Swedish public health agency's chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, recently told Nature. "The citizen has the responsibility not to spread a disease."
If anyone can have success with such a low-enforcement disease-fighting strategy, it may be Sweden. A sparsely-populated country of people who generally agree to follow the rules is certainly a better candidate than most others for this public health experiment. 
But even in Sweden, the reality is that COVID-19 is a tough disease to corral, and the relaxed disease-fighting plan doesn't seem to be going as well as some officials there might've hoped.
Sweden is a country of willfully compliant citizens, home of a so-called "consensus culture." It's a place that's birthed some of the world's safest cars, and most inoffensive furniture. Nearly everyone pays their taxes without prodding, despite the record high rates.
"People trust the government," American archaeologist and Scandinavian art history professor Nancy Wicker, who's traveled frequently back and forth between Sweden and the US for nearly four decades, told Business Insider. "It's definitely part of the culture to follow the rules, or guidelines, and to not be too pushy about it."
The Swedish prerogative asks citizens to act like adults, and then trusts that, left to their own devices, people will. The Swedish even have a word for this, folkvett. It translates, roughly, to "good manners," but really means much more, expecting that Swedish people will act appropriately and do the right thing, without being told, or if not, face severe public shame and moral judgement.
In the US, the land of "liberty or death!" and vociferous coronavirus protests, where individualism and independence are prized above all else, it's hard to imagine the same we're-a-collective disease-fighting strategy working as well.

The Swedish coronavirus strategy is rooted in a practical, grown-up sense of being in this fight together, and for the long haul. 
"People want to get along, and not draw attention to themselves, which is really different than most Americans," Wicker said.
Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård once described the mindset at work here, Jantelagen, as "don't think you're special," and it applies to all Swedes (even movie stars and kings).
Indeed, Swedish King Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus said as much in a recent, rare national address.
"We must act responsibly and selflessly," he said. "Everyone in our country has this obligation. Each and every one of us. There is still a great deal of uncertainty. But one thing is certain: we will remember these times and look back on them. Did I think about other people? Or did I put myself first? We will have to live with the choices we make today, for a long time to come."

Sweden places a high importance on the rights of the child, stressing that children need time, space, and friends to play with, and that adults, similarly need go to work, not just to make ends meet and keep the economy chugging along, but to feel a part of the fabric of their society.
The Swedes are also seriously weighing concerns that have been taken as inevitable, if unfortunate, collateral damage in other countries, such as the mental health risks of being stuck inside, rising rates of abuse, and substance use disorders.
"It's good for people to be outdoors," Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde recently told Politico. "If you're locked inside there's risk of depression, domestic violence, alcohol abuse."

Other countries, including the UK and the Netherlands, originally toyed with the idea that a tight lockdown would lead to unrest, and that it would be more realistic to go for a looser approach, and to aim for herd immunity. 
Both were accused of heartlessness: sacrificing the old and vulnerable to avoid anger over pubs closing. They backpedaled, and issued lockdowns. But Sweden has persevered.
This doesn't mean that the country is simply comfortable throwing away its elders, or that anything you might've seen in a horror flick like Midsommar about old people jumping off cliffs to get rid of themselves, is rooted in reality or history. ("Definitely not, definitely not," Wicker said.)
Rather, the comparatively lax strategy is about trying to create a sustainable set up that Swedes will respect long-term, leaning on a culture of asking and not telling.
"The health agency in Sweden, we have to remember this, their job is not just simply to deal with contagious diseases, they are concerned with the health of the population as a whole," Swedish historian Lars Trägårdh told Business Insider. "Whereas in Norway, Finland, Denmark, the politicians have the last word."
Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister, Isabella Lovin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday "it's a great myth that Sweden hasn't really taken very serious steps" to limit the spread of the virus.
"Every country needs to take its own measures according to its traditions and its systems of governance," Lovin said, a nod to the fact that Sweden's public health agency runs independently, so politicians never get to make decisions about Swedish health.
"It's a real fear that if you have too harsh measures, then they can't be sustained over time, and you can get a counter-reaction, and people would not respect the voluntary recommendations that will need to be respected for a very long time."

Living in Sweden right now does not mean you can do whatever you want. People are advised to stay home when they feel sick, and then continue to isolate until they've been symptom-free for two days. And, for the most part, they do.
There are already promising signs that the ask-not-order strategy is working somewhat well in Sweden, as it has before. 
With universal healthcare, Sweden simply "offers" it's children shots, and upholds a 97% vaccination rate.
With the coronavirus, too, it seems, Swedes are taking their own health seriously, and trying to keep density at the nation's hospitals (where there aren't a lot of beds, anyway) low, while at the same time upping their own home hygiene.
"We have data showing that the flu epidemic and the winter norovirus dropped consistently this year, meaning that our social distancing and hand washing is working," Tegnell said.

Sweden's COVID-19 game plan is not without it's issues, though. It's proving tough to control a raging new virus that is highly contagious, sometimes tricky to spot, and for which there is no population immunity.
Some Swedes have gotten quite sick. More than 2,650 have died. The country's COVID-19 death rate is 12.3%, roughly triple that of Sweden's Nordic neighbors, Finland and Norway. The Swedish case-fatality rate also surpasses some of the hardest-hit countries: Spain (11.5%), and the US (5.9%).
Swedish nursing homes, in a country which generally gets good marks for its elder care, have been especially hard-hit during this pandemic, accounting for more than half of the country's deaths, according to Tegnell. Arguably, some of those infections, and deaths, could have been easily prevented.
"Where I'm working we don't have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people," one Swedish home care worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, recently told the Guardian. "Everybody's concerned about it. We are all worried."
Furloughed airline employees are even being retrained to step in and work at the country's hospitals and nursing homes.
"We underestimated the issues at care homes," Tegnell said. "We should have controlled this more thoroughly."
Trägårdh said that the issue is made even more difficult because most elders in Sweden live at home, meaning nursing homes are reserved for the very oldest, and most fragile patients, already at greatest risk. 
"You only really get into these institutions if you are really old and unwell," he said. "There's been an underinvestment in elderly care, and that's a long-term problem." 
The economy has also taken a hit. The Swedish Public Employment Service said on April 20 that 8% of the country is now unemployed, a figure that's projected to continue to rise, possibly hitting 10% by this summer.
"This is not a strategy that has come without any impact on our economy, or on people's freedom," Lovin told the BBC. "We have more than 90,000 people who have been unemployed during these four or five weeks."
The Public Health Agency of Sweden is now cautiously applauding its approach, suggesting the worst of the virus' infectious spread may have already occured in the country's densest, most populous city.
So far, laboratories have counted 8,200 COVID-19 infections in Stockholm, an infection rate of less than 1%.
But because Swedish health authorities suspect there are approximately 75 unconfirmed COVID-19 cases for each lab-confirmed case, they predict, using mathematical models, that 26% of people, or about 1 in 4 living in Stockholm county, "has or will have had COVID-19" by May, and that, as such, they are not as susceptible to the disease.
That's still quite a way away from any kind of herd immunity, when enough people are immune to a disease that it cannot make in-roads in the community.
Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images
"It's going to take 60% to 70% of the population to be infected and develop immunity, or be vaccinated to slow down transmission in any meaningful way," Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told Business Insider.
Trägårdh said that while herd immunity is not "an explicit policy goal" for Sweden, "you know, it's there in the mix."
However, the World Health Organization warns that there's "not enough evidence" yet to guarantee people who get COVID-19 will be immune from re-infection, stressing that "no study" has yet evaluated the question.
"We expect people that are infected with COVID-19 to develop a response that has some level of protection," the WHO's head of emerging diseases Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters at a press conference on Monday. "What we don't know right now is how strong that protection is, and if that's seen in everybody that is infected, and for how long that lasts."
With spring temperatures warming, and the sun shining for more than 15 hours every day in the Swedish capital, there are worrisome signs that go against the government's rosy projections. Independent estimates show that infection rates are still on the rise, not the decline. It may be time for some more draconian stay-at-home measures right now, even in Sweden, a move officials there say they may consider.
After all, other countries with stricter lockdowns are successfully preventing hundreds of thousands of infections.

While Sweden may provide some inspiration for how to reopen other places with diligence and calm, the country's high death count shows that it isn't a perfect coronavirus-fighting model, especially for other countries where fewer people live on their own, citizens are less-than-obedient, and far more crowded public spaces make it difficult to consistently keep a safe distance from others.
"We've got to dance with the virus," George Fu Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said during a National Academy of Sciences conference last weekend.
"We have to come back, resume the business, resume the social activities."
In order to be successful at this novel kind of dance, countries need to continue to protect their people from infection, largely by keeping them apart from the sick, until there's either a treatment, a vaccine, or ideally, both. Complicating matters further, if this coronavirus proves to be anything like the influenza pandemics we've seen in the past, we can expect that it's going to hit hard again, in a devastating second wave of illnesses, perhaps as early as this fall.
"Can we stay locked up for 18 or 20 months?" Osterholm asked, pointing out that even that timeline is highly optimistic for a vaccine.
"We need to have some very painful population discussions about how do we try to get to what might one day be a vaccine, minimizing the number of cases, and particularly seriously ill cases, and those that die, compared to, you know, sustaining our society. I categorically reject the idea that it's money versus deaths, that's not what this is about." 
Sweden is already having some of those tough, society-wide discussions, but the US isn't, largely expecting that more widespread testing and tracing of cases will solve the problem on its own, even as armed protesters rush toward politicians in anger.
"People keep talking about testing their way back into everyday life," Osterholm said. "That is a part of it, but it's not the magic bullet people think."
Ultimately, he says the better question for countries like the US is whether they can achieve a new, well-thought-out, safer way to interact while out and about during the outbreak, with minimum harm, and maximum personal responsibility.
The idea sounds very Swedish, and not very American.

However, there is an opportunity here for other countries to take some inspiration from Sweden's gamble, while learning from some of the biggest mistakes thus far, by giving more forethought to how to protect some of the most vulnerable populations among us, as we venture back out into the open. 
"I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model," WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies Mike Ryan said during a press conference on Wednesday. "If we wish to get back to a society in which we don't have lockdowns, then society may need to adapt for a medium or potentially a longer period of time in which our physical and social relationships with each other will have to be modulated by the presence of the virus." 
How to emerge from lockdown, without letting cases explode?
There could be conversations about relaxing restrictions for younger people to get back to work and school first, or having sparsely populated areas open up for activities like manufacturing and construction, all the while monitoring those populations for outbreaks of new cases.
The important thing is to talk about all the ways re-opening could look, rather than seeing it as a binary: open, or closed?
"Do we try to bubble-protect the people who have highest risk of serious disease? This is a conversation we need to have right now, and we're not having it," Osterholm said.
"It's almost like we have a light switch, on and off. Either we've released society, or we haven't."

With spring temperatures warming, and the sun shining for more than 15 hours every day in the Swedish capital, there are worrisome signs that go against the government's rosy projections. Independent estimates show that infection rates are still on the rise, not the decline. It may be time for some more draconian stay-at-home measures right now, even in Sweden, a move officials there say they may consider. 
After all, other countries with stricter lockdowns are successfully preventing hundreds of thousands of infections. 
While Sweden may provide some inspiration for how to reopen other places with diligence and calm, the country's high death count shows that it isn't a perfect coronavirus-fighting model, especially for other countries where fewer people live on their own, citizens are less-than-obedient, and far more crowded public spaces make it difficult to consistently keep a safe distance from others. 
"We've got to dance with the virus," George Fu Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said during a National Academy of Sciences conference last weekend.
"We have to come back, resume the business, resume the social activities."
In order to be successful at this novel kind of dance, countries need to continue to protect their people from infection, largely by keeping them apart from the sick, until there's either a treatment, a vaccine, or ideally, both. Complicating matters further, if this coronavirus proves to be anything like the influenza pandemics we've seen in the past, we can expect that it's going to hit hard again, in a devastating second wave of illnesses, perhaps as early as this fall. 
"Can we stay locked up for 18 or 20 months?" Osterholm asked, pointing out that even that timeline is highly optimistic for a vaccine.
"We need to have some very painful population discussions about how do we try to get to what might one day be a vaccine, minimizing the number of cases, and particularly seriously ill cases, and those that die, compared to, you know, sustaining our society. I categorically reject the idea that it's money versus deaths, that's not what this is about." 
Sweden is already having some of those tough, society-wide discussions, but the US isn't, largely expecting that more widespread testing and tracing of cases will solve the problem on its own, even as armed protesters rush toward politicians in anger. 
"People keep talking about testing their way back into everyday life," Osterholm said. "That is a part of it, but it's not the magic bullet people think."
Ultimately, he says the better question for countries like the US is whether they can achieve a new, well-thought-out, safer way to interact while out and about during the outbreak, with minimum harm, and maximum personal responsibility.
The idea sounds very Swedish, and not very American.
However, there is an opportunity here for other countries to take some inspiration from Sweden's gamble, while learning from some of the biggest mistakes thus far, by giving more forethought to how to protect some of the most vulnerable populations among us, as we venture back out into the open. 
"I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model," WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies Mike Ryan said during a press conference on Wednesday. "If we wish to get back to a society in which we don't have lockdowns, then society may need to adapt for a medium or potentially a longer period of time in which our physical and social relationships with each other will have to be modulated by the presence of the virus." 
How to emerge from lockdown, without letting cases explode?
There could be conversations about relaxing restrictions for younger people to get back to work and school first, or having sparsely populated areas open up for activities like manufacturing and construction, all the while monitoring those populations for outbreaks of new cases.
The important thing is to talk about all the ways re-opening could look, rather than seeing it as a binary: open, or closed?
"Do we try to bubble-protect the people who have highest risk of serious disease? This is a conversation we need to have right now, and we're not having it," Osterholm said.
"It's almost like we have a light switch, on and off. Either we've released society, or we haven't."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweden’s gamble on coronavirus herd immunity couldn’t work in the US — and it may not work in Sweden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In Sweden, bars and restaurants are open to the public, you can go get a haircut, and primary school is in session.
The coronavirus has arrived, but life goes on.
The country has taken a lighter-than-most approach to social distancing for COVID-19, relying on people to monitor themselves for symptoms, stay home when ill, practice good handwashing, and avoid crowds.
You see very few masks on people’s faces in current photos from Stockholm and other Swedish cities.
It’s a strategy that hasn’t been employed in neighboring Finland or Norway, and it’s one that some Swedish parents (keeping their kids out of school) as well as doctors and scientists (writing open letters of protest to the government) do not agree with at all.
The ruling concept relies on a bedrock of trust between the government and its people, an expectation of willing obedience and a mindset of safety first, coupled with a desire to keep people healthy, both physically, and mentally.
“What every country is trying to do is to keep people apart, using the measures we have and the traditions we have to implement those measures,” the Swedish public health agency’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, recently told Nature. “The citizen has the responsibility not to spread a disease.”
If anyone can have success with such a low-enforcement disease-fighting strategy, it may be Sweden. A sparsely-populated country of people who generally agree to follow the rules is certainly a better candidate than most others for this public health experiment.
But even in Sweden, the reality is that COVID-19 is a tough disease to corral, and the relaxed disease-fighting plan doesn’t seem to be going as well as some officials there might’ve hoped.
Sweden is a country of willfully compliant citizens, home of a so-called “consensus culture.” It’s a place that’s birthed some of the world’s safest cars, and most inoffensive furniture. Nearly everyone pays their taxes without prodding, despite the record high rates.
“People trust the government,” American archaeologist and Scandinavian art history professor Nancy Wicker, who’s traveled frequently back and forth between Sweden and the US for nearly four decades, told Business Insider. “It’s definitely part of the culture to follow the rules, or guidelines, and to not be too pushy about it.”
The Swedish prerogative asks citizens to act like adults, and then trusts that, left to their own devices, people will. The Swedish even have a word for this, folkvett. It translates, roughly, to “good manners,” but really means much more, expecting that Swedish people will act appropriately and do the right thing, without being told, or if not, face severe public shame and moral judgement.
In the US, the land of “liberty or death!” and vociferous coronavirus protests, where individualism and independence are prized above all else, it’s hard to imagine the same we’re-a-collective disease-fighting strategy working as well.
The Swedish coronavirus strategy is rooted in a practical, grown-up sense of being in this fight together, and for the long haul.
“People want to get along, and not draw attention to themselves, which is really different than most Americans,” Wicker said.
Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård once described the mindset at work here, Jantelagen, as “don’t think you’re special,” and it applies to all Swedes (even movie stars and kings).
Indeed, Swedish King Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus said as much in a recent, rare national address.
“We must act responsibly and selflessly,” he said. “Everyone in our country has this obligation. Each and every one of us. There is still a great deal of uncertainty. But one thing is certain: we will remember these times and look back on them. Did I think about other people? Or did I put myself first? We will have to live with the choices we make today, for a long time to come.”
Sweden places a high importance on the rights of the child, stressing that children need time, space, and friends to play with, and that adults, similarly need go to work, not just to make ends meet and keep the economy chugging along, but to feel a part of the fabric of their society.
The Swedes are also seriously weighing concerns that have been taken as inevitable, if unfortunate, collateral damage in other countries, such as the mental health risks of being stuck inside, rising rates of abuse, and substance use disorders.
“It’s good for people to be outdoors,” Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde recently told Politico. “If you’re locked inside there’s risk of depression, domestic violence, alcohol abuse.”
Other countries, including the UK and the Netherlands, originally toyed with the idea that a tight lockdown would lead to unrest, and that it would be more realistic to go for a looser approach, and to aim for herd immunity.
Both were accused of heartlessness: sacrificing the old and vulnerable to avoid anger over pubs closing. They backpedaled, and issued lockdowns. But Sweden has persevered.
This doesn’t mean that the country is simply comfortable throwing away its elders, or that anything you might’ve seen in a horror flick like Midsommar about old people jumping off cliffs to get rid of themselves, is rooted in reality or history. (“Definitely not, definitely not,” Wicker said.)
Rather, the comparatively lax strategy is about trying to create a sustainable set up that Swedes will respect long-term, leaning on a culture of asking and not telling.
“The health agency in Sweden, we have to remember this, their job is not just simply to deal with contagious diseases, they are concerned with the health of the population as a whole,” Swedish historian Lars Trägårdh told Business Insider. “Whereas in Norway, Finland, Denmark, the politicians have the last word.”
Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, Isabella Lovin, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday “it’s a great myth that Sweden hasn’t really taken very serious steps” to limit the spread of the virus.
“Every country needs to take its own measures according to its traditions and its systems of governance,” Lovin said, a nod to the fact that Sweden’s public health agency runs independently, so politicians never get to make decisions about Swedish health.
“It’s a real fear that if you have too harsh measures, then they can’t be sustained over time, and you can get a counter-reaction, and people would not respect the voluntary recommendations that will need to be respected for a very long time.”
Living in Sweden right now does not mean you can do whatever you want. People are advised to stay home when they feel sick, and then continue to isolate until they’ve been symptom-free for two days. And, for the most part, they do.
There are already promising signs that the ask-not-order strategy is working somewhat well in Sweden, as it has before.
With universal healthcare, Sweden simply “offers” it’s children shots, and upholds a 97% vaccination rate.
With the coronavirus, too, it seems, Swedes are taking their own health seriously, and trying to keep density at the nation’s hospitals (where there aren’t a lot of beds, anyway) low, while at the same time upping their own home hygiene.
“We have data showing that the flu epidemic and the winter norovirus dropped consistently this year, meaning that our social distancing and hand washing is working,” Tegnell said.
Sweden’s COVID-19 game plan is not without it’s issues, though. It’s proving tough to control a raging new virus that is highly contagious, sometimes tricky to spot, and for which there is no population immunity.
Some Swedes have gotten quite sick. More than 2,650 have died. The country’s COVID-19 death rate is 12.3%, roughly triple that of Sweden’s Nordic neighbors, Finland and Norway. The Swedish case-fatality rate also surpasses some of the hardest-hit countries: Spain (11.5%), and the US (5.9%).
Swedish nursing homes, in a country which generally gets good marks for its elder care, have been especially hard-hit during this pandemic, accounting for more than half of the country’s deaths, according to Tegnell. Arguably, some of those infections, and deaths, could have been easily prevented.
“Where I’m working we don’t have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people,” one Swedish home care worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, recently told the Guardian. “Everybody’s concerned about it. We are all worried.”
Furloughed airline employees are even being retrained to step in and work at the country’s hospitals and nursing homes.
“We underestimated the issues at care homes,” Tegnell said. “We should have controlled this more thoroughly.”
Trägårdh said that the issue is made even more difficult because most elders in Sweden live at home, meaning nursing homes are reserved for the very oldest, and most fragile patients, already at greatest risk.
“You only really get into these institutions if you are really old and unwell,” he said. “There’s been an underinvestment in elderly care, and that’s a long-term problem.”
The economy has also taken a hit. The Swedish Public Employment Service said on April 20 that 8% of the country is now unemployed, a figure that’s projected to continue to rise, possibly hitting 10% by this summer.
“This is not a strategy that has come without any impact on our economy, or on people’s freedom,” Lovin told the BBC. “We have more than 90,000 people who have been unemployed during these four or five weeks.”
The Public Health Agency of Sweden is now cautiously applauding its approach, suggesting the worst of the virus’ infectious spread may have already occured in the country’s densest, most populous city.
So far, laboratories have counted 8,200 COVID-19 infections in Stockholm, an infection rate of less than 1%.
But because Swedish health authorities suspect there are approximately 75 unconfirmed COVID-19 cases for each lab-confirmed case, they predict, using mathematical models, that 26% of people, or about 1 in 4 living in Stockholm county, “has or will have had COVID-19” by May, and that, as such, they are not as susceptible to the disease.
That’s still quite a way away from any kind of herd immunity, when enough people are immune to a disease that it cannot make in-roads in the community.
“It’s going to take 60% to 70% of the population to be infected and develop immunity, or be vaccinated to slow down transmission in any meaningful way,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told Business Insider.
Trägårdh said that while herd immunity is not “an explicit policy goal” for Sweden, “you know, it’s there in the mix.”
However, the World Health Organization warns that there’s “not enough evidence” yet to guarantee people who get COVID-19 will be immune from re-infection, stressing that “no study” has yet evaluated the question.
“We expect people that are infected with COVID-19 to develop a response that has some level of protection,” the WHO’s head of emerging diseases Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters at a press conference on Monday. “What we don’t know right now is how strong that protection is, and if that’s seen in everybody that is infected, and for how long that lasts.”
With spring temperatures warming, and the sun shining for more than 15 hours every day in the Swedish capital, there are worrisome signs that go against the government’s rosy projections. Independent estimates show that infection rates are still on the rise, not the decline. It may be time for some more draconian stay-at-home measures right now, even in Sweden, a move officials there say they may consider.
After all, other countries with stricter lockdowns are successfully preventing hundreds of thousands of infections.
While Sweden may provide some inspiration for how to reopen other places with diligence and calm, the country’s high death count shows that it isn’t a perfect coronavirus-fighting model, especially for other countries where fewer people live on their own, citizens are less-than-obedient, and far more crowded public spaces make it difficult to consistently keep a safe distance from others.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three FC Koln players test positive for Covid-19 in Bundesliga, questions raised</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Covid-19 infection of three people at Bundesliga’s FC Koln has raised questions about the safety of a possible Bundesliga restart amid the coronaviruspandemic.
With the Bundesliga battling to convince the government that the season should restart in May, and with daily infection figures dropping, Koln announced the positive tests on Friday.
“Likely two players, one staffer infected,” wrote Karl Lauterbach, senior lawmaker with the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition, on Twitter on Saturday.
“The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with COVID-19 risks damages to lung, heart, and kidneys,” added Lauterbach, who is a professor of health economics and epidemiology.
“I am surprised that players are allowing this,” he said in reference to Koln’s training continuing with the rest of the squad instead of them all being quarantined as a precaution. “Football should be a model example and not ‘bread and games’,” he said.
Koln had said all three cases were symptom-free and the individuals were placed in a 14-day quarantine but the club did not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those concerned, nor did it say whether players were involved.
While Bundesliga clubs have returned to training in small groups in the past weeks after the league was suspended in mid-March, they must wait another week to find out about a possible restart to the season. The German government on Thursday delayed any decision over a league resumption amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The cash-strapped clubs and league had been hoping for the green light to end the two-month suspension so the league can contractually finish by June 30.
The German Football League has also submitted a health safety plan for games without spectators that foresees regular testing of players but no quarantine for entire squads in cases of positive tests.
Chancellor Merkel has said any decision on if and when sports could resume would be taken on May 6.
Germany has suffered over 6,500 deaths from coronavirus with some 162,00 people infected.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gilead Sciences exporting remdesivir, CEO says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington (AFP) - The head of the maker of remdesivir, an anti-viral shown to reduce recovery times in COVID-19 patients, said Sunday the company has been exporting the drug and is making it available to patients in the United States through the US government.
Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O'Day said the company is donating its entire existing supply of the drug -- 1.5 million vials, enough to treat 100,000 to 200,000 patients.
"We have been exporting for clinical trials and for compassionate use thousands of treatment courses," O'Day said on CBS's "Face the Nation."
"And our collaboration with the government has been such, we have been very transparent with them here in the United States and we have a good relationship on future allocation."
US regulators on Friday authorized the experimental drug for emergency use against COVID-19 after a major clinical trial showed it shortened the time to recovery in some coronavirus patients by a third.
It is the first medicine to show beneficial results in treating COVID-19 since the new coronavirus emerged in China late last year.
O'Day said the US government will determine how the drug is allocated in the United States based on where it is needed most.
"They will begin shipping tens of thousands of treatment courses out early this week and adjust that as the epidemic shifts and evolves in different parts and different cities here in the United States," he said.
O'Day said there will be a significantly greater supply of remdesivir in the second half of the year.
In the meantime, the company has not been barred from exporting the drug, he said.
"In terms of the allocation question, I think we're aligned with the US government to both serve the patients here in the United States, and then to be able to also make sure as a global company based in the United States that we can serve other countries," he said.
"We've had very good dialogues with the government and that's going well."
Remdesivir, which is administered by injection, was already available to some patients who enrolled in clinical trials, or who sought it out on a "compassionate use" basis.
The authorization by the federal Food and Drug Administration allows it to be distributed far more widely and used in both adults and children who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19.
The FDA defines severe as having low blood oxygen levels, requiring oxygen therapy, or being on a ventilator.

She took a regional flight on March 17 and 10 days later developed symptoms of the respiratory virus.
The woman, who RNZ agreed not to name, said it was nothing like she had ever felt before.
"My lungs started burning, I didn't get the normal flu symptoms, I had that a little bit later on, but it was just my lungs have never been affected in that way.
"The burning then started to become painful with coughing and it felt like a weight on my chest that every day that I had the virus and extra extra weight got put on there, it was just a little bit harder to breathe," she said.
On developing a fever she rang Healthline, but was refused testing because she had no contact with a confirmed case and the tracing team had not made contact to suggest otherwise.
"I tried again a second time and told them I'd been on a regional flight with international people and was refused."
She got so sick she contemplated going to the hospital, but instead looked through old media releases and found a flight from the March 17 listed as one which had a confirmed COVID-19 case on it.
The man had flown in from Barcelona before travelling regionally.
She found a story where the District Health Board's Medical Officer of Health said they would be contacting the close contacts from the international flight.
"I didn't actually pick up at the time, they will only contact trace the international flights.
"And they hadn't even bothered to ring up the regional flight members who he'd been in contact with the same day. And I thought that that was pretty poor."
At this stage it had been over two weeks since she was on the flight and still no contact from the Ministry of Health or tracing teams.
She was able to get tested after proving she was on a flight with a confirmed case.
The results came back negative, but she was told there were lots of false negatives, so she was considered a probable case of COVID-19.
The woman was asked to go back and get re-tested a week later, but when she did her symptoms were clearing up and she was denied.
During this time she was allowed into a medical centre, despite her protests as she was still showing COVID-19 symptoms.
The staff at the centre said the negative test result meant she could come in.
Four-and-a-half weeks after the regional flight where she came into contact with a man with COVID-19, the Ministry of Health's contact tracing team called her up.
"[They] advised me that I'd been in contact with a COVID sufferer on March 17.
"This was over a month later and advised me to go and get tested and ring the health line.
"I thought it was a bit late now.
"I rang up the health line dutifully, like I was told to and they said it's too late."
She said the whole situation "reeks of incompetence".
"I must admit, my reaction was to just laugh at the tracing officer, not in a nasty way, but I just laughed.
"I couldn't believe it, that's four-and-a-half weeks later, you've got to be kidding me."
The Ministry of Health said in a statement it was difficult to comment on the specific case.
"What we can say is our case definition for contact tracing people on an aircraft is those sitting within two seats in all directions.
"Other people on the flight would have been considered casual contacts," the statement said.
"We acknowledge that it would have been too late for her to be tested once the contact tracing team contacted her, the passenger would have been able to identify whether any of her close contacts had become unwell and they could have got tested."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Karnataka government on Sunday said Bengaluru urban and its four neighbouring districts would be treated as a single unit for inter-district movement of individuals and vehicles to undertake permitted activities during the extended period of the COVID-19 lockdown.
The Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar has issued an order to this effect, in continuation of that issued on Saturday, along with guidelines on lockdown measures which would come into effect from May 4 for the period of two weeks. Bengaluru Rural, Urban, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur and Kolar districts will be treated as a single unit for the purpose of movement between 7 am to 7 pm to carry out permitted activities with the production of a letter from the company they are working in and the official Identity Card, it said.

Hence, no other inter-district passes will be required to move across these districts, it added. However, for other districts, inter-district movement passes for permitted activities would be required and it would be issued by concerned either Deputy Commissioners of districts or DCPs in Commissionerates. No inter-district passes shall be issued for non-permitted activities except on one-time basis for stranded people.
For the movement of individuals during night time curfew timings between 7 pm to 7 am, passes already issued for all essential activities only, shall continue to be valid. "For IT, BT, industries etc., departmental secretaries will recommend issue of curfew passes to concerned DCPs in Commissionerates or Deputy Commissioners of the districts," the order said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Athletes stop play to contain Covid-19 in Lyari</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI  : More than 50 football clubs of Lyari, as well as members of the locality’s community centres, have joined hands with the district administration in the fight against the coronavirus and containing its spread in the old city neighbourhood.
The initiative came in the wake of Lyari residents continuing to flout lockdown instructions and paying little heed to officials’ requests to stay home.
Speaking with regards to this two-pronged strategy adopted by the district administration to curb the virus’ spread in Lyari, South deputy commissioner Irshad Ahmed Sodhar said that sportspersons would encourage youngsters to maintain social distancing and pandemic guidelines, while jamaat khana [community centre] members would convince the elders.
“We have adopted this multi-pronged strategy to keep people safe from the virus,” he added.
Besides, the district administration has set up over two dozen portable washing drums at different spots to help people understand the importance of maintaining hygiene.
In a meeting held in this regard on Saturday, representatives of the football clubs assured district administration officials of their complete support, also agreeing not to hold any night matches during Ramazan this year, as has been a tradition in the past.
“We want to play matches after the lockdown [is lifted],” Muhammad Ishaq – a footballer from Lyari who, along with his teammates, has been actively trying to convince people to stay home through video messages – told The Express Tribune. “We need to be healthy to play football. If we are ailing, we wouldn’t be able to play well.”
Referring to his appeals of staying home, which were being circulated among the residents of Lyari, Ishaq said he wanted to convey similar messages to the residents of other areas as well.
Appreciating the initiative, Salman Khatri, a resident of Agra Taj Colony, noted that local sportspersons were also involved in community awareness drives being conducted in the neighbourhood.
Emphasising the importance of involving the local community in stemming the virus spread, Khatri opined that the government should have taken the step earlier. “Without the involvement of people from the local community, Lyari’s people won’t pay much heed to the government’s requests and instructions,” he elaborated. “The locals will better be able to convince people [to observe precautions, as] otherwise it is tricky to deal with [the resident of] Lyari. Here, people listen only to their own people, not the government.”
Khatri advised that not just footballers, but other sportspersons, such as cyclists, boxers and cricketers, also be made a part of the fight against the coronavirus.
The sharp spread of the contagion in the locality has, by and large, done little to move the people of Lyari towards being more mindful of precautionary measures. Rather, they complain that patrolling by law enforcement personnel has increased in the area and that they are being forced to stay inside. The residents also complain of shops being forcible closed.
“Fear prevails in the neighbourhood but people continue to stay outdoors, which is dangerous for everyone,” lamented Khatri.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA grants emergency approval to Swiss firm's coronavirus antibody test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for an antibody coronavirus test developed by Roche Holding AG, the Swiss healthcare company said in a statement Sunday.
The tests are used to determine whether a person has been infected with the novel coronavirus and developed antibodies against it. State and federal officials have touted the tests as a way to help guide decisions about how to safely reopen parts of the U.S.  
Roche Holding AG said that its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, had a 99.8 percent specificity rate and a sensitivity rate of 100 percent based on a sampling of 5,272 people. 
The company said that it would begin ramping up production of the tests to the "high double-digit millions per month" to serve countries accepting them. The firm has already started shipping the tests to some laboratories. 
“Thanks to the enormous efforts of our dedicated colleagues we are now able to deliver a high-quality antibody test in high quantities, so we can support healthcare systems around the world with an important tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis,” Roche Group CEO Severin Schwan said in a statement.
”I am in particular pleased about the high specificity and sensitivity of our test, which is crucial to support health care systems around the world with a reliable tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis.”
Multiple companies, including US-based Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Co, and Italy’s DiaSorin, have reportedly received emergency approval from the FDA for their antibody tests.
The rush to develop the tests, however, has produced fears about inaccurate results. The House Oversight and Reform Committee recently released a report that showed the FDA allowed numerous antibody tests on the market without review. The committee said it resulted in hundreds of flawed tests that are still available on the market, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about whether someone has immunity to COVID-19. 
Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, told The Hill last week that he wants the agency to clear the market of any unauthorized test. 
In its news release, Roche said that its sampling showed no cross-reactivity to the four human coronaviruses causing a common cold, reducing the chance of false positives. The company previously said that its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies, Reuters reported.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A coronavirus antibody test that is more than 99% accurate is now cleared for emergency use in the US, easing concerns of false positives that hindered earlier tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US regulators authorized Sunday emergency use of a coronavirus antibody test that is more than 99% accurate, addressing concerns about high false positive rates that have plagued some of the first tests.
The test is made by Roche, a Swiss giant in the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries. Roche said Sunday it will boost its manufacturing to produce "high double-digit millions per month" of the test.
Antibodies are proteins created by the body's immune system to fight invading threats, like viruses or bacteria. Antibody testing is seen by many as a critical step into reopening the economy. Some have floated ideas of using the tests to issue some form of "immunity passports," which could allow people with the antibodies to return to work. 
Roche stated the test has a 100% sensitivity rating and a 99.8% specificity rating, which are significantly higher than some of the first antibody tests that were cleared for use in the US. The results came from using more than 5,000 samples on its test.
It will take about 18 minutes to process a single test, with Roche's devices able to run up to 300 tests per hour in an automated fashion, the company said. 
One recent study found several of these tests are less than 90% accurate. Combined with Roche's ability to mass-manufacture millions of tests, this new test should help address the issue of false positive results, where a test may tell someone they have the antibodies when they actually do not.
Another medical diagnostics giant, Abbott, has been using its antibody test for the past few weeks in the US. Abbot says its test is 99% accurate, based on testing about 1,000 samples.

Even if fully accurate, antibody testing still faces several critical unknowns that may limit the usefulness of these tests.
First, it is not yet known for sure that having antibodies equals protection. For most viruses, having antibodies means being protected from future infections. But studies have yet to be done on the novel coronavirus proving this to be the case, and there have been some reports of potential reinfection.
Even if antibodies give a degree of protection from the virus, researchers do not know how long that protection will last. This could be another critical limitation if antibody protection lasts for months instead of years. 
Finally, it is still unknown what percentage of the US or world population has already been infected with the coronavirus. Reliable and widespread antibody testing can help answer this question.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MHA orders ‘second line of defence’ for police as Covid-19 cases rise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Sunday asked chief secretaries, director generals of police (DGPs) of all states and heads of central paramilitary forces to “prepare a second line of defence” in police to make up for those who may be rendered ineffective due to Covid-19.
In an order, the ministry told the states/union territories that they can use the services of home guards, civil defence, NCC cadets, Scouts and Guides and Students Police Cadets in the areas where there are not imminent law and order duties.
The order came after many central police forces have reported Covid-19 cases. The CRPF has been the worst hit with more than 100 of its troopers testing positive in Delhi which forced it to seal its headquarters on Sunday.

The police chiefs have also been asked to consider the option of work from home for personnel not deployed on frontline and where feasible.
“To meet the challenge of Covid-19, and to ensure sustainment of control strategy for Covid-19, police forces need to prepare an effective second line of defence to make up for the police personnel who may be rendered ineffective due to Covid-19 infection during the pandemic,” stated the order reviewed by HT.
The government has suggested that the home guards, NCC etc can especially be of help in maintaining order at the relief centres and in facilitating the maintenance of supply chain and for coordinating other essential services.
The police have also been asked to help the general public and deal with them with empathy and compassion especially the weaker sections of the society. The cops have been asked to also monitor religious and social congregations during festivals to ensure social distancing.
“Police should also be watchful of migrant labourers/slums to contain any unexpected and undesirable mass movement,” it stated.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the introduction to our Half-Life: Alyx review, Dustin observed that the game was “shouldering the hopes of the virtual reality industry.” The first post-Alyx Steam Hardware Survey results are in, and it appears as though Alyx has come through: by one estimate, a whopping 950,000 new headsets were connected to Steam in the month after Alyx launched.
As Road to VR points out, that’s the biggest single-month increase ever, more than triple the previous record set over the December-January holiday season. April’s Steam Hardware Survey shows 1.91% of Steam users had a VR headset of some kind connected to their PC – making VR twice as popular on Steam as Linux with about half the number of users who are on MacOS.
It’s worth noting that Steam’s reported numbers in the hardware survey are a bit fuzzy. First, the survey reports ‘monthly connected headsets,’ which only means that a headset was connected while a user was logged into Steam – it doesn’t say whether the headset was actually used. Second, the numbers are reported as a share of Steam’s overall user population rather than in raw totals, so we don’t have a firm figure on exactly how many Steam users own VR headsets.
Helpfully, Road to VR has an in-house algorithm that computes estimates based on available information, and they say the model suggests about 950,000 more monthly connected VR headsets in April over March, which makes for about 2.7 million headsets in the Steam ecosystem.
The survey also shows that Valve’s own share of the VR market has increased, making it the third biggest VR hardware manufacturer on Steam after Oculus and HTC just a year after the launch of the Valve Index.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Karnataka allows inter-district movement for permitted activities from 7 am to 7 pm</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bengaluru, May 03: The Karnataka government on Sunday said Bengaluru urban and its four neighbouring districts would be treated as a single unit for inter-district movement of individuals and vehicles to undertake permitted activities during the extended period of the COVID-19 lockdown.
The Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar has issued an order to this effect, in continuation of that issued on Saturday, along with guidelines on lockdown measures which would come into effect from May 4 for the period of two weeks.
Bengaluru Rural, Urban, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur and Kolar districts will be treated as a single unit for the purpose of movement between 7 am to 7 pm to carry out permitted activities with the production of letter from the company they are working in and the official Identity Card, it said.
Hence, no other inter-district passes will be required to move across these districts, it added.
However, for other districts, inter-district movement passes for permitted activities would be required and it would be issued by concerned either Deputy Commissioners of districts or DCPs in Commissionerates.
No inter-district passes shall be issued for non- permitted activities except on one-time basis for stranded people. For movement of individuals during night time curfew timings between 7 pm to 7 am, passes already issued for all essential activities only, shall continue to be valid.
"For IT, BT, industries etc., departmental secretaries will recommend issue of curfew passes to concerned DCPs in Commissionerates or Deputy Commissioners of the districts," the order said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche wins U.S. nod for COVID-19 antibody test, aims to boost output</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roche has won emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to determine whether people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20200503:nGNE71pdqt on Sunday.
Thomas Schinecker, Roche’s head of diagnostics, said the company aims to more than double production of tests from about 50 million a month to significantly more than 100 million a month by the end of the year.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests to learn who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to help end national lockdowns.
Basel-based Roche, which also makes molecular tests to identify active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test has a specificity rate exceeding 99.8% and sensitivity of 100%, meaning tests would show very few false positives and no false negatives.
A false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity. Roche said its test relies on intravenous blood draws, with higher accuracy than finger-prick tests.
“If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve … when you take blood from the vein,” Schinecker said.
“You have to have very, very high specificity. Even 0.1% or 0.2% makes a difference.”
RIVALS’ TESTS
Similar antibody tests have also been developed by companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Italy’s DiaSorin.
Abbott has said the specificity and sensitivity of its test are 99.5% and 100% respectively. Diasorin has said its Liason XL test has 97.4% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity.
As demand escalates for antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established testing competency have also joined the experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
Roche did not disclose a price for its test but said that it would be identical worldwide.
Schinecker foresees a high need for testing healthcare workers and their families for exposure, and those who showed signs and symptoms, to see if they have antibodies.
While antibodies typically confer some immunity, Schinecker acknowledged that much remains to be learned about the novel coronavirus before drawing definitive conclusions.
“Since this virus is not well known, one can hypothesize, but the proof will take longer,” he said. “Testing these people … is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity.” (Reporting by Aakriti Bhalla in Bengaluru and John Miller in Zurich; Editing by Himani Sarkar and David Goodman)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Heavy rains wreak havoc across Kenya - VIDEO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As heavy rains flowed into the month of May, floods have continued to spell disaster as they displaced hundreds from their homes and destroyed infrastructure such as road and bridges.
KISII
In Kisii County, massive landslides have hit part of the region leaving about 50 households displaced from their homes.
Magenche and Bosoti-Sengera Wards in Bomachoge Borabu and Bomachoge Chache constituencies have been greatly affected.
The landslides started on Friday and have continued to cause damage.
Kenyenya Deputy County Commissioner David Mbevi confirmed 31 families have been affected, though locals claim the number could be over 50.
“Some houses were covered by soil while others are uninhabitable because water is seeping from underground. Trees and crops in farms have also been destroyed,” said Mr Mbevi, adding that they have already submitted reports to necessary authorities.
“We are asking the government and well-wishers to intervene and offer humanitarian help,” said Zachariah Bichanga, one of those displaced.
Gladys Moguche said though no deaths have been reported in the area, the destruction caused by the landslides is massive.
“We were lucky that we were not in our homes when the landslide struck,” said Ms Moguche.
Mr Joel Omagwa, former Bomachoge Borabu Constituency Development Fund Chairman, said more households in the area may be affected if the heavy rains continue.
“There is a big fault line here. Authorities need to take action to avoid deaths,” said Mr Omagwa.
BUSIA
In Busia County, two deaths have been reported after River Nzoia burst its banks and displaced over 40,000 people.
Hundreds others are marooned by the raging waters that have submerged villages in Budalangi Sub-county, spreading to neighbouring Alego Usonga in Siaya County.
A joint operation effort led by the Kenya Coast Guard Service and disaster management humanitarian organisations navigated the expansive area in a search and rescue mission for people trapped in their homes after flash floods hit the region on Friday night.
The bodies of a two-year-old girl and a boy who died at Busagwa area are yet to be retrieved while the situation has been made worse by the buildup of waters whose levels continue to rise by the day.
"We are only relying on one boat after other vessels were moved to Mageta Island to rescue people after a water bus capsized in Lake Victoria on Saturday evening," said Mr Thomas Mango of Busia Community Development (Bucodev).
Due to the shallow waters, the rescue boats could not access some areas.
"We are overwhelmed by calls from desperate people who have been trapped in their houses," said Mr Mango who is in charge of the operation.
The places affected include Bunyala Central, Khajula, Bunyala South, Bunyala West, Bunyala East and Bunyala North.
The flood victims are being are being evacuated to 15 designated rescue centres including primary schools in Bukhoma, Bunyofu, Bumadeya, Starlet Academy, Port Mixed, Bubango, Bulemia, Nandekere, Mundere, Namalo, Budalangi, Sifugwe, Bukhoma Secondary, Bunyala Cultural Centre and Mundere Campus.
Due to the government directive to avoid overcrowding at camps as a way of curbing the spread Covid-19, the locals are being encouraged to stay with their friends and relatives.
KILIFI
In Kilifi County, hundreds of families in Malindi and Magarini constituencies have lost their homes and property after River Sabaki broke its banks following heavy rains upstream.
Those affected are Miwani, Goshi, Kisiwani complex, Magongoloni, Bate, Langobaya, Chakama and Madunguni residents who have been forced to move to safe grounds while others went to their relatives' homes as the river continued to cause disaster since last Friday.
"We broke our houses and moved to our neighbourhood to set camp. Some items were swept away during the time we were moving to safe ground," he said.
Jacqueline Mweni, a Nyumba Kumi elder in Magongoloni, said residents are having sleepless nights over fears that the damage could be more severe and cause more disaster.
"The households affected are over 40 and we fear the numbers could rise," she said.
Those worst affected are the ones who had farms along the river as all the crops that were about to be harvested were washed away.
The Kenya Red Cross coordinator in Kilifi County, Cornel Ndombi, said they are currently conducting assessments in collaboration with the county and national government to assess damage and begin action on the areas affected.
TWO DEAD, TWO MISSING IN TURKANA
Two people have been confirmed dead and two others missing after they were swept away by flash floods along the Lodwar-Lokichoggio Highway in Turkana County.
Turkana West Sub-county Police Commander Suiyanka Cunningham said that the two who lost their lives were among eight occupants of a Toyota Hilux that was swept away at 6.30 pm on Saturday by Lomunyenakirienok River between Kakuma and Lokichoggio towns.
Mr Cunningham said that the eight, China Railway No. 5 Engineering Group Co. Ltd employees working on Kalobeyei River-Nadapal road, were heading back to their campsite in Lokichoggio town when the driver tried to cross the river.
"The vehicle was swept away by violent flash floods. Six managed to swim to safety while bodies of two others who had been reported missing were retrieved early Sunday morning," The police boss said.
He noted that despite a distress call from the six who had saved themselves, a team comprising of police officers, the Chinese construction company and Lotus Kenya Action for Development Organization could not access them due to other flooded rivers along the way.
In a separate incident, a Toyota Landcruiser Hardtop was also swept at around 6 am on Sunday.
The driver and his passenger who were heading to Kakwanyang from Lodwar are still missing and the vehicle not yet located.
Kawalase River has been flooded since yesterday with hundreds of motorists and villagers spending cold nights on both sides of the 100-metre wide seasonal river.
Turkana County Police Commander Samwel Ndanyi said that with support from local divers, they have launched an operation to retrieve the vehicle and trace the two.
Turkana West MP Daniel Epuyo said careless driving and poor judgement by some drivers was to blame for the deaths.
"You can't fight nature by misjudging the depth and speed of flash floods. Save your lives and that of your passengers by being patient until the water levels completely subside," Mr Epuyo said.
In Nakuru County, residents woke up to a collapsed road on Sunday morning. Read more here.
While in Meru and Kirinyaga Counties, families have been displaced by rains and a boy drowned in the swollen Thiba River.

Rare unity in US Congress on refusing Trump virus tests
In a rare joint message, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders on Saturday rejected the Trump administration's offer to conduct rapid coronavirus screening on senators who will return to Washington next week, stating that the tests should be reserved for the public.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, normally fierce political rivals, issued a statement announcing that Congress was "grateful" for the offer, but that they would "respectfully decline".
"Congress wants to keep directing resources to the front-line facilities where they can do the most good the most quickly," they said.
The United States' 100 senators, many of whom are advanced in age, will return to Washington on Monday following a recess that was prolonged due to the pandemic.
US President Donald Trump had tweeted that there "is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday".

'Second tragedy': Cremation traumatises in virus-hit Philippines
Families of coronavirus victims in the Philippines are being denied traditional death rites in favour of hurried, impersonal cremations, with virus restrictions often meaning they are forbidden a last look at their loved ones.
It is a painful and disorienting process for both the families and crematory workers that has upended the Philippines' intimate rituals of laying the dead to rest.
Burial is the norm in the Catholic-majority nation, and it usually follows a days-long display of the embalmed body at home or in a chapel.
But due to the pandemic authorities are encouraging rapid cremations - though quick burials are still allowed - of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 deaths.
Wakes are barred in these cases and hospitals must seal remains in plastic and send them directly to crematories or funeral homes.
Before the virus struck, families opting for cremation were able to have one last look at their loved one before the body was consigned to the flames.

'Keep going': Syrian refugees use war resilience to confront virus
It is not the first catastrophe they have faced.
But while today's global pandemic bears no resemblance to Syria's almost decade-long civil war, some refugees believe their experience of violence and exile helps them deal with the anxiety sparked by the novel coronavirus.
The minute France's stay-at-home orders began, Mohammad Hijazi said he thought back to what he had learnt from living through war and the dark days of his three-month detention by the Syrian regime.
Keeping a strict routine helps, said the 31-year-old filmmaker from Damascus, who was held because of his political views in 2012 - 2013.
Seeing war close-up does not make living through a pandemic any easier, as Yazan al-Homsy knows.
He survived more than a year under siege and bombing in the city of Homs and said the first week of the lockdown took him back to that terrifying time.
Before planes were grounded by the virus, the sound of them taking off and landing at Lyon airport near his new home began to trigger memories of fighter jets that pounded his native city.
In these troubled times, living in a democracy is also reassuring for Dunia Al Dahan from Damascus.
"There is a system, there is a state, and there are people who are expressing their views," the mother of two young children said.
Having lived in Paris since 2014, she values the freedom to be able to speak out, citing the example of a televised interview with a French doctor who lambasted the authorities over a lack of preparedness for a pandemic.
But she acknowledged that the death toll from Covid-19 had "frightened" her and made her reassess the devastating loss in her own country.

Virus efforts jeopardise vaccines for millions of MENA children: UN
The coronavirus pandemic could jeopardise vaccination campaigns in the Middle East and North Africa, Unicef warned on Sunday, saying millions of children could miss out on polio and measles immunisations.
The UN agency said most countries in the region were continuing with routine campaigns, under strict controls to prevent the spread of the virus.
But it warned that some vaccination campaigns had been suspended as health workers were diverted to fighting the Covid-19 illness.
"As a result, one in five children or 10 million children under the age of five risk missing their polio vaccination," it said in a statement.
"Nearly 4.5 million children under the age of 15 risk missing their measles vaccination."
Ted Chaiban, Unicef's regional director, said it was "absolutely critical that every child gets immunised against deadly diseases including polio, measles, diphtheria and hepatitis".
Unicef and the World Health Organisation warned in mid-April that around 117 million children worldwide risked contracting measles as dozens of countries curtailed vaccination programmes to battle the pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the United States is hoping that it has already reached the Peak of the Coronavirus and is looking forward to flattening the curve, a new study from Minnesota-based Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) has said that COVID-19 virus may well last 18 to 24 months.
The report titled “The future of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons learned from pandemic influenza”, warns the authorities and the states to plan for the worst-case scenario (which involves a large second peak of cases in the fall of 2020), including no vaccine availability or herd immunity.
The report urged government agencies and healthcare delivery organizations to develop strategies to ensure adequate protection for healthcare workers. This news has come at the time when more than a dozen states in the US eased their Coronavirus Lockdowns.
The United States already registered around 1.2 Million cases with more than 65,000 deaths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Swiss drug maker Roche Holding AG says it has received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies.
Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to “high double-digit millions” per month.
The Basel-based company, which also makes separate molecular tests to identify people with active Covid-19 infections, said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity rate of about 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%.
These rates help determine if a patient has been exposed to Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and if the patient has developed antibodies against it.
Other companies, including US-based Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Co, and Italy’s DiaSorin have also developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
DiaSorin and Abbott recently received US emergency authorisation for their tests.
Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand Covid-19, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity.
In developing its test, Roche scrutinised some existing products for reliability before rejecting them, its chief executive, Severin Schwan, had earlier said.
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result.
It declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies.
Roche has said its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the human body, suggesting possible immunity.
As demand escalates for blood antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established competency in medical testing have joined experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the US, according to a Reuters investigation.
The rush to obtain, advertise and find buyers for test kits follows the FDA’s decision to allow any company to sell antibody tests in the country without prior review by the agency.
This comes after the agency faced criticism that it did not act quickly enough with diagnostic tests.
FDA has said the aim of its policy is to provide laboratories and healthcare providers early access to the tests, but that it will adjust the approach as needed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">State homes keeping up with distance learning - CPFSA finding ways to cope with resource challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Western Bureau:
With the closure of schools since March 13 as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the island, state childcare facilities have found themselves in a tough spot trying to keep thousands of wards engaged in distance-learning efforts with a heavier strain on already meagre resources.
Rosalee Gage-Grey, CEO of the Child Protection and Family Services Agency (CPFSA), told The Sunday Gleaner that while some of the facilities have in-house schools, the majority of state wards are enrolled in public institutions. This has increased pressure on the resources, and creative ways are being found to avoid clashes and facilitate all students.
“It is challenging to have all the children home at once, but we are utilising the resources. We have to continue the homeschool,” said Gage-Grey, who added that the homes were following the Ministry of Education’s guidelines.
“From the reports we have had, the children are receiving their work from the respective schools, and the homes are facilitating that. We are really utilising the resources that the Ministry of Education has for the general population in the homes. We haven’t had any adverse reports in terms of people not coping with it and we are monitoring daily.”
Gage-Grey said that while all homes have essential equipment to facilitate remote learning, the ratio of children to equipment could be overwhelming. She said that the development of time-management schedules has so far helped ease the tension.
“We just did an assessment and we know that the homes have resources in terms of Internet access and computers. As you would expect, it is challenging having so many children at home at the same time, but we are working to make do with what we have so that they (children) can continue their education at home. It would call for a lot of scheduling for access to equipment to ease the challenge,” said Gage-Grey, who added that homes were dealt another blow as they have restricted access to the premises and so cannot benefit from the assistance usually given by volunteers.
“That (using volunteers) is difficult because we have stopped visitation and it’s just the persons employed to us are there. The ministry is asking for retired teachers and are utilising those resources. They have some outline platforms and are using TV … and our children are using some of those,” said Gage-Grey, adding that “they have teachers on staff in a lot of the facilities.”
Gage-Grey said that there are about 1,000 children in foster care, and that social workers had adopted a supervision strategy to ensure that they were still continuing their education.
“They are expected to flag us if there are any issues, but so far we have not had any adverse reports,” Gage-Grey said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche’s COVID-19 antibody test receives FDA Emergency Use Authorization and is available in markets accepting the CE mark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Basel, 03 May 2020 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)1 for its new Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. The test is designed to help determine if a patient has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and if the patient has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Roche has already started shipping the new antibody test to leading laboratories globally and will ramp up production capacity to high double-digit millions per month to serve healthcare systems in countries accepting the CE mark2 as well as the U.S."Thanks to the enormous efforts of our dedicated colleagues we are now able to deliver a high-quality antibody test in high quantities, so we can support healthcare systems around the world with an important tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis,” said Severin Schwan, CEO Roche Group. ”I am in particular pleased about the high specificity and sensitivity of our test, which is crucial to support health care systems around the world with a reliable tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis.”"Our best scientists have worked 24/7 over the last few weeks and months to develop a highly reliable antibody test to help fight this pandemic,” said Thomas Schinecker, CEO Roche Diagnostics. "Roche is committed to helping laboratories deliver fast, accurate, and reliable results to healthcare professionals and their patients.”Roche’s SARS-CoV2 antibody test, which has a specificity greater than 99.8% and 100% sensitivity3 (14 Days post-PCR confirmation), can help assess patients’ immune response to the virus. As more is understood about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the test may help to assess who has built up immunity to the virus.With extensive global manufacturing capabilities, Roche will be able to deliver high double-digit millions of tests per month. Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available around the world.For countries with specific regulatory requirements, local approval timelines apply. In addition there may be other country-specific regulations, such as import requirements, which will determine when the test becomes available locally. Roche will work closely with the respective regional representatives to ensure we appropriately support local registration efforts.About antibody testingAn antibody test, also called a serology test, is used to determine whether a person might have gained immunity against a pathogen or not. The human body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses. In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, antibody tests need to be able to specifically detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to other similar coronaviruses, which could generate a false positive result and thus wrongly indicate potential immunity. A false positive result happens when a person receives a positive test result, when they should have received a negative result. False positives are particularly critical when we do not know how many people in a given population have had COVID-19. As of 24 April 2020, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans4.About Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology testElecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is an immunoassay for the in-vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (including IgG) to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human serum and plasma. Through a blood sample, the test, which is based on an in-solution double-antigen sandwich format, can detect antibodies to the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, which could signal whether a person has already been infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Based on the measurement of a total of 5272 samples, the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has 99.81% specificity and shows no cross-reactivity to the four human coronaviruses causing common cold. This means it can lower the chance of false positives due to the detection of similar antibodies that may be present in an individual, but are specific for coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2. Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 detected antibodies with 100% sensitivity in samples taken 14 days after a PCR-confirmed infection. The importance of specificity and sensitivity of a particular test will be dependent on its purpose and disease prevalence within a given population.Hospitals and reference laboratories can run the test on Roche’s cobas e analysers, which are widely available around the world. These fully automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes for one single test, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.About RocheRoche is a global pioneer in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics focused on advancing science to improve people’s lives.

05:22 Swiss drugmaker Roche says it has been granted emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its coronavirus antibody test.  Such blood tests have been seen by governments and businesses as a potentially important tool in working out who has contracted the virus, and who may be immune, as countries move towards lifting lockdowns.

It requires an intravenous blood draw, and is designed to determine if a patient has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and if they have developed antibodies against it.

04:49 The coronavirus death toll in Japan has surpassed 500. According to official figures cited by local broadcaster NHK, the number of fatalities now stands at 530, with more than 15,000 confirmed cases.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to decide Monday whether to extend the nationwide state of emergency, which is set to expire on May 6.
While citizens are encouraged to stay home, and many shops and businesses are closed, Japan has resisted imposing the kind of strict lockdown measures seen in some other countries. People have still been allowed to go out to parks and beaches, as well as to crowded places such as games halls.
04:04 The Australian state of Victoria has seen its biggest jump in new cases in several weeks while the country's most populous state, New South Wales, is dealing with a cluster of infections at an old people's care facility.
Thirteen new cases have been registered in Victoria, health officials said, with six of the infections related to a meat processing facility in the state’s capital, Melbourne.
"What I'm worried about is the unknown unknowns," Victoria's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said, pleading for more people to get tested. She added: "We want to make sure that if we have cases that are positive in the community we can identify those individuals... this is how we are going to defeat the virus."
In New South Wales there were four new infections, two of which were reported at the Newmarch aged care facility in Sydney, where more than 60 people have contracted the novel virus, resulting in 14 deaths.
03:57 The number of confirmed cases in Germany has increased by 793 to 162,496, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases has revealed.
This represented a decrease of 152 on the previous day's amount of new infections as the number of daily cases in Germany continues to steadily decline.
The reported death toll rose by 74 bringing the total number of fatalities to 6,649.
02:49 China has reported two new cases in its daily COVID-19 update, up from one the day before, the country's national health authority has revealed.
One case was imported and the other was local, the National Health Commission (NHC) said. The NHC also reported 12 asymptomatic cases for May 2, down from 20 in the previous day's update.
China has recorded 82,877 cases in total since the outbreak first emerged in the city of Wuhan while the country's death toll currently stands at 4,633.
The Chinese government has taken a number of stringent measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including blocking almost all foreigners from entering the country and sharply curtailing the number of international flights.
02:08 German Health Minister Jens Spahn has raised ethical questions over the possibility of issuing so-called "immunity passports" to those who had already been infected with the novel coronavirus.
Spahn expressed his concerns in a letter to the Ethics Council in Germany, according to newspaper Bild am Sonntag. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politician said it is "a matter of concern to him that the ethical aspects" are met while there were still questions over "how and in what context the proof of an immunity should be used."
"Immunity passports" could be a way for key workers to get back to work as they will have developed the antibodies necessary to give them protection from the virus that has infected almost 3.5 million people worldwide.
However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently said it was yet to be convinced on the idea of any such certification being issued.
01:25 The United States has registered 1,435 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 66,364, significantly more any other country in the world.
The Johns Hopkins University has stated that more than 1.1 million infections have occurred in the country, having recorded its first case on January 20.
01:22 Doctors treating British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for coronavirus last month were prepared to announce his death after he was taken into intensive care, he told the Sun on Sunday newspaper.
"It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it," he said. "They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin'-type scenario."
"I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong."
The British PM first announced he had contracted the virus on March 27 but at the time was only displaying mild symptoms.
However, the following week it became apparent that his condition had deteriorated sufficiently for him to be admitted to hospital, where soon after he was moved to intensive care.
Johnson spent three days on "oxygen support," and admitted after his discharge on April 12 that his battle "could have gone either way."
The 55-year-old and his partner Carrie Symonds announced the arrival of their newborn son earlier this week and said the child would bear the names of "the two doctors that saved Boris' life," Symonds said.

01:17 Mexico's health ministry reported 1,349 new cases of the novel coronavirus on May 2, bringing the total number of infections in the country to over 22,000. The country also reported 89 more deaths, which brought the total death toll to over 2,000.
00:48 Panama has recorded 370 new cases, bringing its total to 7,090, and 197 deaths, the health ministry said. The ministry said the increase was partly because of ramping up testing.
In addition, Luis Sucre, Panama's health vice minister, said about a quarter of all tests performed had come back positive.
"This tells us that we're not meeting our required objectives for this phase," said Sucre.
00:02 The Eiffel Tower joined other famous landmarks around the world on Saturday in capping a sparkling tribute to those fighting against COVID-19. The initiative was first launched by the Empire State Building in New York last month.
At 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), the Paris monument lit up in "sparkling white" to hail "the unfailing courage of care workers confronting the coronavirus pandemic," said SETE, the firm that manages the Eiffel Tower.
The nine-day #HeroesShineBright initiative first began on April 24 in New York. Each night a different color is shone into the night sky to express gratitude towards healthcare staff, transit workers, and police or military personnel, SETE said.
Other landmarks that have seen similar acts are the Euromast in Rotterdam, the 360 Observation Deck in Chicago, the UAE'S Burj Khalifa, the CN Tower in Toronto, the Macao tower in China, the Busan Tower in South Korea, the Ostankino TV Tower in Russia, the Tallinn TV Tower in Estonia and the OVNI Tower in Slovakia.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pharmaceutical and diagnostic company Roche said Sunday that its coronavirus antibody test was granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, and that it can churn out over 100 million of the kits by the end of this year, as governments search for ways to safely reopen communities and let people go back to work.
An antibody test can detect whether a person has had the coronavirus, according to the Wall Street Journal, which experts hope will mean protection against the virus moving forward.
It’s unclear if⁠—or for how long⁠—antibodies can prevent repeated infections of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the virus is new and scientists are still learning about it, the WSJ reported.
Roche says its test is 100% accurate in detecting the presence of antibodies, and 99.8% effective in ruling out the presence of antibodies, which means very few false positive results.
Roche’s test relies on an intravenous blood draw as opposed to a finger prick, Reuters reported.
According to the WSJ, most commercially-available antibody tests aren’t accurate enough.
Roche has already begun shipping its test to labs around the world, CNBC reported.
“Testing these people….is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity,” Thomas Shinecker, Roche’s head of diagnostics, told Reuters. 
6,000. That’s how many blood samples Roche tested for antibodies, Shinecker told the WSJ. Roche was able to test a significantly higher number of samples compared to its rivals, the WSJ said.
Antibody testing is seen by governments around the world as one key to reopening economies, as the results can provide insight into the spread of coronavirus⁠—especially mild or asymptomatic cases, the WSJ reported. Some governments are looking into whether to issue “immunity passports” to people who have antibodies, which could let those individuals return to work sooner. There is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus (although antiviral remdesivir, also granted emergency FDA authorization over the weekend, appeared to shorten recovery time in a federal trial).

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng officials are continuing with operations as people return to the province as part of the seven-day travel grace period.
Since Friday, many residents have been streaming into the province to prepare to go back to work from on Monday.
Some South Africans could not travel under the nationwide lockdown regulations leaving many stuck in different parts of the country.
Government has now made provision for once-off movements across provinces to allow people to return to work and their homes.
Hundreds of commuters and motorists were screened by health officials on Saturday on the R59 in Vereeniging.
Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko said they were on Sunday conducting the operations on the N1 towards the Free State province.
“There are also nurses on-site, checking their temperatures and if a person exceeds 38°C or 39°C, then they get taken to a private tent where they are further screened.”
One motorist from Cape Town said: “I think it’s appropriate to make sure that people are healthy before they get through.”
Mazibuko added: “I am happy, the officers have been very friendly to everyone, they’re talking to them nicely.”
One motorist has been arrested for the possession of alcohol.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche gets FDA emergency use nod for COVID-19 antibody test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Aakriti Bhalla and John Miller
(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG (S:ROG) received emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= on Sunday.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests, to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies.
Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to "high double-digit millions" per month.
The Basel-based company, which also makes separate molecular tests to identify people with active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity rate of about 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%.
These rates help determine if a patient has been exposed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and if the patient has developed antibodies against it.
Other companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories (N:ABT), Becton Dickinson and Co (N:BDX), Italy's DiaSorin (MI:DIAS) have also developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
Diasorin and Abbott recently got U.S. emergency authorization for their tests.
Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand COVID-19, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity.
In developing its test, Roche scrutinized some existing products for reliability before rejecting them, its chief executive, Severin Schwan, had earlier said.
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result.
It declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies.
Roche has said its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the human body, suggesting possible immunity.
As demand escalates for blood antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established competency in medical testing have joined experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
The rush to obtain, advertise and find buyers for test kits follows the FDA's decision to allow any company to sell antibody tests in the country without prior review by the agency.
This comes after the agency faced criticism that it did not act quickly enough with diagnostic tests.
FDA has said the aim of its policy is to provide laboratories and healthcare providers early access to the tests, but that it will adjust the approach as needed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veterans memorial in Kearney nearly finished</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KEARNEY, Neb. (AP) - A memorial honoring area veterans is moving toward completion at the Central Nebraska Veterans’ Home at Kearney.
“It’s been a long haul. It took longer than we estimated, but I think the end product is going to be worth the wait,” said Bob Harpst, chair of the Central Nebraska Veterans’ Memorial Committee.
All of the concrete service pillars, which are 16-feet-tall, and the 8-feet conflict pillars are up and the granite has been installed, according to the Kearney Hub. Plaques that describe each conflict should be completed this week and sent to the printers. Flagpoles have been ordered and the final dirt work will be done soon, making room for the remainder of the flat concrete work.
The memorial occupies more than one-third of an acre on the southeast corner of the vets home campus at 4510 E. 56th St.
“When you stand next to one of those big pillars you just go, ‘Wow.’ It’s big. Really big,” said Harpst. “The amount of concrete in the footings alone is amazing.”
Harpst is hopeful the project will be completed by fall. The memorial was designed by Kearney native Phil Cudaback, a San Diego architect.
In June 2019, ground was broke for the $2 million project. About $1.5 million of the fund will cover costs to erect the 173-foot by 103-foot memorial. The remaining $500,000 will be set aside in an endowment managed by the committee, which will be utilized for memorial repairs and upkeep.
The fundraising campaign started in September 2016.
The committee is within $50,000 of their goal, Harpst said. Fundraising efforts were suspended last year during the March and July floods, and again are suspended due to the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Distressed coronavirus frontline workers flood mental health hotline</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Battle-scarred healthcare workers are calling state volunteers at a rate of more than once every hour for help dealing with the devastating emotional toll of witnessing death en masse, The Post has learned. 
The state’s COVID-19 Emotional Support Helpline fielded 380 calls from healthcare workers pushed to the brink by the pandemic from April 15-28, according to the state Office of Mental Health. That’s an average of 29 per day.
The disturbing influx was revealed days after two city medical workers, Bronx EMT John Modello, 23, and New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital ER Dr. Lorna Breen, 49, committed suicide after weeks of working with coronavirus patients. 
Gov. Cuomo debuted the hotline March 25, warning New Yorkers not to “underestimate the emotional trauma that people are feeling, and the emotional health issues.” 
The free service is staffed by 6,000 volunteers.
From March 26-April 21, a total of 8,350 callers from across the state dialed into the 1-844-863-9314 hotline open to anyone dealing with a coronavirus-induced emotional issues. 
Callers include an anxious woman with trouble sleeping, a high schooler overwhelmed by virtual learning and a canceled graduation ceremony, and an uninsured woman who couldn’t afford counseling, said Office of Mental Health spokesman James Plastiras.
Realizing that “healthcare workers and first responders were clearly facing extraordinary and unique challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the state added the transfer-option for healthcare workers on April 15, Plastiras explained. 
In the wake of the deaths of Mondello on April 24 and Breen on April 26, Mayor de Blasio also announced a mental health program for healthcare workers that will involve “combat stress” counseling from military trauma experts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How an unproven drug became a bellwether for global stocks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As soon as Dr Anthony Fauci uttered the magic words, stock markets surged.
Sitting alongside Donald Trump in the Oval Office, the US government’s top infectious diseases official on Wednesday said a trial of the drug remdesivir had shown a “clear cut significant positive effect” in treating coronavirus. 
It was the first official confirmation that the antiviral treatment made by Californian drugmaker Gilead might be able to help patients recover more quickly from a disease that has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide. 
By the end of Wednesday, the S&P 500 had closed almost 2.7 per cent higher, while Gilead’s shares added roughly 6 per cent. 
The market moves underscored how data from trials of remdesivir have become a proxy for wider investor sentiment. As traders struggle to price assets while huge swaths of the global economy are shut down and unemployment is surging, they have homed in on the prospects for a treatment that might allow the world to reopen more quickly. 
In previous financial crises it would have been unthinkable for preliminary data from a single drug trial to result in a broad-based rise in stock prices. But at a time when investors have few barometers, the success or failure of one medicine has become a bellwether for the overall market.
“It’s wild to think that something like remdesivir could be a binary readout for the entire stock market,” said Brad Loncar, founder of Loncar Investments, which runs two biotech funds. 
The positive data from the remdesivir study run by the US government was accompanied by several caveats. Dr Fauci warned it was not a “knockout” trial and that the drug did not demonstrate a statistically significant impact on survival rates. Researchers say it is impossible to draw firm conclusions without first seeing the full results, which have yet to be published in a medical journal.
The choreography of Dr Fauci’s impromptu announcement this week — which was shoehorned into a scheduled event with the governor of Louisiana — was unusual. Headline results from drug trials tend to be released by the company making the medicine or the group conducting the study before full data is presented at a medical meeting and printed in a peer-reviewed publication. 
Dr Fauci said he had decided to unveil the preliminary results because he was concerned they would leak after the researchers conducting the trial were told they should move patients receiving a placebo on to Gilead’s drug. 
Concerns over the leaking of non-public information — and the potential for market manipulation — have plagued the pharma industry for years. Famously, Martha Stewart, the lifestyle guru, went to jail after being convicted of lying to investigators over the sale of shares in 2001 in ImClone, a biotech company, ahead of an unfavourable ruling by the US Food and Drug Administration. 
Dr Fauci’s announcement capped a frenzied fortnight during which markets gyrated as conflicting, unofficial information about the effectiveness of remdesivir leaked out in dribs and drabs. 
In mid-April, Stat News reported that patients were responding to the drug. The medical news website said it had obtained a copy of a video of a trial investigator at the University of Chicago — who was studying the medicine in just 125 people — saying most of her patients had been discharged. Even in the absence of detailed information or a confirmation from Gilead, the tiny snapshot of success prompted the drugmaker’s shares to rise by as much as 14 per cent while S&P 500 futures gained in after-hours trading. 
Just one week later, the World Health Organisation accidentally published a summary of the results of another trial from China, which showed patients taking the drug had not improved. On the day the Financial Times reported the results, the S&P 500 ended down having been up as much as 1.6 per cent while Gilead fell 4 per cent.
The link between broader stock prices and remdesivir data has raised concerns that investors are putting too much store in incomplete information that they do not fully understand, resulting in hype-fuelled bubbles that could burst and exacerbate market volatility. Even the most experienced biotech fund managers struggle to read complex clinical trial results at speed, and they often disagree on the magnitude of supposedly clear-cut data. 
“I pity the people . . . trying to do this based on their sketchy ability to read good information out of highly technical medical documents,” David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. 
It would not be the first time that generalist investors, known disparagingly as “biotech tourists” by specialist fund managers, have piled in to pharmaceutical stocks only to end up losing money. The sector also attracts a large number of retail traders, who are attracted by the binary nature of trial results that can result in sharp stock price movements: it is the investment equivalent of a gambler at a casino roulette wheel who puts all their chips on black or red. 
“There are moments like this where biotech is front and centre and people who don’t know what they’re doing throw money at the sector,” said Mr Loncar. “If history is any guide, those people often get burnt.” 
ExplainerCoronavirusRemdesivir: Five things to know about the antiviral drug
Gilead, which was chaired by Donald Rumsfeld between 1997 and 2001, when he was appointed as George Bush’s defence secretary, has always been something of a political stock. Even as it has churned out revolutionary treatments that can treat viral diseases and prevent HIV, it has generated negative attention from lawmakers for charging high prices and allegedly profiting from government-funded research. 
However, Geoffrey Porges, a biotech analyst at SVB Leerink, said the current level of scrutiny directed at Gilead is “unprecedented”. He has received a constant string of calls from fund managers trying to interpret the data, in part because they see the pharma sector as a hedge against the wider market: the theory is that the price of biotech stocks with potential drugs and vaccines could still go up even if other sectors decline. 
“The virus is wagging the market back and forth,” said Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton, which manages $580bn of assets. “I understand the move in Gilead. I just don't understand the move in the entire market.”
He added: “Everyone is trying to become an expert on the disease. But the truth is we're not experts on the medical side . . . and that has been part of the problem.”
However, while the release of a successful treatment or vaccine might indeed allow the economy to reopen, leading to an eventual recovery in broad stock prices, pharma companies do not necessarily stand to generate significant revenues from their products — at least, not for now. 
The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.
After years of negative publicity over the price of drugs, most drugmakers have pledged to give treatments and vaccines away for free or sell them at cost price while the crisis is at its most acute. Gilead, for instance, has said it will give away 1.5m doses of remdesivir until the end of May. Given the considerable cost of developing and making a medicine, that means the company will initially lose money on its remdesivir project. 
Just as the markets closed on Friday, President Trump announced that remdesivir had received emergency regulatory approval. The FDA confirmed the news — and issued guidance warning patients that little is known about the side effects of the drug. The stock, which had been down almost 5 per cent on concerns that Gilead will not profit from the drug, climbed in after hours trading, up 1.6 per cent.
Even if Gilead does commercialise the drug, Mr Loncar predicts peak annual revenues in the “low single-digit billions” — a “blockbuster” in pharma parlance, but not a particularly lucrative one. Compare that with the increase in the company’s market capitalisation since February, when investors were first excited by the potential of remdesivir: it has risen by about $25bn.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US authorises remdesivir as emergency treatment for Covid-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted authorisation to Gilead Sciences for emergency use of its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to treat patients with Covid-19, it said in a letter to Gilead.
During a meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating one million vials of the drug to help patients.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
The closely watched drug has moved financial markets in recent weeks, following the release of several studies that painted a mixed picture of its effectiveness.
Vice President Mike Pence said the one million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Businesses reopen in Georgia
Nearly every business in Georgia was free to reopen on Friday after being shut for weeks, in a move closely watched by the US government and other states to see if the lifting of restrictions triggers a spike in coronavirus deaths.
With about half of US states edging towards the partial lifting of shutdowns that had aimed to curb the pandemic, Georgia was trying to get back to business ahead of the others.
Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, decided against extending Georgia’s month-long shelter-in-place orders this week, enabling a full gamut of businesses to open. He approved the reopening of hair salons, gyms and other service businesses last Friday, followed by movie theatres and restaurants on Monday.
By contrast, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday all state schools including colleges would remain closed for the remainder of the academic year due to the pandemic. The coronavirus has hit New York especially hard, making it the world epicenter for the COVID-19 disease.
With stores shut, Americans are relying more heavily on home deliveries of everything from food to clothes and office equipment, giving online retailers like Amazon.com Inc a heavy workload.
Some workers at Amazon, Target Corp and Instacart Inc were staging protests and sick-outs in New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon and other states on Friday to demand a safer work environment and better pay during the outbreak.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to President Donald Trump, said on Thursday he was concerned about states and communities reopening ahead of a timeline recommended by the White House.
But Georgia’s rush to get back to work was applauded by Michael Bowers, 55, who co-owns Bowers Watch & Clock Repair in Atlanta’s tony Buckhead neighborhood.
“We need to reopen,” he said of the business his grandfather started in the 1940s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Approval Broadens Use of COVID-19 Drug Remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 US states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
US Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US approves use of anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat coronavirus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US regulators have approved the use of the first drug which appears to help coronavirus patients recover quicker.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the use of remdesivir, a drug previously used to treat ebola patients, after studies showed it shortened recovery time by 31 per cent, or around four days on average, for hospitalised Covid-19 patients.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average, compared to 15 days for the placebo group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
The drug is can now be administered to patients with severe conditions, such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies.
But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Cathy Burgess, an attorney specialising in FDA issues, said: “This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point.
“But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”
Pharmaceutical company Gilead Science, which produces remdesivir, said it will donate its currently available stock of the drug and ramp up production.
They said the US government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to parts of the country that need it most.
No drugs are currently FDA-approved for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication.
Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US regulators approve use of experimental drug to treat coronavirus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US REGULATORS HAVE approved emergency use of an experimental drug that appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster.
It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalised Covid-19 patients.
The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir’s effects could be rigorously evaluated.
President Donald Trump announced the FDA’s action at the White House.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that is not certain from the partial results revealed so far.
The National Institutes of Health’s Dr Anthony Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients like those in this study.
The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital.
The FDA said the intravenous drug would be specifically for hospitalised patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
Early days 
FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said “this was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved”, calling the drug “an important clinical advance”.
Dr Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.
“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Dr Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”
The FDA said preliminary results for federal researchers warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir”.
The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to doctors and patients, the FDA said.
The drug, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.
The FDA authorised the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies.
But during public health emergencies, the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental drug’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Gilead has said it would donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the US government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to places most in need of it.
No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specialising in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”

Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible Covid-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.
The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York/ Washington/ Minneapolis: Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral drug remdesivir was cleared by U.S. regulators for emergency use in Covid-19 patients, becoming the first medication backed by early clinical data to be made available to fight the novel coronavirus.
Remdesivir reduced the time it took hospitalized Covid-19 patients to recover in an interim analysis of an ongoing study.The Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency-use authorization, President Donald Trump said on Friday, a step by which the agency can allow products to be used without full data on their safety and efficacy.
Gilead shares closed down 4.8% on Friday at $79.95 in New York. The company has faced questions from investors about how it plans to make money on the drug, but its stock is still up 23% this year, at a time when the rest of the market has cratered.
“This was lighting speed in terms of getting something approved,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking with Trump. “From clinical trial to getting it authorized, it was 90 days.”
Emergency use is limited to hospitalized Covid-19 patients with low blood-oxygen levels or who need breathing support, the FDA said in a statement. A U.S.-led study released this week showed patients given remdesivir, which is administered by an intravenous infusion, recovered in 11 days, on average, while those who got a placebo recovered in 15 days.
Finding a reliable therapy is important for reopening the economy and ending social-distancing measures that have resulted in millions of lost jobs, closed schools and sent the financial markets through the most turbulent period since the 2008 financial crisis. Remdesivir could help curb the coronavirus, which has infected more than a million people in the U.S., and provide a bridge to an effective vaccine.
The FDA has also authorized two malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, for use against Covid-19, but those haven’t undergone rigorous research or shown an effect against the coronavirus.

Gilead is donating 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, its entire current supply, as it continues to seek full FDA approval and clearance from regulators around the world. That would cover 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.
Gilead didn’t comment on what it plans to charge for the medication once the 1.5 million doses have been exhausted.
“Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir,” Gilead said in a statement.
The medication will be produced by Gilead and the U.S. government will coordinate its distribution.
Patients who are hospitalized and in need of oxygen support account for about 14% of Covid-19 patients, according to early studies of the outbreak. Patients on a mechanical ventilator or heart-lung bypass machine should receive it for 10 days, while those who are less sick should get it for five days, the company said.
Gilead has quickly scaled up manufacturing of remdesivir, which it wasn’t producing in January, by working with multiple partners around the world. It plans to make 500,000 treatment courses by October and double that number by December.
The company is also building a consortium of chemical and pharmaceutical companies to help produce it.
Some investors have asked how, or if, Gilead will make money on the product. Analysts asked on an earnings conference call Thursday what its long-term plans were for the drug after it dispenses an early round of the treatment for free.
“There has been no other time like this in the history of the planet,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day said on the call. “There is no rule book out there, other than that we need to be thoughtful about how we can make sure we provide access of our medicines to patients around the globe and do that in a sustainable way for the company, for shareholders, and we acknowledge that.” –Bloomberg

    <h5 class="mb-1">US allows emergency use of remdesivir for Covid-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Science Inc’s antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 U.S. states, have been administering the drug.The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 dead, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and casualties at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Over 100 members of the South African Police Service have tested positive for the coronavirus
- One officer has also lost his life as the nation continues their battle with this unseen enemy
- To date, over 2917 officers have been tested for the virus with only a small portion testing positive
Over 100 police officials have tested positive for the coronavirus as South Africa continues to endure the pandemic andsubsequent lockdown.
Speaking during a presentation on Wednesday, April 29, Major General Leon Rabie confirmed the number of cases.
Rabie explained that 2917 police officers have been tested for Covid-19 and the results came back negative for 1795 officers while 103 tested positive. Over 1000 officials placed under quarantine.
Out of the 103 positive cases, 10 have since recovered and 89 were placed in isolation. Three officers required hospitalisation and one died.
Rabie explained that 45 police buildings have been evacuated while 39 were decontaminated and since reopened.

"The biggest threat, from a resource perspective, remains a reduced workforce, due to increasing levels of infections. In addition to preventative measures implemented, levels of infection and the impact on staffing levels are constantly being monitored," read Rabie's presentation.
The official says that reserve options have been explored, should the need arise to bolster the force.
"A reserve capability, currently performing non-critical functions, has been identified to be deployed to critical functions if and when the need arises. Measures are implemented to limit the exposure of personnel."
Personal protective equipment including masks, gloves and hand sanitiser has been procured to ensure the safety of employees, especially those in the field.
Legit.ng gathered that the police response to the crisis will cost the nation around R2.8 billion.
Meanwhile, Legit.ng earlier reported that an unnamed nurse and her mother allegedly tested positive for coronavirus after showing symptoms of Covid-19 in Imokun, Epe local government area of Lagos state.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: US FDA permits emergency use of drug for treating COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US coronavirus news: National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients
US regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of an experimental drug that appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight COVID-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide.
The Food and Drug Administration acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences's remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31 per cent, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir's effects could be rigorously evaluated.
President Donald Trump announced the FDA's action at the White House. Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that's not certain from the partial results revealed so far.
The National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients like those in this study. The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital.
Gilead has said it would donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA previously gave emergency use authorization to a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, after President Donald Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible treatment for COVID-19. No large high-quality studies have shown the drug to work for that, however, and it has significant safety concerns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Authorises Ebola Drug For Coronavirus Treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised emergency use of the Ebola drug remdesivir for treating the coronavirus.The authorisation means the anti-viral drug can now be used on people who are hospitalised with severe Covid-19.A recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten the recovery time for people who were seriously ill.However, it did not significantly improve survival rates.Experts have warned the drug - which was originally developed to treat Ebola, and is produced by Gilead pharmaceutical company in California - should not be seen as a "magic bullet" for coronavirus.The drug interferes with the virus's genome, disrupting its ability to replicate.During a meeting with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said the FDA authorisation was an important first step.The company would donate 1.5 million vials of the drug, he said.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn also said at the meeting: "It's the first authorised therapy for Covid-19, so we're really proud to be part of it."Emergency FDA authorisation is not the same as formal approval, which requires a higher level of review.What do we know about remdesivir?The drug did not cure Ebola, and Gilead says on its website: "Remdesivir is an experimental medicine that does not have established safety or efficacy for the treatment of any condition." Gilead also warns of possible serious side-effects.However, President Trump has been a vocal supporter of remdesivir as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.In its clinical trial, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11.The trials involved 1,063 people at hospitals around the world - including the US, France, Italy, the UK, China and South Korea. Some patients were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment.Dr Anthony Fauci who runs NIAID, said that remdesivir had "a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery".However, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - the trials did not give any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus.As much remains uncertain about the treatment regime, Gilead suggests a 10-day dosing duration for patients on ventilators and five days for patients who are not.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The pandemic has made the US healthcare crisis far more dire. We must fix the system</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to our current healthcare system, the waste, cruelty and dysfunction was glaringly obvious even before the horrific pandemic we are now experiencing. Today, as millions of Americans lose their jobs and their healthcare benefits that come with them, it is now virtually impossible for any rational person to defend a system – unique among wealthy countries – that ties healthcare to employment, and is designed only to make huge profits for the insurance industry and drug companies, while ignoring the needs of ordinary Americans.
Before the pandemic, 87 million people were uninsured or underinsured in our country, and more than 30,000 people died every year because they couldn’t get to a doctor when they needed to see one. More than half a million families declared bankruptcy each year because of medically related debt. One out of five Americans could not afford the outrageously priced prescription drugs their doctors prescribed to them. And our healthcare outcomes, from maternal deaths to life expectancy to infant mortality, lagged behind most other industrialized nations.
And for all of that, the United States still spends nearly $11,000 on healthcare for every adult and child – more than twice the average of other major countries.
That was before the pandemic. The situation is far more dire now.
Over just the last five weeks, more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs and now face a crisis unique among advanced countries: for most of them, their healthcare was tied to their jobs. In America, unlike any other major country, when you lose your job, you lose your healthcare. As a result, up to 35 million Americans are estimated to see their health coverage disappear in the middle of this Covid-19 nightmare. And premiums for those who retain their health insurance in this crisis could increase by up to 40% . As horror stories circulate of $34,000 coronavirus medical bills, the uninsured remain terrified of going bankrupt just to get tested and treated for Covid-19. In many cases, they just cannot afford to go to a doctor or the hospital.
But it’s not just the high cost and growing number of uninsured that expose the irrationality of the current system. It’s that the current “system” makes absolutely no sense to anyone. It is an incredibly byzantine and complicated collection of independent entities without a common purpose – except greed. Think about it: In the midst of the worst healthcare crisis in modern American history, with thousands of doctors and nurses and other medical personnel becoming infected and sometimes dying, hospitals and clinics have, for financial reasons, been forced to lay off thousands of medical workers at a time when they are needed most.
Further, our public health system is incredibly weak, in part because of consistent federal disinvestment and austerity that have decimated too many public health agencies. In most states, we lack the capability to significantly increase the level of coronavirus testing and contact tracing we need to begin to safely reopen the economy.
Price-gouging and profiteering has affected everything from hand sanitizer to respirator prices which, in some cases, have more than quintupled – virtually overnight. Cities, states and hospitals continue to fight over scarce gloves, gowns, masks and ventilators. Four out of five frontline nurses don’t have enough protective equipment. In the richest country in the history of the world, nurses caring for coronavirus patients have resorted to wearing trash bags as makeshift protective gear. That is an international embarrassment.
The current crisis has also exposed, to a horrific degree, how the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America magnifies healthcare inequities, and financially ravages our most vulnerable people. Rural hospitals and community health clinics, which often treat the poor, are on the verge of going bankrupt and shutting down. Major outbreaks are attacking our Black, Hispanic, Native American and undocumented communities, as well as the incarcerated and the homeless.
State and local data show that more than 30% of reported deaths have been African American, even though they only make up less than 15% of the population. The perverse irony of our broken for-profit healthcare system is that black, brown, rural and low-income people are most likely to be uninsured or underinsured, delaying or forgoing the costly necessary treatments or prescription drugs that could prevent the very conditions that make them most susceptible to the virus. It is no coincidence that the poor, the working class, the sick and the elderly disproportionately make up America’s 1m reported coronavirus infections and over 57,000 deaths – the largest figures of any country on Earth.
If there is any silver lining in this unprecedented moment that we find ourselves in, it is that we must use this time to reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future. With tens of thousands of Americans dying and millions losing their jobs, how sad it would be if we learned nothing from all that we have done wrong.
Do we really want to continue the current expensive and cruel system that ties healthcare to our jobs? Or do we need a simple, comprehensive and cost-effective system that understands that healthcare is a human right for all of our people – employed or unemployed, young or old, rich or poor?
Do we really want to continue being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry that charges us, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Or do we want a system that negotiates drug prices like every other country on Earth?
Do we really want to continue the complicated, wasteful and bureaucratic system in which virtually every visit to a doctor or hospital requires the filling out of endless forms in order to determine how much of our deductible we have paid, what percentage of our procedure is covered, and whether we got sick in the appropriate “network”? Or do we want a simple system in which we go to any doctor we choose and never see a bill, because the system is publicly funded?
Do we really want to continue having a woefully inadequate primary healthcare system because medical and nursing school graduates, faced with huge student debt, often gravitate to communities where they can make big bucks? Or do we want to make sure we have an appropriate number of medical personnel in the locations where they are most needed?
The good news is that a growing number of Americans – especially in the face of this pandemic – believe that this dysfunctional and wasteful healthcare system must be replaced. A poll conducted this month, for example, indicated that 69% of all Americans – including 68% of independents and 88% of Democrats – support providing Medicare to every American.
The bad news is that the healthcare industry, which made more than $100bn in profits last year and provides their CEOs with huge compensation packages, will do everything possible to maintain the status quo. And don’t be fooled: they will lobby just as hard against any lesser proposal as they will against Medicare for All, buying politicians with campaign contributions and spending endless amounts of money on lobbying and advertising.
There is no question that this will be an enormous challenge – but we can win this struggle if we engage people in the political process in a way we have never done before. We are all in this together. In this unprecedented moment in American history, let us stand united and harness the solidarity and compassion that so many are now demonstrating. Let us, finally, guarantee healthcare to all our people as a human right.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Several US hospitals using HCQ in treatment of coronavirus patients: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Several hospitals in the US are using antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 positive patients, a media report has said.
MDedge, a medical publication, on Friday reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently the first-line therapy and Tocilizumab the second-line medication for people hospitalized with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Yale New Haven Health System, which operates hospitals across Connecticut.
Coronavirus lockdown 3.0: Here's a list of what will remain open and closed across India
“Hydroxychloroquine is first-line at Yale because in-vitro data shows potent inhibition of the virus and possible clinical benefit, which is about as good as evidence gets at the moment,” Indian-American cardiologist Nihar Desai told the medical publication.
"It's cheap, it's been used for decades, and people are relatively comfortable with it," he added.

"We are trying to do the best we can. One hopes we never have to go through anything like this (coronavirus pandemic) again," Desai told MDedge.
His home institution, Yale New Haven Hospital, is almost half full with COVID-19 patients, at more than 400, the report said.
On US President Donald Trump's request, India allowed the export of 50 million HCQ tablets to treat COVID-19 patients in America, the worst-hit country by the pandemic.
On Friday, US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
HCQ was the first drug to receive EAU from FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
US President Donald Trump has been an advocate of use of HCQ, which has reportedly cured patients in New York and several other place.
Reports indicate that the malaria drug has been effective during the initial phases of a person being infected by coronavirus but poses a danger to those having heart ailments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Women, minorities shoulder front-line work during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As America tentatively emerges from weeks of lockdowns, it is becoming clear that the pandemic has taken its toll on workers who have been on the front lines all along.
They have been packing and delivering supplies, caring for the sick and elderly, and keeping streets and buildings clean.
They have also watched their co-workers fall ill. Thousands have gotten sick themselves. Many have died.
Read| Coronavirus Global updates, 2 May
The burden has been borne unevenly across gender, racial and socioeconomic lines, according to an Associated Press analysis of census data in the country’s 100 largest cities. They are mostly women, people of color and more likely to be immigrants.
Workers deemed “essential” are also more likely to live below the federal poverty line or hover just above it. They are more likely to have children at home, and many live with others who also have front-line jobs.
“What is important about this pandemic is that it has shined a spotlight on workers who have always been essential but before this were invisible,” said David Michaels, professor of environmental and occupational health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.
A look at these workers:
The warehouse worker
Born homeless in New York City, Courtenay Brown is no stranger to hardship.
She and her youngest sister both work at an Amazon Fresh warehouse in New Jersey and share an apartment in Newark with six cats and a turtle. The sisters fought for their stable life, at one point living in Brown’s car for weeks until they saved enough for a security deposit and first month’s rent.
When the pandemic took hold, Brown plunged into her job as a supervisor in the loading dock to get the $2 hourly pay bump and double overtime. Soon, several of her co-workers became infected. Others, she said, didn’t show up.
More than 60% of warehouse and delivery workers in most cities are people of color, a figure that rises to more than 95% in Newark.
One tough day, Brown pleaded with a co-worker to come back to work for a day. The next day, exhausted and limping because of tendinitis, Brown couldn’t bear to come in herself. Her phone rang repeatedly that morning. She threw it across the room.
“I thought, ‘this just isn’t worth it,’“ she said.
Jane St. Louis knows many of her customers after 27 years at a Safeway in Damascus, Maryland. Some have brought her cookies. Others have taken out their own fears of the virus on her, including one woman who yelled at her for not wearing gloves.
Grocery employees have been among the most visible of America’s front-line workers as people rush to stock up on essentials. Nationwide, they are among the more diverse of front-line workers, split evenly between men and women. In most cities, more than 40% are white, 15% are black and 14% are Hispanic. At least 16% live below the federal poverty line and 15% lack health insurance.
The virus has killed at least 30 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. Another 3,000 have either fallen ill or been quarantined for exposure, according to the union, which represents 900,000 people.
When St. Louis gets home, her routine takes about an hour and starts in the garage, where she removes her shoes and changes into a bathrobe. She sprays the shoes with Lysol. The clothes go in the washing machine, as does her bathrobe after her shower.
She doesn’t want to risk infecting her husband, a construction worker, and 15-year-old granddaughter, who lives with them.
“I didn’t know I had anxiety until this started,” St. Louis said.
Juan Giraldo and his wife nearly lost their home after he was laid off in the 2008 financial crisis. A refinancing deal saved him from foreclosure but left him tens of thousands of dollars deeper in debt.
Now he feels he is sinking back into a familiar nightmare. A contract port truck driver in Los Angeles, Giraldo has seen work dry up as imports slow. He gets fewer than four hauls a week, compared with at least 12 in normal times. He used to make up to $3,500 a month but now earns about $1,500.
More than 85% of warehouse and delivery workers in the Los Angeles area are people of color and 53% are foreign-born.
Giraldo was raised in Colombia by his grandparents after his father left the war-torn country to work in the fruit groves of California. Giraldo followed in his early 20s, grateful to his father for paving the way but determined to be the kind of parent he never had.
“I’m trying to change our history,” he said.
As a contract worker, the father of four gets no paid sick leave and relies on California’s state health insurance program.
“They are calling us heroes but it’s like they are sending us to World War II with wooden pistols,” Giraldo said.
Annette Brown’s job had been source of stability in a difficult life.
For six years, the single mother of two has worked the overnight shift cleaning the second floor of a hospital in Halethorpe, Maryland.
The outbreak has made her routine even tougher. She leaves her Baltimore apartment three hours before her shift starts and takes two buses to get to work. In the morning, she gets her 8-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son ready for remote schooling, cooks dinner and gets a few hours of sleep before starting over.
The unionized job offers her paid sick days, a yearly raise and health insurance _ a luxury in an industry where nearly 30% of workers lack it.
She just never banked on finding herself working in a pandemic battleground. The hospital now treats COVID-19 patients, and Brown is terrified of going to her $14.70-an-hour job that barely keeps her family above the poverty line.
“People are dropping like flies, and I don’t want it to happen to my family,” she said.
Janitors are the most financially vulnerable front-line workers. In most cities, more than a quarter live below the poverty line. More than 40% are foreign-born and 74% are people of color.
In Baltimore, nearly 75% of them are black. At least 90 members of Brown’s union, 32BJ SEIU, have died of the coronavirus. Another 20,000 have been laid off.
Brown’s son tells her not to be afraid, saying: “Fear is nothing but the devil.”
Linda Silva knew something was wrong when she started coughing on a Saturday in late March. The next day, the nurse’s assistant woke up with chest pain, a fever, a headache and a backache so bad it reminded her of labor pain. She tested positive for COVID-19 a week later.
“That was before we realized we actually had COVID cases in our nursing home,” said Silva, who works at the Queens Nassau Nursing Center and the Beacon Rehab and Nursing Center in New York. “We didn’t have the right personal protective equipment at first.”
About 75% of health care workers in most cities are women. They are among the front-line workers most likely to have access to health insurance, although 7% lack it. And more than 8% live below the federal poverty line.
In New York City, more than 76% of health care workers are people of color.
At least 54 nurses have died of the coronavirus, according to the American Nurses Association.
Silva returned to work after recovering. It’s been more than a month since she has hugged her two sons or her husband, who is a building fire safety director.
“We say we love each other daily and put our arms around our own selves in front of each other,” she said.
Desmond Hill is a music writer who plays the flugelhorn, but he makes his living as a New York City subway conductor.
His partner and five others he knows were among the more than 3,000 bus and subway workers who tested positive. Another 3,500, including Hill, were put on 14-day quarantine for exposure. Nearly 6,000 have returned to work.
At least 83 New York City transit workers have died of the virus, according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority.
In New York City, more than 45% of transit workers are black, 20% are white and 24% are Hispanic.
“Sometimes you’re looking out on a train and think, ‘who am I moving right now? I’m moving homeless people back and forth, why am I out here doing this?”’ said Hill, who is back at work.
Other times, he feels a sense of purpose.
“There are also days you can see essential workers, people going to work at grocery stores, Target, hospitals. Those people get off the train and thank you,” Hill said. “It’s a back-and-forth struggle.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus Roundup for April 25-May 1</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The items below are highlights from the newsletter, “Smart, useful, science stuff about COVID-19.” To receive newsletter issues daily in your inbox, sign-up here. Please consider a monthly contribution to support this newsletter. 
Forecasts can be frustratingly speculative and inaccurate, but journalist Lydia Denworth's concise sketch of "how the COVID-19 pandemic could end" is worth your time. It quickly reviews what worked in three past pandemics and outbreaks—1918-1919 H1N1 influenza, SARS, and 2009 H1N1 influenza. The piece reports that the COVID-19 pandemic’s outcomes will depend on a 50/50 mix of socio-political factors and science (possible antiviral drugs and other treatments, screens/tests for antibodies and immunity, and a vaccine). In Scientific American, 4/28/20.
A 4/28/20 story by Jennifer Couzin-Frankel at Science explores the latest thinking about how to treat “happy hypoxics,” COVID-19 patients with extremely low levels of oxygen in their blood (a condition called hypoxia) who nonetheless experience no shortness of breath. It’s possible that the excess clotting seen in many COVID-19 patients could be causing the hypoxia, say doctors quoted in the story. If you are thinking of purchasing a pulse oximeter to detect your blood-oxygen saturation at home, read the last story’s last two paragraphs, which describe the lack of consensus among physicians about the value of this approach.
Newsweek published a story on 4/27/20 by Fred Guterl, Naveed Jamali, and Tom O’Connor on the topic of how SARS-CoV-2 jumped from infecting animals to infecting humans. Yes, the virus originated in a wild animal population, and some researchers have ruled out a malicious release of a lab-created virus. But the new virus plausibly didn’t spread to humans from a market in China, the story states. Instead, the virus could have escaped accidentally (not been released intentionally) from a well-regarded infectious disease laboratory in Wuhan. This theory comes from a 3/27/20 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report, the magazine reports, but there is no evidence for the theory. Researchers at this lab do “gain-of-function” research—genetic engineering of new viruses to see if they could spread to humans. This type of research—funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development, so you know, us—is done in various countries these days as part of efforts to protect the public from virus strains that could evolve and cause outbreaks, not for weaponizing purposes, the story states.
Some weeks before more fingers pointed to the Wuhan infectious diseases lab, Scientific American published an excellent story, “How China’s ‘bat woman’ hunted down viruses from SARS to the new coronavirus,” about the lab’s director, Shi Zhengli. The story, by Beijing-based science journalist Jane Qiu, was updated 4/27/20 to “address rumors that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from Shi Zhengli's lab in China,” according to an editor’s note.
On the origins of the virus, Jane Qiu also recommends 4/29/20 coverage in The Economist, tweeting that their piece in goes into more depth on conspiracy theories. And the story is “in stark contrast to the depressingly bad reports on the topic that have turned some mainstream media into rumor mills,” she writes [registration required].
Andy Slavitt, former Medicare, Medicaid & Affordable Care Act head for President Obama, writes at Medium that widespread distribution of high-quality, medical-grade, reusable masks, such as the N-95 respirators used in hospitals, could defeat the new coronavirus outbreak, even in the absence of good treatments or an effective vaccine (4/25/20).
A state-by-state analysis by Harvard researchers and STAT reveals that most U.S. states are too far behind in daily testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections to be ready to “safely" relax lockdowns in the next week, reports Sharon Begley in a story for STAT (4/27/20). The good news is that 19 states, mostly in the U.S. South and West, reportedly are already doing enough daily testing, the analysis reportedly shows. Harder-hit states have to do more tests daily to get the data needed to determine when and how to safely re-open, the story states.
Some people in their 30s and 40s with COVID-19 are experiencing a type of strokes considered to be the deadliest (called large vessel occlusions), according to a 4/24/20 story by Ariana Eunjung Cha at The Washington Post. Some of the patients have no other chronic conditions or risk factors such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity, the story states.
In a 4/23/20 episode of Scientific American’s “Science Talk” podcast, Seattle-based science journalist W. Wayt Gibbs spoke with pathologists who are gaining insights from autopsies of people with COVID-19. The pathologists discuss what the disease does to the lungs and other tissues, whether patients actually had acute respiratory distress (ARDS) or not, and some surprising findings about what these patients actually die of. The full transcript is available too, so you have both audio and text-reading options.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Several US hospitals using hydroxychloroquine in treatment of COVID-19 patients: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The vaccine has reportedly cured patients in New York and several other places.
Washington: Several hospitals in the US are using the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as the first-line of therapy for COVID-19 positive patients, a medical publication has reported.
MDedge on Friday reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently the first-line therapy and Tocilizumab the second-line medication for people hospitalised with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Yale-New Haven Health System, which operates hospitals across Connecticut, one of the hotspots in the US.
Hydroxychloroquine is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs. US President Donald Trump has called hydroxychloroquine a "game-changer" drug in the fight against COVID-19.
At Trump's request, India last month allowed the export of 50 million HCQ tablets to treat COVID-19 patients in America, the worst-hit country by the pandemic.
"Hydroxychloroquine is first-line at Yale because in-vitro data shows potent inhibition of the virus and possible clinical benefit, which is about as good as evidence gets at the moment," Indian-American cardiologist Nihar Desai told the medical publication.
"It's cheap, it's been used for decades, and people are relatively comfortable with it," he added. "We are trying to do the best we can. One hopes we never have to go through anything like this (coronavirus pandemic) again," Desai told MDedge.
His home institution, Yale New Haven Hospital, is almost half full with COVID-19 patients, at more than 400, the report said.
On Friday, US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
HCQ was the first drug to receive EAU from FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The vaccine has reportedly cured patients in New York and several other places.
Reports indicate that the malaria drug has been effective during the initial phases of a person being infected by coronavirus but poses a danger to those having heart ailments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fertility treatment and coronavirus: ‘The Covid-19 baby boom jokes are hard to take’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“The rest of the country only now have the experience of living with life on hold – something I’ve been dealing with for nearly three years, as well as my grief for my lost babies. This lockdown will end for most soon. Not so for us,” says Elizabeth.
The emotional and psychological toll of undergoing fertility treatment is, she says, its own kind of “lockdown”.
In March, what Elizabeth describes as the “lonely and heartbreaking wait” for a baby was thrown into further uncertainty, when the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) recommended that “all fertility patients considering or planning treatment, even if they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for Covid-19 infection, should avoid becoming pregnant”.
Patients whose treatment was already under way were advised to defer. But no such advice was given to those who did not need assisted reproductive treatment (ART) to become pregnant.
In March, the European Centre for Disease Control advised that there is “no current evidence .. that infection with Covid-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus … no evidence of transmission of Covid-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy”.
This caused distress and confusion for those undergoing treatment. “I feel very discriminated against because there was no advice for ‘normal’ women not to get pregnant,” says Elizabeth.
Dr John Kennedy, medical director of the Sims Fertility Clinic in Dublin, says that the decision by Irish clinics to close was made in the national interest. “Nobody actually formally directed us to close. But of course it is impossible to practice fertility treatment and maintain social distancing.”
Fertility clinics were not originally classified as essential services. But “the longer this goes on, the more essential we become,” he says.
Last week, the ESHRE recommendations were updated to state that the pandemic is stabilising and “the return to normal daily life will also see the need to restart the provision of ART treatments”. The majority of Irish fertility clinics are planning to reopen from next week.
Even so, there remains a lot of uncertainty for the estimated 5,000-6,000 people who undergo fertility treatment in Ireland each year. Even before Elizabeth’s donor egg treatment was postponed, she had already experienced long delays – including the nine months it took from her initial consultation to embryo transfer, a cycle which sadly ended in miscarriage.
At 43, she is acutely conscious of time passing. “I haven’t had any updates from my clinic, just that they’ll be contacting everyone. I’m really hoping I can get started in June. Time goes by very slowly for women like me, and there can be many obstacles and delays.”
The jokes about “a Covid-19 baby boom are hard to take,” she says.
“It’s time-sensitive, especially for the patients in their 40s. It’s enough to make your mental wellbeing really poor,” says Dr Bart Kuczera of the Beacon Care Fertility Clinic, which will also reopen next week.
But while the clinic will be open, he warns that “you won’t be able to start on Tuesday and have all the services available on Wednesday”. Fertility cycles follow human reproductive cycles. “So it will take at least a month for everything to be back.”
For the clinics to reopen, major changes have had to be made in their operation, says Kennedy. “We’re completely changing how we work: longer days with less staff; there’s going to be social distancing where possible for staff and patients; there’s going to be appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) which we’re in the process of sourcing.”
Consultations will be virtual where possible, and some supportive drug treatments like immunotherapy and steroid treatment, won’t be immediately available. “All of the core things – egg collection, ICSI, pre-implantation genetic screening – will be proceeding as normal.”
The early advice from ESHRE, that candidates for fertility treatment should avoid becoming pregnant, has left some women with lingering worries about potential risks. “Every answer anybody gives has an asterisk beside it. We just don’t know for sure. We think there aren’t any impacts – unlike Sars and Mers, there doesn’t appear to be an increased risk. It all appears safe,” Kennedy says.
During recent virtual consultations, Kuczera noticed a sharp increase in the number of enquiries about egg freezing – suggesting that some women were worried about a risk of becoming pregnant now, but wanted to try to protect their chances in the future. “Half of the initial consultations were about egg freezing.”
Even when the Irish clinics are once again up and running, for those had been undergoing treatment abroad, there are likely to be further delays.
Miriam travelled to Prague in the final days before international flights stopped so that she could undergo egg retrieval. She is very grateful for the care she received and has no regrets about her choice to undergo IVF there. But, she says, “now we have no clue when we might get there to retrieve our embryos. It costs approximately €1,500 to have them shipped, and who knows the risks of that. I hope the governments of both countries recognise the trauma the ESHRE [recommendations have] caused to women like myself.”
The Irish Times recently published a letter from another woman, Sarah K, describing the impact of the closure of clinics on her. Sarah K says now: “Along with the universal uncertainty ... fertility patients have had to bear the added uncertainty as to whether this delay in treatment will affect their chance of becoming a parent. I’m 42 and started this journey over two years ago. I never ever thought I would be still here, in this horrendous, anxiety-filled holding pattern.”
As with everyone who spoke to The Irish Times, Sarah K is relieved at the updated ESHRE guidelines. Still, the waiting game goes on. “I’m still not sure as to when I will get to do my embryo transfer. I can only hope it is soon. Some might think it is only a few months’ delay, but for me every hour, day, month delay is an hour, a day and a month I won’t have with my much longed-for child, and my parents won’t have with their much sought after grandchild.”
Names of those undergoing fertility treatment have been withheld to protect their privacy

    <h5 class="mb-1">NAFDAC denies approving coronavirus vaccine, drugs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control on Friday said it was concerned about claims in the social media that the agency had approved drugs and vaccine for COVID-19, describing the claim as misleading.
The Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said in a statement that although a research was ongoing to find cure for COVID-19, there was no drug or vaccine for the virus yet.
She said, “NAFDAC is concerned about several reports and claims on social media and other media on drugs or vaccine to cure COVID-19.
“The Director-General of the Agency, Prof Adeyeye, hereby refutes such claims and reports from a section of the media to say that NAFDAC has not granted any approval to any product for use as a cure or vaccine against COVID-19. To put the record straight, no drugs or vaccines have been given approval in the country for cure of COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ralph, 92, is the write stuff during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 92-year-old RAF veteran from Telford has shown he is the write stuff during the coronavirus crisis by becoming a penpal for local families and youngsters in lockdown.
And when it is all over they are hoping to meet up.
For Ralph Neale, writing letters to penpals is nothing new. Since being stationed in Egypt during his service he has corresponded with people eager to hear from others and find out about their lives.
Now, as lockdown confines many to their homes, Ralph, who lives at Sanctuary Housing’s Hartshorne Court in Dawley, is once again forging new friendships through letter writing.
Scheme manager Vivienne Chalmers was approached by schools and families with children who wanted people to write to and so Ralph and a number of his fellow residents have been put in contact.
Ralph, who has lived at Hartshorne Court for four years, regularly writes to a few families and receives replies every two or three days. One reply from Antonia Johnston included a handmade rainbow which he displays in his window.
“It’s most interesting and great entertainment,” he said. “With the things they write I feel like I have to reply and discuss the subjects they want to talk about.”
Not surprisingly, his 25-year career in the RAF and subsequent stint as an engineer with British Leyland as well as a security guard at Asda, something he did until he was 79, are top of the list.
“They want to know about me and it’s interesting to find out about their lives too. There are plans in place for us all to meet up when this is over, although that could be a while yet.
“One family are dog lovers and I had Westies for 30 years so I can’t wait to meet them.”
While becoming a penpal has provided him with a way of keeping in touch with people, he is not short of things to do during the lockdown.
Ralph, who has six children and 18 grandchildren, said: “This is my way of life. I keep pretty much to myself because I have hobbies such as painting and tapestry to help the day pass. I am quite used to it.
“I am also very lucky because I have a marvellous daughter and family who live nearby in Wellington who do all my laundry and shopping.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Professor Suzanne Miller, who studied geology at St Andrews University, misused a corporate credit card to buy personal items including a £500 silk jacket, an electric scooter, show tickets and a drum kit.
She also used the card to transfer money into her mortgage account, to pay private school fees and to book flights and accommodation in Scotland.
The 55-year-old was removed from her roles as Queensland chief scientist and chief executive officer of the Queensland Museum Network following an investigation by the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission.
The Edinburgh-born geologist also claimed more than £23,000 of private healthcare insurance to which she was not entitled.
Miller pled guilty to fraud during a hearing at Brisbane Magistrates Court in March.
Yesterday she was given a three-year prison sentence, which will be suspended for good behaviour after three months. She was also ordered to repay the money.
She wrongfully claimed health insurance through her contract at the Queensland museum between February 2014 and July 2017.
She claimed to be on a special talent visa that entitled her to the insurance when she was not.
She also used a government credit card to make purchases worth more than £15,000 for her personal benefit.
The court heard she intends to move back to Scotland when she is released to be with her husband and daughter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4a camera samples leaked</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google Pixel 4a is the next most anticipated phone. Its announcement on May 22 seems inevitable now. The phone has tough competition from the likes of OnePlus which offers apparently the best (if not the best) vanilla Android experience even in comparison to Google phones. And now with iPhone SE in contention, buyers will be looking for a solid package in the form of Pixel 4a. Always known for its camera performance, Google should also have an excellent camera module in the Pixel 4a.
That said, tech YouTuber Julio Lusson from Cuba has Tweeted some samples of the Pixel 4a pitted against the Redmi Note 7. How he got his hands on the Pixel phone is anybody’s guess, but since he is a reliable tipster, his word can be taken with a grain of salt though. According to Julio, the image comparison is one close-up shot indoors (seen above) and another a wide-angle shot that demonstrates the capability of the phone. For reference, the shot below on the left is from Pixel 4a and one on the right is from Note 7.
Both the Pixel 4a photos have very balanced exposure levels and edge-detection is also good. The close-up shot displays the depth-sensing capabilities and better focusing ability of Pixel 4a camera. As for the wide-angle shot, there is a clear crispness, less noise, and color saturation levels due to the phone’s capable sensor.
Although comparing Redmi Note 7 camera with Google Pixel’s camera module is a bit unjustified, still we get an idea of what the Google phone will be capable of. The Pixel 4a is rumored to have a 12 MP camera whereas the Note 7 has a 48 MP, but we all know that more megapixels doesn’t always mean better photo clicking capabilities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">IMF Approves $643 Million Disbursement to Ecuador to Fight COVID-19 Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The International Monetary Fund will provide Ecuador with a $643 million loan to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak, the nation's Ministry of Economy and Finance said on Friday.
According to the Ministry, the IMF loan has been granted for 5 years and has an interest rate of 1.05%. 
On 1 May, the International Monetary Fund approved a two-year $10.8 billion credit line for Colombia under the Flexible Credit Line.
In April, it approved $389 million in emergency funding for El-Salvador to help cushion the nation’s economy from the impact of nationwide restrictions on transportation and quarantine for citizens exposed to the coronavirus.
Previously, the IMF said it was providing some $100 billion as a short-term liquidity line to more than 100 countries requiring emergency financing due to hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Re-opening of economies, covid-19 flattening to push ringgit higher next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 — News on the reopening of economies across the globe coupled with the flattening of the Covid-19 infection curve are set to take centre stage next week, pushing the ringgit higher.
This is despite the disappointing economic data released recently.
“Survey data like (the US) Purchasing Managers Index are plunging as businesses become increasingly worried about their future prospects.
“Having said that, the US government keeps on adding more stimulus to support small businesses. The US Federal Reserve is also very committed to acting further to provide liquidity,” Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid told Bernama.
He said to a large degree, the move has alleviated concerns over the severe impact on the economy brought by the disease.
In addition, Afzanizam said the volatility index has also come off from more than 80 points in March to around 33 points.
The index still remains elevated but it has made a considerable improvement and as a result, the local currency has appreciated against various currencies on Thursday, reaching RM4.302 versus the greenback from RM4.345 on Wednesday.
It also appreciated against the Japanese yen and Singapore dollar.
The ringgit would likely make an attempt to break the RM4.30 level next week, but intermittently, there would be some profit taking along the way as economic numbers are expected to remain weak in the near term, he added.
The market was closed on Friday for Labour Day.
For the week just ended, the ringgit was traded mostly higher, tracking the external market sentiment, namely the US Fed’s decision to keep its interest rate near zero until the economy recovers, followed by the oil price rally due to the reopening of economies.
On Friday, benchmark Brent crude jumped 12.42 per cent to US$25.34 (RM108.90_) per barrel.
On a Thursday-to-Friday basis, the local currency was firmer against a basket of currencies.
It increased against the US dollar to 4.2950/2050 from 4.3600/3680 on Friday last week.
The local unit also strengthened against the Singapore dollar to 3.0461/0543 from 3.0594/0657 and appreciated versus the Japanese yen to 4.0253/0358 from 4.0494/0576 .
It rose vis-a-vis the British pound to 5.3675/3808 from 5.3741/3853 and was higher against the euro at 4.6639/6765 from 4.6927/7030. — Bernama

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Several US hospitals using hydroxycloroquine for treating COVID-19 patients, says MDedge report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reports indicate that the malaria drug has been effective during the initial phases of a person being infected by coronavirus but poses a danger to those with heart ailments
Several hospitals in the United States continue to use malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 positive patients, a media report said.
Medical publication, MDedge on Friday reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the malaria drug, is currently the first-line therapy and Tocilizumab the second-line medication for people hospitalized with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Yale New Haven Health System, which operates hospitals across Connecticut.
Hydroxychloroquine is first-line at Yale because in-vitro data shows potent inhibition of the virus and possible clinical benefit, which is about as good as evidence gets at the moment, Indian American cardiologist Nihar Desai told the medical publication. "It's cheap, it's been used for decades, and people are relatively comfortable with it," he added.
"We are trying to do the best we can. One hopes we never have to go through anything like this (coronavirus pandemic) again," Desai told MDedge. His home institution, Yale New Haven Hospital, is almost half full with COVID-19 patients, at more than 400, the report said.
On Friday, US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID 19 patients. HCQ was the first drug to receive EAU from FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
US President Donald Trump has been an advocate of use of HCQ, which has reportedly cured patients in New York and several other place. Reports indicate that the malaria drug has been effective during the initial phases of a person being infected by coronavirus but poses a danger to those having heart ailments. At the request of Trump, India had exported 50 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine to the United States.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pennsylvania Doctor: Coronavirus May Be Less Deadly than Feared</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Dr. Donald Yealy said on Thursday he believes the coronavirus death rate is much lower than feared, and he sees hospitals returning to normalcy soon.
“We’ve learned that way more people, far, far more people have actually been exposed to the infection without any knowledge of it,” Dr. Yealy, chair of emergency medicine explained during an extended conversation with reporters. “That makes the overall death rate much lower. Many people just didn’t feel sick at all and recovered without difficulty.”
Yealy cited studies of New York and California, alongside the official death counts due to the COVID-19 coronavirus in Pittsburgh. Studies found that somewhere between five and twenty percent of the populations had been infected, with the majority facing only minor illness — and many remained completely asymptomatic.
Yealy raised a hypothetical situation, in which roughly three percent of Allegheny County residents were infected. That would mean an estimated 36,000 people contracted COVID-19. As of Thursday, the novel coronavirus death toll for Allegheny County is sitting at 94. That puts the death rate closer to .25 percent than current estimates as high as seven percent. “There is a big difference between 0.25% mortality and 7%,” he said.
There are, of course, many caveats. First among them is that Allegheny has only reported about 1,300 patients who tested positive. Second, it is impossible to say how many deaths can be attributed to the virus without proactive testing — impossible outside of already-critical cases with the current supply. It is also important to note that even at .25 percent, the coronavirus would still be nearly three times as deadly as influenza, which is estimated at around .1 percent fatality.
But the doctor said that “2% percent of the UPMC system’s 5,500 beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients,” and the hospital is seeing a decline in new cases. Dr. Rachel Sackrowitz, the chief medical officer for UPMC’s intensive care units, told reporters that 234 COVID-19 patients have recovered and been released. “This is very good news. It means people are getting better and we’re all on the right track together,” she said.
Dr. Sackrowitz hesitated to make any guesses about the danger of a nationwide relapse and focused on a long-term evaluation: “What I suspect is COVID-19 will be a part of our experience treating patients for an extended [period of] months to maybe years,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus Dispatches: Can Robots Help Us ‘Feed The Nation?’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even panic-buying tractor diesel is a thing. At the local pump its one-in-one-out, with tractors queuing at the gates. "And the long number?" the cashier shouts through the open window of his office as you bark your card details from a distance of 20 feet. Social distancing is fully observed by a profession that, by its nature, is socially distant.
In the far West of England, Cornwall grows some of the earliest crops. It starts with daffodils in January for bulbs and flowers, then onto early spring vegetables like cauliflower, new potatoes and cabbages.
Even those Forbes journalists-come-farmers are conscripted now. Farm mechanics are also considered essential workers, which is just as well as our tractor is so ancient that it regularly needs parts. Phone ahead and they'll find a "series two linkage bolt." Phone again when you arrive and they'll leave it on the doorstep. Again, social distancing in overdrive.
But a dodgy tractor is the last thing on the minds of neighbouring dairy farms. Cornwall is the home of clotted cream, that delicious and essential ingredient for cream teas as well as most deserts.
However, with doors at the Ritz and pretty much every other afternoon tea institution firmly closed, there is less demand for the stuff. Not that there is anywhere else dairy farmers can sell their milk. With catering and export markets diminished demand and prices have fallen off a cliff.
"Cows are not a switch," says one local farmer. "You can't simply stop milking them and then start again two weeks later."
Nor is milk is like oil. You can't store it until the world gets going again or buy it in futures. The result is milk thrown away. Gallons of it washed down the drain.
Secretary of state, and local minister of parliament (MP) George Eustice, has denied a bailout to the dairy industry, saying that prices are steadily picking up again. But many Cornish dairy farmers, who in normal times boost their income through tourism, have already suffered devastating losses.
However, Cornwall's biggest farming worry right now is who will pick the vegetables currently ripening in the fields. Normally migrant workers come from Eastern Europe to pick fruit and vegetables that cannot be mechanically harvested. But with borders now all but closed, Eustice has called for furloughed workers to step in. 'Feed The Nation', and 'Pick For Britain' are two campaigns dedicated to recruiting more local workers.
Only desperation will determine whether Britain can find the 80,000-or-so workers it needs. Most farms pay minimum wage, expect workers all summer long and then want them to live on site six days a week, often in squalid trailer parks in muddy yards. Even Cornwall's knock-out scenery can't make up for that monotony. No wonder thousands have already turned down farm jobs.
However, like so many things, coronavirus is accelerating changes that are already overdue in the industry.
Innovation in harvest robotics is happening. Cabbage, leek and fennel, which are currently picked by hand, have already been rustled by machinery from the likes of Belgium-based Vanhoucke Engineering. Prototype picking robots from nearby University of Plymouth were tested on cauliflowers last year.
Agritech (agricultural technology) was already a growth area pre-coronavirus, but now it could see a boom. It is not just Cornwall that is struggling to attract migrant workers, most Western European countries are having the same issue. Technology that not only harvests crops, but also milks cows and fertilises fields will become more widespread still.
But here's another idea: What about looking to the past as well as the future? London families used to decamp to Kent for the summer picking season, as depicted in George Orwell’s A Clergyman’s Daughter. Students would flock to French vineyards hoping to pick up some language skills alongside vines.
Backbreaking and long hours? Yes, but in return you could be rewarded with ploughman's or "vendange" lunches, not to mention fresh air and a healthy tan.
Now, in a country craving for comradery, harvest villages could become a thing. Following a summer of cancelled music festivals, maybe harvest festivals will make a comeback. "Make farming fun again" is surely a slogan for 2021 harvest season?
Then being furloughed to the farm might even be desirable. Only technology needs to help us on our way. That starts with fixing a broken tractor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Where are the secret boss fights in Streets of Rage 4?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yesterday saw the release of Dotemu's excellent Streets of Rage 4. As such, you may have already thrown hands with classic SoR villains such as Nora, Garnet, and Barbon. But I know what you're thinking: "This is all well and good, Y Signal, but I want to beat up that tonally inappropriate alien guy from Streets of Rage 2."Well, have I got the guide for you...Streets of Rage 4 has several secret boss fights, which let players throw down with some classic 16-bit bosses on their pixelated stomping grounds. To access these fights, all you need do is bag yourself a taser and electrify one of several Bare Knuckle arcade cabs strewn throughout the city. In SoR 4, the taser is a fragile weapon, so be careful not to use it before it's helped you on your time-warping trip to the 1990s. Unfortunately, completing these fights does not unlock anything new, but it's still a neat touch - yet another way that Streets of Rage 4 pays homage to its series' storied history. You can find the locations of four secret fights below. But these are early days, so who knows what else might be uncovered now that the game is in the hands of the public?(The bosses themselves have not been revealed to keep the surprise element.)
Stage 2: Police PrecinctWhile brawling through the cell block, you'll find the Bare Knuckle cabinet hiding in an open cell toward the end of first area. Grab the taser from a cop during the previous fight.Stage 4: Old PierThe cabinet can be found in its natural habitat at the end of the pier. Enter through the doorway on the far right. There are two taser-wielding cops right outside, so grabbing a zapper shouldn't be a problem.Stage 5: UndergroundAfter you climb out of the sewers and battle through the bathroom, the cabinet can be found in the center of the Red Demon bar. One of the nearby thugs is carrying a taser. This is a wild area, so be careful not to smash the cab by accident.Stage 8: Art GalleryWhen you reach the storage area filled with golden chickens, the cabinet is against the back wall and standing next to what is, let's face it, a giant butt-plug. This taser is a little hidden, but you'll find it in the bottom left of the screen, directly in front of the cabinet and just jutting out from the foreground.Streets of Rage 4 is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We speak with Ambika Pillai and Prakruthi Ananth, two celebrity make-up artists who have worked with the likes of Deepika Padukone, Katrina Kaif and Soundarya Rajnikanth, on moving their consultations online and what to expect in the next few months.
Ambika Pillai: “The last thing on anyone’s mind now is any kind of event. I consult via WhatsApp video calls on a daily basis, but [so far] no one has brought up a bridal consultation. This is a frightening phase for me, not knowing what the future holds. My line of work is one where social distancing of any sort will be compromised, as we are always in close proximity with our clients. Also, it is not a profession where working from home is an option. We had taken bookings before the pandemic [monsoon brides, and going into autumn and winter brides] and though everyone is in touch via e-mail, no one has finalised any occasion. In the near future, one can work on a bride with masks on and attention paid to sanitation, but will it be safe for the artist herself?”
Prakruthi Ananth: “I opted for virtual consultations for two brides in Chennai. I couldn’t travel to the venues during lockdown, but they managed with the online help. Going forward, I think weddings will be conducted on a much smaller scale, especially with restrictions on international travel. As long as we can travel to their destination locally, brides needn’t compromise on their dream look. Having said that, hairstyles and make-up trends will not see any changes. I have received enquiries and bookings post lockdown (until September), but with a request to be flexible. Starting May, I will be conducting one-on-one online tutorials for basic make-up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mass Mask-Making Masterclass</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just as 3D printers around the world have been churning out face shields, the thread injectors of home sewists have been stitching up fabric masks. Over the past several weeks, [Becky Stern] has made them for friends, family, neighbors, and anyone in her community who happens upon the box of free masks she’s left at a nearby bus stop. This is in addition the scores she has made and donated to health care workers so they can extend the life of their N95 masks.
If you’re going to make more than a few of anything, it just makes sense to make multiples at the same time and adjust the process for batch production. [Becky Stern] has some great ideas for ramping up assembly even further that include cutting out multiple main mask pieces at the same time, and ironing the pleats of several masks round robin style so you don’t waste time while they cool.
Even if you don’t dabble in the fabric arts, her method of kitting out the process of mask making is an interesting look into small-scale production.
Our favorite idea concerns the side bindings and the straps, which are the last part of the build and take the longest to do. [Becky] makes several miles of straps ahead of time with a 3D printed bias tape folder and then sews them all into a continuous strip. She can add the short side bindings to a bunch of masks at once, feeding them in one after the other so they end up strung together like sausages. Then she can just snip them apart and keep going, having saved both time and thread. Watch [Becky] make a single mask after the break and see how easy it is.
If sewing is a no-go for you, there are plenty of ways to help the PPE effort by firing up that printer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Japan aims to fast-track review of anti-viral drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO: Japan will fast-track a review of Gilead Sciences Inc's antiviral drug remdesivir so that it can hopefully be approved for domestic COVID-19 patients a week after the US firm's filing for such approval, the health minister said on Saturday (May 2).
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato's comment comes after remdesivir was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday.
"I've heard that Gilead Sciences will file for approval (in Japan) within days," Kato told reporters. "I issued an instruction so that we will be ready to approve it within a week or so."
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he was leaning towards extending Japan's state of emergency, due to expire on May 6, for a month as experts said coronavirus restrictions should remain in place until the number of cases falls further.
Japan has confirmed nearly 15,000 cases and 517 deaths from COVID-19, according to an NHK tally.
Tokyo, the capital, saw a decline in daily reported cases since hitting a peak of 201 on Apr 17, with further falls into double digits this week, but the numbers jumped back far above 100 on Friday and Saturday.
The Nikkei business daily has said although Gilead planned to distribute enough doses to cover 140,000 patients worldwide, Japan would not receive enough for all its patients in need.
No one was immediately available for comment at Gilead's Japanese unit.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host's immune system.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus treatment’s surprise approval gets a mixed reaction: Here’s why</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United States’ “emergency use” approval of the experimental antiviral drug Remdesivir to fight COVID-19 in patients made big news this weekend.
The approval was granted by the US Food and Drugs Administration two days after the National Institutes of Health’s clinical trial showed modestly promising results.
Ordinarily, this sort of news would come via a peer-reviewed journal. Instead, it’s occurred over three days, via a series of press releases.
On the heels of the USA, Japan has also announced it will fast-track a review of remdesivir so it can hopefully be approved for domestic COVID-19 patients.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato’s stated: “I’ve heard that Gilead Sciences will file for approval (in Japan) within days.
“I issued an instruction so that we will be ready to approve it within a week or so.”
The US trial involved 1063 severely ill patients in dozens of hospitals around the world.
According to a statement from the US National Institute of Health, which funded the trial, patients given the drug, intravenously, over a ten day period, recovered 31 per cent faster than equally sick patients who were given a placebo.
In real terms, Remdesivir cut recovery time from a median of 15 days to 11.
The trial also showed a small improvement over mortality, but one not statistically significant.
The FDA, in the opening paragraph of the announcement, noted “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using Remdesivir to treat people”.
The listed possible side effects, including “increased levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of inflammation or damage to cells in the liver; and infusion-related reactions, which may include low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and shivering”.
The FDA authorisation means the drug can be used in hospitalised patients with severe symptoms, even in cases where COVID-19 is suspected, and not actually confirmed by testing. It can be given to adults and children.
The FDA drug had already approved the use of Remdesivir on compassionate grounds. People on the verge of dying were given the drug because there was nothing to lose.
The FDA announcement was entirely a surprise. The previous day, at the White House, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described the trial results as “a very important proof of concept, because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus”.
Dr Fauci conceded the quicker recovery achieved by the drug “doesn’t seem like a knockout 100 per cent,” and he was careful to make clear that Remdesivir isn’t a magic bullet or a cure.
And yet, he declared: “This will be the standard of care.”
And he’s correct, because so far there is nothing else that has worked in slowing or halting the disease.
Scientists tend to agree that the double-blind randomised controlled trial agree that the trial was well run (although the goal posts of the trial were reportedly changed), but there’s been a call for the trial data to be made public.
Gilead Science, the company that developed the drug, as a potential remedy for Ebola and hepatitis (both of those trials failed) is donating 1.5 million doses of the drug to hospitals.
Dr Gaetan Burgio is head of the Transgenesis Core Facility in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the John Curtin School of Medical Research.
Responding to questions by email, Dr Burgio said:
“This is a very interesting question and there is a bit of debate on this. The US Remdesivir trial released from the NIH trial in a press release (not yet in a peer review publication) shows an acceleration for time to recovery (11 days instead of 14 days with placebo group) and reduction in mortality (not convincing).
“Indeed the time to recovery was assessed at day 28 in this trial. (A) Chinese trial published in The Lancet showed no difference in outcome between the placebo and the Remdesivir group. Overall it shows Remdesivir may work against the infection but not a silver bullet or a miracle drug. More details are needed to assess in detail this NIH trial.
“In this respect, yes I am a bit surprised by the rapid move to standard treatment and the fact it is made available under emergency provision. I would have expected more complete results from the respective arms (US, Europe, China) of this large trial before adopting such a move.
“I guess the pressure is massive in the US hospitals. Three days gain in recovery time might make a difference regarding the US situation and might ease the pressure in overloaded hospitals.”
Noting the “serious side effects”, Dr Burgio said the administration of Remdesivir has to be in light of the balance between risk and benefit.
“In short this means Remdesivir treatment might be beneficial to some, risky for others and this has to assessed carefully before initiating the treatment. Hence, its primary indication to a risk group (severe COVID19) where the benefits (time to recovery, mortality) outweigh the risks (severe side effects).”
Professor Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology in the Dept of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in a posting at the Science Media Centre, said:
“This is the first evidence that Remdesivir has genuine benefits, but they are certainly not dramatic. We do not know what adverse events occurred and the long term prognosis is not yet known. A full assessment of these results cannot be made without seeing a full publication.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK hospital trials blood plasma treatment for COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - A top British hospital will use blood plasma treatment for COVID-19 patients as part of a trial that transfuses plasma from recovered people into sick people to give their immune systems a boost to fight the virus.
Since the novel coronavirus emerged in China late last year, it has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide and drug companies are racing to produce a vaccine though there is not yet any specific treatment.
London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said helped save his life after he fell gravely ill with COVID-19, is to test the so called “convalescent plasma” treatment as part of an international trial.
Blood plasma donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19 is transfused into sick patients whose bodies are not producing enough of their own antibodies against the virus.
“At the moment, there is no proven treatment for COVID-19,” said Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’.
“Convalescent plasma is a promising treatment that could help patients whose bodies aren’t producing enough antibodies to curb the disease,” he said. “This trial will help us understand whether the treatment should be used more widely to treat COVID-19.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: A top British hospital will use blood plasma treatment for Covid-19 patients as part of a trial that transfuses plasma from recovered people into sick people to give their immune systems a boost to fight the virus.
Since the novel coronavirus emerged in China late last year, it has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide and drug companies are racing to produce a vaccine though there is not yet any specific treatment.
London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said helped save his life after he fell gravely ill with Covid-19, is to test the so-called “convalescent plasma” treatment as part of an international trial.
Blood plasma donations from people who have recovered from Covid-19 is transfused into sick patients whose bodies are not producing enough of their own antibodies against the virus.
“At the moment, there is no proven treatment for Covid-19,” said Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’.
“Convalescent plasma is a promising treatment that could help patients whose bodies aren’t producing enough antibodies to curb the disease,” he said. “This trial will help us understand whether the treatment should be used more widely to treat Covid-19.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">West Indies tour of England: Windies isolation period under discussion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Discussions around rescheduling West Indies' tour of England have included the possibility of the visitors going into isolation for as long as 14 days.
The three-Test series was due to begin in June, but the shutdown of cricket in England and Wales has been extended until at least 1 July.
The earliest date the first Test could begin is thought to be 8 July.
If the Windies are in isolation, they are likely to have access to practice facilities at a locked-down venue.
BBC Sport understands the visitors' planning involves leaving the Caribbean in mid-June, allowing enough time for any period of isolation, followed by practice matches.
The length of the isolation is another part of the discussions, with 14 days one of the options.
As it stands, there are no restrictions placed on overseas travellers arriving in the UK.
However, on Sunday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC plans for screening and quarantining people coming from abroad were "a serious point under consideration".
On Saturday, the England and Wales Cricket Board said "positive" discussions had been held with Cricket West Indies over a revised schedule for the tour.
Any cricket that does take place this summer is likely to be behind closed doors, perhaps in a "bio-secure" environment.
Even then, the staging of matches and the ability of overseas teams to play in the UK will be determined by government guidelines.
Australia, Pakistan and Ireland are also due to tour England this summer.
The ECB has previously stated it is looking at rescheduling the international calendar for the period between July and the end of September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US is being colonised by 'murder hornets,' a 'shockingly large' insect that can kill humans and behead entire colonies of bees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As if 2020 wasn’t already bad enough, the US now has another problem to deal with: a terrifying monster insect nicknamed the “murder hornet.”
Officially called the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia, the huge insects have been spotted in the US for the first time in recent months, appearing in Washington state, the state’s Department of Agriculture says.
The hornets, which are over two inches long, were first spotted in the state in December last year, and generally become active in the spring, researchers from Washington State University said in a post published in early April.
“They’re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,” Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at WSU’s Department of Entomology.
“It’s a shockingly large hornet,” added Todd Murray, a specialist in invasive species at the university.
While generally not aggressive towards people or pets, the hornets can attack if provoked, officials say, and have killed humans in extreme circumstances.
In 2013, between July and October, the insects killed 41 people and injured 1,600 in Shaanxi province during a particularly bad hornet season, the BBC reported.
Their main target, however, is the hives of honeybees, which they attack and often will destroy, largely by decapitating the bees in the hive, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA).
“Asian giant hornet attacks and destroys honeybee hives. A few hornets can destroy a hive in a matter of hours. The hornets enter a “slaughter phase” where they kill bees by decapitating them,” the department said.
“They then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young. They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire populations of those insects.”
Scientists are keen to make clear that people should be extremely cautious around the insects.
Such is the threat posed by the giant hornets that the WSDA has an entire web page devoted to reporting sightings of the insects and instructions on how to trap them. The site displays a large red banner warning people to be careful near them.
“Don’t try to take them out yourself if you see them,” said entomologist Chris Looney from the WSDA in a blog post on the WSU website.
“If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we’re going to have any hope of eradication.”

“They’re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,” Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at WSU’s Department of Entomology.
“It’s a shockingly large hornet,” added Todd Murray, a specialist in invasive species at the university.
While generally not aggressive towards people or pets, the hornets can attack if provoked, officials say, and have killed humans in extreme circumstances.
In 2013, between July and October, the insects killed 41 people and injured 1,600 in Shaanxi province during a particularly bad hornet season, the BBC reported.
Their main target, however, is the hives of honeybees, which they attack and often will destroy, largely by decapitating the bees in the hive, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA).
“Asian giant hornet attacks and destroys honeybee hives. A few hornets can destroy a hive in a matter of hours. The hornets enter a “slaughter phase” where they kill bees by decapitating them,” the department said.
“They then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young. They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire populations of those insects.”
Scientists are keen to make clear that people should be extremely cautious around the insects.
Such is the threat posed by the giant hornets that the WSDA has an entire web page devoted to reporting sightings of the insects and instructions on how to trap them. The site displays a large red banner warning people to be careful near them.
“Don’t try to take them out yourself if you see them,” said entomologist Chris Looney from the WSDA in a blog post on the WSU website.
“If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we’re going to have any hope of eradication.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pope says coronavirus vaccine must be shared worldwide</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on Sunday for international scientific cooperation to discover a vaccine for the coronavirus and said any successful vaccine should be made available around the world.
Francis, who has been delivering his Sunday address from the papal library instead of St. Peter’s Square because of the lockdown in Italy, thanked all those around the world who were providing essential services.
He encouraged international cooperation to deal with the crisis and combat the virus, which has infected nearly 3.5 million people and killed more than 240,000 people worldwide.
“In fact, it is important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way to find vaccines and treatments,” he said.
Francis said it was also important to “guarantee universal access to essential technologies that allow each infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary medical treatment.”
World leaders pledged in April to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, but the United States did not take part in the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said the WHO was slow to react to the outbreak and was being “China-centric”, and as a consequence has announced a suspension of funding. The WHO has defended its handling of the crisis.
A number of pharmaceutical companies around the world have developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
The Trump administration is planning to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine with the goal of having 100 million doses ready by the end of 2020, according to a senior U.S. administration official.
Most experts have suggested clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months.
On Sunday, the pope also backed a proposal by an inter-religious group known as the Higher Committee on Human Fraternity for an international day of prayer and fasting on May 14 to ask God to help humanity overcome the pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mainland China reports one new COVID-19 case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BEIJING: China reported one new COVID-19 case on Friday (May 1), down from 12 a day earlier, data from the country’s health authority showed on Saturday.
The new case was imported, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, down from six imported cases a day earlier. China reported no domestic transmission cases down from six the day before.
The NHC also reported 20 new asymptomatic cases for May 1, down from 25 a day earlier.
The total number of confirmed cases in the country has reached 82,875. With no new deaths on Friday, the toll remained at 4,633.
Companies, schools and individuals across China are lining up to be tested for the virus as the country rises back to normal life after largely taming the epidemic.
Biotech firms are ramping up production of test kits with demand growing despite lingering questions over their accuracy, while the government is pushing for more testing.
Where most testing had previously focused on those with symptoms, especially in the central city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged, demand is now soaring across China.
Beijing has seen some of the most strident demand, with many taking the test before business trips, and a drive-through service set up in one of the capital's districts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">People in the UK may have to cut down their social groups by 90% to stop coronavirus from spreading, scientists warn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK's social distancing measures may need to be in place for years, according to two new studies from scientists.
Social contact in the UK may need to be dramatically reduced on a long-term basis, according to scientists who warned that the UK's scope for lifting the lockdown is extremely limited until the discovery of a vaccine.
Two new studies found that Boris Johnson's government risks pushing the rate of transmission too high if social interaction is not severely limited for the foreseeable future.
The studies, published by British academics, explored what would happen to the so-called R rate if the current social distancing measures, which the government introduced in March, were lifted.
The R rate tracks how many people are infected, on average, for every one person who has the disease and keeping it below one is key to preventing a second peak of infections later this summer, scientists say.
A new study by scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and reported by the Telegraph newspaper, found that even in an "optimistic" scenario, social contact would have to be limited to around 5 to 10 people outside the home, workplace, and school.
A second study reported by scientists at the University of Dundee concluded that people resuming more than 10% of their previous social activity would risk a second peak of the virus, the Telegraph reported.
"Lockdown… can barely contain the disease's spread," the authors of the University of Dundee's study wrote.
"Our data is more consistent with a need to adopting a 'new normal' that can provide the optimal balance between allowing economic activity while ensuring very substantial reductions in prior social contacts - 90 per cent reductions according to our best estimates."
It came as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, warned on Sunday that Britain would not return to "business as usual this month.
He told Sky News: "I don't think we should expect us to go from this situation that we have at the moment of social distancing back to where we were in February - that's clearly not going to happen and I don't think anyone imagines that for one moment.
"The most important thing is that the absolute focus of what the Prime Minister will be announcing later in the week is that what we do going forward doesn't undo the brilliant work people have been doing to get that R number below 1 - the all-critical reproduction rate doesn't come back up because that's when we'd see a second spike.
"So no I'm afraid it is definitely not going to be business as usual but we do want to make sure that people understand where the route map lies."
Shapps confirmed that the government would be piloting a contact-tracing smartphone app this month, which is designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.
The app will alert people if they have potentially interacted with people infected with the coronavirus.

BLAINE, Washington -- Officials are warning about the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive species found in Washington state that can pack a powerful sting and be a threat to honeybees.
The Washington State Department of Agriculture said the bug was found in early December in Blaine, near the Canadian border.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gilead has yet to set a price for the coronavirus treatment remdesivir, but an influential drug pricing watchdog says it could be worth up to $4,500 per patient</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the big biotech Gilead Sciences has yet to outline its sales plan for the first effective coronavirus treatment, an influential drug pricing group has calculated the drug is worth up to $4,500 per patient.
The experimental antiviral called remdesivir was authorized for emergency use in the US on Friday, after a trial showed patients on the drug recovered 31% faster than those on a placebo. That translates to shaving four days off the typical hospital stay among these patients. It is the first drug to show a clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients in a high-quality randomized study.
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is a Boston-based nonprofit that analyzes drug pricing. The pharma industry regularly clashes with ICER, criticizing its models for being too rigid. The group often finds drugs to be overpriced compared to their value in the healthcare system. 
But in the case of remdesivir, ICER said Friday a price of up to $4,500 per treatment course is justified for remdesivir. The organization cautioned its findings are based on preliminary data that may change over time. 
ICER's analysis is focused on list prices for drug, which do not take into account rebates or discounts offered by drug companies.
"We are releasing these estimates now, despite the fact that the evidence is highly uncertain and evolving, because now is the time when the public and policymakers should be actively debating how to link pricing to an overall platform to develop treatments for COVID-19," said Steven Pearson, ICER's president, in a statement. "The consequential discussion about the tradeoffs and priorities involved with different pricing approaches cannot wait."
But the California biotech has called it too early to set a long-term pricing strategy. So far, the company pledged to donate its current supply of remdesivir, which amounts to 140,000 treatment courses. The pricing question has become a top uncertainty among many investors and Wall Street analysts. 
"The fact that ICER is typically conservative in all their analyses, and yet they can justify up to $4,500, seems pretty interesting," Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee wrote in a Sunday note to investors.

Using a placeholder of a $1,000 price, Yee estimated Gilead could make $1 billion on remdesivir by the end of 2020 if it sells 1 million treatment courses in the US and internationally. A $1,000 pricetag is "pretty reasonable" in the context of modern drug pricing, the analyst said.
Gilead has pledged it will donate its current supply of remdesivir, which amounts to about 140,000 treatment courses. CEO Daniel O'Day said Sunday the drug should start reaching patients within the next few days. 
Remdesivir is given as a 10-day IV infusion and has only been tested in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company is also researching ways to administer the drug subcutaneously or through inhalation but has not provided any timetables on those efforts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This cookbook made me a big believer in meal prep — and it's getting my family of four through the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a full-time freelancer for nearly 15 years and a mom to 4-year-old twins, I've become a master at multitasking, mostly out of necessity. At any given time, I'm juggling around six to eight clients and roughly the same amount of requests for snacks and cuddles — often simultaneously these days, thanks to the 24/7 togetherness of the COVID-19 crisis.
With this in mind, meal prepping always seemed like a logical solution, with its promise of efficiency and potential time and cost savings. But in reality, time (to grocery shop and cook a large portion of food) and desire has always eluded me. Plus, variety is the spice of life, and eating the same thing all week felt a little too "Groundhog Day" for my greedy palate.
Enter the 2020 quarantine, when suddenly I was spending more time in the kitchen than ever before. Maximizing our grocery haul and saving money became a priority. The crisis forced me to finally give meal prepping a try, and when a friend in my "moms of multiples" group suggested the "Cook Once, Eat All Week" cookbook by Cassy Joy Garcia, I was all-in.
Unlike other meal prep methods, Garcia streamlines and simplifies the process by using one "main" set of ingredients that can be used in up to five different meals throughout the week. There's also a good range of cuisines represented, from Asian, Italian, Mexican, to Greek.
Each week calls for a different trifecta of main ingredients, like shredded pork-kale-plantains or ground beef-broccoli-potatoes combinations. According to Garcia, the three-ingredient lineups are intentionally chosen to include one protein, one veggie, and one starch; additionally, many of the same staples are used week to week, such as chicken or beef broth, extra-virgin olive oil, and various vinegars and spices.
This is when all ingredients are prepped and stored, but the actual meals are made gradually throughout the week utilizing the ready-to-use ingredients. These prep-and-cook sessions are short, sweet, and super easy to accomplish after a long workday.
This produced three meals: sweet-and-sour chicken chow mein, chicken souvlaki bowls, and chicken Tettrazini. Each week's set of recipes also includes two "bonus dinners," so I could have stretched this to five meals, but I figured it was best to start small.
All things considered, I spent about three hours prepping in the kitchen that Sunday morning, fueled by Diet Coke and a steady soundtrack of Prince and Michael Jackson. As the week progressed, my husband and I were happy to discover that each recipe tasted distinct and not similar to each other (and chicken tettrazini was our clear favorite!).
Even my 4-year-old son — whose diet mostly consists of chicken nuggets and sweet potato dinosaurs — has been getting in on the action and loving it. My daughter, however, remains committed to her regimen of string cheese and Cutie oranges.
We were also relieved to discover more recipes that meet our individual dietary needs — my husband is full keto and low-carb, while I have celiac disease and eat strictly gluten-free.
All of Garcia's recipes are gluten free, and she includes substitutions throughout the book for Paleo, grain-free, dairy-free, egg-free, and nut-free eating. Vegetarians and vegans won't find much to enjoy here, though, as all 26 weeks call for meat as a main component.
I can see this good habit actually continuing long past the pandemic. Though it's been hard to note any sort of savings on groceries just yet (we leave hefty tips on Instacart and are stocking up on kitchen pantry items) — I can easily see how this approach will eventually save not only time, but also money.
And that's music to this multitasking mom's ears.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This cookbook made me a big believer in meal prep — and it's getting my family of four through the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a full-time freelancer for nearly 15 years and a mom to 4-year-old twins, I’ve become a master at multitasking, mostly out of necessity. At any given time, I’m juggling around six to eight clients and roughly the same amount of requests for snacks and cuddles – often simultaneously these days, thanks to the 24/7 togetherness of the COVID-19 crisis.
With this in mind, meal prepping always seemed like a logical solution, with its promise of efficiency and potential time and cost savings. But in reality, time (to grocery shop and cook a large portion of food) and desire has always eluded me. Plus, variety is the spice of life, and eating the same thing all week felt a little too “Groundhog Day” for my greedy palate.
Enter the 2020 quarantine, when suddenly I was spending more time in the kitchen than ever before. Maximizing our grocery haul and saving money became a priority. The crisis forced me to finally give meal prepping a try, and when a friend in my “moms of multiples” group suggested the “Cook Once, Eat All Week” cookbook by Cassy Joy Garcia, I was all-in.
Unlike other meal prep methods, Garcia streamlines and simplifies the process by using one “main” set of ingredients that can be used in up to five different meals throughout the week. There’s also a good range of cuisines represented, from Asian, Italian, Mexican, to Greek.
Each week calls for a different trifecta of main ingredients, like shredded pork-kale-plantains or ground beef-broccoli-potatoes combinations. According to Garcia, the three-ingredient lineups are intentionally chosen to include one protein, one veggie, and one starch; additionally, many of the same staples are used week to week, such as chicken or beef broth, extra-virgin olive oil, and various vinegars and spices.
This is when all ingredients are prepped and stored, but the actual meals are made gradually throughout the week utilizing the ready-to-use ingredients. These prep-and-cook sessions are short, sweet, and super easy to accomplish after a long workday.
This produced three meals: sweet-and-sour chicken chow mein, chicken souvlaki bowls, and chicken Tettrazini. Each week’s set of recipes also includes two “bonus dinners,” so I could have stretched this to five meals, but I figured it was best to start small.
All things considered, I spent about three hours prepping in the kitchen that Sunday morning, fueled by Diet Coke and a steady soundtrack of Prince and Michael Jackson. As the week progressed, my husband and I were happy to discover that each recipe tasted distinct and not similar to each other (and chicken tettrazini was our clear favorite!).
Even my 4-year-old son – whose diet mostly consists of chicken nuggets and sweet potato dinosaurs – has been getting in on the action and loving it. My daughter, however, remains committed to her regimen of string cheese and Cutie oranges.
We were also relieved to discover more recipes that meet our individual dietary needs – my husband is full keto and low-carb, while I have celiac disease and eat strictly gluten-free.
All of Garcia’s recipes are gluten free, and she includes substitutions throughout the book for Paleo, grain-free, dairy-free, egg-free, and nut-free eating. Vegetarians and vegans won’t find much to enjoy here, though, as all 26 weeks call for meat as a main component.
I can see this good habit actually continuing long past the pandemic. Though it’s been hard to note any sort of savings on groceries just yet (we leave hefty tips on Instacart and are stocking up on kitchen pantry items) – I can easily see how this approach will eventually save not only time, but also money.
And that’s music to this multitasking mom’s ears.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Click to read all about coronavirus →
The late Mary Agyapong, a Ghanaian nurse who died from Coronavirus, was one of the many essential workers in the UK who contracted the disease while performing their duties and subsequently passed away.
The departed souls were honoured for their bravery and commitment in the fight against the pandemic.
On April 16, 2020, firefighters and hospital staff at the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital in Luton, held a minute silence for Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong in her honour.
The Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service posted a video of its Deputy Chief Fire Officer Andrew Hopkinson giving a speech to commemorate Mary Agyapong, who worked at the hospital for five years.
Addressing well-wishers, Andrew Hopkinson said, “We are taking the opportunity to remember and appreciate a wonderful young woman and nurse who’s made a huge contribution to this NHS trust and to the lives of so many patients she has cared for.
“Everyone here will remember her… and we are all grateful for her service.
“It’s also a time to remember all those NHS staff who have died on the frontline fighting this virus.”
Aside eulogizing her hardwork, the 28-year-old was described by her colleagues as “a great example” of what the hospital stands for.
Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong was heavily pregnant and underwent a caesarean section to save her daughter, according to reports.
Her baby, reports say, is doing well.
It, however, is unclear how she contracted the disease since it was reported that she did not attend to coronavirus patients while working
A GoFundMe page for Agyapong’s family and newborn child has raised more than £186, 859 as at May 3, 2020. The campaign creator, Rhoda Asiedu, wrote “it is humane for us to take care of them in every way we can during this heavy and trying time.” She added, “we will forever miss you.” —Melissa Godin
She is survived by her baby girl and her husband only known as AJ.

The Reproductive Health Centre at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital has resumed its cervical cancer screening campaign but by appointments to prevent overcrowding at the facility.
The screening, which started in January as part of the nationwide cervical cancer awareness campaign, was expected to end in June 2020.
However, it was suspended due to the three-week lockdown in Accra to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Ms Rose Eduful, the Principal Nursing Officer, of the Centre, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), therefore, urged clients to schedule appointments to be screened.
"One can walk-in to book an appointment or contact 0243840804 for that to be done on their behalf," she said.
“The same process of calling would be followed for those coming to get their test results and also a picture of the results could be sent to the client upon request.”
Ms Eduful said as part of the measures put in place by the Centre to contain the spread of COVID-19, clients were required to wear face masks, wash their hands, and use hand sanitizers.
She advised women to take advantage of the ongoing cervical cancer screening exercise; while observing the new protocols for safety.
The early detection of cervical cancer, she advised, could help in preventing the disease from reaching an advanced stage where it could be detrimental to the patient.
“So for women having the fear of the unknown as their deterrent for not screening, they should know that early detection is key to preventing the scourge of the disease,” she stated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WC education readying for June reopening of schools</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CAPE TOWN – Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schafer said officials have already started working to ensure schools are ready to receive learners come the start of June.
The Basic Education Ministry this week announced 1 June has been set down as the tentative date for matriculants and grade 7 pupils to return to school.
The return of teachers and the remaining grades will be staggered.
MEC Schafer said she is aware of one school in the province that does not have access to a running water supply – officials are now working to find a solution for that problem.
Hygiene packs have been ordered and are expected to be delivered in the coming week.
Schafer said on balance they are relatively prepared, but she is concerned about overcrowding when all grades return to school.
The time crunch is a big factor in their planning – with limited funding and just a few weeks to get everything in place.
“There is no way we are going to get classrooms delivered, we just don’t have the funding for it and even if we did, it’s not possible to have classrooms installed until in a month or two.”'So, they are considering all possibilities to ensure the system gets moving again and is safe. “We are busy trying to work on some options including seeing if some of the children can go every alternate day. It’s really not something we want to do, but we might have to.”
The MEC said measures have been put in place to shorten the curriculum for learners up to grade 11, and matriculants will be given extra support to ensure they will be able to complete the year successfully.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EDITORIAL: Doping rule win for sport</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The stringent measures put in place by Athletics Kenya (AK) to deter doping among local athletes could not have come at a better time.
On Saturday, AK announced it will no longer clear athletes who have ever been suspended for doping to compete for the country.
It might also withdraw the passports of those sanctioned for use of banned substances, said AK President Jack Tuwei, while the employment contracts of drug cheats who are in the disciplined forces will be terminated.
Coming after the Athletics Integrity Unit named two more Kenyans — Alex Korio Oloitiptip and Mikel Kiprotich Mutai — as having been suspended for doping, the measures promise to root out the menace.
They would keep Kenyan athletes on the straight and narrow as they compete.
Kenya boasts a record of excellence in athletics and is a sporting powerhouse, thanks to its dominance in the middle- and long-distance races.
But with about 50 of its athletes sanctioned by local and international agencies in the past year for doping, it remains firmly on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) watchlist.
Local agencies now ought to enforce national laws that criminalise doping. The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) should crack down on dopers for a drug-free environment in which athletes compete clean and win fair.
AK should also ban unauthorised individuals from local training camps as a way of protecting young athletes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indore on recovery path? Recovered COVID-19 patients outnumber new cases for second day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BHOPAL: After witnessing a surge in COVID-19 cases for over a month, Indore - one of the COVID-19 hotspots of the country – could be on the path of recovery.
Indore had become the COVID-19 capital of Madhya Pradesh. But since the last two days, the city is witnessing a positive trend of patients having recovered from the deadly infection outnumbering new cases reported.
On Saturday, as many as 121 coronavirus patients were discharged from various hospitals in the city, after two of their last test reports were found negative for the infection.
The number of patients discharged from MRTB Hospital, SAIMS Hospital and Index Hospital was five times more than the new positive cases reported on Saturday, which stood at 23.
The positive development began on Friday when 42 patients were discharged from various hospitals, which were 10 more than the 32 new positive cases reported the same day.
“Since the last two days, the number of patients discharged from various hospitals has been greater than the new positive cases. We hope that this trend will continue in the coming days also,” Indore district chief medical and health officer Dr Pravin Jadia told The New Indian Express.
But the encouraging trend isn’t confined to the total number of discharged patients outnumbering the new positive cases. Even the percentage of samples tested positive out of the total samples tested too is declining.
As per figures with the health department in Indore, on April 27, out of the 820 total samples tested, 165 samples (20.12%) had tested positive for COVID-19. On April 28, the figure slid to 14.6%, which further declined to 9.82% on April 30, before further dropping to 6.31% on May 1.
On Saturday, out of the 515 samples that were tested, just 23 (4.46%) tested positive, which was an all-time low. Till date, out of the 8948 samples tested - 1568 (17.52%) have tested positive.
“The number of patients discharged from hospitals in Indore on Saturday being five times more than the new positive cases means that we are moving in the right direction. In the coming days, the situation is going to improve further,” said Dr Ravi Dosi, the senior pulmonologist at SAIMS Hospital, where the bulk of the COVID-19 patients are admitted.
Also, the four critical patients at SAIMS Hospital to whom Plasma Therapy is being administered are showing signs of improvement. “They are no longer on oxygen support and their Chest X-rays have shown remarkable improvement. All the four patients are now talking to us with ease, which is very encouraging,” Dr Dosi informed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian-American physician launches study to find if prayers could heal Covid patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kansas City: An Indian-American physician in Kansas City has begun a study to find if something called remote intercessory prayer might initiate God to heal those infected with the coronavirus.
Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy launched the four-month prayer study on Friday, which involves 1,000 coronavirus patients who are in intensive care.
 
In the study, none of the patients' prescribed standard care will be changed. They will be divided in two groups of 500 each and prayers will be offered for one of the groups.
Also, neither group will be informed about the prayers.
The four-month study will investigate "the role of remote intercessory multi-denominational prayer on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients," according to a description provided to the National Institutes of Health.
Half of the patients, randomly chosen, will receive a "universal" prayer offered in five denominational forms -- Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism -- while the other patients will constitute the control group.
All the patients will receive the standard of care prescribed by their medical providers and Lakkireddy has assembled a steering committee of medical professionals to oversee the study.
"We all believe in science, and we also believe in faith," Lakkireddy said.
"If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question," he said.
The investigators will assess how long the patients remain on ventilators, how many suffer from organ failure, how quickly they are released from intensive care and how many die, Lakkireddy said.
He describes himself as "born into Hinduism," but said he also attended a Catholic school and had spent time in synagogues, Buddhist monasteries, and mosques.
The physician said he cannot explain how people praying remotely for someone they don't know (or a group of people,) could actually make a difference in their health outcomes, and acknowledged that some of his medical colleagues have had "a mixed reaction" to his study proposal.
Lakkireddy said he has no idea what he will find, "but it's not like we're putting anyone at risk. A miracle could happen. There's always hope, right?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">In Bangladesh, COVID-19 infection rate highest among the youth at 26pc: IEDCR</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The bulk of the coronavirus infections afflicting the population in Bangladesh is youths, according to data released by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR.
Nearly two months since the first case of COVID-19 was found in Bangladesh, IEDCR revealed that 26 percent of the infected are between 21 and 30 years old.
Experts believe this 'alarming' rate of infection among the age group is largely due to their inclination towards defying stay-at-home rules designed to contain the spread of the disease.
"Anybody can be infected by the virus. But the highest cases of infection occuring between certain age brackets may be down to their tendency of going out, be it for professional reasons or something else. So the rate of infection among youths is high," Mushtuq Husain, a former chief scientific officer at IEDCR told bdnews24.com.
Prof Shahnila Ferdousi, director at DGHS' Disease Control Department said, "You must have noticed that they (youths) are not complying with the lockdown measures, they are out and about. This may be a key reason (for their infection), though this age group is supposed to have the toughest immune system.
"...they are unexpectedly falling sick while some of them are dying."
Prof Shahnila pointed out that further analysis of the data would provide a more concrete understanding of the susceptibility of different age groups to the COVID-19 infection.
bdnews24.com phone calls to other IEDCR officials, including the Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora, to dive deeper into the matter went unanswered.
According to IEDCR data, three percent of the infected are children below 10 yearsm while eight percent are aged between 11 and 20.
Another 24 percent of the infected are 31 to 40 years old, 18 percent are 41 to 50 and 13 percent are aged 51 to 60. The remaining eight percent are more than 60 years old.
Among the fatalities, 60 percent are elderly, aged above 60, while 27 percent are 51 to 60 years old, 19 percent are aged 41-50 and seven percent 31 to 40 years old.
Youths between 21 and 30 years, the age group with the highest rate of infection, make up three percent of the dead while two percent are children under 10 years. No deaths have been recorded in 11-20 age group.
The tally of infections jumped to 8,790 with 552 additional cases confirmed on Saturday as five more deaths in the 24 hours to 8am took the body count in Bangladesh to 175.
Among the infected, 68 percent are males while they comprise 73 percent of the dead.

“What we are seeing are scenes from a horror movie."
Those words came from Artur Virgilio, the mayor of Manaus, about the coronavirus crisis developing in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil.
The city had a record number of burials in April -- about 100 a day, or triple the average -- forcing authorities to do many en masse in improvised cemeteries.
“We aren’t in a state of emergency. We are in a state of utter disaster, like a country that is at war but has already lost," Virgilio said.

The city's public health system has already collapsed, with 100% of intensive-care beds occupied and hundreds of people left untreated.
Relatives of victims report that burials have been carried out collectively, with some people left not knowing if their loved one was, in fact, buried.
In some cases, corpses were placed on top of each other in graves, according to reports. The official cause of death is often listed as "unknown" or "severe acute respiratory failure," which experts say is contributing to a massive under-count of coronavirus cases.
Between April 21 and April 28, the government reported 118 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Manaus. But in that same week, more than 200 people were buried due without a determined cause of death, in addition to 395 due to respiratory failure or suspected coronavirus.
According to one projection, the number of burials in Manaus may reach 4,200 later this month..
BOLSONARO EFFECT? MORE BRAZILIANS SEEN DEFYING CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS
The crisis in Manaus could be a sign of things to come for the whole country.
Although conditions in São Paulo, the largest city in South America, and Rio de Janeiro, are not as dire, experts warn that the country faces a coronavirus surge similar to those that devasted Italy, Spain and parts of the United States. Or even worse,
Edmar Santos, Rio’s state secretary of health, said in a television interview that a "collapse" of the nation's health care system could happen this month.
"What we expect for the next three to four weeks is that Brazil will experience the same collapse that [happended in] Italy, Spain and the United States. Rio has over a thousand people waiting for a bed, with 361 patients in serious condition."
The government is weighing a possible nationwide lockdown if COVID-19 cases keep surging.
Getting people to engage in social distancing, however, can be easier said than done. The country's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sabotaged efforts to impose effective social distancing, firing his health minister who defended the move, and attacking covid-19 as “hysteria”.
Asked about Brazil's rising death toll, the far-right politician recently declared: “So what?”
BRAZIL SEES SPIKE IN CORONAVIRUS CASES, WITH SOME HOSPITALS OVERLOADED
His supporters seem to be following his words.
A study conducted by researchers of Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) and Cambridge University found that social isolation declined among Bolsonaro’s supporters after his speeches in March, using geolocation data on more than 60 million mobile devices.
Bolsonaro was elected with over 55 million votes and, according to a recent poll, his popularity reaches almost 40% of the electorate, which would represent around 40 million people. According to economist Luis Meloni, from Universidade de São Paulo, the president has shown "impressive" resilience amid the health crisis.
But the resignation of his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had strong popular approval, and the loss of the highly popular justice minister, Sérgio Moro, who resigned because he disagreed with the president's actions, may have greater consequences for Bolsonaro, Meloni said.
"The president has benefited from social isolation because people contrary to his presidency are at home, unable to protest, although every day there are records of people protesting at their windows. But those who support him have been out on the streets showing support for him. So it is difficult to calculate, at that moment, the possibility of him falling from power, but, in fact, the size of his popularity is impressive, even with the current disastrous situation of Brazil in the fight against the epidemic."
Moro, on his way out, said the president tried to influence Federal Police investigations involving his sons, Carlos Bolsonaro and Eduardo Bolsonaro. This week, the president gave another sign in this direction: He appointed a friendly delegate to the post of director of the Police, which was blocked by the Supreme Federal Court due to a conflict of interest.
The Supreme Court also authorized the opening of an investigation against the president, and political parties filed a request for impeachment in the House of Representatives.
In the meantime, rising numbers of coronavirus deaths and a looming economic crisis are likely to seriously damage Bolsonaro.

As of Saturday morning, Brazil had more than 92,000 confirmed cases and more than 6,000 deaths. Experts believe, however, that the real numbers could be up to 15 times higher than official statistics.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What happens if a coronavirus vaccine is never developed? It has happened before</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As countries lie frozen in lockdown and billions of people lose their livelihoods, public figures are teasing a breakthrough that would mark the end of the crippling coronavirus pandemic: a vaccine.
But there is another, worst-case possibility: that no vaccine is ever developed. In this outcome, the public's hopes are repeatedly raised and then dashed, as various proposed solutions fall before the final hurdle.
Instead of wiping out COVID-19, societies may instead learn to live with it. Cities would slowly open and some freedoms will be returned, but on a short leash, if experts' recommendations are followed.Testing and physical tracing will become part of our lives in the short term, but in many countries, an abrupt instruction to self-isolate could come at any time. Treatments may be developed -- but outbreaks of the disease could still occur each year, and the global death toll would continue to tick upwards.
It's a path rarely publicly countenanced by politicians, who are speaking optimistically about human trials already underway to find a vaccine. But the possibility is taken very seriously by many experts -- because it's happened before. Several times.
"There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against," says Dr. David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, who also serves as a special envoy to the World Health Organization on COVID-19. "We can't make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.
"It's absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat, and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst," Nabarro tells CNN.
Most experts remain confident that a COVID-19 vaccine will eventually be developed; in part because, unlike previous diseases like HIV and malaria, the coronavirus does not mutate rapidly.
Many, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggest it could happen in a year to 18 months. Other figures, like England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, have veered towards the more distant end of the spectrum, suggesting that a year may be too soon.
But even if a vaccine is developed, bringing it to fruition in any of those timeframes would be a feat never achieved before.
"We've never accelerated a vaccine in a year to 18 months," Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, tells CNN. "It doesn't mean it's impossible, but it will be quite a heroic achievement.
"We need plan A, and a plan B," he says.
In 1984, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler announced at a press conference in Washington, DC, that scientists had successfully identified the virus that later became known as HIV -- and predicted that a preventative vaccine would be ready for testing in two years.
Nearly four decades and 32 million deaths later, the world is still waiting for an HIV vaccine.
Instead of a breakthrough, Heckler's claim was followed by the loss of much of a generation of gay men and the painful shunning of their community in Western countries. For many years, a positive diagnosis was not only a death sentence; it ensured a person would spend their final months abandoned by their communities, while doctors debated in medical journals whether HIV patients were even worth saving.
The search didn't end in the 1980s. In 1997, President Bill Clinton challenged the US to come up with a vaccine within a decade. Fourteen years ago, scientists said we were still about 10 years away.
The difficulties in finding a vaccine began with the very nature of HIV/AIDS itself. "Influenza is able to change itself from one year to the next so the natural infection or immunization the previous year doesn't infect you the following year. HIV does that during a single infection," explains Paul Offit, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist who co-invented the rotavirus vaccine.
"It continues to mutate in you, so it's like you're infected with a thousand different HIV strands," Offit tells CNN. "(And) while it is mutating, it's also crippling your immune system."
HIV poses very unique difficulties and Covid-19 does not possess its level of elusiveness, making experts generally more optimistic about finding a vaccine.
But there have been other diseases that have confounded both scientists and the human body. An effective vaccine for dengue fever, which infects as many as 400,000 people a year according to the WHO, has eluded doctors for decades. In 2017, a large-scale effort to find one was suspended after it was found to worsen the symptoms of the disease.
Similarly, it's been very difficult to develop vaccines for the common rhinoviruses and adenoviruses -- which, like coronaviruses, can cause cold symptoms. There's just one vaccine to prevent two strains of adenovirus, and it's not commercially available.
"You have high hopes, and then your hopes are dashed," says Nabarro, describing the slow and painful process of developing a vaccine. "We're dealing with biological systems, we're not dealing with mechanical systems. It really depends so much on how the body reacts."
Human trials are already underway at Oxford University in England for a coronavirus vaccine made from a chimpanzee virus, and in the US for a different vaccine, produced by Moderna.
However, it is the testing process -- not the development -- that holds up and often scuppers the production of vaccines, adds Hotez, who worked on a vaccine to protect against SARS. "The hard part is showing you can prove that it works and it's safe."
If the same fate befalls a COVID-19 vaccine, the virus could remain with us for many years. But the medical response to HIV-AIDS still provides a framework for living with a disease we can't stamp out.
"In HIV, we've been able to make that a chronic disease with antivirals. We've done what we've always hoped to do with cancer," Offit says. "It's not the death sentence it was in the 1980s."
The groundbreaking development of a daily preventative pill -- pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP -- has since led to hundreds of thousands of people at risk of contracting HIV being protected from the disease.
A number of treatments are likewise being tested for Covid-19, as scientists hunt for a Plan B in parallel to the ongoing vaccine trials, but all of those trials are in very early stages. Scientists are looking at experimental anti-Ebola drug remdesivir, while blood plasma treatments are also being explored. Hydroxychloroquine, touted as a potential "game changer" by U.S. President Donald Trump, has so found been found not to work on very sick patients.
"The drugs they've chosen are the best candidates," says Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor in the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham. The problem, he says, has been the "piecemeal approach" to testing them.
"We have to do randomized controlled trials. It's ridiculous that only recently have we managed to get that off the ground," Neal, who reviews such tests for inclusion in medical journals, tells CNN. "The papers that I'm getting to look at -- I'm just rejecting them on the grounds that they're not properly done."
Now those fuller trials are off the ground, and if one of those drugs works for COVID-19 the signs should emerge "within weeks," says Neal. The first may already have arrived; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told CNN it is in talks to make remdesivir available to patients after positive signs it could speed up recovery from the coronavirus.
The knock-on effects of a successful treatment would be felt widely; if a drug can decrease a patient's average time spent in ICU even by by a few days, it would free up hospital capacity and could therefore greatly increase the willingness of governments to open up society.
But how effective a treatment is would depend on which one works -- remdesivir is not in high supply internationally and scaling up its production would cause problems.
And crucially, any treatment won't prevent infections occurring in society -- meaning the coronavirus would be easier to manage and the pandemic would subside, but the disease could be with us many years into the future.
If a vaccine can't be produced, life will not remain as it is now. It just might not go back to normal quickly.
"The lockdown is not sustainable economically, and possibly not politically," says Neal. "So we need other things to control it."
That means that, as countries start to creep out of their paralyses, experts would push governments to implement an awkward new way of living and interacting to buy the world time in the months, years or decades until Covid-19 can be eliminated by a vaccine.
"It is absolutely essential to work on being COVID-ready," Nabarro says. He calls for a new "social contract" in which citizens in every country, while starting to go about their normal lives, take personal responsibility to self-isolate if they show symptoms or come into contact with a potential COVID-19 case.
It means the culture of shrugging off a cough or light cold symptoms and trudging into work shouldbe over. Experts also predict a permanent change in attitudes towards remote working, with working from home, at least on some days, becoming a standard way of life for white collar employees. Companies would be expected to shift their rotas so that offices are never full unnecessarily.
"It (must) become a way of behaving that we all ascribe to personal responsibility ... treating those who are isolated as heroes rather than pariahs," says Nabarro. "A collective pact for survival and well-being in the face of the threat of the virus.
"It's going to be difficult to do in poorer nations," he adds, so finding ways to support developing countries will become "particularly politically tricky, but also very important." He cites tightly packed refugee and migrant settlements as areas of especially high concern.
In the short term, Nabarro says a vast program of testing and contact tracing would need to be implemented to allow life to function alongside COVID-19 -- one which dwarfs any such program ever established to fight an outbreak, and which remains some time away in major countries like the U.S. and the U.K.
"Absolutely critical is going to be having a public health system in place that includes contact tracing, diagnosis in the workplace, monitoring for syndromic surveillance, early communication on whether we have to re-implement social distancing," adds Hotez. "It's doable, but it's complicated and we really haven't done it before."
Those systems could allow for some social interactions to return. "If there's minimal transmission, it may indeed be possible to open things up for sporting events" and other large gatherings, says Hotez -- but such a move would not be permanent and would continually be assessed by governments and public health bodies.
That means the the Premier League, NFL and other mass events could go ahead with their schedules as long as athletes are getting regularly tested, and welcome in fans for weeks at a time -- perhaps separated within the stands -- before quickly shutting stadiums if the threat rises.
"Bars and pubs are probably last on the list as well, because they are overcrowded," suggests Neal. "They could reopen as restaurants, with social distancing." Some European countries have signaled they will start allowing restaurants to serve customers at vastly reduced capacity.
Restrictions are most likely to come back over the winter, with Hotez suggesting that COVID-19 peaks could occur every winter until a vaccine is introduced.
And lockdowns, many of which are in the process of gradually being lifted, could return at any moment. "From time to time there will be outbreaks, movement will be restricted -- and that may apply to parts of a country, or it may even apply to a whole country," Nabarro says.
The more time passes, the more imposing becomes the hotly debated prospectof herd immunity -- reached when the majority of a given population, around 70% to 90%, becomes immune to an infectious disease. "That does to some extent limit spread," Offit says -- "although population immunity caused by natural infection is not the best way to provide population immunity. The best way is with a vaccine."
Measles is the "perfect example," says Offit -- before vaccines became widespread, "every year 2 to 3 million people would get measles, and that would be true here too." In other words, the amount of death and suffering from COVID-19 would be vast even if a large portion of the population is not susceptible.
All of these predictions are tempered by a general belief that a vaccine will, eventually, be developed. "I do think there'll be vaccine -- there's plenty of money, there's plenty of interest and the target is clear," Offit says.
But if previous outbreaks have proven anything, it's that hunts for vaccines are unpredictable. "I don't think any vaccine has been developed quickly," Offit cautions. "I'd be really amazed if we had something in 18 months."

    <h5 class="mb-1">MSDH: No confirmed transmission of coronavirus in Miss. poultry processing plants</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Some of Mississippi’s more rural counties are seeing more coronavirus cases than areas six and seven times their size, with Scott County leading the state as the place with the highest rate of positive COVID-19 cases per capita.
For the last two weeks, concerned Mississippians have been reaching out to 3 On Your Side, claiming coronavirus is spreading unchecked at poultry processing plants in Scott and Leake counties, contributing to those high numbers.
Gov. Tate Reeves said he’s been assured by State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs that those claims aren’t true.
“They did not have a confirmed case transmitted within one of those plants," Reeves said.
Reeves said in a White House conference call earlier this week, Dr. Deborah Birx told him that, at many food processing plants across the U.S., research has shown that outbreaks are happening not in those facilities, but possibly among plant employees while they’re not at work.
“The transmission generally happens in a communal living space where a lot of the workers live, in very close quarters, or sometimes in the transportation vehicles where they’re in very tight quarters moving from where they live to the actual plants themselves," Reeves said.
Scott and Leake counties rank highest in positive cases per 10,000 residents.
In fact, one out of every 83 Scott County residents has tested positive for the virus since the county got its first case on March 22.
3 On Your Side reached out to officials with Koch Foods in Morton and Tyson Foods in Forest to see how many employees this has affected.
Only Tyson responded.
Spokesperson Morgan Watchous said they do have confirmed cases at some of their U.S. locations, but would not disclose the number of cases associated with a plant or even which plants were impacted.
Watchous did say, however, that the company is adjusting how it operates to reduce worker interaction and sanitizing several parts of its facilities daily.
Dobbs said the state health department will be changing its strategy for those two counties to concentrate on localized outbreaks to find out where these cases keep spreading.
“I think that’s driving part of the increase, localized outbreaks or localized transmission. Additional public health activities will need to happen in these areas," Dobbs said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus pandemic could place hundreds of thousands of jobs in wind, solar energy at risk</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus lockdowns across the U.S. may be helping clear the air of pollution, but the pandemic has also led to a setback for the country's renewable energy industry, The Associated Press reports.
The wind and solar sectors were on good footing before the pandemic struck but now trade groups are predicting as many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost when all is said and done. "There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak," said Abigail Ross Harper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. "Up to half our jobs are at risk."
The wind industry is struggling to get parts from overseas, while residential solar businesses are taking the brunt of the hit in that industry since door-to-door sales aren't possible anymore, and individual customers are being cautious during the downturn. Subsequently, new solar installations could drop 17 percent this year, while wind manufacturing could fall up to 20 percent, consulting firm Wood McKenzie estimates.
"The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two," said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. "That reversal is stunning and problematic."
But while the pandemic has caused the industry pain, there's a sense things will turn around again in the long run. Andrew Pershing, the chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, for example, hopes the pandemic eventually results in an economy "that doesn't depend on burning coal and oil."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gov. Reynolds: Iowa will reopen economy, keep meat plants running responsibly and safely</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has partially lifted coronavirus restrictions, vowed Saturday to reopen in a way that keeps people safe.
Appearing on "Cavuto LIVE," Reynolds said she appreciates President Trump'sorder to keep meat processing plants open and has been in constant communication with over 40 state manufacturers and plants to make sure they have the tests and safety equipment they need.

"Iowa produces 10 percent of the food supply, and we're a fourth of the processing," the Republican governor said. "And so this is a critical and essential workforce, and a critical and essential work production capability. We're working in tandem to make sure that we can keep the food supply chain moving and keep America fed."
This comes after Tyson Foods reported Friday it will be reopening its plant in Indiana with limited production after nearly 900 workers tested positive for coronavirus.
The pork processing plant closed for 14 days in an effort to contain the outbreak, and all workers were tested for the virus. The decision to reopen followed a tour with local health and government officials, and a union representative, according to a news release.
The company said it has taken additional measures to ensure a safe work environment, including adding more work station barriers, hand sanitizer dispensers and monitors to help enforce social distancing.
Reynolds said regular testing of employees at the plants is "critical."
She told host Neil Cavuto that there have been over 7,500 diagnostic coronavirus tests and 5,000 serology tests conducted to date in Iowa, and 24,000 tests combined are scheduled in the next 10 days.
"This really gives the employees the confidence that they need to feel safe in returning back to work...," Reynolds said.
As of Friday, most of Iowa’s counties have begun to reopen. Restaurants, retail businesses, shopping malls, fitness centers and race tracks will be allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity. Events can be held with up to 10 people, and worship services can resume with social distancing.
"We've eased restrictions in 77 of our counties and we're seeing about 88 to 90 percent of our [positive] cases in the 22 counties that will remain under the higher level of restrictions," Reynolds said.
Despite still recording hundreds of new coronavirus cases, Iowa never imposed a statewide stay-at-home order.

"Iowans are responsible. They're practicing personal responsibility,as well as our businesses, and so we're going to continue to look at the data [and] monitor the virus activity," she said.  "We're able to do that from a statewide perspective to a county perspective right down to a community and a zip code. So we can be targeted in our approach as we begin to reopen Iowa and bring our economy back online."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zelda would be better if Link had a gun - Reader’s Feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A reader offers a tongue-in-cheek glimpse of what games like Dark Souls and The Legend Of Zelda would be like with guns instead of swords.
I’d like to start this feature by recalling one of the most beloved scenes in cinematic history, and one which I’m sure your readers are familiar with. The scene in question appears in the Steven Spielberg 1981 classic, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones’s friend, Marion, has been kidnapped in the bustling streets of Cairo, with Indy in frantic pursuit, trying desperately to tail her abductors and get her back.
Suddenly the crowd disperses, revealing a menacingly cloaked figure wielding an equally intimidating scimitar. Taunting Jones, the assassin demonstrates his formidable swordsmanship and the scene is clearing setting up an epic showdown between the two. Of course, what happens next is even more epic; Indy casually takes out his revolver and dispatches his adversary with a single shot. It’s perhaps the most iconic subversion of expectations a movie has ever achieved.
Now, I’d like to direct your attention to an equally beloved and epic video game, Dark Souls. I’m sure many of you have played this seminal classic before, but in case anyone’s unfamiliar with the game, let me tell you, it’s hard. Like, reeeeaaally hard. Even the lowest minions can pose a real threat to an overconfident or ill-prepared player. A particular moment early on in the game stands out in my memory perhaps more so than other part of the game.
After around 10 minutes, you encounter your first Black Knight, and trust me, these guys don’t mess around! The first time I took him on, he dashed at me with unbelievable speed and finished me off with just two or three vicious swipes from his sword. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the same thing happened around 50 times before I eventually, through sheer grit and determination, defeated him. I felt triumphant, for sure, but also drained and frustrated in equal measure.
Now, let’s pretend that arduous routine never happened at all. Let’s imagine, instead, that as that intimidating Black Knight was dashing towards me, his cockiness almost visible through his impenetrable visor, I simply whipped out a sawn-off, double-barrelled shotgun and blew the muppet’s head off. You see where I’m going with this? Not only would there be hardly any time lost dying over and over, but all the other minions would witness how powerful I am and flee in terror. I could simply progress straight to the bosses, finish them off with ease and the game would be over a lot quicker. It would, simply put, be a better game.
Let us turn our attention to another game, the recent classic, Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. Now, I’m loath to criticise a game as loved as this, but in the name of providing enlightenment, I’m afraid I must. I was constantly being ambushed by Ganon’s minions in this game wherever I went. I couldn’t even pick apples without suddenly being surrounded by a score of enemies and having to fend them off with a pathetic excuse for a sword which was about as useful as a toothpick.
Why can’t I just pull out a minigun from my satchel and waste them all in a few seconds? It would make the game so much fun and so less time-consuming. The expression ‘bringing a knife to a gun fight’ exists for a reason. Guns are better and more fun, it’s that simple.
I don’t even think it would be too difficult a feature to implement into the game’s design. The guns could still break, like the melee weapons did, if you don’t maintain them well enough. Link could find or buy better armour with more ammo slots and pockets, allowing him to carry a greater arsenal as the game progresses. Just as in the real game, better attire could also unlock special abilities, like a jetpack for traversing the mountains instead of wasting 15 minutes of my life watching Link climb 15 metres only to then slide down 20 metres because it’s raining.
I picture Link starting off with his first gun, a rubbish .25 calibre peashooter, and by the end of the game, a walking one-man army, carrying grenades, bombs, rocket launchers, automatic rifles… the possibilities are endless. Nintendo could even introduce paid-for DLC and loot boxes if they were worried about how profitable the game would be, with players being able to buy gun modifications, skins, and even witty one-liners Link could quip as he’s mowing down the next bunch of crazy fools dumb enough to get in his way.
And picture how glorious the final battle with Ganon would be! This huge, towering beast, getting ready to lay waste to the whole population beneath it, only for Link to order a nuclear drone strike right on his head. There could even be a cut scene where Link turns to princess Zelda and winks at her, as the mushroom cloud rises on the horizon, but I jest and I’m getting ahead of myself!
Now look, I understand the whole point of adventure games is the challenge; to slowly but surely build up your character to overcome the odds and emerge victorious, the hard work and investment paying off in the end. You could even make the argument that these games are a metaphor for dealing with real-life’s hardships and overcoming them through strength, faith, determination, and whatever other human virtues you care to name. I also concede that some games wouldn’t benefit from the introduction of guns.
I can’t imagine how they would enhance, say, your typical 15-minute game of FIFA, for example. I would also imagine that EA would be nervous about introducing such a feature because the media outcry would be immeasurable. But the argument I would make is that if games are about empowering the player, what would better achieve that goal? Equipping them with a tree branch or equipping them with a plasma rifle?
Anyway, these are just my thoughts and I would love to hear what everyone else thinks. But just remember this: Grand Theft Auto and Call Of Duty sell much more than games like Okami, Kirby and Catherine, and that’s for a reason…

    <h5 class="mb-1">First giant panda born in Netherlands</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE HAGUE: Wu Wen, a giant panda loaned to a Dutch zoo by China, has given birth in a first for the Netherlands, Ouwehands animal park announced Saturday (May 2).
Mating took place in January and the cub, which belongs to Beijing just like the mother and father Xing Ya, was born on May 1.
"The mother and her cub are staying in the maternity den and are doing well," the zoo in the central city of Rhenen said in a statement said.
"This cub was born and conceived naturally," said Ouwehands owner Marcel Boekhoorn.
"Male or female? The cub's gender will remain a surprise for the time being," he added.
"The keepers are leaving Wu Wen and her cub alone. When the cub leaves the maternity den after a few months, we will be able to see what the gender is.
"When that happens, the little giant panda will be named," Boekhoorn said. The cub will go to China after four years to join the breeding programme.
The mother and father were loaned to the Netherlands in 2017 for 15 years.
Giant pandas are found only in the wild in China where their habitat is shrinking.
However since 2016, they are no longer considered in danger of extinction but remain "vulnerable".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Over 1.5 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded in Europe, just under half the worldwide total, according to an AFP tally on Saturday.
With at least 1,506,853 infections, including 140,260 deaths, Europe is the hardest-hit continent. Across the world, 3,350,224 cases and 238,334 deaths have been recorded.
Spain, with 215,216 cases and 24,824 deaths, Italy with 207,428 cases and 28,236 deaths, Britain (177,454 and 27,510), France (167,346 and 24,594) and Germany (161,703 and 6,575) are the five European countries with official tolls over 150,000.
The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only the most serious cases.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WINNIPEG -- People in some provinces will enjoy more freedom Monday as restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are loosened. But the change appears set to leave some workers looking for child care, some employers looking for workers, and many people trying to figure out a new regimen for going about their daily routine.
Manitoba is allowing many non-essential businesses, restaurant patios, museums, campgrounds and other facilities to reopen in one of the more aggressive restart-the-economy plans. At all venues, there will be rules in place to limit crowd gatherings and keep things sanitary in order to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Businesses that had been forced to close because of the pandemic learned last Wednesday, with just a few days notice, that they will be allowed to open at reduced capacity and with strict requirements for physical distancing between customers, hand sanitizer dispensers and more.
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said some of its members are worried their employees may not come back right away for a variety of reasons, such as fear of catching COVID-19 or because they cannot find child care with Manitoba's schools still closed.
"There's definitely going to be quite a few staff that are staying home and employers that are going to be having staff shortages," Jonathan Alward, the federation's director in Manitoba, said.
Some hair salons have said they will not open immediately because they need time to acquire enough hand sanitizer, masks and other gear. A small clothing boutique posted on social media that it was scrambling to find a way to ensure customer and worker safety in the narrow floor space.
There are also new rules at Manitoba campgrounds opening this week. One is that campers can use washrooms and outhouses, but they'll have to bring their own toilet paper from home.
Manitoba's conservation and climate minister, Sarah Guillemard, said there will be signage at park entrances to remind people of the rules, which also include 10-person limits on gatherings and a requirement to fill up at gas stations close to home instead of near the camp site.
"Social media will also be updated to help remind people, before they leave their home community, what they would do to prepare to go and enjoy the great outdoors," Guillemard said Friday.
Alberta started allowing golf courses to reopen on the weekend, and has told dentists, physiotherapists and other medical professionals they can start operating again Monday. Non-essential retail stores will begin to open May 14.
The Saskatchewan government is allowing dentists, optometrists and other medical providers to restart Monday, and is also opening fishing shoreline areas and boat launches.
Quebec is letting retail stores outside the Montreal area reopen Monday. Those in the Montreal area will have the right to operate a week later.
Ontario announced Friday that it would allow some largely outdoor-based businesses and workplaces to open up starting Monday, though with certain restrictions in place.
The province's reopening list includes garden centres for curbside pickup, lawn care and landscaping companies, auto dealerships by appointment, automatic and self-serve car washes, and a broad list of essential construction projects. Golf courses and marinas will be allowed to start to prep for the season, but not yet open to the public.
Back in Manitoba, restaurant patios will also be allowed to operate as of Monday, although at reduced capacity.
The province's chief public health officer said the aim of the province's reopening plan is not just about the economy -- it's also about letting people resume parts of their normal lives and connect with others while still protecting them from the spread of COVID-19.
"We need to still be cautious about this virus, but at the same time, we realize we have to start reopening things," Dr. Brent Roussin said at his daily briefing Friday.
"This virus isn't the only thing that affects people's health."

The Saskatchewan government is allowing dentists, optometrists and other medical providers to restart Monday, and is also opening fishing shoreline areas and boat launches.
Quebec is letting retail stores outside the Montreal area reopen Monday. Those in the Montreal area will have the right to operate a week later.
Ontario announced Friday that it would allow some largely outdoor-based businesses and workplaces to open up starting Monday, though with certain restrictions in place.
The province’s reopening list includes garden centres for curbside pickup, lawn care and landscaping companies, auto dealerships by appointment, automatic and self-serve car washes and a broad list of essential construction projects. Golf courses and marinas will be allowed to start to prep for the season, but not yet open to the public.
Back in Manitoba, restaurant patios will also be allowed to operate as of Monday, although at reduced capacity.
The province’s chief public health officer said the aim of the province’s reopening plan is not just about the economy – it’s also about letting people resume parts of their normal lives and connect with others while still protecting them from the spread of COVID-19.
“We need to still be cautious about this virus, but at the same time, we realize we have to start reopening things,” Dr. Brent Roussin said at his daily briefing Friday.
“This virus isn’t the only thing that affects people’s health.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WINNIPEG — People in some provinces will enjoy more freedom Monday as restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are loosened. But the change appears set to leave some workers looking for child care, some employers looking for workers, and many people trying to figure out a new regimen for going about their daily routine.
Manitoba is allowing many non-essential businesses, restaurant patios, museums, campgrounds and other facilities to reopen in one of the more aggressive restart-the-economy plans. At all venues, there will be rules in place to limit crowd gatherings and keep things sanitary in order to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Businesses that had been forced to close because of the pandemic learned last Wednesday, with just a few days notice, that they will be allowed to open at reduced capacity and with strict requirements for physical distancing between customers, hand sanitizer dispensers and more.
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said some of its members are worried their employees may not come back right away for a variety of reasons, such as fear of catching COVID-19 or because they cannot find child care with Manitoba’s schools still closed.
“There’s definitely going to be quite a few staff that are staying home and employers that are going to be having staff shortages,” Jonathan Alward, the federation’s director in Manitoba, said.
Some hair salons have said they will not open immediately because they need time to acquire enough hand sanitizer, masks and other gear. A small clothing boutique posted on social media that it was scrambling to find a way to ensure customer and worker safety in the narrow floor space.
There are also new rules at Manitoba campgrounds opening this week. One is that campers can use washrooms and outhouses, but they’ll have to bring their own toilet paper from home.
Manitoba’s conservation and climate minister, Sarah Guillemard, said there will be signage at park entrances to remind people of the rules, which also include 10-person limits on gatherings and a requirement to fill up at gas stations close to home instead of near the camp site.
“Social media will also be updated to help remind people, before they leave their home community, what they would do to prepare to go and enjoy the great outdoors,” Guillemard said Friday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most Australians think the COVID-19 situation will last for less than 12 months but a substantial number are plagued by a paralysing uncertainty, new research shows.
West Australian researchers from Edith Cowan University are conducting a major ongoing survey evaluating the impact of the pandemic situation on the Australian public.
Preliminary results reveal 68 per cent of respondents think the situation will last 12 months or less, with about six months being a frequent estimate.
Comparatively few respondents thought it would last for 1½ years (9 per cent), two years (3 per cent), or more than two years (2 per cent).
A substantial proportion, however, are reluctant to hazard even a guess, saying they are “very uncertain” (17 per cent).
Psychological wellbeing expert Shane Rogers, who is collaborating with health researcher Travis Cruickshank on the study, said this seemed to reflect a general level of optimism.
“In psychology it is well known that most people possess a general 'optimism bias'. This is not a bad thing. Rather, it is adaptive for us as it helps us get on with our lives,” he said.
“By making predictions about how long it will last, this helps people to set a marker for how long they have to endure things, and this can help people to cope, and provide them a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to. For example, thoughts such as 'OK, I only need to put up with this for 12 months or so, I can do that'.
“I don't want to give off the impression that people who think it will be over in 12 months are wrong or naive ... it very well could be that is the case ... nobody really knows as the situation is dynamic.”
But the high levels of uncertainty were causing many people stress, suggested responses, including the open-ended comments respondents provided when invited at the end of the 10-minute survey.
The survey has been running over the past few weeks, while Australia has been experiencing the strictest social distancing restrictions.
Now the restrictions are being eased somewhat, the researchers are keen to see whether this will be associated with an increase in optimism, and will monitor to see if there is a shift in sentiment on survey responses.
The survey is open to all Australians over 18. You can complete it here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Optimism bias' could help us get on with life despite pandemic: research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most Australians think the COVID-19 situation will last for less than 12 months but a substantial number are plagued by a paralysing uncertainty, new research shows.
West Australian researchers from Edith Cowan University are conducting a major ongoing survey evaluating the impact of the pandemic situation on the Australian public.
Preliminary results reveal 68 per cent of respondents think the situation will last 12 months or less, with about six months being a frequent estimate.
Comparatively few respondents thought it would last for 1½ years (9 per cent), two years (3 per cent), or more than two years (2 per cent).
A substantial proportion, however, are reluctant to hazard even a guess, saying they are “very uncertain” (17 per cent).
Psychological wellbeing expert Shane Rogers, who is collaborating with health researcher Travis Cruickshank on the study, said this seemed to reflect a general level of optimism.
“In psychology it is well known that most people possess a general 'optimism bias'. This is not a bad thing. Rather, it is adaptive for us as it helps us get on with our lives,” he said.
“By making predictions about how long it will last, this helps people to set a marker for how long they have to endure things, and this can help people to cope, and provide them a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to. For example, thoughts such as 'OK, I only need to put up with this for 12 months or so, I can do that'.
“I don't want to give off the impression that people who think it will be over in 12 months are wrong or naive ... it very well could be that is the case ... nobody really knows as the situation is dynamic.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The cold snap affecting much of Queensland is expected to hang around for another morning or two, with the mercury predicted to sink close to or even below freezing in some parts on Monday.
The Sunshine Coast was seven degrees below the May average overnight while the Wide Bay region experienced conditions from 7 to 10 degrees below average.
Thangool on the Capricornia coast, about 120 kilometres south of Rockhampton, was the coolest spot in the state overnight, at just 3.6 degrees.
On Saturday morning, the temperature in Oakey, west of Toowoomba, had fallen to minus 0.4 degrees and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, broke the freezing barrier with minus 0.1.
Weather bureau senior meteorologist Gabriel Branescu said the weather should warm up from Tuesday and Wednesday in coastal areas.
He said inland parts should get relief from Thursday to Saturday but not before a return to possible freezing temperatures near Stanthorpe and the Darling Downs on Monday.
"We have a slow-moving high-pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directing the really dry and cool air mass directly across the state," he said.
“Temperatures will start to moderate from Tuesday and Wednesday next week as the winds will tend more easterly and bring in more moisture from the ocean.
"We’re expecting the minimum temperatures to stay about 13 or 14 degrees in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, around 11 or 12 degrees in the Gold Coast area.
"Cool temperatures will remain inland for another two or three mornings until the warmer and more moist air mass will make its way to the Northern Territory border later next week."
During the early hours of Sunday, Kingaroy, in the Wide Bay and Burnett region, hit a low of 4 degrees while Gayndah and Maryborough reached 5.6.
In the south-eastern corner, Greenbank in Logan recorded just 5.9 degrees overnight, Beaudesert experienced 6.8 and the Sunshine Coast Airport dropped to 7.
In the Darling Downs and Granite Belt, Applethorpe recorded 7.7 degrees, Dalby hit 6, Miles got to 7.3 and Oakey reached 6.9.
Across the state's centre, Roma, Charleville and Rolleston Airport had a low of 5.2 degrees, Blackall experienced 5.7, Hughenden dropped to 6.6 and Richmond recorded 6.9.
Meanwhile, Woolshed in north Queensland recorded 8.3 degrees and the Mackay Racecourse on the central Queensland coast dropped to 8.2 overnight.
Mr Branescu said Monday would bring another chilly start to the day.
"Cooler temperatures are here to stay for a few more nights, especially on Monday morning, we expect temperatures to drop even below zero around the Stanthorpe and Darling Downs area … where the minimum temperatures can drop to minus one", he said.
"Roma may also see temperatures dropping to near zero. So large areas of frost in the Darling Downs, Maranoa and Warrego for another morning or two."

    <h5 class="mb-1">From fish to rat: how early humans' tastes changed on long trip to Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When early humans arrived in south-east Asia tens of thousands of years ago, they were mostly eating fish. Research has found they quickly learned to love rat.
Australian researchers working in the Indonesian region have discovered that ancient humans were mostly eating fish and other marine-based food as they travelled through the region more than 45,000 years ago.
Griffith University Associate Professor Julien Louys said by about 20,000 years ago, many of the humans who had settled into the region had transitioned to a mostly land-based diet.
“It indicates that humans are incredibly flexible, ecologically, that’s one of the defining traits of humanity,” the palaeontologist said.
“That allowed these people to move very rapidly through these islands on their way to Australia, basically, but also they were able to subsist on these islands once they became established.”
It has been previously revealed ancient humans living on islands in the Indonesian archipelago, including Flores, Timor and Alor, hunted local game, including giant rats and a miniature species of the elephant-like stegodon.
Professor Louys said her team used carbon-dating analysis to discover people only started to eat those animals in large numbers from 20,000 years ago onwards.
“This is the first direct evidence we have of what they were doing,” he said.
“The chemicals in their teeth show us that when they first got there, they were using marine resources, and it was only later that they started to diversify into other resources available on the islands.”
Such evidence shows how adaptable early humans were, as many of the islands in the region have been surrounded by water for the past 2 million years, and have always required water crossing for humans to reach them.
Professor Louys said the fact Homo sapiens adapted to different climates and resources while others did not, showed why humans spread so quickly across the globe.
“The results of this study support the idea that a distinguishing characteristic of Homo sapiens is high ecological flexibility, compared to other hominins from the same region,” he said.
“Compare that to things like the “hobbit” [Homo floresiensis] or Homo luzonensis, these small-body hominins that are found only on some of these islands.
“They didn’t seem to be able to get as far as humans did, and the data seems to suggest the reason for that is they couldn’t exploit marine resources like modern humans could.”
The work being done by Professor Louys and the team, which also includes researchers from the Max Planck Institute and Indonesia’s Universitas Gadjah Mada, is part of a major push by palaeontologists around the world to investigate the south-east Asia and Oceania regions, which are only now being explored extensively by scientists.
“There’s still so much to be discovered. Within these island chains there’s something like 17,000 different islands, and we've got archaeological records for around 10 of them,” he said.
“This region is completely unknown, so every time we put a hole in the ground we’re finding new stuff. So these discoveries will continue to be made.”
The latest findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From fish to rat: how early humans' tastes changed on long trip to Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When early humans arrived in south-east Asia tens of thousands of years ago, they were mostly eating fish. Research has found they quickly learned to love rat.
Australian researchers working in the Indonesian region have discovered that ancient humans were mostly eating fish and other marine-based food as they travelled through the region more than 45,000 years ago.
Griffith University Associate Professor Julien Louys said by about 20,000 years ago, many of the humans who had settled into the region had transitioned to a mostly land-based diet.
“It indicates that humans are incredibly flexible, ecologically, that’s one of the defining traits of humanity,” the palaeontologist said.
“That allowed these people to move very rapidly through these islands on their way to Australia, basically, but also they were able to subsist on these islands once they became established.”
It has been previously revealed ancient humans living on islands in the Indonesian archipelago, including Flores, Timor and Alor, hunted local game, including giant rats and a miniature species of the elephant-like stegodon.
Professor Louys said her team used carbon-dating analysis to discover people only started to eat those animals in large numbers from 20,000 years ago onwards.
“This is the first direct evidence we have of what they were doing,” he said.
“The chemicals in their teeth show us that when they first got there, they were using marine resources, and it was only later that they started to diversify into other resources available on the islands.”
Such evidence shows how adaptable early humans were, as many of the islands in the region have been surrounded by water for the past 2 million years, and have always required water crossing for humans to reach them.
Professor Louys said the fact Homo sapiens adapted to different climates and resources while others did not, showed why humans spread so quickly across the globe.
“The results of this study support the idea that a distinguishing characteristic of Homo sapiens is high ecological flexibility, compared to other hominins from the same region,” he said.
“Compare that to things like the “hobbit” [Homo floresiensis] or Homo luzonensis, these small-body hominins that are found only on some of these islands.
“They didn’t seem to be able to get as far as humans did, and the data seems to suggest the reason for that is they couldn’t exploit marine resources like modern humans could.”
The work being done by Professor Louys and the team, which also includes researchers from the Max Planck Institute and Indonesia’s Universitas Gadjah Mada, is part of a major push by palaeontologists around the world to investigate the south-east Asia and Oceania regions, which are only now being explored extensively by scientists.
“There’s still so much to be discovered. Within these island chains there’s something like 17,000 different islands, and we've got archaeological records for around 10 of them,” he said.
“This region is completely unknown, so every time we put a hole in the ground we’re finding new stuff. So these discoveries will continue to be made.”
The latest findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus daily tests drop far below Government's 100,000 target</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Daily tests in the UK for coronavirus have dropped back below the Government’s 100,000 target.
In total 76,496 tests were carried out in the 24 hours prior to 9am this morning.
The number fell due to a ‘weekend dip’, according to national medical director of England Dr Stephen Powis.
He said: ‘You will see that testing capacity has ramped up very quickly over the last week or so and we are now at a very high level of testing.
‘Over 100,000, a little bit of a dip in the weekend but we anticipate that that testing capacity will continue to increase. It’s a very important component of our approach going forward.’
Michael Gove, who was leading the daily coronavirus press conference this afternoon, reiterated there had been a drop in tests due to a weekend dip.
He stated there had been more than 1,206,405 coronavirus tests in total carried out in the UK as of 9am on Sunday.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also confirmed the UK death toll had risen to 28,446.
He noted that 14,248 people are currently being treated in hospital, compared to 14,695 recorded on Saturday.
The rise in death toll comes after 358 more people died in hospitals across the country.
England recorded another 327 deaths in hospitals, Wales another 14, Scotland 12, and Northern Ireland another five.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You can watch livestreams of puppies being their adorable selves</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lockdown is tough.
It feels quite a lot like Groundhog Day as all of the days blur into one.
But, of course, staying at home means we are doing our bit to slow the spread of coronavirus.
And if you're Netflixed-out and looking for some light relief, we may have found it.
Because online you can find adorable online streams of a puppies.
They are in the USA, so the time difference means it's best to log in later in the day when they're awake and enjoying themselves.
One streams live from Maryland, USA of the pooches from Warrior Canine Connection (WCC).
Those behind it say: "WCC’s programme not only creates valuable service dogs, it harnesses the healing power of the warrior ethos and the human-animal bond.
"The program is designed to trigger powerful mind/body effects in our warrior trainers that reduce the symptoms of combat trauma."
And the adorable puppies from the programme are seen play-fighting and using their very own swing.
WCC say the puppies come out into the playroom during the day starting when they’re about four weeks old.
They add: "Here they will be socialised with the help of staff and volunteers as well as US military service members and their families."
And if that's not enough, there is another super-cute livestream from the Guide Dogs of America Nursery.
They say: "These German Shepherd pups were born on March 6. There are five girls and one boy.
"The pups are in training to become guide dogs for people who are visually impaired. Their first eight weeks are so crucial in their training. From the day they are born they entered into an early socialisation program that will introduce them to different sights, sounds, and feels in the world.
"The hope is that when they grow up they will help someone who is blind live with more confidence, independence, and mobility.
They add: "Don't see puppies? Don't worry, the puppies are just live on another camera. Because puppies have such fragile immune systems, we swap them between kennel runs every day to allow for a 24-hour disinfection to take place.
"For this reason we have two camera's installed, the 'Nursery cam,' and the 'Mobility Cam.'"
There are loads more livestreams including African animals, horses, birds, and cats so you can easily lose a few hours on explore.org/livecams.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest news on the COVID-19 global pandemic (all times Eastern):
3:55 p.m.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says British Columbia can't follow the same pandemic response plans as other jurisdictions like Sweden and New Zealand because of its proximity to the United States.
Over the course of the pandemic, Henry says the dramatic increases in COVID-19 infections across the border, especially in Washington state, "dramatically" affected how B.C. has responded.
She says B.C. must continue to be thoughtful in how it reopens the economy and details of the plan will be released next week.
The province recorded 26 news cases today, bringing the total to 2,171.

2:40 p.m.
Nova Scotia is reporting two more deaths related to COVID-19 at the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax.
That brings the death toll in the province to 31.
Of the 323 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, 202 are at Northwood, the largest non-profit care home in Atlantic Canada.
Four new cases have been reported in the province, bringing the total to 963.
Of those, 609 have recovered.

1:25 p.m.
Newfoundland and Labrador has no new cases of COVID-19 today.
The case count remains at 259.
Of the 259 cases, 241 are in the Eastern Health area, which includes St. John's.
There are just 18 cases in the rest of the province.

1:20 p.m.
New Brunswick says all people in the province who were with sick with COVID-19 have recovered as of today.
It has now been two weeks since the province reported fresh COVID-19 cases.
It says all 118 people who had the virus are now testing negative.
Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that despite the positive milestone, she is urging the province's citizens to continue practising physical distancing and to stay home as much as possible.

1:15 p.m.
Quebec is reporting 114 new deaths linked to COVID-19 today, bringing the death toll to 2,136.
The province's Health Department says in a statement that an additional 1,008 confirmed cases have been reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the number of those infected to 29,656.
Of those cases, 1,738 have required hospitalization, with 222 people in intensive care.
Quebec has announced plans to gradually reopen daycares, elementary schools, retail businesses, construction and manufacturing gradually during the month of May.
Authorities are staggering opening dates between the rest of the province and greater Montreal, which has been heavily hit by COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The province also wants to ramp up testing to 14,000 tests per day in anticipation of the gradual resumption of activities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Iran reports lowest virus infections since March 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Iran said Saturday there was a "clear drop" in the number of new coronavirus infections as it reported 802 fresh cases, the lowest daily count since March 10.
The new cases brought to 96,448 the number recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.
"This shows a clear drop in the number of new infections compared to recent weeks, despite our active testing," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.
He added that 77,350 of those hospitalised have since been discharged, claiming it is a "one of the highest recovery percentages in the world."
New deaths from COVID-19 rose slightly to 65 in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 6,156, Jahanpour said.
Doubts have been cast over Iran's coronavirus figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.
Iran's deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi warned that the fall in the number of infections could quickly reverse.
"I emphasise that this steady decline is fragile," said Harirchi, who has himself recovered from COVID-19.
"Carelessness in gatherings, reopening (businesses) and observing health protocols can make the country face serious problems again."
He also called on the government to increase health sector spending, which he said had been hit by fiscal pressures resulting from sweeping US sanctions and the global economic contraction sparked by the coronavirus.
Iran has tried to contain the spread of the virus by shutting schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces since March.
But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, and authorities are now mulling allowing sports, cultural and religious centres too.
Tehran authorities, who have kept public transportation running despite warnings from health experts, made it mandatory for passengers to wear masks as of Saturday.
The virus has not spared public figures, with at least 12 current or former government officials or lawmakers dead and more infected.
One of the most senior -- parliament speaker Ali Larijani -- made his first public appearance in a month on Saturday, donning a protetive mask to attend a televised meeting alongside the president and the head of the judiciary.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Iran reports lowest coronavirus infections since March 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Iran said on Saturday there was a "clear drop" in the number of new coronavirus infections as it reported 802 fresh cases, the lowest daily count since March 10.
The new cases brought to 96,448 the number recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.
"This shows a clear drop in the number of new infections compared to recent weeks, despite our active testing," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.
He added that 77,350 of those hospitalised have since been discharged, claiming it is a "one of the highest recovery percentages in the world."
New deaths from COVID-19 rose slightly to 65 in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 6,156, Jahanpour said.
Doubts have been cast over Iran's coronavirus figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.
Iran's deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi warned that the fall in the number of infections could quickly reverse.
"I emphasise that this steady decline is fragile," said Harirchi, who has himself recovered from COVID-19.
"Carelessness in gatherings, reopening (businesses) and observing health protocols can make the country face serious problems again."
He also called on the government to increase health sector spending, which he said had been hit by fiscal pressures resulting from sweeping US sanctions and the global economic contraction sparked by the coronavirus.
Iran has tried to contain the spread of the virus by shutting schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces since March.
But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, and authorities are now mulling allowing sports, cultural and religious centres too. Tehran authorities, who have kept public transportation running despite warnings from health experts, made it mandatory for passengers to wear masks as of Saturday.
The virus has not spared public figures, with at least 12 current or former government officials or lawmakers dead and more infected.
One of the most senior -- parliament speaker Ali Larijani -- made his first public appearance in a month on Saturday, donning a protetive mask to attend a televised meeting alongside the president and the head of the judiciary.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US issues emergency approval for remdesivir for COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (AFP) - The experimental drug remdesivir has been authorized by US regulators for emergency use against COVID-19, President Donald Trump announced Friday.
It comes after the antiviral made by Gilead Sciences was shown in a major clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some coronavirus patients, the first time any medicine has had a proven benefit against the disease.
"It is really a really promising situation," Trump said at the White House, where he was joined by Gilead s CEO Daniel O Day.
"We are humbled with this first step for hospitalized patients," said O Day, adding: "We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of these patients getting the medicine."
The company has previously announced it was donating some 1.5 million doses for free.
This amounts to about 140,000 treatment courses based on a 10-day treatment duration.
Remdesivir, which is administered by an injection, was already available to some patients who enrolled in clinical trials, or who sought it out on a "compassionate use" basis.
The new move allows it to be distributed far more widely and used in both adults and children who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19.
The Food and Drug Administration, which authorized the approval, defines severe as having low blood oxygen levels, requiring oxygen therapy, or being on a ventilator.
The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced the results of a trial involving more than 1,000 people on Wednesday.
It found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress got better quicker than those on a placebo.
Specifically, patients on the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery.
"Although the results were clearly positive from a statistically significant standpoint, they were modest," Anthony Fauci, the scientist who leads the NIAID told NBC News on Thursday.
While not considered a miracle cure, remdesivir s trial achieved a "proof of concept," according to Fauci that could pave the way for better treatments.
Remdesivir incorporates itself into the virus s genome, short circuiting its replication process.
It was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever, but did not boost survival rates as other medicines.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Medics have deployed a robot in a Tunisian hospital caring for patients who contracted the novel coronavirus to limit contact between staff and infected patients, in a first for the North African country.
The tall, single-limbed machine is mounted on wheels and is capable of taking pulses and checking temperatures and blood oxygen levels.
It enables nurses, doctors and patients' relatives to make virtual bedside visits.
The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse
"It allows a reduction in contact with the sick and therefore the risk of contaminating personnel," said Nawel Besbes Chaouch, a doctor leading the pulmonary department at the Abderrahmane Memmi hospital in Ariana, near the capital Tunis, AFP reported.
A screen mounted at the top of the robot enables audiovisual communication with patients, who in turn can see and recognise the faces of those caring for them -- an impossibility when medics otherwise have to use full protective gear.
Also, a website allows families to reserve a time slot for a virtual visit, where the robot is remote-controlled into the patient's room to allow a video conversation.

The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse.

    <h5 class="mb-1">One new COVID-19 case in Queensland, almost 95 per cent of patients recovered</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queensland has one new novel coronavirus case on Sunday, taking the state total to 1035 and this week's figure to six, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has confirmed.
However, Health Minister Steven Miles said health authorities were unsure how the new patient, who lives in Brisbane's south, contracted the virus, with contact tracers working to track the source.
"It is not as straight forward as some of the others … obviously we update that [Queensland Health] table with a source of infection every day and we hope that tomorrow [Monday] when we update it, we will have a source of infection [for this patient]," Mr Miles said on Sunday.
In that updated total of 1035 cases, 976 of those patients have recovered, meaning Queensland's COVID-19 recovery rate sat at 94.3 per cent on Sunday.
Nine Queenslanders remained in hospital with the novel coronavirus, all in the state's south-east, with four of those in intensive care units.
Ms Palaszczuk posted on Twitter that 115,598 novel coronavirus tests had been conducted since the pandemic reached Queensland and the state's death toll remained at six.
On Saturday, the first day of eased COVID-19 movement restrictions, Queensland police handed out 32 fines for breaching the health regulations.
As of 11.59pm on Friday, Queenslanders could go for a drive, a recreational ride on their motorbike, jet ski or boat, have a picnic, visit an open national park, and shop for non-essential items.
Activities must be done within a 50-kilometre radius of home. The outings were limited to members of the same household or an individual and one friend, and social distancing must be maintained.
There was also one new COVID-19 case confirmed in the state on Saturday, which it came with an urgent health warning for Qantas flight QF614 from Melbourne to Brisbane on April 22.
An infected traveller was on that flight, so Queensland Health authorities were urgently tracing people in rows 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23. Those passengers should contact 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) immediately.
"That Qantas flight was some time ago, so the level of concern is mitigated by the fact that that time has passed without necessarily seeing those cases from it," Mr Miles said on Sunday.
"We can run down every single lead. We can chase down every potential contact ... People on that flight should not be unnecessarily concerned."
Meanwhile, Mr Miles announced on Sunday that Queensland Health had purchased an extra 35 anaesthetic machines to continue to expand the state's ICU capacity.
"We ordered these machines as part of our surge planning when we were planning for the worst … when we thought Brisbane and Queensland could look like New York City does today," he said.
"We are incredibly fortunate that it doesn’t, but we are going to continue that planning."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'India's COVID-19 mortality rate lowest in world' : everything you should know</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Even as cases in the world's largest democracy cross 40,000, Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said that India's COVID-19 mortality rate of 3.2 per cent is the lowest in the world.
"Today more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients have been discharged. Those still admitted at hospitals are on the road to recovery. If in last 14 days doubling rate was 10.5 days, then today it is around 12 days," the Minister told ANI after visiting Lady Hardinge Hospital.
The deaths recorded have crossed 1,300 as of Sunday. 
Helicopters showered masked health workers with rose petals and jets roared across the skies as India's military paid tribute to frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.
In one of the first of several gestures on Sunday, petals fell on to the upturned faces of medical personnel clad in protective gear as an army band played patriotic tunes including "Jai Ho" (May victory prevail) from the popular Slumdog Millionaire film.
In several states and territories, fighter jets and transport aircraft in formations took part in low-flying aerial salutes to thank the country's so-called "corona warriors".
"The entire nation stands united in these challenging times," Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted Sunday as he praised the "commendable work" of the "frontline warriors", including police which have been enforcing the nationwide virus lockdown in place since late March.
The navy will light up its ships off the sub-continent's shores when night falls as part of the tributes.
The performances were the third public show of gratitude to health and other frontline workers, after Indians took part in nationwide clapping and lamp lighting efforts led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on previous Sundays.
The lockdown was extended for another two weeks, ending on May 17 by the government on Friday, although some restrictions were lifted in regions that have lower numbers of virus cases.
Registrations for stranded citizens have started with Indian missions, From the UAE alone, more than 150,000 people have registered on through the Indian consulate's website. Norka, a platform for non-resident Keralites, also opened registrations, bringing over 390,000 applications from Keralites stranded across the world.
With the country-wide lockdown in place until May 17, the plan, process and dates are still unclear and there are only initial announcements of repatriation plans to the country.
Reports from India said the central government is preparing a mega plan for the evacuation and repatriation of Indians from Gulf countries with Indian Air Force planes and Indian Navy warships being readied along with assistance from commercial airlines like Air India.
In view of the extension of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown by two weeks, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has announced new guidelines to be followed in the state.
According to the new guidelines, Sundays will be a closed day for everything including vehicle movement. Moreover, public transport, public gathering, cinema theatres, religious places, events, malls, liquor shops, bars, barbershops, beauty parlours, gyms and educational institutions will not be allowed to open across the State.
Government offices can function with 50 per cent attendance of group A and B employees and 33 per cent attendance in group C and D category staff. They can also provide non-essential services.
In the Green Zone, shops can be open between 7 am and 7.30 pm for six days of the week and taxi services can operate two passengers. Inter-district travel may be permitted for a maximum of two persons.
As per the norms of having no positive COVID-19 cases in the last 21 days, only Ernakulam district in Kerala has qualified to be in the Green Zone.
Speaking about the containment zones, the Chief Minister said the zone list can change as per the situation and the containment zones within Red Zones would have "full lockdown with no exemptions".
"With a new case being reported on Saturday, the status of Wayanad district has changed from Green Zone to Orange Zone. Wayanad was earlier in the Green Zone list declared by the Centre. With no coronavirus patients under treatment, Alappuzha and Thrissur districts have moved to Green Zone. Kannur and Kottayam are under Red Zone. All the other districts in the State are in Orange Zone," he said.
Meanwhile, two more cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Kerala on Saturday, one each from Wayanad and Kannur districts.
"There are 499 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Kerala and 96 patients are under treatment in different districts in the State," the Chief Minister said.
To contain coronavirus effectively, the government has demarcated the country into three zones -- red, orange and green. There are more coronavirus cases in western region than the eastern region.
There are more red zones in prosperous states, like Maharashtra, than states considerably less advanced, like Bihar and Odisha. The number of cases in metros, like Mumbai and Delhi, is more than smaller cities in the eastern region.
In Maharashtra, there are 14 red, 16 orange and 6 green zones. In Bihar, there are 5 red, 20 orange and 13 green zones. There are 130 red, 284 orange and 319 green zones in the country, according to the letter written by Health Secretary Preeti Sudan to the state secretaries on April 30.
Explaining these zones, the government said the green zones comprised districts with either zero confirmed case or no confirmed case in the last 21 days. The classification of districts as red zones takes into account number of active cases, doubling rate of confirmed cases, extent of testing and surveillance feedback from there. The districts, which are neither defined as red nor green, are classified as orange zones.
As of 8am on May 3, Maharashtra reported 12,296 coronavirus cases and 521 fatalities. Bihar had 481 cases and 4 deaths; and Odisha 157 cases and one death, according to the Health Ministry.
Among the the other western states, Gujarat reported 5,054 cases and 262 deaths, followed by Rajasthan with 2,770 cases and 65 fatalities. In the eastern region, West Bengal reported 922 cases and 3 deaths, and UP 2,487 cases and 43 deaths.
Speaking to IANS, K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said, "The pattern reflects difference in economic development, indicated by the size of the international airports, number of international and domestic flights operating from those airports, foreign-returned travellers arriving and spreading out from there."
"Western India is more urbanised, with greater mobility of people with whom the virus hitch hikes to spread fast. Eastern India has lower foreign returnees to initiate the spread," Reddy said.
According to him, the rural India has less mobility. "This too has protected eastern parts. That's why the more urbanised western countries too have seen a rapid spread. Similar phenomenon in India has occurred," he said.
Dr Manoj Goel, Director (Pulmonology), at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, told IANS attributed this distribution of infection to the population density in different parts of India.
"India is a large country. It's like a subcontinent with over 17 per cent of the world population. So there is likely to be no uniformity in distribution of cases in the different regions," he said.
Stating that the densely populated places in the west are the worst hit, he said, "Dense population makes it difficult for the virus to contain as social distancing can be difficult to manage. The states with large number of immigrants from abroad could also been witnessing more Covid-19 cases."
The government has said the classification of districts into red, green and orange zones will be shared by the MoHFW with states and Union Territories on a weekly basis, or earlier, as required.
While states and UTs can include more districts in the red and orange zones, they may not lower the classification of a district included by the MoHFW.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Using photoacoustic imaging to visualize scarring in donor kidneys before transplant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When kidney transplants first came into practice in the 1950s, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) could finally picture freedom from the unrelenting routine of blood-cleansing dialysis treatments. Just over a half-century later, demand has completely outstripped supply. The critically ill languish for years on waiting lists, while doctors have little choice but to accept donations of damaged kidneys in a desperate attempt to save lives.
Transplant outcomes are so hard to predict that nephrologist Dr. Darren Yuen, of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, compares it to "spinning a roulette wheel". But recently published findings in JCI Insight are laying the groundwork to potentially revolutionize this dynamic - and empower physicians to eventually reset the gold standard in transplantation protocol.
The research is an integration of Yuen's clinical insights on kidney disease with the medical physics expertise of Ryerson University's Dr. Michael Kolios and Ph.D. candidate Eno Hysi, and their respective teams. Both Yuen and Kolios have labs at the Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Science, and Technology (iBEST), a unique collaboration between the hospital and university, bringing together experts from diverse and traditionally siloed research fields.
The team's new method is a world-first in applying photoacoustic (PA) imaging to visualize scarring in kidneys, also known as fibrosis, a common form of damage in donor kidneys. Their results produced clear images of kidney scarring just hours before surgery. During this window of opportunity, an accurate assessment could mean the difference between implanting an organ with decades-long durability - or one that quickly fails, sending a patient right back to dialysis and the years-long waitlist.
Needle biopsy - a painful procedure fraught with bleeding risk - is currently the only method to assess the amount of kidney scarring in prospective donors. But its reliability is hampered by potentially inaccurate estimates based on a tissue sample size of only 1% of the kidney.
The current research takes a quicker, non-invasive and more comprehensive route to quantify kidney damage, using PA imaging instead. The novel technology combines laser and ultrasound - a sequence that Hysi likens to lightning and thunder. "We shine light on kidney tissue, which creates a pressure wave that can be heard using an ultrasound probe."
The sound data is then run through a proprietary algorithm based on a technique called spectral unmixing.
Each kind of body tissue absorbs colored laser light in its own unique way. Collagen - one of the main components in kidney scarring - absorbs color in a manner that is distinct from other components in the kidney. Spectral unmixing teases out the differences. Maps generated by the technology show the amount and distribution of collagen, blood or other tissue - thus allowing physicians to 'see' the quality of donated kidneys.
When Hysi first proposed using spectral unmixing to hone in on collagen, nothing in prior medical physics knowledge hinted that the application was even possible.
Hysi persisted with a counterintuitive approach. With so many other biological substances exhibiting peaks and valleys once spectral unmixing is applied, collagen might stand out conspicuously by virtue of its own flatness.
The problem became so intriguing that Hysi decided to explore this possibility in parallel with his own doctoral research on cancer monitoring. Two years later, the findings validated his hypothesis, and the proprietary algorithms are now being patented.
In less than two minutes, the new technique can generate a 2D image with enough detail to quantify total scarring in a kidney. Within 15 minutes, 3D imaging allows visualization not only of overall scarring, but also its varied distribution throughout the kidney.
As the research moves into clinical trials at St. Michael's Hospital, Hysi and Yuen will assess how closely their predictions on kidney quality mirror actual outcomes in patients. If successful, their scoring method could have a significant impact on transplantation practice, and become the new gold standard in kidney assessment.
Healthcare systems could save the whopping $100,000 in direct, annual, per-patient costs to manage dialysis patients. But the greatest impact is in giving each patient the best possible kidney, keeping them off dialysis and giving them a new, durable lease on life.
Yuen sums up the two-year whirlwind of research: "I've never seen anything like this before. Clinicians and researchers working together, and discovering such great results in so short a time - it's just amazing."

    <h5 class="mb-1">How free taxi rides in Spain helped healthcare workers battle COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MADRID: In Madrid's deserted streets with paying customers scarce, taxi drivers running doctors from house-to-house or taking the sick to hospital have become an essential service, their free rides helping frontline medics fight the virus.
Although their role has been largely anonymous, healthcare staff say it has been essential as Spain has battled the worst of an epidemic that has killed close to 25,000 people.
In Madrid, by far the worst-hit area, more than 500 taxi drivers signed up to volunteer through the PideTaxi app, and they have run more than 100,000 free trips.
"I work on the days when I can, then if they need any help and I'm the closest, the app pings and off I go," says Gaby Saez, 45, who has spent the past six weeks behind the wheel since Spain imposed a strict national lockdown on Mar 14.
Despite the risks, he says he's not afraid, just ultra-careful, wearing a mask and gloves and scrupulously disinfecting his taxi after every single trip.
"At times like these, we all have to do our bit, even if what we can do is very limited."
ANONYMOUS BUT IMPORTANT ROLE
With taxi services made freely available to staff at 266 medical centres across the region, medics have been able to visit patients at home, easing pressure on primary healthcare services.
"Health centres request a taxi so they can make home visits to the elderly, to those needing treatment or people with COVID," says PideTaxi president Andres Veiga.
The idea was to reduce the number of people going to health centres to stop them picking up the virus or passing on the infection to medical staff.
"A taxi might do 10 or 20 visits a day with healthcare staff. Instead of patients going into the health centres, the doctors or nurses go to see them," he told AFP.
"Being able to take a taxi has made a big difference in stopping the spread of the virus, helping contain it and preventing medical staff from becoming infected."
EU health chiefs at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control say measures to prevent transmission in healthcare facilities "are an immediate priority".
This is particularly true in Spain which has suffered more than 215,000 cases, around 19 per cent involving healthcare workers, one of the highest reported percentages in the world.
"ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL"
Although epidemic peaked earlier this month, medics say the free taxis have made a huge difference.
"For me, it's been absolutely essential," says Sara del Carmen Vicente, a 23-year-old nurse at Madrid's October 12 hospital.
"They take you to people's homes, they wait outside then they take you to the next place. They're 100 per cent available, they're always there with a smile and they never give you any grief," she told AFP.
"They're always asking how we're doing, how we're coping emotionally, if things are improving and how the patients are doing.
"It's as if they were part of your family."
Footage of doctors and nurses hailing the taxis for their work have been widely shared on social media, one showing a driver in tears when staff began clapping as he entered a health centre.
For Saez, whose wife is also a taxi driver, seeing medical staff break down was tough.
"For me, these doctors and nurses are pretty much heroes so you try and calm them and offer some sort of shoulder to cry on," he says.
Voluntary work aside, few of Spain's 100,000 drivers are managing to actually work with movement severely restricted and and regional authorities capping the number of taxis out every day.
"Billing is down between 80 and 90 per cent," says Tito Alvarez of Elite Taxi Barcelona.
"When you do get the chance to work, you work well because there are hardly any taxis. But you don't cover you costs because you're only working five days a month."
Though money is tight, Saez says the worst thing is knowing that five colleagues have died of the virus.
"That really touches a nerve," he admits.
"But I feel very calm and I wouldn't even consider stopping volunteering or doing things like delivering masks or ventilator valves. Just seeing how grateful these people are is the greatest reward."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madagascar ships anti-virus herbal tea to Guinea-Bissau</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bissau, Guinea-Bissau | AFP |  Madagascar on Saturday delivered to Guinea-Bissau a shipment of a herbal tea that President Andry Rajoelina has touted as a powerful remedy against the novel coronavirus and hopes to distribute across West Africa and beyond.
Baptised Covid-Organics, the drink is derived from artemisia — a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment — and other indigenous herbs.
Guinea-Bissau’s self-proclaimed President Umaro Sissoco Embalo was at the airport to oversee reception of the cargo donated by Madagascar, AFP correspondents said.
After Equatorial Guinea on Thursday, Guinea-Bissau is the second country to take delivery of the potion that Madagascar claims cures COVID-19 patients within 10 days.
The World Health Organization has said that the herbal tea’s effects had not been tested, and there are no published scientific studies of the potion.
Embalo’s chief of staff Califa Soares Cassama told reporters that part of Saturday’s shipment was to be passed along to the other 14 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
Rajoelina had on Friday thanked Embalo for taking charge of the distribution in West Africa.
There was no indication of how Guinea-Bissau, poor even by African standards and chronically unstable politically, would handle the required logistics.
The country of 1.8 million has reported 200 coronavirus cases, including Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam and four other cabinet members, and one virus death.
Embalo has said that he will test the potion from Madagascar on leading government members, including the premier.
Equatorial Guinea meanwhile announced that it will distribute the potion to infected people in hospitals during two weeks and, in its preventative version, to everybody else.
Back in Madagascar, unarmed soldiers have been going door to door in the capital Antananarivo handing out Covid-Organics.
When launching the distribution last month, Rajoelina said two people had already been cured thanks to the potion, and added: “We can change the history of the entire world.”
There is currently no scientifically proven cure for coronavirus, which has killed more than 240,000 people worldwide according to official figures compiled by AFP.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blood pressure medicines don't raise COVID-19 risk, says research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON DC, USA – Commonly used blood pressure medicines do not heighten susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, or increase the risk of becoming seriously ill with the disease, three major studies said Friday, positive news for the millions of people who take them.
The research primarily concerned angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), which are also given to diabetes patients to help protect their kidneys.
ACE inhibitors include the likes of ramipril, lisinopril and other drugs ending in -pril; while ARBs include valsartan and losartan, and generally end in -sartan.
There had been concern arising from animal studies that these medicines might increase the body's levels of a protein called ACE2, which the coronavirus latches on to when it invades human cells, thus increasing people's vulnerability to the disease.
Confusing matters further, there were also contradictory animal studies that showed having more ACE2 proteins might lessen an inflammatory reaction in lungs to COVID-19, a beneficial effect.
The 3 new studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).
Each involved reviewing the records of thousands of people either on or not on the medicines and seeing if they got infected and how the disease progressed.
They then used statistical methods to control for other factors like underlying health conditions that might make people more susceptible to infection and to serious COVID-19.
"We saw no difference in the likelihood of a positive test with ACE inhibitors and with angiotensin receptor blockers," Harmony Reynolds of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who led one of the studies that involved about 12,600 people, told AFP.
The studies were "observational," meaning the researchers observed the effect of a risk factor.
This type of investigation is always considered weaker than "experimental" where an intervention is introduced along with a control, which leaves less to chance.
The authors of an accompanying editorial in the NEJM acknowledged this inherent limitation, but added: "We find it reassuring that 3 studies in different populations and with different designs arrive at the consistent message."
Reynolds said the findings were relieving, because she had been getting questions from worried patients who had read press reports and were asking if they should stop their medicines.
"I'm very happy to be able to tell patients that they should continue their blood pressure medications," she said.
This is especially important given that lockdown life itself appears to be causing high blood pressure, "maybe from stress or less exercise or eating differently," she added.
Mandeep Mehra, the medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Heart and Vascular Center who led another of the studies, said another fundamental question had been answered.
Early on in the pandemic, when it became clear that people with cardiovascular conditions were more likely to get severe COVID-19, scientists wondered: Was it heart disease that was the risk factor, or the medicine used to control it?
The new research settles the debate firmly in favor of the former, he said.
"It tells you beyond a shadow of a doubt that COVID-19 somehow interacts with the cardiovascular system in a pretty negative way," said Mehra.
Potential benefit?
Mehra's study, which looked at almost 9,000 patients across 11 countries, also tied the use of blood pressure medicines to a lower risk of death from COVID-19 – a finding not shared by the other two studies.
"The same drugs that appear to have life saving benefits in patients with cardiovascular illness also appear to show us a signal of benefit in patients who are in the throes of COVID-19," he said.
He added it was unclear why this was the case – whether it was because the medicines were helping the heart which in turn made it more resilient to the effects of the virus, or whether they were doing something else.
"What we can tell you is that, if you're on a statin or an ACE inhibitor, by golly, please continue it," added Mehra.
Nearly half of adults in the United States, or 108 million people, have hypertension, according to official figures. – Rappler.com

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Commonly used blood pressure medicines do not heighten susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, or increase the risk of becoming seriously ill with the disease, three major studies said Friday, positive news for the millions of people who take them.
The research primarily concerned angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), which are also given to diabetes patients to help protect their kidneys.

ACE inhibitors include the likes of ramipril, lisinopril and other drugs ending in -pril; while ARBs include valsartan and losartan, and generally end in -sartan.
There had been concern arising from animal studies that these medicines might increase the body's levels of a protein called ACE2, which the coronavirus latches on to when it invades human cells, thus increasing people's vulnerability to the disease.

Confusing matters further, there were also contradictory animal studies that showed having more ACE2 proteins might lessen an inflammatory reaction in lungs to COVID-19, a beneficial effect.
The three new studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).
Each involved reviewing the records of thousands of people either on or not on the medicines and seeing if they got infected and how the disease progressed.
They then used statistical methods to control for other factors like underlying health conditions that might make people more susceptible to infection and to serious COVID-19.
"We saw no difference in the likelihood of a positive test with ACE inhibitors and with angiotensin receptor blockers," Harmony Reynolds of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who led one of the studies that involved about 12,600 people, told AFP.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SHIMLA, INDIA -- A rare snow leopard captured as it savaged livestock in a remote village in the Indian Himalaya will be sent to a zoo instead of being released, officials said Sunday, triggering outrage from activists.
The endangered creature was found on Saturday after it became trapped inside a pen containing sheep and goats in Giu village near the Tibetan border in India's Himachal Pradesh state.
"The big cat was unable to escape from the enclosure after killing a few livestock," wildlife official Hardev Negi, who led the team that caught the snow leopard, told AFP.
"The shepherd contacted us and we captured the animal in a cage."
The state's chief wildlife official Savita Sharma told AFP the snow leopard was not being released since the incident involved "wild animal-human conflict," adding it would be transferred to a zoo in the foothills outside the state capital Shimla.
Officials estimated that the juvenile animal killed 43 sheep and goats in the pen over four days.
There are only 44 snow leopards living in the high passes and rugged valleys of Himachal Pradesh, according to Sharma.
Rajeshwar Negi, the National Convener of Nature Watch India said the decision was condemning the creature to a life without freedom.
"Don't they know how stressful it will be for the animal to be transported on a bumpy 350-kilometre long road," he told AFP.
"Does it mean the snow leopard will spend the rest of its life in a zoo instead of the Himalayan wilds?"
He added that the animal would also suffer in the higher temperatures at the zoo in Shimla, which is significantly warmer than its natural habitat.
As few as 4,000 of the mysterious animals could be left in the high mountains of central Asia -- their sole habitat -- according to the World Wildlife Fund.
Negi said snow leopards were being forced to move to lower altitudes and prey on domestic animals as the populations of their natural prey -- the ibex and blue sheep -- have been decimated by hunting.
Global warming is also threatening the survival of the big cat, with warmer temperatures pushing the tree line higher and prompting farmers to move further up the mountains to plant crops and graze livestock, encroaching on the snow leopards' territory.

"Does it mean the snow leopard will spend the rest of its life in a zoo instead of the Himalayan wilds?"
He added that the animal would also suffer in the higher temperatures at the zoo in Shimla, which is significantly warmer than its natural habitat.
As few as 4,000 of the mysterious animals could be left in the high mountains of central Asia -- their sole habitat -- according to the World Wildlife Fund.
Negi said snow leopards were being forced to move to lower altitudes and prey on domestic animals as the populations of their natural prey -- the ibex and blue sheep -- have been decimated by hunting.
Global warming is also threatening the survival of the big cat, with warmer temperatures pushing the tree line higher and prompting farmers to move further up the mountains to plant crops and graze livestock, encroaching on the snow leopards' territory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian officials capture rare snow leopard, send it to zoo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A rare snow leopard captured as it savaged livestock in a remote village in the Indian Himalaya will be sent to a zoo instead of being released, officials said Sunday, triggering outrage from activists.
The endangered creature was found on Saturday after it became trapped inside a pen containing sheep and goats in Giu village near the Tibetan border in India's Himachal Pradesh state.
"The big cat was unable to escape from the enclosure after killing a few livestock," wildlife official Hardev Negi, who led the team that caught the snow leopard, told AFP.
"The shepherd contacted us and we captured the animal in a cage."
The state's chief wildlife official Savita Sharma told AFP the snow leopard was not being released since the incident involved "wild animal-human conflict," adding it would be transferred to a zoo in the foothills outside the state capital Shimla.
Officials estimated that the juvenile animal killed 43 sheep and goats in the pen over four days.
There are only 44 snow leopards living in the high passes and rugged valleys of Himachal Pradesh, according to Sharma.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Robot helps Tunisia medics avoid infection from virus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Medics have deployed a robot in a Tunisian hospital caring for coronavirus victims to limit contact between staff and infected patients, in a first for the North African country.
The tall, single-limbed machine is mounted on wheels and is capable of taking pulses and checking temperatures and blood oxygen levels.
It enables nurses, doctors and patients’ relatives to make virtual bedside visits.
“It allows a reduction in contact with the sick and therefore the risk of contaminating personnel,” said Nawel Besbes Chaouch, a doctor leading the pulmonary department at the Abderrahmane Memmi hospital in Ariana, near the capital Tunis.
A screen mounted at the top of the robot enables audiovisual communication with patients, who in turn can see and recognise the faces of those caring for them — an impossibility when medics otherwise have to use full protective gear.
A website allows families to reserve a time slot for a virtual visit, where the robot is remote-controlled into the patient’s room to allow a video conversation.
The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A giant inflatable dinosaur has been spotted “waddling” the streets of Watford by delighted neighbours isolating in their homes.
Georgina Cooper, a 35-year-old mum, has been using her daily walk to entertain her community as their friendly local Tyrannosaurus-Rex.
Mrs Cooper, who has two sons aged one and five, said she bought the dinosaur costume from eBay “for fun” but after its popularity “spiralled out of control” she began collecting money for PPE in care homes during the coronavirus crisis.
She said she lost her severely disabled cousin Miriam, who the family only want known by her first name, after care home workers unwittingly brought the virus into her accommodation and she died after testing positive.
Mrs Cooper is unsure whether care home workers who provided 24 hour care for her cousin were equipped with PPE, although she noted the care homes where she has delivered donations have had “varied” levels of PPE.
“We would never point fingers at the carers or anything like that, they do an amazing job looking after our relatives. It’s just unfortunate,” she said.
“The dinosaur is filled with air so it’s got a little fan inside to keep it big,” she said.
“When it’s windy, it takes the head with it so you can’t see where you’re going and the head is flying around. You have to hold on to it.
“Also the legs are quite big so you can’t walk normally, I have to walk with my legs quite wide apart. It’s a little bit awkward.
“When I walk it has a big kind of waddle and the bottom sways and everyone laughs.
“They say the best bit is seeing it walk off because you can see it waddling down the road.”
“So many people come out on their doorstep, waiting and waving. It’s not just kids, it’s people of all ages who come out to see the dinosaur,” she said.
“It’s been really well received.
“There was one particular cul-de-sac that I went down which has lots of bungalows, and people were in wheelchairs and things like that outside their houses.
“It was so nice because they might not have seen anyone pass their house.
“It was really nice to have that sort of impact without even collecting any money for the PPE that I’ve been buying, just for people to be smiling and have something to brighten their day is really nice.”
Mrs Cooper collects donations on her travels, and via her fundraiser(https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/woodside-dinosaur)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant dinosaur delights neighbours during coronavirus lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Georgina Cooper, 35, has been using her daily walk to visit neighbours in a giant inflatable T-rex costume, while collecting money for care homes.
A giant inflatable dinosaur has been spotted “waddling” the streets of Watford by delighted neighbours isolating in their homes.
Georgina Cooper, a 35-year-old mum, has been using her daily walk to entertain her community as their friendly local Tyrannosaurus-Rex.
Mrs Cooper, who has two sons aged one and five, said she bought the dinosaur costume from eBay “for fun” but after its popularity “spiralled out of control” she began collecting money for PPE in care homes during the coronavirus crisis.
She said she lost her severely disabled cousin Miriam, who the family only want known by her first name, after care home workers unwittingly brought the virus into her accommodation and she died after testing positive.
Mrs Cooper is unsure whether care home workers who provided 24 hour care for her cousin were equipped with PPE, although she noted the care homes where she has delivered donations have had “varied” levels of PPE.
“We would never point fingers at the carers or anything like that, they do an amazing job looking after our relatives. It’s just unfortunate,” she said.
Mrs Cooper, now also known as Georgina the Woodside Dinosaur, has been using her daily walk to cheer up neighbours and collect donations to ensure carers are better protected from catching and spreading the virus.
“The dinosaur is filled with air so it’s got a little fan inside to keep it big,” she said.
“When it’s windy, it takes the head with it so you can’t see where you’re going and the head is flying around. You have to hold on to it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Most states fall short of coronavirus testing thresholds | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATLANTA >> As more states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, most are falling short of the minimum levels of testing suggested by the federal government and recommended by a variety of public health researchers, an Associated Press analysis has found.
Three months into an unprecedented public health emergency, the White House has largely resisted calls for a coordinated plan to conduct the millions of tests experts say are needed to contain the virus. What federal officials outlined recently isn’t even an official benchmark, and AP’s analysis found that a majority of states are not yet meeting it.
With no specific guidelines, states are left to figure out what a successful testing program should be while they simultaneously try to reopen their shattered economies. If states don’t have robust testing, public health experts say they will be unable to detect outbreaks quickly enough to contain them, which could lead to more shutdowns.
“It’s dangerous and irresponsible,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown University.
In many states, testing has been limited to hospitalized patients, high-risk individuals and front-line workers. But most public health experts agree that containing the virus will require a massive expansion of testing that eventually includes millions of patients without symptoms, which is not happening now.
A testing blueprint released Monday by the Trump administration lacked any metrics state officials could use to make informed decisions. Instead, the document made clear that states are responsible for testing, saying the federal government is the “supplier of last resort.”
The closest the White House has come to issuing a benchmark does not actually appear in the document. At a recent briefing, senior administration officials said the government would provide each state with enough tests, swabs and related materials to screen at least 2.6% of their populations in May and June. Those hit harder by the outbreak would be eligible for additional assistance.
It was unclear how the 2.6% figure was reached. When asked about it, officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services described it as 2% of state populations per month without explaining the discrepancy. Officials also did not respond to questions about whether the administration has a target for how many daily tests should be done nationwide or when it would issue more details.
Only about 40% of states currently meet even the 2% testing threshold, according to AP’s analysis. The percentage is expected to rise as states increase their testing capabilities. The AP based the monthly testing rate for each state on the average number of new daily tests over the most recent 7 days. The data is from the COVID Tracking Project and includes counts up to April 30th.
A White House spokesman said Friday that the administration’s testing threshold is only a suggestion and that states are ultimately responsible for deciding how to reopen in a “safe and responsible manner.” The administration says it is working to expand testing and has been highlighting plans first announced in March for additional testing sites at retail pharmacy chains.
States that do not meet the administration’s testing guidance, based on their current screening rates, include some that have been moving into the early stages of reopening, such as Colorado, South Carolina and Texas. Georgia, which has moved aggressively to ease restrictions and lift its stay-at-home order, is just under the 2% threshold.
Louisiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers have been putting pressure on Democratic governors to reopen, are falling short, according to the AP analysis. In Kansas, the governor and top health administrator expect to reach the 2% mark this month.
Florida, which announced its first phase of reopening will start next week, also falls short but has said it will be able to test 30,000 to 40,000 people a day if needed. Michigan, where the Republican-led legislature has sued the Democratic governor over the state’s stay-at-home order, is on track to test 2.2% of its population.
Former health officials and experts were critical of the testing blueprint and said the 2.6% or 2% population metric was too vague and didn’t take into account guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control on who should be tested.
“Why don’t they say, ‘We’ll test everybody with any symptoms of coronavirus and all their contacts?’” said Dr. James Curran, a former assistant U.S. surgeon general who worked at CDC for 25 years. “If that amounts to 2% that’s fine, but the guidelines are not to test 2%. The guidelines are to test who needs it.”
Many experts already say the national testing rate falls short of what is needed to safely ease social distancing guidelines.
Researchers at Harvard have calculated that the U.S. needs to be testing roughly 500,000 people per day before considering easing restrictions this month. That’s a nearly 150% increase from the recent daily tally of approximately 200,000 tests.
“I’ve described it and I still describe it as an absolute bare minimum,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
More than half of states are not testing their populations at the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues. The Harvard team developed their statistics in mid-April and noted that projections for U.S. cases have increased since then.
Many states hardest hit by the crisis failed to reach the team’s testing recommendations, even if they were already testing more than 2% of their populations, according to an AP analysis using state-by-state figures provided by Harvard. States falling short of the Harvard numbers include many of the epicenters of the outbreak, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Jha and his colleagues based their testing targets, in part, on the number of tests needed to screen enough people to push positive results below 10%, the level that the World Health Organization considers sufficient to contain the outbreak. More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.
Former CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.
Officials in at least 20 states have indicated their testing capacity is not adequate and said they are taking steps to address this, according to a review by the AP. But there is little consensus among states on how many people should be tested or whether that should include those with no symptoms.
Georgia, where in-person dining at restaurants is now permitted with restrictions, has not said how many people it would like to test but recently touted its ability to test over 20,000 people on a single day and has encouraged more people to get tested. New Jersey, which has a slightly smaller population and a higher number of COVID-19 cases, has said it would need to conduct 20,000 to 30,000 tests a day to reopen.
Ohio wants to increase testing from 7,200 per day to 22,000 by May 27. Washington state, which has seen one of the largest U.S. outbreaks, has reported averaging 4,650 tests a day and wants to do more than 22,000 but lacks the necessary supplies.
Most states have convened advisory panels to help in setting guidelines, but they run the gamut in terms of expertise and will result in a patchwork of policies that experts say may be ineffective in containing a virus that doesn’t respect state borders.
“Treading water on testing is not going to get us out of this,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola.

More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.
Former CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.
Officials in at least 20 states have indicated their testing capacity is not adequate and said they are taking steps to address this, according to a review by the AP. But there is little consensus among states on how many people should be tested or whether that should include those with no symptoms.
Georgia, where in-person dining at restaurants is now permitted with restrictions, has not said how many people it would like to test but recently touted its ability to test over 20,000 people on a single day and has encouraged more people to get tested. New Jersey, which has a slightly smaller population and a higher number of COVID-19 cases, has said it would need to conduct 20,000 to 30,000 tests a day to reopen.
Ohio wants to increase testing from 7,200 per day to 22,000 by May 27. Washington state, which has seen one of the largest U.S. outbreaks, has reported averaging 4,650 tests a day and wants to do more than 22,000 but lacks the necessary supplies.
Most states have convened advisory panels to help in setting guidelines, but they run the gamut in terms of expertise and will result in a patchwork of policies that experts say may be ineffective in containing a virus that doesn’t respect state borders.
“Treading water on testing is not going to get us out of this,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Analysis: Most states fall short of coronavirus testing thresholds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATLANTA — As more states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, most are falling short of the minimum levels of testing suggested by the federal government and recommended by a variety of public health researchers, an Associated Press analysis has found.
Three months into an unprecedented public health emergency, the White House has largely resisted calls for a coordinated plan to conduct the millions of tests experts say are needed to contain the virus. What federal officials outlined recently isn’t even an official benchmark, and AP’s analysis found that a majority of states are not yet meeting it.
With no specific guidelines, states are left to figure out what a successful testing program should be while they simultaneously try to reopen their shattered economies. If states don’t have robust testing, public health experts say they will be unable to detect outbreaks quickly enough to contain them, which could lead to more shutdowns.
“It’s dangerous and irresponsible,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown University.
In many states, testing has been limited to hospitalized patients, high-risk individuals and front-line workers. But most public health experts agree that containing the virus will require a massive expansion of testing that eventually includes millions of patients without symptoms, which is not happening now.
A testing blueprint released Monday by the Trump administration lacked any metrics state officials could use to make informed decisions. Instead, the document made clear that states are responsible for testing, saying the federal government is the “supplier of last resort.”
The closest the White House has come to issuing a benchmark does not actually appear in the document. At a recent briefing, senior administration officials said the government would provide each state with enough tests, swabs and related materials to screen at least 2.6% of their populations in May and June. Those hit harder by the outbreak would be eligible for additional assistance.
It was unclear how the 2.6% figure was reached. When asked about it, officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services described it as 2% of state populations per month without explaining the discrepancy. Officials also did not respond to questions about whether the administration has a target for how many daily tests should be done nationwide or when it would issue more details.
Only about 40% of states currently meet even the 2% testing threshold, according to AP’s analysis. The percentage is expected to rise as states increase their testing capabilities. The AP based the monthly testing rate for each state on the average number of new daily tests over the most recent 7 days. The data is from the COVID Tracking Project and includes counts up to April 30th.
A White House spokesman said Friday that the administration’s testing threshold is only a suggestion and that states are ultimately responsible for deciding how to reopen in a “safe and responsible manner.” The administration says it is working to expand testing and has been highlighting plans first announced in March for additional testing sites at retail pharmacy chains.
States that do not meet the administration’s testing guidance, based on their current screening rates, include some that have been moving into the early stages of reopening, such as Colorado, South Carolina and Texas. Georgia, which has moved aggressively to ease restrictions and lift its stay-at-home order, is just under the 2% threshold.
Louisiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers have been putting pressure on Democratic governors to reopen, are falling short, according to the AP analysis. In Kansas, the governor and top health administrator expect to reach the 2% mark this month.
Florida, which announced its first phase of reopening will start next week, also falls short but has said it will be able to test 30,000 to 40,000 people a day if needed. Michigan, where the Republican-led legislature has sued the Democratic governor over the state’s stay-at-home order, is on track to test 2.2% of its population.
Former health officials and experts were critical of the testing blueprint and said the 2.6% or 2% population metric was too vague and didn’t take into account guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control on who should be tested.
“Why don’t they say, ‘We’ll test everybody with any symptoms of coronavirus and all their contacts?’” said Dr. James Curran, a former assistant U.S. surgeon general who worked at CDC for 25 years. “If that amounts to 2% that’s fine, but the guidelines are not to test 2%. The guidelines are to test who needs it.”
Many experts already say the national testing rate falls short of what is needed to safely ease social distancing guidelines.
Researchers at Harvard have calculated that the U.S. needs to be testing roughly 500,000 people per day before considering easing restrictions this month. That’s a nearly 150% increase from the recent daily tally of approximately 200,000 tests.
“I’ve described it and I still describe it as an absolute bare minimum,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
More than half of states are not testing their populations at the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues. The Harvard team developed their statistics in mid-April and noted that projections for U.S. cases have increased since then.
Many states hardest hit by the crisis failed to reach the team’s testing recommendations, even if they were already testing more than 2% of their populations, according to an AP analysis using state-by-state figures provided by Harvard. States falling short of the Harvard numbers include many of the epicenters of the outbreak, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Jha and his colleagues based their testing targets, in part, on the number of tests needed to screen enough people to push positive results below 10%, the level that the World Health Organization considers sufficient to contain the outbreak. More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.
Former CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A potential treatment for Covid-19 using plasma from recovered patients is to be trialled by doctors at London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital.
The first donations of the plasma have been collected and transfusions will begin in “the coming weeks”, the hospital’s Biomedical Research Centre said in a statement.
It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.
The hospital says if the trials prove the treatment to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.
The trial is co-led by Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at the hospital, along with experts from NHS Blood and Transplant and the University of Cambridge.
“As a new disease, there are no proven drugs to treat critically ill patients with Covid-19. Providing critically ill patients with plasma from patients who have recovered… could improve their chances of recovery,” said Dr Shankar-Hari.
Health and Social Care secretary Matt Hancock said: “This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it.
“The UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.
“Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future.”
The BBC reported there was currently enough plasma to transfuse to 143 patients.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) - The president of Virginia Tech President says he is hopeful the school will be able to hold classes on campus this fall, but said no final decision will be made until next month.
The Roanoke Times reports that President Tim Sands told local government leaders during a call Friday that the fall “is an opportunity for us to bring the campus back to life to some degree” after the campus shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Sands said it is too early to predict what Tech’s fall semester would look like exactly, but he indicated the university aims to hold some in-person classes on campus.
“Maybe not every class, but some classes are going to have to be, I think, in parallel, online and in person, because we won’t have the ability, at least early in the fall, to have large classes with very high-density occupation,” Sands said.
“We don’t expect it to be exactly like it was, say, last fall,” he added, noting the likelihood of continued public health guidelines such as physical distancing.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan said he will be temporarily stepping back from the programme after developing a “mild” coronavirus symptom.
The programme will be hosted by ITV presenter Ben Shephard alongside Susanna Reid as Mr Morgan waits for his test results, which are due on Monday.
Mr Morgan said in a tweet: “On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in the past 48 hours, I’ve had a test for Covid-19 and so won’t be working on Good Morning Britain until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow.”
This week, Mr Morgan was cleared of breaching TV watchdog Ofcom’s rules after attracting more than 3,000 complaints over his “combative” questioning of care minister Helen Whately in two interviews.
During an animated interview, he asked Ms Whately for the number of health workers and care workers who had died from the illness.
She accused him of “shouting at me and not giving me a chance to answer your questions” and “attempting to score points”.
Mr Morgan defended his approach, saying it was not as “uncomfortable” as the conditions for the carers on the front line of the coronavirus crisis.
Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock on April 16, who accused him of constantly interrupting him.
Mr Morgan has also attracted positive publicity in recent weeks, as one of the famous faces taking on the 2.6 challenge which replaced the London Marathon, and raised money for struggling charities last Sunday.
A host of huge names, including Sir Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and David Haye went through a workout, led by Piers Morgan, in aid of the Ruth Strauss Foundation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How coronavirus lockdown looked in Wales this weekend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is now five weeks since Boris Johnson appeared in a televised address to announce that lockdown measures were being imposed and governments around the UK put social distancing rules in place.
Ever since, most people have adhered to them, with city centres largely deserted, though there have been plenty who have decided not to adhere to the rules. During the last weekend in April, people used parks in Cardiff for barbecues, as an outdoor gym and, at one point, even to ride horses and carts.
And through the last week, police have continued to report on further, though largely isolated, incidents — you can see some of the most ridiculous here.
But this weekend, people appear to have largely stuck to the rules, with few sightings of anyone breaching the rules and parks and streets mostly empty. However, police did need to deal with some incidents, including people travelling "totally unreasonable distances" because they were "bored" and a man who travelled from Merseyside to view a house in Newtown.
In Cardiff, the city centre was empty, as it has largely been for the last five weeks.
It was a similar picture in Cardiff Bay, where Saturday's warm weather would have seen crowds making the most of the bars, restaurants and ice cream parlours of Mermaid Quay, as well as walking along the barrage with their families.
And the parks, which in one area last weekend say people turn up in groups complete with horses and carts, were also largely empty.
Police in Neath found nothing to be concerned about during a walk through the town centre and canal path, saying: "All appears to be in order."
Police in Maesteg thanked "the fantastic people" who painted their window in recognition of the work of the country's key workers, and in Aberdare and Monmouthshire they seemed happy that lockdown was being observed.
Meanwhile, First Minister Mark Drakeford said today that it would be June at the earliest before schools reopened. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: “We’ve been clear that the next phase for schools will only start when it is safe to do so.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Real figures of COVID-19 hushed up: Congress leader</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy said that both the BJP government at the Centre and TRS government in the State were hand-in-glove to hush up the real statistics pertaining to COVID-19 infection.
After distributing sanitisers and masks in Secunderabad Assembly segment on Sunday, Mr. Narayana Reddy said that the State government was not conducting COVID-19 tests in adequate quantity only to avoid the increase in number of positive cases. “In order to see low figures, KCR government is actually trying to hide COVID-19 patients. Once the lockdown gets over, those untested and untreated patients will play havoc in the entire society,” he feared.
The Congress leader said that there were multiple cases of community transmission in Telangana and other parts of the country although we never acknowledged coronavirus entering the third stage. There were at least 22 COVID-19 positive cases in Telangana with no travel history. Instead of sounding an alert, the State government has simply entered into a denial mode, he claimed.
“Doctors for Seva”, an NGO, has pointed out not only the ‘under-testing for COVID-19 in Telangana, but also the under-reporting.
The Congress leader also alleged that the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) did not do its job properly and they did not seek any answers from the State government on real issues. Why the IMCT did did not question the State government on low percentage of testing? Why the Central Team was silent on open violation of ICMR guidelines which says that all pregnant women in containment areas or clusters should be tested, he asked.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eyes Clean Themselves in Much The Same Way Brains Do, Mouse Study Shows</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scientists have discovered that eyes and brains in rodents seem to have uncannily similar drainage systems used for self cleaning, and there's reason to think this might apply to us, too.
This sort of maintenance is necessary to wash away waste cells and fluids, and we know that brains make use of a tiny network of pipes known as the glymphatic system, similar to the lymphatic system that clears out rubbish from the rest of the body.
New tests on mice and rats show that the structures at the back of their eyes - like the optic nerve and the retina - take a page or two from the glymphatic system playbook. In the absence of the standard lymphatic vessels, they funnel waste products through a network a lot like the one the brain uses.
"Similar to the brain inside the cranial vault, the internal structures of the eye are contained within a confined space, necessitating tight control of fluid homeostasis," the researchers write in their paper.
"Our analysis provides the evidence for the existence of a highly polarised ocular clearance system that might have implications for our understanding of eye health and disease."
One of the key jobs of the brain's waste disposal system is to clear out the toxic amyloid beta proteins that have been associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease.
To see exactly how the eye disposes of similar waste, the researchers injected the eyes of lab mice with fluorescently labelled amyloid beta proteins. The subsequent tracing showed the shuttling of these proteins through specialised channels in the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual data back to the brain.
A few hours after the injection, traces of the labelled proteins were found much further afield, carried from the eye into lymph nodes inside the animal's neck as part of the body's typical garbage disposal process. Again, this matches the way the brain links up with the rest of the body.
While the brain's glymphatic system kicks in at night – which is why sleep is so important – the eye version of this cleaning system appears to be propelled into action when the iris moves in response to changing light.
It's important to note that the new research is based on mice and rats rather than humans, but these animals do have similar ocular setups to us, albeit on a more simplified level. Furthermore, the discovery of the glymphatic system in the human brain was also inspired by experiments on rats - boosting the chances that yet again, this isn't just a rodent thing.
As well as highlighting some interesting similarities between the way the eyes and the brain deal with waste, these findings could also help us understand more about eye diseases such as glaucoma.
The researchers suggest that damage to the eye's waste clearance system could be one of the causes behind the disease, where excess fluid is allowed to build up. A closer look at this newly found network should be able to tell us for sure, and perhaps hint at more effective treatments too.
"This represents only the starting point for further investigations on the impact of the ocular glymphatic system on the pathogenesis of several ocular diseases," physician Peter Wostyn from the Psychiatrisch Centrum Sint-Amandus in Belgium, who wasn't involved in the study, told Abby Olena at The Scientist.
The research has been published in Science Translational Medicine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nurse closing in on retirement dies with coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A nurse has died with coronavirus after spending nearly 40 years in the job.
Philomina Cherian, 63, died on April 30 at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where she also worked as a staff nurse.
Ms Cherian was married and had three children and, according to her family, she was planning to retire in a couple of years’ time.
“She was a great human being, a caring mother and wife,” her husband Joseph Varkey said.
“She was a dedicated nurse. For her, nursing was not just a profession but it was her passion.
“She would have lived for so many years and enjoyed her well-deserved retired life if she was not affected by Covid.”
A statement from Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) said of Ms Cherian: “She was a popular and hugely valued member of our OUH nursing family who will be sorely missed by her colleagues as well as by her family and friends.”
Sam Foster, chief nursing officer, said: “I wanted to express that at this very sad time our thoughts are with the family of Philomina, as well as with her friends and colleagues throughout the Trust.
“She was an incredibly caring friend and colleague who will be terribly missed by us all.
“Many of you will have known her and worked closely with her and I ask you to remember how she wonderfully cared for her patients and her colleagues, acting as an exemplar nurse to all who met her.
“Philomina was cared for with the utmost love, care and attention and we would like to thank all staff who were involved in her care.”
A fundraising page has been set up to help cover the costs of Ms Cherian’s memorial.

‘Many of you will have known her and worked closely with her and I ask you to remember how she wonderfully cared for her patients and her colleagues, acting as an exemplar nurse to all who met her. Philomina was cared for with the utmost love, care and attention’.
Her death has been announced after the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that another 621 Covid-associated deaths have been recorded.
Officials also recorded another 4,806 cases, with more than 180,000 Britons having now been infected since the crisis hit the UK in February. A lack of testing means potentially millions of cases have been missed
Daily surveillance figures released each day by DHSC are deaths across the UK where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. The deaths do not account for deaths outside of hospitals, and are not officially registered.
All figures are provided daily to NHS England by individual hospitals. The data are only published once the confirmed families have been notified of the deaths.
Weekly figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are Covid-registered deaths across England and Wales. They include any place of death.
Data comprise deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate. They may include cases where doctors completing a certificate diagnosed coronavirus in a patient based on relevant symptoms, but where no test occurred.
The figures include cases where a death certificate lists coronavirus (Covid-19) – either tested or suspected – as well as ‘Influenza and Pneumonia’.  Where both are present, Covid-19 is listed as the presumed or probable cause of death.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nurse closing in on retirement dies with coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Philomina Cherian died on April 30.
A nurse has died with coronavirus after spending nearly 40 years in the job.
Philomina Cherian, 63, died on April 30 at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where she also worked as a staff nurse.
Ms Cherian was married and had three children and, according to her family, she was planning to retire in a couple of years’ time.
“She was a great human being, a caring mother and wife,” her husband Joseph Varkey said.
“She was a dedicated nurse. For her, nursing was not just a profession but it was her passion.
“She would have lived for so many years and enjoyed her well-deserved retired life if she was not affected by Covid.”
Ms Cherian, originally from Kerala in India, worked as a nurse in Saudi Arabia before moving to the UK.
A statement from Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) said of Ms Cherian: “She was a popular and hugely valued member of our OUH nursing family who will be sorely missed by her colleagues as well as by her family and friends.”
Sam Foster, chief nursing officer, said: “I wanted to express that at this very sad time our thoughts are with the family of Philomina, as well as with her friends and colleagues throughout the Trust.
“She was an incredibly caring friend and colleague who will be terribly missed by us all.
“Many of you will have known her and worked closely with her and I ask you to remember how she wonderfully cared for her patients and her colleagues, acting as an exemplar nurse to all who met her.
“Philomina was cared for with the utmost love, care and attention and we would like to thank all staff who were involved in her care.”
A fundraising page has been set up to help cover the costs of Ms Cherian’s memorial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USFDA okays emergency use of Gilead drug for hospitalised Covid-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US food and drug regulatory body has allowed emergency use of an investigational anti-viral vaccine to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by an Indian-American physician, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
The FDA authorisation came after researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, reported Remdesivir shortened the recovery times in people who have fallen ill from the new coronavirus.
I'm pleased to announce that Gilead now has an EUA (emergency use authorisation) from the FDA for Remdesivir, US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Trump said that EUA is an important treatment for hospitalised coronavirus patients.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that this is a significant step forward in battling COVID-19.
The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

By Friday, over 63,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus and over one million have tested positive with COVID-19.
Trump said that his administration has been doing work with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.
I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time. For the first case, that was diagnosed in the United States to now, our first step forward with a therapeutic in less than 90 days, said Deborah Birx, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.
In a statement, Gilead said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe Covid-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.
Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe Covid-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.
Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted.

This EUA opens the way for us to provide emergency use of Remdesivir to more patients with severe symptoms of Covid-19, said Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences.
We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of Remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug's profile. We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility, he said.
According to Gilead, the EUA is based on available data from two global clinical trials the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases' placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, including those who were critically ill, and Gilead's global Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of Remdesivir in patients with severe disease.
Multiple additional clinical trials are ongoing to generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine as a treatment for Covid-19, it said.
Indian-American Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, is one of the lead investigators of the study.

Earlier in an interview to Fox news, Subramanian said that there's a lot more work to be done in terms of exactly who should get this drug, what is the best timing, who is at highest risk for having complications And what can we add to this or what can we improve upon this to make outcomes even better.
This (remdesivir) is a direct-acting antiviral. It has been shown to have great promise in the lab and in animal models and for the first time now in human clinical trials, Subramanian told Fox News.
We know that so far, it's been very safe and tolerable. We've had good clinical outcomes and yesterday we found that compared to placebo, that is people who are given no medication, people do much better, she said.
FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn said, today's action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub ‘are staying in the maternity den and are doing well’.
A giant panda loaned by China to a Dutch zoo as part of a breeding pair has given birth to a cub.
Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub “are staying in the maternity den and are doing well”.
The zoo said following Friday’s birth that it is “delighted and proud to contribute to the protection of this endangered species in a natural way”.
The new cub’s gender will not be known until it leaves the maternity den, likely in a few months’ time, with its mother.
Wu Wen and male panda Xing Ya arrived in the Netherlands from Sichuan province in 2017, as part of a loan programme. The zoo said the new cub also belongs to China and can remain in the Netherlands for four years before going to China to join the breeding programme there.
Around 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, the majority within China, while an estimated 1,864 live in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Solar, wind energy struggle as coronavirus takes toll</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) — The US renewable energy industry is reeling from the new coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed construction, put thousands of skilled labourers out of work and sowed doubts about solar and wind projects on the drawing board.
In locked-down California, some local agencies that issue permits for new work closed temporarily, and some solar companies furloughed installers.
In New York and New Jersey, SunPower CEO Thomas Werner halted installation of more than 400 residential solar systems, fearing for his workers' safety.
As many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost, trade groups say.
“There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “Up to half our jobs are at risk.”
Leaders are confident the future is bright. But the worldwide slowdown is delaying a transition to cleaner energy that scientists say is not happening quickly enough to curtail climate change.
Even as some states move toward reopening, executives fear diminished incomes and work disrupted by lay-offs and social distancing will do lasting damage.
The wind industry is plagued by slowdowns in obtaining parts from overseas, getting them to job sites and constructing new turbines.
“The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two,” said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. “That reversal is stunning and problematic.”
Residential solar business has been hit especially hard, Hopper said, with door-to-door sales no longer feasible and potential customers watching their wallets. Deals with commercial buyers also have slumped.
New solar installations could be 17 per cent lower worldwide than expected this year, and wind turbine manufacturing could fall up to 20 per cent, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
“Pre-pandemic, there were great dreams and aspirations for a record-setting year,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy, a utility-scale wind and solar developer. “I'm sure we're not going to have that.”
Fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal remain the leading providers of the nation's electricity, with nuclear power another key contributor, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).
But renewable sources — wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal — have jumped in the last decade as production costs have fallen and many states have ordered utilities to make greater use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables produced nearly one-fifth of the country's energy last year.
The EIA predicts renewable energy, despite recent setbacks, will grow 11 per cent this year — an indication of the sector's strong surge before the economy tanked. Meanwhile, coal-fired power is expected to decline 20 per cent and gas generation to grow just one per cent.
The setback for renewable energy still has been painful — even in California, where residential solar demand took off due to frequent blackouts and state laws requiring to new homes to produce as much energy as they consume.
“A lot of companies are just trying everything they can to just limp along and keep their workforce,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
All 20 employees were temporarily furloughed at Cinnamon Energy Systems, which sells residential and commercial solar systems in Northern California.
“I'm sure we'll bounce back, just smaller,” CEO Barry Cinnamon said, adding that people might not spend as much as they once did, because their income will likely be down. “Whether that's months or years, nobody knows.”
Luminalt, a San Francisco solar company, furloughed most of its 40 employees. And when work resumes, CEO Jeanine Cotter expects that projects will take longer and cost more to keep installers safe.
“Think about working on a roof with a mask,” Cotter said. “And think about not being able to pass a power tool to somebody unless you disinfect it before you pass it on.”
Since his furlough in mid-March, Luminalt solar technician Tom Hicks has been collecting benefits but no salary — and he's worried about mortgage payments.
“My 401k got crushed by 30 per cent just like everyone else,” said Hicks, 55. “How much time do I have to recover?”
Still, there are hopeful signs. The Boston-based developer Longroad recently began a utility-scale solar project in California and secured new financing for another in Texas.
Sunnova Energy International, a Houston-based residential solar and energy storage service provider, is doing more videoconferencing and fewer in-person dealings with customers. But CEO John Berger said, “Our installations are still moving ahead, service is still moving ahead, we still see customers paying us.”
In eastern Kansas, construction has continued at Southern Power's 200-megawatt Reading Wind Facility despite delayed parts shipments, company spokeswoman Helen Northcutt White said. Sixty-two turbines are planned for the facility, scheduled to go online in mid-May.
The wind and solar industries have asked lawmakers and federal agencies for help, including an extension of their four-year deadlines for completing projects without losing tax benefits. Similar assistance was granted during the 2008-09 recession.
The renewable energy industry's health is crucial to improving the climate and to a strong economic recovery, said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.
“These businesses, these workers deserve immediate relief,” Davis said.
It's important to push for more responsible energy use as the economy reopens worldwide, said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, which studies climate change and oceans.
“My hope is that we would use this as an opportunity to build toward an economy that doesn't depend on burning coal and oil and that is more resilient to the climate impacts that are heading our way,” Pershing said.

The EIA predicts renewable energy, despite recent setbacks, will grow 11% this year — an indication of the sector’s strong surge before the economy tanked. Meanwhile, coal-fired power is expected to decline 20% and gas generation to grow just 1%.
The setback for renewable energy still has been painful — even in California, where residential solar demand took off due to frequent blackouts and state laws requiring to new homes to produce as much energy as they consume.
“A lot of companies are just trying everything they can to just limp along and keep their workforce,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
All 20 employees were temporarily furloughed at Cinnamon Energy Systems, which sells residential and commercial solar systems in Northern California.
“I’m sure we’ll bounce back, just smaller,” CEO Barry Cinnamon said, adding that people might not spend as much as they once did, because their income will likely be down. “Whether that’s months or years, nobody knows.”
Luminalt, a San Francisco solar company, furloughed most of its 40 employees. And when work resumes, CEO Jeanine Cotter expects that projects will take longer and cost more to keep installers safe.
“Think about working on a roof with a mask,” Cotter said. “And think about not being able to pass a power tool to somebody unless you disinfect it before you pass it on.”
Since his furlough in mid-March, Luminalt solar technician Tom Hicks has been collecting benefits but no salary — and he’s worried about mortgage payments.
“My 401k got crushed by 30% just like everyone else,” said Hicks, 55. “How much time do I have to recover?”
Still, there are hopeful signs. The Boston-based developer Longroad recently began a utility-scale solar project in California and secured new financing for another in Texas.
Sunnova Energy International, a Houston-based residential solar and energy storage service provider, is doing more videoconferencing and fewer in-person dealings with customers. But CEO John Berger said, “Our installations are still moving ahead, service is still moving ahead, we still see customers paying us.”
In eastern Kansas, construction has continued at Southern Power’s 200-megawatt Reading Wind Facility despite delayed parts shipments, company spokeswoman Helen Northcutt White said. Sixty-two turbines are planned for the facility, scheduled to go online in mid-May.
The wind and solar industries have asked lawmakers and federal agencies for help, including an extension of their four-year deadlines for completing projects without losing tax benefits. Similar assistance was granted during the 2008-09 recession.
The renewable energy industry’s health is crucial to improving the climate and to a strong economic recovery, said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.
“These businesses, these workers deserve immediate relief,” Davis said.
It’s important to push for more responsible energy use as the economy reopens worldwide, said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, which studies climate change and oceans.
“My hope is that we would use this as an opportunity to build toward an economy that doesn’t depend on burning coal and oil and that is more resilient to the climate impacts that are heading our way,” Pershing said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Solar, wind energy struggle as coronavirus takes toll</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — The U.S. renewable energy industry is reeling from the new coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed construction, put thousands of skilled labourers out of work and sowed doubts about solar and wind projects on the drawing board.
In locked-down California, some local agencies that issue permits for new work closed temporarily, and some solar companies furloughed installers.
In New York and New Jersey, SunPower CEO Thomas Werner halted installation of more than 400 residential solar systems, fearing for his workers’ safety.
As many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost, trade groups say.
“There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “Up to half our jobs are at risk.”
Leaders are confident the future is bright. But the worldwide slowdown is delaying a transition to cleaner energy that scientists say is not happening quickly enough to curtail climate change.
Even as some states move toward reopening, executives fear diminished incomes and work disrupted by layoffs and social distancing will do lasting damage.
The wind industry is plagued by slowdowns in obtaining parts from overseas, getting them to job sites and constructing new turbines.
“The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two,” said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. ”That reversal is stunning and problematic.”
Residential solar business has been hit especially hard, Hopper said, with door-to-door sales no longer feasible and potential customers watching their wallets. Deals with commercial buyers also have slumped.
New solar installations could be 17% lower worldwide than expected this year, and wind turbine manufacturing could fall up to 20%, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
“Pre-pandemic, there were great dreams and aspirations for a record-setting year,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy, a utility-scale wind and solar developer. “I’m sure we’re not going to have that.”
Fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal remain the leading providers of the nation’s electricity, with nuclear power another key contributor, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
But renewable sources — wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal — have jumped in the last decade as production costs have fallen and many states have ordered utilities to make greater use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables produced nearly one-fifth of the country’s energy last year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 104-year-old woman in New York is recovering from COVID-19, and her nursing home is calling it a “miracle.”
Ida Acconciamessa, who lives at the Sheepshead Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre in Brooklyn, tested positive for COVID-19 on April 4. She was given oxygen, was very weak, and wasn’t eating, according to CBS News. And now, nearly a month later, she’s talking, eating, and recovering from the virus.
Her daughter, Barbara Senese, said her mother isn’t a stranger to health hardships. She said Acconciamessa lived through the Spanish flu, has had two broken hips, survived stage 4 melanoma, and now, COVID-19.
“She always used to say, ‘I was born under a lucky star.’ That was her mantra in life. And you know what? To be able to get through this virus, those words often come to my mind,” Senese told CBS News.
Senese said that she and her sister, Johann Giordano, used to visit their mother almost every day, but the coronavirus pandemic changed how they visited. They couldn’t go inside her nursing home, so they would meet their mother by her first-floor window, wearing masks and gloves. They last saw her at the window on March 26 and were concerned with her health.
“They brought her to us in a wheelchair by the window. The window was open just a tiny bit so she could hear our voices,” Senese said. “She didn’t move a muscle and she stared at us. Just a stare. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that – ever. We were begging her for 10 to 15 minutes to say something. She said nothing. When we walked away, I said to my sister, ‘She’s sick. She has the virus.'”
The family feared she wouldn’t recover from COVID-19 because she was already recovering from a fractured hip and c. difficile, another infection, but now nursing home staff say she’s on the up and up.
Staff at Sheepshead Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre called Acconciamessa on April 24 to say she was recovering from the virus.
“At 104 years, I think it’s a miracle to survive through COVID,” said Marco Perrone, the Nursing Administration Supervisor at the facility told CBS News. “We have people 40, 50 years old, passing due to COVID. So, 104 years old it’s amazing she was able to survive through this.“

    <h5 class="mb-1">A US researcher who worked with a Wuhan virology lab gives 4 reasons why a coronavirus leak would be extremely unlikely</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A fringe theory suggests that the new coronavirus leaked by accident from a lab in Wuhan.
Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) study infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, and did before the pandemic started. So as questions about how the pandemic started continue to go unanswered, the lab has drawn scrutiny.
Matthew Pottinger, Trump’s deputy national security adviser, asked intelligence agencies in January to look into the idea of a Wuhan lab leak, The New York Times reported. But CIA officers didn’t find any evidence.
There’s a reason for that, according to Jonna Mazet, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, who has worked with and trained WIV researchers in the past.
“I know that we worked together to develop very stringent safety protocol, and it’s highly unlikely this was a lab accident,” she told Business Insider. Here are four reasons why.
The WIV houses China’s only Biosafety-level-4 laboratory. Scientists study the most dangerous and infectious microbes known to humankind in these types of facilities. Some of the institute’s researchers, including virologist Shi Zhengli, have collected, sampled, and studied coronaviruses that circulate Chinese bats. In 2013, Shi and her collaborators pinpointed the bat population most likely responsible for spreading SARS, in the Shitou Cave near Kunming.
After her team sequenced the COVID-19 virus, Shi told Scientific American that she quickly checked her laboratory’s record from the past few years to check for accidents, especially during disposal. Then she cross-referenced the new coronavirus’ genome with the genetic information of other bat coronaviruses her team had collected. They didn’t match.
“That really took a load off my mind,” Shi said told Scientific American, adding, “I had not slept a wink for days.”
Mazet has met and worked with Shi through PREDICT, a pandemic early-warning program started by the US Agency for International Development. The program has trained staff and funded labs in 30 countries, including the WIV, but President Donald Trump shut down PREDICT last fall.
“I’ve spoken to her recently,” Mazet said of Shi. “She is absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening.”
Mazet added that Shi set up a secure, shared database into which PREDICT members could upload their work for public release.
In 2018, US officials raised concerns about safety issues at WIV, according to diplomatic cables obtained by The Washington Post. But Mazet said Shi’s work in the lab and in the field was above reproach.
“In the field, they wear extreme personal protective equipment, including multiple layers of gloves, eye protection, full body suits, and masks,” she said. (She noted, however, that she has not personally visited the WIV and couldn’t speak to all the research done there.) Samples collected from bats, Mazet added, get immediately split between some vials that contain chemicals that deactivate the virus, and other containers that leave the virus alive.
All samples are then dunked into liquid nitrogen on the spot, which freezes them, then the vials are disinfected and transported to the lab. There, scientists wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) unload them into a freezer set to minus 80 degrees Celsius.
When the samples are studied later, researchers only use the deactivated, non-infectious ones, Mazet said, adding that the vials with viable virus are locked down in a special area.
Rather than a leak, the coronavirus is more likely the latest disease to have jumped from an animal host to humans, experts say.
This type of cross-species hop, called a spillover event, also led to outbreaks of Ebola and SARS. Both of those viruses originated in bats, and genetic research has all but confirmed the same for the new coronavirus – a study published in February found that it shares 96% of its genetic code with coronaviruses circulating in Chinese bat populations.
Three out of every four emerging infectious diseases come to us from other species; these pathogens are known as zoonotic diseases. The coronavirus is the seventh zoonotic virus to have spilled over into people in the last century.
The 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic – swine flu – started in pigs then killed nearly 300,000 people. People have caught bird flus via direct contact with infected poultry. Other pandemic influenza strains, including the 1957 “Asian flu” and the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic, likely started in birds, too.
And in the last 45 years, at least four epidemics have been traced back to bats.
The caves and wild habitats in which samples get collected from bats are dangerous places for people, since humans can be exposed to the live viruses circulating in the animals, Mazet said.
Shi’s researchers navigate those caves in full PPE; but tourists, hunters, poachers, and other people who rely on animals in some capacity for food or trade wander into such places less protected.
Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance (which managed PREDICT’s relationship with the WIV), told NPR last week that his colleagues are “finding 1 to 7 million people exposed” to zoonotic viruses in Southeast Asia each year.
“That’s the pathway. It’s just so obvious to all of us working in the field,” he said.
A study published in March 2019 even predicted that bats would be the source of a new coronavirus outbreak in China. That’s because the majority of coronaviruses – those that affect humans and animals – can be found in China, and many bats “live near humans in China, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock,” the authors said.
The frequency of spillover events will increase as humans encroach further into wild habitats that house disease-carrying species we haven’t interacted with before, Mazet said. Researching how past spillovers happened and which habitats present the greatest risk for such events helps scientists make predictions about the next pandemic.
Since 2014, Shi’s group at the WIV has received nearly $600,000 from a multi-million dollar, five-year grant funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to research the spillover of bat coronaviruses. The grant, which is managed by EcoHealth Alliance, was renewed for another five years in 2019.
However, after being questioned about that funding at a White House briefing on April 17, President Trump said his administration would “end that grant very quickly.”
A week later, the National Institutes of Health canceled it.
Yuan Zhiming, director of the WIV’s biosafety laboratory, told Reuters that “malicious” claims about the lab had been “pulled out of thin air” and contradicted all available evidence.
The persistent circulation of the lab-leak theory could impact future scientific cooperation and information sharing between the US and China, according to Mazet.
“What’s happening sociologically right now is our biggest risk -who’s going to want to work on this if they’re the ones put under a microscope?” Mazet said. “I think the real danger of what’s going on now is that experts like Shi and myself may not be able to keep collaborating to identify these viruses because of government pressures.” Mazet said.
That would make it harder to discover where the COVID-19 virus came from, as well as to forecast and prepare for the next spillover.
Mazet added that she worries a blame game could even put lives at risk in the short term.
“If we point fingers at other nations that have best opportunity to develop a vaccine, why would we expect them to freely share that with us?” Mazet said. “Collaboration is key right now, otherwise you have countries developing things in parallel, and you can’t assume the US is the best at everything.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">A US researcher who worked with a Wuhan virology lab gives 4 reasons why a coronavirus leak would be extremely unlikely</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A fringe theory suggests that the new coronavirus leaked by accident from a lab in Wuhan.
Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) study infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, and did before the pandemic started. So as questions about how the pandemic started continue to go unanswered, the lab has drawn scrutiny.
Matthew Pottinger, Trump’s deputy national security adviser, asked intelligence agencies in January to look into the idea of a Wuhan lab leak, The New York Times reported. But CIA officers didn’t find any evidence.
There’s a reason for that, according to Jonna Mazet, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, who has worked with and trained WIV researchers in the past.
“I know that we worked together to develop very stringent safety protocol, and it’s highly unlikely this was a lab accident,” she told Business Insider. Here are four reasons why.
The WIV houses China’s only Biosafety-level-4 laboratory, which is one of only a dozen in the world. Scientists study the most dangerous and infectious microbes known to humankind in these types of facilities. Some of the institute’s researchers, including virologist Shi Zhengli, have collected, sampled, and studied coronaviruses that circulate Chinese bats. In 2013, Shi and her collaborators pinpointed the bat population most likely responsible for spreading SARS, in the Shitou Cave near Kunming.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aston Villa captain Dennis Mortimer shows the First Division trophy off to a crowd of thousands outside Birmingham Town Hall after the 1980-81 title triumph.
It was Villa’s seventh league championship but their first since 1910 and was sealed despite a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal at Highbury on the final day of the season.
Ron Saunders’ side pipped Ipswich to the summit by four points, with a seven-match winning run from January to March proving pivotal to their success.
Villa used just 14 players over the course of the campaign, with Mortimer one of seven that were ever-present. The others were Jimmy Rimmer, Kenny Swain, Ken McNaught, Des Bremner, Gordon Cowans and Tony Morley.
Mortimer, who had already lifted the League Cup with the club in 1977, went on to captain the Villains to the European Cup in 1982 with a 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam.
Liverpool-born midfielder Mortimer made nearly 600 appearances in the Football League, which also included a spell at rivals Birmingham, but was never capped by England at senior level.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dennis Mortimer with the First Division trophy outside Birmingham Town Hall.
Aston Villa captain Dennis Mortimer shows the First Division trophy off to a crowd of thousands outside Birmingham Town Hall after the 1980-81 title triumph.
It was Villa’s seventh league championship but their first since 1910 and was sealed despite a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal at Highbury on the final day of the season.
Ron Saunders’ side pipped Ipswich to the summit by four points, with a seven-match winning run from January to March proving pivotal to their success.
Villa used just 14 players over the course of the campaign, with Mortimer one of seven that were ever-present. The others were Jimmy Rimmer, Kenny Swain, Ken McNaught, Des Bremner, Gordon Cowans and Tony Morley.
Mortimer, who had already lifted the League Cup with the club in 1977, went on to captain the Villains to the European Cup in 1982 with a 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam.
Liverpool-born midfielder Mortimer made nearly 600 appearances in the Football League, which also included a spell at rivals Birmingham, but was never capped by England at senior level.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cancer patients may face high risk of death from COVID-19: Study</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cancer patients with COVID-19 are much more likely to die due to novel coronavirus infection than those without the malignant disease, according to a study led by an Indian-origin researcher who says the findings may help protect this vulnerable section of the global population.
The study, published in the journal Cancer Discovery, is the largest so far to assess outcomes for patients with cancer who have also been infected with COVID-19, according to the researchers.
“Our findings emphasise the need to prevent cancer patients from contracting COVID-19 and — if they do — to identify and closely monitor these individuals for dangerous symptoms,” said Vikas Mehta, a co-lead author of the study from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the US.
“We hope that our findings can inform states and communities that have not yet been so severely struck by this pandemic about the unique vulnerability cancer patients face,” Mehta added.
In the study, the scientists assessed 218 cancer patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 18 to April 8 at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, US — one of the worst hit regions by the pandemic in the country.
They found that a total of 61 cancer patients died from COVID-19 — a dramatically high case-fatality rate of 28 per cent.
In comparison, they said, the mortality rate for COVID-19 in the US is 5.8 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
“A key element is that mortality appears to be more closely related to frailty, age, and co-morbidities than to active therapy for cancer,” said co-senior author Balazs Halmos from Einstein College of Medicine.
“Our data suggest that we should not stop lifesaving cancer therapies, but rather develop strategies to minimise potential COVID-19 exposures and re-evaluate therapies for our most vulnerable cancer populations,” explained Amit Verma, co-senior author of the study.
According to the researchers, the time period during which these patients were treated was earlier in the epidemic when testing was almost exclusively done in sicker, symptomatic patients who required hospitalization.
They said this may partially explain the high fatality rate within the study’s cancer population.
However, even when compared to mortality rates in non-cancer patients at Montefiore and across New York City during the same time period, the study noted that cancer patients demonstrated a significantly higher risk of dying from COVID-19.
As a group, COVID-19 patients with hematologic (blood) cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, had the highest mortality rate of 37 per cent (20 of 54 patients), the scientists said.
And for patients with solid malignancies, they said the mortality rate was 25 per cent (41 of 164).
The researchers reported some striking differences among specific solid cancers in the study.
They said the mortality rate for patients with lung cancer was 55 per cent, and for those with colorectal cancer, it was 38 per cent, compared with mortality rates of 14 per cent for breast cancer, and 20 per cent for prostate cancer.
According to the study, certain underlying conditions such as older age, hypertension, heart disease, and chronic lung disease were significantly associated with increased mortality among cancer patients with COVID-19.
More than half of those with cancer who died due to COVID-19 (37 out of 61 patients) had been in places with a higher risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus, such as nursing homes, hospitals, or emergency departments within the 30 days before being diagnosed with the highly contagious disease.
The scientists said this period was before widespread social distancing had been implemented.
Citing the limitations of the study, the researchers said they could not fully account for all of the patients’ pre-existing health conditions prior to COVID-19 infection.
Differential treatments paradigms for COVID-19 infection were also not controlled for in the study, the scientists said.
“We also acknowledge that the mortality rate is highly dependent on the breadth of testing, and therefore understand that more widespread detection of viral infection would likely alter the results,” they wrote in the study.
The researchers believe that further studies assessing a larger population of cancer patients with more rigorous control for other factors may help validate the findings.
“These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population,” they concluded in the study.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oxford Researcher Working On Coronavirus Vaccine Could Show Effectiveness In Humans By June</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020

'As every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up,' says Sir John Bell.
An Oxford University scientist says that he’s hopeful a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be showing efficacy by June, although he didn’t offer a timetable for when the vaccine would be available for widespread use, NBC News reports.
Sir John Bell spoke to Meet The Press on Sunday and talked about the work his team, the Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group, is doing on producing a vaccine for the virus. As Business Insider reports, the Oxford team has already produced a vaccine — hAdOx1 nCoV-19 — and then shipped it to a lab in Montana to be tested on rhesus macaques. The animals were exposed to exceptionally-high concentrations of the virus. After 28 days, none of the primates showed any signs of illness, from the vaccine itself or from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Though the experiment was carried out on animals and not on humans, Vincent Munster, the head of the Virus Ecology Unit at the laboratory, said that the biological similarities between the two species means the results are promising for the vaccine’s use in humans.
“The rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,” Munster said.
Bell, for his part, is bullish on the results so far.
“As every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up,” Bell said.
He said he’s hopeful that the data will be conclusive by June that the vaccine is ready to be tested on humans.
However, Bell notes that the safety of the human test subjects is the team’s top priority.
“I think we’ve got reason to believe that the efficacy, the efficacy of the vaccine in terms of generating strong antibody responses is probably going to be OK. The real question is whether the safety profile’s going to be fine. So that’s actually the main focus of the clinical studies,” he said.
Even if Bell’s prediction that the key milestone will be reached by June holds true, that doesn’t necessarily mean that a vaccine will be deployed for widespread use in humans at that time.
Further, Bell echoed a sentiment previously expressed by Bill Gates: namely, that developing the vaccine would be a wasted effort if it’s only deployed in countries that can afford to pay for it. As reported by The Inquisitr, Gates, like Bell, is hopeful a vaccine will be developed soon. However, manufacturing, distributing, and injecting the vaccine is a process that’s going to cost money, and he, like Bell, is concerned that governments of poorer countries, and their citizens, might be left behind.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AstraZeneca teams up with Oxford University to develop coronavirus vaccine — first results from human trials expected in June or July</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British drug maker AstraZeneca has teamed up with the University of Oxford to develop and manufacture a vaccine for coronavirus, in a move that could allow for rapid vaccination around the world if the treatment proves to be effective.
Human trials of the vaccine developed by the university’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group entered phase-one testing last week, with hundreds of people aged 18 to 55 volunteering across five trial centres in southern England.
“As COVID-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent,” Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca AZN, -1.44%AZN, -0.80%, said in a statement on Thursday.
Speaking to BBC radio, Soriot said: “It is definitely a risk to launch into the development of the vaccine but now is the time to take those kind of risks.”
“By June, July we will already have a very good idea of the direction of travel in terms of its potential efficacy,” he added.
Shares in AstraZeneca, which are up 8.8% in the year to date, were up 1.90% in early morning trading in London.
Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, described the partnership with AstraZeneca as a “major force in the struggle against pandemics” for “many years” to come.
But Bell told the BBC’s Today program that the challenge is to be able to manufacture at scale once it is approved by the regulators. “We also want to make sure that the rest of the world will be ready to make this vaccine at scale so that it gets to populations in developing countries, for example, where the need is very great,” he said.
The U.K. death toll from the coronavirus disease COVID-19 has risen to 26,097, after the government on Wednesday started including deaths in care homes and the wider community for the first time.
The AstraZeneca-Oxford University partnership is the first created since the U.K. government launched the Vaccines Taskforce two weeks ago to help find a new coronavirus vaccine. Details of the agreement are set to be finalized in the coming weeks.
It comes amid a global race to find a vaccine against the coronavirus, with governments lobbying companies to secure first access when one is ready. There are 70 treatments under development worldwide.
On Wednesday, the top U.S. infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said data collected from the coronavirus drug trial testing by Gilead Sciences GILD, -4.82% with the antiviral drug remdesivir showed “quite good news.”
Oxford University said both partners have agreed to operate on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic, with only the costs of production and distribution being covered.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was “hugely welcome news” that Oxford University had come to an agreement with AstraZeneca to scale up its coronavirus vaccine.
“The science is uncertain, and no vaccine may work, but this deal gives the U.K. the best chance we can of a breakthrough that could defeat this awful virus. I’m sending best wishes for good fortune to all involved — for the sake of the nation and indeed the whole world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Don’t try to usurp power during pandemic crisis: Mamata hits out at Governor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday wrote a 13-page letter to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, accusing him of trying to “usurp powers” amid the coronavirus crisis, and asked him to desist from using official communications and logos on social media.
On April 23 and 24, Dhankhar had written two letters, including a 14-page one, to the CM.
“When I read your two letters and many earlier ones as well, I felt more sad than angry. My second emotion was one of amusement,” Banerjee wrote, listing Dhankhar’s “choicest epithets”.
Referring to the letters, she wrote, “Such words and such communications of such content, tenor and tone from a Governor to an elected CM are unprecedented in the annals of Indian constitutional and political history.”
“I beseech you to desist from intensifying your efforts to usurp powers, especially during the humongous crisis which the nation and WB is grappling with… remind you to also desist from… using the official communications/logos between Nabanna (Secretariat) and Raj Bhavan for continuous tweets in the social media, hold my officers responsible for things about which they do not have liberty to open their mouths in the social media, and hold press conferences unilaterally attacking my Government, Ministers and Officers.”
She further wrote that she had a list of the Governor’s communications, in which he had used words about the CM and her minister and officers, which “can only be described as vituperative, intemperate, intimidating, abusive and insulting.”
She also quoted a few expressions used by the Governor, such as “like loose cannons in public domain; driven by external script; theatrics and politicking, law unto oneself… bravado mode of collision”. However, she added that “preaching without practice and sermonising while violating, does not behave you or your office.”
However, within half an hour the Governor responded on Twitter saying, “Response to my letter dated April 24 has been sent by Mamata Banerjee today and is in public domain. Hence, this comment prior to response at the outset in this critical time I urge her to focus on grim situation and work in togetherness towards alleviating untold public miseries.”
He added that while he found no substance in her version, both in fact and law, he appreciated her stance “for full cooperation with State Government”.
“Persistently I had been beseeching her to work in togetherness as we are faced virtually with roof falling situation. Hope she acts as such,” he tweeted. He added that a reply would be sent as her letter had content to which he could not “subscribe as it eclipses essence of constitution.”
In Saturday’s letter, Banerjee cited three supreme court judgments and said, “You may (politely) bring your grievance to my attention (not write to Ministers, Departments, Officers or go to Press or Public) and, If it is still not resolved to your satisfaction, there is unfortunately no other power in you, so long as my Government commands the confidence of the legislature… howsoever much you may disagree or dislike decisions of the state government, in cases of legislation or even otherwise, you are obliged to sign and accede to the state government’s wishes, subject, where applicable, to your single right of referral back.”
At the end, Banerjee told Dhankhar that he had limited powers to bring about any change and urged him to act “politely”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: 'Covid toe' and other rashes puzzle doctors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five rashes, including Covid toe, are affecting some hospital patients diagnosed with Covid-19, a small study by Spanish doctors has found.
The rashes tended to appear in younger people and lasted several days.
It is not uncommon for a rash to be a symptom of a virus, such as the spots that indicate chicken pox.
But the researchers said they were surprised to see so many varieties of rash with Covid-19.
Rashes are not currently included in the list of symptoms of the illness.
There have been many reports about "Covid toe" - a rash appearing on Covid patients' feet even in the absence of other symptoms - but lead researcher Dr Ignacio Garcia-Doval said the most common form of rash in the study was maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps that tend to appear on the torso.
"It is strange to see several different rashes - and some of them are quite specific," Dr Garcia-Doval told the BBC.
"It usually appears later on, after the respiratory manifestation of the disease - so it's not good for diagnosing patients," he added.
All the patients in the study were already in hospital and had respiratory symptoms.
The peer-reviewed paper was published this week in the British Journal of Dermatology.
All dermatologists in Spain were asked to share details of Covid patients they had seen who had developed rashes in the previous two weeks. There were 375 in total.
The five rashes were:
However, the researchers stressed that rashes can have many causes, and it can be difficult to differentiate between them without medical expertise.
"The relevance of this study is not so much in helping people self-diagnose, but rather to help build our wider understanding of how the infection can affect people," said Dr Ruth Murphy, president of the British Association of Dermatologists.
Dr Michael Head at the University of Southampton said that rashes were a well-known side effect of many viral infections, including pneumonia.
"With Covid-19, rashes and skin ulcers have been noted in a few per cent of hospitalised patients. We don't yet know the extent of these links, or precisely why this inflammation occurs in some patients but not others."
The American Academy of Determatology is also compiling a register of skin symptoms seen by its members.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. emergency approval broadens use of Gilead's COVID-19 drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 U.S. states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against Covid-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus’ racially disparate impact is no surprise — pols ignored causes for years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a display of the worst kind of political catch-up, Mayor Bill de Blasio last Sunday appointed his wife Chirlane as head of a coronavirus racial-inequality task force.
Six years into his tenure, de Blasio seeks to identify the “structural racism” that contributes to the health-care and health-outcomes disparities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as city data shows the virus hitting especially hard at New York’s black and Hispanic communities.
Thing is, this isn’t anything new: In particular, the conditions associated with much higher deaths from the bug, including obesity and hypertension, have long plagued blacks and Hispanics at elevated levels.
But: “The city and state have long been aware of these disparities” fumed Chris Norwood, head of the Bronx-based Health People — after all, treating “chronic disease is practically the entire Medicaid budget.”
Decades of national data show that African Americans are 20 percent are more likely to have asthma and 40 percent more likely to be hypertensive. And black women are three times more likely to have lupus.
Critics like Norwood say the state and city health departments know perfectly well the massive studies showing what works to reduce the toll of chronic disease — yet have been utterly indifferent for years.
Charmaine Ruddock, executive director of Bronx Health REACH, says the city has been slow to address many of the disconcerting perceptions in the black and Hispanic communities about their risk of getting COVID-19 and the precautionary measures needed.
City and state leaders know that health behaviors in these communities need to change, Ruddock also notes — but those leaders have never scaled up programs that could help do that.
Instead, state and city budgets have devoted resources to the needs of special interests. Yet de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo pretend to be blindsided by the higher death tolls in communities of color.
We don’t really need a new panel to examine the health-disparity issue. If anything, the pandemic has revealed to black and Hispanic New Yorkers the indifference of the local progressive leadership when it comes to the chronic diseases decimating their communities.
Maybe they’ll make them pay the price for that indifference once the pandemic recedes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No, Sweden isn’t a miracle coronavirus model</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Health Organisation has been generous with its praise throughout this pandemic. China, Singapore and Ireland have all received plaudits for their handling of the coronavirus crisis. Now that a new turning point is in sight, with the infection’s spread slowing and draconian lockdown measures being gradually lifted, the WHO is promoting the Swedish way of doing things. “Sweden represents a future model” If we wish to get back to a society in which we don’t have lockdowns,” the WHO’s Mike Ryan said, praising the way Swedes are trusted to “self-regulate.”
Sweden’s hands-off approach to lockdown has certainly been different to that of other countries, from France and Italy to the US and China. Large public gatherings are banned but restaurants, bars and schools have stayed open, and social distancing is encouraged rather than enforced by police. Trust in the public is high, and so is the public’s trust in the strategy. Swedes seem happy with the global attention. “Many countries are starting to come around to the Swedish way,” Anders Tegnell, the country’s chief epidemiologist, told USA Today.
But like so many stories of national exceptionalism in this crisis — the UK at one point was convinced it could avoid strict closures, painting them as unscientific, before eventually doing a U-turn — this one is debatable and premature.
US President Donald Trump, no doubt annoyed at stories in the American media heaping praise on the Swedes, tweeted one obvious riposte this week, noting the high price that Swedes have had to pay in terms of Covid-19 fatalities. Sweden’s 2,586 deaths compare poorly with Denmark’s 452, and Norway’s 207. Taking population into account, Sweden has suffered more deaths per million people than the US (although deaths aren’t always counted in the same way).
When looking at all-cause mortality — which is probably a better gauge of the real level of coronavirus deaths — Sweden has been hit with “very high” excess deaths since the start of the year, according to the European body monitoring these statistics. In Denmark, they’ve been “low.”
The counterargument is that Sweden has accepted more deaths in exchange for trying to achieve group immunity more quickly and protecting its economy from lasting collapse. Several big countries in Europe with stricter lockdowns have suffered more excess deaths and greater economic damage than Sweden while being more aggressive about halting infections. But they felt they had no other way to relieve their overrun hospitals, a problem that Sweden doesn’t have.
We don’t know what other nations might have gone through if they’d followed the Swedish model — France estimates its own lockdown saved 60,000 lives. We also don’t know how much immunity has been acquired by the Swedes. An official report estimating that a third of Stockholm’s population would develop antibodies to the virus by May 1 was withdrawn after an error.
We do know that Sweden’s Covid-19 journey hasn’t been exceptional. Like other countries, it has experienced a surge in deaths in care homes, where about one in three virus deaths are estimated to have taken place. Visiting relatives and staff are expected to “self-regulate” but, according to reports, they don’t always do so. The Swedes have also had a lack of systematic testing and equipment shortages.
Things might have been even worse without the Swedes’ demographic and cultural defences. This is a population that does social distancing already in many ways. More than half of the country lives in single-person households, working from home is common and access to fast broadband is everywhere. But Swedes are becoming increasingly unconcerned about keeping their distance as time goes on, as images of packed restaurants indicate. Public-health officials have warned about their behaviour. In Stockholm they’ve threatened to shut bars and restaurants.
At the same time, migrant workers in the country are being infected disproportionately, according to a recent national survey. The hyper-individualist expectation to “self-regulate” looks too complacent for immigrant communities who lack access to information.
Sweden may very well turn out to be a relative winner of sorts, especially economically. It will probably experience a shorter and less severe slowdown than its European neighbours, says Torbjorn Isaksson, an analyst at Nordea Bank. That will cheer the lockdown critics such as Swedish industrialist Jacob Wallenberg, who in March warned of the long-term damage of putting economies in deep freeze. Whether that’s much of a win for an economy where trade accounts for 89 per cent of GDP is doubtful. Leapfrogging European Union trading partners in a single market that’s been paralysed by the virus scare can’t be that meaningful. And it probably won’t be fondly remembered.
Given that we haven’t reached the end of this pandemic, more circumspection might be in order. Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once said: “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” As we approach a turning point in the crisis, it’s tempting to look back and single out winners as the model to follow. But we don’t know what’s going to happen next. None of us has lived through it yet. And that includes Sweden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Iraqis turn to sketches and songs to contain virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Basra, Iraq: Bushy moustaches, thick Syrian accents, fistfights in 1930s Damascus and... medical masks? A parody of a popular Syrian television show is raising awareness on curbing the coronavirus outbreak in neighbouring Iraq.
Artists in Iraq's southern port city of Basra have adapted the beloved characters of "Bab al-Hara" ("The Neighbourhood Gate") - a 10-season period drama watched across the Arab world - to convince their compatriots to take the pandemic seriously.
In one skit, the show's main character, Abu Issam, returns to the Syrian capital, Damascus, unannounced after a long absence, just in time to keep his son from getting into a street fight.
"Put on your mask!" Abu Issam, played by Iraqi artist Mohammad Qassem, scolds his son.
When his wife - also played by Qassem - later draws close to welcome him home, Abu Issam slaps her.
"Don't you know that hugging and kissing are forbidden? We're in the time of corona(virus)! Disinfect the house!"
The scenes are meant to be lighthearted, but the messages behind them are no laughing matter, Qassem told AFP.
"We created these skits to raise the public's awareness of what measures the health ministry has asked them to commit to, how to disinfect and clean your hands, and how to abide by the lockdown," he said.
Iraq imposed a nationwide lockdown in mid-March to combat the spread of the virus, but relaxed measures to an evening and weekend curfew last week.
People quickly flooded the streets as stores opened across the country, with very few practising social distancing or wearing masks and gloves.
The language of comedy may convince people to take preventative action against the virus in ways government orders could not, said Youssef al-Hajjaj, who plays Abu Issam's son in the "Bab al-Hara" parody.
"These sketches use comedy to spread information about staying protected when leaving your homes," Hajjaj said.
Pop hits have also been used to persuade Iraqis to stay home, including a remixed music video of a beloved Egyptian hit featuring a police officer at a checkpoint.
"Corona's got us under curfew here, the world is crazy and full of fear," he croons.
Iraqi singers Wissam Daoud and Thaer Hazem were quick to put out their own tune, a ballad set to the jumpy percussion typical of Iraqi music.
official number of coronavirus cases in Iraq, many suspect numbers to be much higher.
"Be careful and don't go out, it'll get easier day by day. That's how you'll stay well and this crisis will go away," they advise.
Iraq has recorded more than 2,000 novel coronavirus cases, including over 90 deaths, although many suspect the real number of cases is much higher as authorities have yet to introduce widespread testing or contact tracing.
Basra, where health services are notoriously poor, is witnessing an uptick in infections, with nearly 100 new cases in recent days raising the total to 450.
Authorities fear a jump in case numbers could overwhelm Iraq's dilapidated health system - ravaged by decades of conflict and underdeveloped due to little investment and widespread corruption.
Qassem and his team have dedicated songs to medical staff and other artists have produced skits to show solidarity with those working long hours at Iraqi hospitals.
One video depicts a young female nurse calling her husband from the hospital, tearfully confessing she was exhausted.
"Stay strong. It's not any tougher than what we've already been through," he tells her over the phone.
Artistic director Abdullah Khaled, 28, considered it an "artistic responsibility" to support medical staff and spread reliable information about the virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sketches, Songs to Contain Coronavirus in Iraq</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bushy moustaches, thick Syrian accents, fistfights in 1930s Damascus and... medical masks? A parody of a popular Syrian television show is raising awareness on curbing the coronavirus outbreak in neighboring Iraq.
Artists in Iraq's southern port city of Basra have adapted the beloved characters of "Bab al-Hara" ("The Neighborhood Gate") -- a 10-season period drama watched across the Arab world -- to convince their compatriots to take the pandemic seriously.
In one skit, the show's main character Abu Issam returns to the Syrian capital Damascus unannounced after a long absence, just in time to keep his son from getting into a street fight.
"Put on your mask!" Abu Issam, played by Iraqi artist Mohammad Qassem, scolds his son.
When his wife -- also played by Qassem -- later draws close to welcome him home, Abu Issam slaps her.
"Don't you know that hugging and kissing are forbidden? We're in the time of corona(virus)! Disinfect the house!"
The scenes are meant to be lighthearted, but the messages behind them are no laughing matter, Qassem told AFP.
"We created these skits to raise the public's awareness of what measures the health ministry has asked them to commit to, how to disinfect and clean your hands, and how to abide by the lockdown," he said.
Iraq imposed a nationwide lockdown in mid-March to combat the spread of the virus, but relaxed measures to an evening and weekend curfew last week.
People quickly flooded the streets as stores opened across the country, with very few practicing social distancing or wearing masks and gloves.
The language of comedy may convince people to take preventative action against the virus in ways government orders could not, said Youssef al-Hajjaj, who plays Abu Issam's son in the "Bab al-Hara" parody.
"These sketches use comedy to spread information about staying protected when leaving your homes," Hajjaj said.
Pop hits have also been used to persuade Iraqis to stay home, including a remixed music video of a beloved Egyptian hit featuring a police officer at a checkpoint.
"Corona's got us under curfew here, the world is crazy and full of fear," he croons.
Iraqi singers Wissam Daoud and Thaer Hazem were quick to put out their own tune, a ballad set to the jumpy percussion typical of Iraqi music.
"Be careful and don't go out, it'll get easier day by day. That's how you'll stay well and this crisis will go away," they advise.
Qassem and his team have dedicated songs to medical staff and other artists have produced skits to show solidarity with those working long hours at Iraqi hospitals.
One video depicts a young female nurse calling her husband from the hospital, tearfully confessing she was exhausted.
"Stay strong. It's not any tougher than what we've already been through," he tells her over the phone.
Artistic director Abdullah Khaled, 28, considered it an "artistic responsibility" to support medical staff and spread reliable information about the virus.
Another film his team produced features practical tips, including how to disinfect produce and limit outings to one person per household.
Khaled's team says these videos, viewed thousands of times on Instagram, would have more of an impact than the government's conventional communications strategy.
"Awareness through videos is one of the most important tools we have to persuade people to protect themselves," said the videos' 29-year-old director Mustafa al-Karkhy.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Sunday it was giving privately held Canadian firm AbCellera Biologics Inc C$176 million to help it find naturally produced antibodies that could be used to battle the coronavirus outbreak.
Federal Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said AbCellera had identified over 500 antibodies from a patient who has recovered from COVID-19.
“This funding is instrumental in accelerating and expanding AbCellera’s capabilities to combat COVID-19. AbCellera and its partners expect clinical trials to begin in July 2020 or earlier,” he said in a statement.
The money will also help the firm to build a Vancouver facility that can manufacture antibodies for clinical testing, he added.
AbCellera said in March it was working with Eli Lilly and Co to co-develop antibody products for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, a flu-like disease caused by the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Curing Coronavirus Isn’t a Job for Social Scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The public appetite for more information about Covid-19 is understandably insatiable. Social scientists have been quick to respond. They are writing papers at a record pace, and academic journals are expediting the review process so that these new, exciting results can be published in a timely and newsworthy manner. While I understand the impulse, the rush to publish findings quickly in the midst of the crisis does little for the public and harms the discipline of social science.
Even in normal times, social science suffers from a host of pathologies. Results reported in our leading scientific journals are often unreliable because researchers can be careless, they might selectively report their results, and career incentives could lead them to publish as many exciting results as possible, regardless of validity. A global crisis only exacerbates these problems. Rushing to publish timely results means more carelessness, and the promise of favorable news coverage in a time of crisis further distorts incentives.
I am especially concerned about three trends among social scientists during the Covid-19 pandemic, the first of which is that many of them appear to be rushing their work. Good science takes time. Researchers often spend months collecting, organizing and double-checking their data. They spend more months presenting their findings and gathering feedback from colleagues before they publicly release their results. But many social scientists are already releasing and publicizing studies using Covid-19 data that was collected just days ago, and they are often failing to apply the same level of rigor that they normally would.
For example, several recent studies have asked whether partisan attitudes affect social distancing. One challenge is that it’s difficult to measure social distancing. In one recent study, survey respondents were asked to self-report their social distancing, but people often misreport their beliefs and behaviors in political surveys. Another study used GPS data to measure visits to places of interest like restaurants and movie theaters, but this seems like a poor test of social distancing at a time when many such places are closed (especially in more Democratic places). A second challenge is that even if we find a clear difference between Democratic and Republican behavior, it’s difficult to say whether this difference is explained by political attitudes or other factors. Democrats tend to live in more urban places, where the pandemic has been more severe and local governments have implemented more stringent policies and guidelines; neither of these studies accounted for these alternative explanations.
Another recent study investigated the extent to which watching “Hannity” versus “Tucker Carlson Tonight” may have increased the spread of Covid-19. This is the kind of study that might make one skeptical in normal times. An extra concern now is that the paper was likely written in just a few days. Although the authors write that they used variation in sunset times to estimate the effect of watching “Hannity,” a closer reading suggests that they’re mostly using variation in how much people in different media markets watch television and how much Fox News they watch. Maybe conservative commentators like Sean Hannity have exacerbated the spread of Covid-19, but it’s dangerous for social scientists to publicize these kinds of results before they have been carefully vetted.
Not only are social scientists rushing to write these studies, but academic journals are also rushing to publish them. An editor might typically vet submitted papers, then select experts in the field to review these papers. The reviewers might read a paper carefully and provide feedback. And then the authors would have the opportunity to revise their paper in response to that feedback, and the process would repeat (often multiple times). But for papers related to Covid-19, the typical process is being streamlined. I was recently asked to review three such papers for a scientific journal. Although an editor might normally give me six weeks to complete one review, I was asked to complete three reviews in just one week. Similarly, a political science journal asked me to referee a paper for a rapid-review series related to Covid-19. The editor explicitly stated that my review would not require the detail or length of a normal review; instead, they wanted a simple “accept” or “reject” within five days.
One possible reason for rushing science in the midst of a crisis is that the benefits of quickly getting new information to the public and to policy makers outweigh the potential costs of giving them less reliable information. Perhaps one could make this argument for those studying how to cure or prevent the spread of Covid-19. But most of the work being done by social scientists on Covid-19, while interesting and important, is not urgent. Understanding how political attitudes affect social distancing may be relevant for understanding political psychology, for example, and it might even help us design better solutions in a future pandemic, but it doesn’t significantly benefit society to have this information today.
The second troubling trend is the temptation of social scientists to speak outside their areas of expertise. There is so much we don’t know about Covid-19 and so much uncertainty about how the pandemic will play out that many are tempted to speculate and conduct their own analyses. I’ve recently seen scholars in fields as varied as political philosophy and macroeconomics giving public-health advice and predicting the future trajectory of the pandemic without seriously discussing the limits of their knowledge or the credibility of their assumptions. A legal scholar first predicted 500 deaths in the U.S., then appeared to revise that to 5,000, and most recently revised it again to 50,000. Despite the scholar’s lack of any relevant expertise or experience, these woefully optimistic early projections reportedly influenced decisions in the White House. (Apparently, this egotism is not unique to social science. Julia Gog, a mathematical modeler of infectious diseases, reports having an email folder full of documents titled “my_first_epidemic.xls.”)
The third troubling trend in social science is the temptation to overclaim. I have seen several studies and analyses by social scientists during the pandemic that are interesting, important and relevant to policy. But the studies often make stronger statements than are warranted, then journalists and policy makers run with these statements and overclaim further. Despite the appeal of favorable news coverage, part of our job as social scientists is to reliably convey the uncertainty associated with our estimates and the limitations of our studies.
In one example of these kinds of misleading claims, one study estimated the economic value of the people spared through social-distancing efforts. Essentially, the authors took estimates from epidemiologists about the number of lives that could be saved, then multiplied them with estimates of the statistical value of a life from economists. The researchers admittedly did not consider any of the potential costs of social distancing. Yet, in the concluding sentence of their abstract, they write, “Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the Covid-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.” To an economist, this sentence might simply convey that they computed large benefits but did not consider costs. But to a layperson or policy maker, it sounds like they have conducted a thorough analysis and concluded that social distancing is, on net, economically beneficial. Not surprisingly, many news outlets have cited this study to support the claim that there is no trade-off between saving lives and economic recovery.
Social scientists have for decades studied questions of great importance for pandemics and beyond: How should we structure our political system to best respond to crises? How should responses be coordinated between local, state and federal governments? How should we implement relief spending to have the greatest economic benefits? How can we best communicate health information to the public and maximize compliance with new norms? To the extent that we have insights to share with policy makers, we should focus much of our energy on that.
The Covid-19 pandemic highlights the importance of what social scientists do on a regular basis, and in time, it will provide new opportunities for us to answer long-standing, policy-relevant questions. And by the time the next crisis comes around, we won’t care whether we answered these questions in a timely or newsworthy manner. We’ll care whether we answered them well.

There is so much we don’t know about Covid-19 and so much uncertainty about how the pandemic will play out that many are tempted to speculate and conduct their own analyses. I’ve recently seen scholars in fields as varied as political philosophy and macroeconomics giving public-health advice and predicting the future trajectory of the pandemic without seriously discussing the limits of their knowledge or the credibility of their assumptions. A legal scholar first predicted 500 deaths in the U.S., then appeared to revise that to 5,000, and most recently revised it again to 50,000. Despite the scholar’s lack of any relevant expertise or experience, these woefully optimistic early projections reportedly influenced decisions in the White House. (Apparently, this egotism is not unique to social science. Julia Gog, a mathematical modeler of infectious diseases, reports having an email folder full of documents titled “my_first_epidemic.xls.”)
The third troubling trend in social science is the temptation to overclaim. I have seen several studies and analyses by social scientists during the pandemic that are interesting, important and relevant to policy. But the studies often make stronger statements than are warranted, then journalists and policy makers run with these statements and overclaim further. Despite the appeal of favorable news coverage, part of our job as social scientists is to reliably convey the uncertainty associated with our estimates and the limitations of our studies.
In one example of these kinds of misleading claims, one study estimated the economic value of the people spared through social-distancing efforts. Essentially, the authors took estimates from epidemiologists about the number of lives that could be saved, then multiplied them with estimates of the statistical value of a life from economists. The researchers admittedly did not consider any of the potential costs of social distancing. Yet, in the concluding sentence of their abstract, they write, “Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the Covid-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.” To an economist, this sentence might simply convey that they computed large benefits but did not consider costs. But to a layperson or policy maker, it sounds like they have conducted a thorough analysis and concluded that social distancing is, on net, economically beneficial. Not surprisingly, many news outlets have cited this study to support the claim that there is no trade-off between saving lives and economic recovery.
Social scientists have for decades studied questions of great importance for pandemics and beyond: How should we structure our political system to best respond to crises? How should responses be coordinated between local, state and federal governments? How should we implement relief spending to have the greatest economic benefits? How can we best communicate health information to the public and maximize compliance with new norms? To the extent that we have insights to share with policy makers, we should focus much of our energy on that.
The Covid-19 pandemic highlights the importance of what social scientists do on a regular basis, and in time, it will provide new opportunities for us to answer long-standing, policy-relevant questions. And by the time the next crisis comes around, we won’t care whether we answered these questions in a timely or newsworthy manner. We’ll care whether we answered them well.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While so called fast radio bursts (FRB) are hardly a novelty, with the first such signal being picked up by scientists back in 2007, it appears that for the first time, one such burst was recently detected originating from a celestial body in our very galaxy, Science Alert reports.
The signal in question, emanated by magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which is located about 30,000 light years away from our planet, was picked up by observatories on Earth on 28 April.
And according to the media outlet, while "work on this event is very preliminary", as astronomers still strive to analyze the data they've obtained, this discovery may finally help solve the mystery of the origins of such signals, as other theories also suggest supernovas and extraterrestrials as possible sources.
Astronomers were also able to detect "the X-ray counterpart" to the signal, with astrophysicist Sandro Mereghetti of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy noting that this is "a very intriguing result and supports the association between FRBs and magnetars".
The media outlet points out, however, that even if the SGR 1935+2154 signal confirms the magnetar origin of FRBs, which remains to be seen, it won't mean that magnetars are the only source of such signals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scientists Find The Highest-Ever Concentration of Microplastics on The Seafloor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What if the "great ocean garbage patches" were just the tip of the iceberg? While more than 10 million tonnes of plastic waste enters the sea each year, we actually see just 1 percent of it – the portion that floats on the ocean surface. What happens to the missing 99 percent has been unclear for a while.
Plastic debris is gradually broken down into smaller and smaller fragments in the ocean, until it forms particles smaller than 5 mm, known as microplastics. Our new research shows that powerful currents sweep these microplastics along the seafloor into large "drifts", which concentrate them in astounding quantities.
We found up to 1.9 million pieces of microplastic in a 5 cm-thick layer covering just one square metre – the highest levels of microplastics yet recorded on the ocean floor.
While microplastics have been found on the seafloor worldwide, scientists weren't sure how they got there and how they spread. We thought that microplastics would separate out according to how big or dense they were, in a similar manner to natural sediment. But plastics are different – some float, but more than half of them sink.
Plastics which once floated can sink as they become coated in algae, or if bound up with other sticky minerals and organic matter.
Recent research has shown that rivers transport microplastics to the ocean too, and laboratory experiments revealed that giant underwater avalanches of sediment can transport these tiny particles along deep-sea canyons to greater depths.
We've now discovered how a global network of deep-sea currents transports microplastics, creating plastic hotspots within vast sediment drifts. By catching a ride on these currents, microplastics may be accumulating where deep-sea life is abundant.
We surveyed an area of the Mediterranean off the western coast of Italy, known as the Tyrrhenian Sea, and studied the bottom currents that flow near the seafloor. These currents are driven by differences in water salinity and temperature as part of a system of ocean circulation that spans the globe.
Seafloor drifts of sediment can be many kilometres across and hundreds of metres high, forming where these currents lose their strength.
We analysed sediment samples from the seafloor taken at depths of several hundred metres. To avoid disturbing the surface layer of sediment, we used samples taken with box-cores, which are like big cookie cutters.
In the laboratory, we separated microplastics from the sediment and counted them under microscopes, analysing them using infra-red spectroscopy to find out what kinds of plastic polymer types were there.
Most microplastics found on the seafloor are fibres from clothes and textiles. These are particularly insidious, as they can be eaten and absorbed by organisms. Although microplastics on their own are often non-toxic, studies show the build-up of toxins on their surfaces can harm organisms if ingested.
These deep ocean currents also carry oxygenated water and nutrients, meaning that the seafloor hotspots where microplastics accumulate may also be home to important ecosystems such as deep-sea coral reefs that have evolved to depend on these flows, but are now receiving huge quantities of microplastics instead.
What was once a hidden problem has now been uncovered – natural currents and the flow of plastic waste into the ocean are turning parts of the seafloor into repositories for microplastics.
The cheap plastic goods we take for granted eventually end up somewhere. The clothes that may only last weeks in your wardrobe linger for decades to centuries on the seafloor, potentially harming the unique and poorly understood creatures that live there.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What if we already have a coronavirus vaccine?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">by Melinda Wenner MoyerAs the world waits for a coronavirus vaccine, tens of thousands of people could die. But some scientists believe a vaccine might already exist.
Surprising new research in a niche area of immunology suggests that certain live vaccines that have been around for decades could, possibly, protect against the coronavirus. The theory is that these vaccines could make people less likely to experience serious symptoms — or even any symptoms — if they catch it.
At more than 25 universities and clinical centers around the world, researchers have begun clinical trials, primarily in health care workers, to test whether a live tuberculosis vaccine that has been in use for 99 years called the bacillus Calmette-Guérin, or B.C.G., vaccine, could reduce the risks associated with the coronavirus.
Another small but esteemed group of scientists is raising money to test the potential protective effects of a 60-year-old live polio vaccine called O.P.V.
It’s counterintuitive to think that old vaccines created to fight very different pathogens could defend against the coronavirus. The idea is controversial in part because it challenges the dogma about how vaccines work.
But scientists’ understanding of an arm of immunology known as innate immunity has shifted in recent years. A growing body of research suggests that live vaccines, which are made from living but attenuated pathogens (as opposed to inactivated vaccines, which use dead pathogens) provide broad protection against infections in ways that no one anticipated.
“We can’t be certain as to what the outcome will be, but I suspect it’ll have an effect” on the coronavirus, said Jeffrey Cirillo, a microbiologist and immunologist at Texas A&M University who is leading one of the B.C.G. trials. “Question is, how big will it be?”
Scientists stress that these vaccines will not be a panacea. They might make symptoms milder, but they probably won’t eliminate them. And the protection, if it occurs, would most likely last only a few years.
Still, “these could be a first step,” said Dr. Mihai Netea, an immunologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands who is leading another one of the trials. “They can be the bridge until you have the time to develop a specific vaccine.”
The first evidence to suggest that live vaccines could be broadly protective trickled in nearly a century ago, but no one knew what to make of it. In 1927, soon after B.C.G. was rolled out, Carl Naslund of the Swedish Tuberculosis Society observed that children vaccinated with the live tuberculosis vaccine were three times less likely to die of any cause compared with kids who weren’t.
“One is tempted to explain this very low mortality among vaccinated children by the idea that B.C.G. vaccine provokes a nonspecific immunity,” he wrote in 1932.
Then, in clinical trials conducted in the 1940s and ’50s in the United States and Britain, researchers found that B.C.G. reduced nonaccidental deaths from causes other than tuberculosis by an average of 25 percent.
Also in the 1950s, Russian researchers, including Marina Voroshilova of the Academy of Medical Science in Moscow, noticed that people who had been given the live polio vaccine, compared with people who hadn’t, were far less likely to fall ill with the seasonal flu and other respiratory infections. She and other scientists undertook a clinical trial involving 320,000 Russians to more carefully test these mysterious effects.
They found that among individuals who had received the live polio vaccine, “the incidence of seasonal influenza was reduced by 75 percent,” said Konstantin Chumakov, Voroshilova’s son, who is now an associate director for research in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.
Recent studies have produced similar findings. In a 2016 review of 68 papers commissioned by the World Health Organization, a team of researchers concluded that B.C.G., along with other live vaccines, “reduce overall mortality by more than would be expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent.”
The W.H.O. has long been skeptical about these “nonspecific effects,” in part because much of the research on them has involved observational studies that don’t establish cause and effect. But in a recent report incorporating newer results from some clinical trials, the organization described nonspecific vaccine effects as “plausible and common.”
Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccinologist and emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania who developed the rubella vaccine but has no involvement in the current research, agreed. “Vaccines can affect the immune system beyond the response to the specific pathogen,” he said.
Peter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist who has spent 40 years studying the nonspecific effects of vaccines in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, and whose findings have been criticized as implausible, is hopeful that these trials will be a tipping point for research in the field. “It’s kind of a golden moment in terms of actually having this taken seriously,” he said.
The possibility that vaccines could have nonspecific effects is brow-furrowing in part because scientists have long believed that vaccines work by stimulating the body’s highly specific adaptive immune system.
After receiving a vaccine against, say, polio, a person’s body creates an army of polio-specific antibodies that recognize and attack the virus before it has a chance to take hold. Antibodies against polio can’t fight off infections caused by other pathogens, though — so, based on this framework, polio vaccines should not be able to reduce the risk associated with other viruses, such as the coronavirus.
But over the past decade, immunologists have discovered that live vaccines also stimulate the innate immune system, which is less specific but much faster. They have found that the innate immune system can be trained by live vaccines to better fight off various kinds of pathogens.
For instance, in a 2018 study, Dr. Netea and his colleagues vaccinated volunteers with either B.C.G. or a placebo and then infected them all with a harmless version of the yellow fever virus. Those who had been given B.C.G. were better able to fight off yellow fever.
Research by Dr. Netea and others shows that live vaccines train the body’s immune system by initiating changes in some stem cells. Among other things, the vaccines initiate the creation of tiny marks that help cells turn on genes involved in immune protection against multiple pathogens.
This area of innate immunity “is one of the hottest areas in fundamental immunology today,” said Dr. Robert Gallo, the director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and co-founder of the Global Virus Network, a coalition of virologists from more than 30 countries. In the 1980s, Dr. Gallo helped to identify H.I.V. as the cause of AIDS.
Dr. Gallo is leading the charge to test the O.P.V. live polio vaccine as a treatment for coronavirus. He and his colleagues hope to start a clinical trial on health care workers in New York City and Maryland within six weeks.
O.P.V. is routinely used in 143 countries, but no longer in the United States. An inactivated polio vaccine was reintroduced here in 1997, in part because one out of every 2.7 million people who receive the live vaccine can actually develop polio from it.
But O.P.V. does not pose this risk to Americans who have received a polio vaccine in the past. “We believe this is very, very, very safe,” Dr. Gallo said. It’s also inexpensive at 12 cents a dose, and is administered orally, so it doesn’t require needles.
Some scientists have raised concerns over whether these vaccines could increase the risk for “cytokine storms” — deadly inflammatory reactions that have been observed in some people weeks after they have been infected with the coronavirus. Dr. Netea and others said that they were taking these concerns seriously but did not anticipate problems. For one thing, the vaccines will be given only to healthy people — not to people who are already infected.
Also, B.C.G. may actually be able to ramp up the body’s initial immune response in ways that reduce the amount of virus in the body, such that an inflammatory response never occurs. It may “lead to less infection to start with,” said Dr. Moshe Arditi, the director of the Infectious and Immunological Diseases Research Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is leading one of the trial arms.
The science on this is still early days. Several pre-prints — scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed — published over the past few months support the idea that B.C.G. could protect against the coronavirus. They have reported, for instance, that death rates are lower in countries that routinely vaccinate children with B.C.G. But these studies can be fraught with bias and difficult to interpret; it’s impossible to know whether the vaccinations, or something else, provided the protection.
Such studies are “at the very bottom of the evidence hierarchy,” said Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, who is raising funds for a Danish B.C.G trial. She added that the protective effects of a dose of B.C.G given to adults decades ago, when they were infants, may well differ from the protective effects the vaccine could provide when given to adults during an outbreak.
“In the end,” said Dr. Netea, “only the clinical trials will give the answer.”
Thankfully, that answer will come very soon. Initial results from the trials that are underway may be available within a few months. If these researchers are right, these old vaccines could buy us time — and save thousands of lives — while we work to develop a new one.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What if we already have a coronavirus vaccine?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the world waits for a coronavirus vaccine, tens of thousands of people could die. But some scientists believe a vaccine might already exist.
Surprising new research in a niche area of immunology suggests that certain live vaccines that have been around for decades could, possibly, protect against the coronavirus. The theory is that these vaccines could make people less likely to experience serious symptoms — or even any symptoms — if they catch it.
At more than 25 universities and clinical centres around the world, researchers have begun clinical trials, primarily in health care workers, to test whether a live tuberculosis vaccine that has been in use for 99 years called the bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG, vaccine, could reduce the risks associated with the coronavirus.
Another small but esteemed group of scientists is raising money to test the potential protective effects of a 60-year-old live polio vaccine called OPV.
It’s counterintuitive to think that old vaccines created to fight very different pathogens could defend against the coronavirus. The idea is controversial in part because it challenges the dogma about how vaccines work.
But scientists’ understanding of an arm of immunology known as innate immunity has shifted in recent years. A growing body of research suggests that live vaccines, which are made from living but attenuated pathogens (as opposed to inactivated vaccines, which use dead pathogens) provide broad protection against infections in ways that no one anticipated.
“We can’t be certain as to what the outcome will be, but I suspect it’ll have an effect” on the coronavirus, said Jeffrey Cirillo, a microbiologist and immunologist at Texas A & M University who is leading one of the BCG trials. “Question is, how big will it be?”
Scientists stress that these vaccines will not be a panacea. They might make symptoms milder, but they probably won’t eliminate them. And the protection, if it occurs, would most likely last only a few years.
Still, “these could be a first step,” said Dr. Mihai Netea, an immunologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands who is leading another one of the trials. “They can be the bridge until you have the time to develop a specific vaccine.”
The first evidence to suggest that live vaccines could be broadly protective trickled in nearly a century ago, but no one knew what to make of it. In 1927, soon after BCG was rolled out, Carl Naslund of the Swedish Tuberculosis Society observed that children vaccinated with the live tuberculosis vaccine were three times less likely to die of any cause compared with kids who weren’t.
“One is tempted to explain this very low mortality among vaccinated children by the idea that BCG vaccine provokes a non-specific immunity,” he wrote in 1932.
Then, in clinical trials conducted in the 1940s and ‘50s in the United States and Britain, researchers found that BCG reduced non-accidental deaths from causes other than tuberculosis by an average of 25 per cent.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madonna made sure she didn't miss out on a friend's birthday party, despite recently testing positive for coronavirus antibodies.
The Like A Virgin singer, 61, attended the bash in person and even hugged and presented her pal Steven Klein with a cake to mark his 55th birthday.
No one at the birthday bash was wearing any protective gear like face masks, despite the worldwide coronavirus crisis.
Madonna's positive test means she has recently been in contact with Covid-19.
Klein's birthday party was livestreamed on the video chatting app Zoom meaning guests could attend it virtually, but defiant Madge was there in person.
One of the people who attended shared a video of Madonna hugging Klein.
They captioned the post: "M made an appearance at Steven Klein's Virtual Birthday Party - such a blast!!
"M called his Bday cake a Covid Cake.
"She's too f**king cute!!! We are living in some crazy tiMes!
"But trying to make the most of it, and still have soMe fun!!! [sic]"
Mirror Online has contacted Madonna's reps for comment.
Madonna took to Instagram to reveal she'd tested positive for the coronavirus antibodies earlier this week.
"Took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies," she said.
"So tomorrow, I'm just going to go for a long drive in the car… and I'm going to breathe in the COVID-19 air.
"Yep. I hope the sun is shining."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Confusions have clouded new Health Directorate estimates updated in a matter of 24 hours that show more than 1,000 people have recovered from coronavirus.
The figure for recovery on Saturday was 177 after three more won the battle against the deadly illness in the preceding 24 hours.
In the Sunday brief, DGHS Additional Director General Nasima Sultana put the total number of recovered patients at 1,063, a whopping rise in the past 24 hours. The uplifting statistics, she said, was based on new calculations done following 'revised guidelines'.
But the factors at play in this dramatic leap in the number of people surviving the deadly illness remains unclear.
A total of 624 patients were discharged from hospitals in Dhaka while 272 others recovered outside the capital, according to Nasima.
"There is a clinical management committee for cases of recovery and they have made a new guideline which sets a criteria for when we can say a patient has recovered, when they can leave hospitals. So, 1,063 patients have recovered under this criteria," she said.
bdnews24.com called on DGHS officials for a better understanding of the development, but the explanations remained vague.
According to previous guidelines, the sample of a person who tested positive for coronavirus would be tested again after 14 days. If it came back negative, another test would follow seven days later. If results again return negative, the patient would once again be tested within 72 hours and if the result is still negative, that individual would be put on the list of recoveries and advised to remain in three-week quarantine on discharge from hospital.
"According to the new guidelines, if a patient has clinically recovered, meaning if they do not have fever, cough or respiratory problem for three consecutive days, they would be released and sent back home to remain in isolation for two weeks," virologist Prof Dr Nazrul Islam, who advises the national technical committee, told bdnews24.com.
The tests which were conducted in hospitals previously would be carried out at home, he said.
However, he was tight-lipped when asked how the information of a patient who recovers at home would be collated.
Also, the question as to whether a person would be considered to have recovered if no symptoms show in two-three days went unanswered.
But Md Habibur Rahman Khan, additional secretary to the health ministry, gave bdnews24.com a different explanation.
"We have been providing information on the hospitals in Dhaka all these days. From today, details coming in from all over the country are being added up. This has caused the number of recoveries to surge," he said.
"From today information on patients recovering from hospitals all over the country will be provided. This is what Health Directorate's Additional Director General Nasima Sultana told me," he said.
bdnews24.com failed to reach Nasima Sultana for her comments on the issue.
The DGHS has been subject to criticism in social media about its handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
Bangladesh confirmed two more deaths from the coronavirus in a daily count, taking the total to 177 on Sunday.
The tally of COVID-19 infections spiralled to 9,455 in the same period after another 665 people tested positive from 5,368 samples in the biggest single-day spike.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Your Open-Floor Office Could Help Spread Coronavirus, According to South Korean Experts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After the call center outbreak in South Korea, new research by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) showed how easy it is to spread coronavirus in an office.
Nearly half (44%) of employees working on the identical floor tested positive for coronavirus in an unnamed call center in Seoul, South Korea, last month, according to the report.
Out of 811 workers, 97% got the virus - 94 of them sat on the 11th floor at the same time as 79 people were in the same section.

An agent on the said call center in Seoul tested positive on March 8, according to Nikkei's report. The employee, however, was working on the 10th floor and never went to the 11th floor.
Officers closed the building the following day and ordered all employees to self-isolate for 14 days, as per South Korea's current protocol. All residents living on the 13th through the 18th floor were also requested to do home quarantine.
The skyscraper's first 11 floors are commercial real estate, and the rest are residential apartments. That means possible touch should take place within the elevator and the lobby.
All workers and residents, together with their households, had been tested. The authorities took a total of 1,143 swab samples that day.
However, only 97 came back positive with four presymptomatic patients. Around 34 patients, who are all family members of the employees, got the coronavirus, too.
But what took the KCDC's attention was that the most central group of confirmed cases was determined among people who sat close to one another. A total of 216 employees were working on the said floor, but only 94 workers fell ill, which means the virus's attack rate is 43.5 percent.
The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a color-coded seating manual of employees working on the 11th floor.
The blue-colored desks in the diagram specify the workers who shriveled the virus. It revealed how offices' inherent structure quickly spread the virus further, particularly with long durations of the interplay between personnel.
The KCDC also emphasized how the length of interplay performed a critical position in spreading the virus further.
"Despite considerable interaction between employees on different floors of the building, the spread of COVID-19 was limited almost exclusively to the 11th floor," the institution notes. The duration of interaction was likely the main facilitator for further spreading, KCDC added.
Based on a report published by the South Korean government concerning the COVID-19 reaction strategy, the fulfillment in flattening the curve was because of mass testing, contact tracing, and using digital surveillance tools.

During the call center outbreak in Seoul last month, a team assigned to alert people despatched a total of 16,000 messages to those who came near the building all through the outbreak period.
The initiative highlights how vital transparency is so that humans with capacity publicity can immediately get themselves tested.
The KCDC also emphasized the urgency of mass testing and how it helped mitigate the country by "disrupting transmission chains through isolation of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients."
"Public health officials should maintain active surveillance and epidemiological research in this quickly evolving landscape of COVID-19," the KCDC added.

Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease are among the most common co-morbidities associated with serious Covid-19 cases in the country, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday.
This as 123 deaths were recorded nationwide.
“We have looked at the data for patients who have been hospitalised and found that, consistent with evidence emerging worldwide, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease are the three most common co-morbidities associated with serious illness from Covid-19,” he added.
Mkhize said other co-morbidities, which are present in admitted patients, were chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic renal disease, malignancy and HIV as well as active and past TB cases.
“I would therefore like to urge our millions of South Africans who are over 63 years of age and those who live with these conditions, to take extra precaution as we ease the lockdown.”
He reiterated the need for continued isolation from the public.
“I would also like to urge all South Africans to continue to stay at home as far as possible, only venturing out to perform essential tasks as we move through the stages of the gradual lifting of the lockdown.”
The numbers so far
Mkhize said as of Saturday night, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa was 6 336, adding tests conducted to date stood at 230 686, of which 13 164 were done in the last 24 hours.
“This is the highest number of tests done in a 24-hour cycle to date.”
Seven Covid-19-related deaths in the Western Cape and Free State have brought the toll to 123, while the number of recoveries stands at 2 549.
The Western Cape has emerged as the epicentre of the virus, with the latest data indicating it accounts for 56 of the 123 deaths countrywide.
The province recorded 779 recoveries, but also led the nation with 2 700 confirmed cases, Mkhize said.

Two more African countries have joined the list of patrons for Madagascar’s purported cure for COVID-19. Tanzania and Comoros confirmed their interest in the herbal cure over this weekend.
The Comorian president, Azali Assoumani, held a teleconference with his Malagasy counterpart, Andry Rajoelina, following which a formal request was made for the product.
Rajoelina posted a screenshot of their meeting on Twitter with the caption which read in part: “He (Assoumani) wishes to benefit from CovidOrganics for Comoros. We will supply them as a sign of solidarity with our brothers in the Indian Ocean!”
In the case of Tanzania, President John Pombe Magufuli whiles speaking at an event on Sunday disclosed that the country will also make requests of the herbal cure to help in the fight against the pandemic.
“I have been in talks with Madagascar. They say they have discovered the medicine for COVID-19. We will send a plane to bring the medicine to Tanzania so that Tanzanians can benefit from it,” he is quoted to have said.
Meanwhile, the Guinea-Bissau delegation that took flew to Madagascar to take the consignment have returned home with the products. Equatorial Guinea was the first country to receive the donation.
The Republic of Congo also announced on Saturday that a consignment will soon be imported. So far, Rajoelina has received praise from a number of his peers including presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal – all of whom he has held teleconferences with.
During an African Union meeting late last month, he stressed the importance of the herbal cure – a variant of which prevents the virus, whiles another cures it. Speaking to colleague heads of state with a bottle of COVID-Organics on his table, he reiterated the viability of the herbal cure.
“There are two treatment protocols (curative and preventive). The state of health of Covid-19 patients who took Tambavy CVO CovidOrganics improved after 7 days and fully recovered after 10 days,” Rajoelina said in an April 30 tweet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Malaria cure symptomatic relativity worth examining</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
It is on record that the United States has a record of about 1,700 malaria fever cases every year from immigrants and travellers returning from countries where the disease is more common.
The symptom is a serious and sometimes life-threatening tropical disease that spreads through parasites just like coronavirus. Records have it that it kills more than 445,000 people a year, many of them children in Africa. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is also an infectious disease caused by what the experts termed a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it.
With the emerging news of upsurge of coronavirus in highly populated towns and areas like Lagos and FTC Abuja, the need for cause examination of malaria/coronavirus relativity becomes a compelling necessity if in reality prevention will be found.
Statistics shows that in the year 2018, Nigeria accounted for 25 percent of malaria fever cases worldwide, becoming the highest record in any country with occurrence in more than 100 countries and territories. Clustering of people in a thickly mass populated area like Lagos metropolis must no doubt encourage mosquito bites, which spread the malaria fever among the people.
The highly welcome suggestion of Dr. Osagie Ehanire, Minister of Health on expansion of testing criteria on COVID- 19 to include cases with fever and respiratory tract symptoms but also all persons with fever respiratory tract symptoms must be an attractive approach to the menacing health problem currently confronting humanity.

The fact must be faced that coronavirus is a foreign disease imported to Nigeria with yet unknown cure whilst malaria is better known to Nigerians with known cure.One is of the strong opinion that Nigeria having rightly been acclaimed to be malaria conqueror of the world should have prompted our researchers, experts and institutions coming up with Malaria drugs capable at least also being applicable to treat coronavirus.
If it took U.S President Donald Trump little or no time to reason that our already known malaria drug in Nigeria, chloroquine is capable of addressing coronavirus menace, nothing should have stopped us as a nation, accounting for 25 percent of malaria cases world wide coming up with a solution on the matter. Coronavirus epidemic has thrown the world economic and productive manufacturing off balance, informing unprecedented restrictive trade policies. Experience, we are told, is the best teacher.
Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde incidentally, was one of those who went into the coronavirus’ lion’s den and came out well, hale and hearty. The experience of such person could be promptly tapped on what drugs and solutions he used to treat himself.
To borrow the words of our amiable Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele: “Although these developments are troubling, they present a clear opportunity to re- echo a persistent message the Central Bank of Nigeria has been sending for a long time, and at this time even more urgently so. We must look inwards as a nation and guarantee food security, high quality and affordable health care, and cutting edge education for our people.”
Now with threatening global recession and food, drugs, medicine imports getting restricted what should a nation like Nigeria with no plan for self reliance do? COVID -19 symptoms seems to be a sister to malaria fever, our field of expertise, this is an opportunity for Nigeria to prove our prowess, not only in meeting health challenges, but to providing solutions to our other healthcare problems.
The battle of wit on how to find a cure for COVID-19 with the method we have been using for years to cure malaria, acute malaria and related diseases etc. ought now to be deployed to tell the whole what Nigerians are capable of.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Major milestone! India conducts 1 million coronavirus tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus lockdown: The milestone comes amid the ICMR's attempts to increase testing. The biomedical research agency had ramped up tests to more than 70,000-75,000 samples per day
India achieved a big feat on Saturday as it completed one million real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to identify people infected with coronavirus. According to officials, this is a major milestone in India's fight against coronavirus. 
An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official confirmed the figure and said that the one-million mark was achieved on a day India saw the biggest single-day jump with 2,411 cases. The official said that 71 people died of coronavirus on Saturday.

Since January 30 this year, when the first positive case was detected, India conducted 1.04 million tests.
The milestone comes amid the ICMR's attempts to increase testing. The biomedical research agency had ramped up tests to more than 70,000-75,000 samples per day. According to officials, till March 31, 47,852 samples were tested, which increased to a total of 9,02,654 samples as on April 30. From May 1 till May 2 evening, 1,37,346 tests were done.
RT-PCR tests began with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and is now available in 292 government and 97 private facilities across the country.

Considered to be the most-effective diagnosis, RT-PCR is a throat and nasal swab test. It detects the virus early on, which is helpful in identifying and isolating an infected person.
Director General of ICMR Balram Bhargava said that the entire scientific and medical community including the private sector have all joined forces to tackle coronavirus. The Centre is also working with the states to ensure that the supply chain is maintained. "We have also decentralised the supply chain. The gold standard for COVID-19 testing remains and has remained the RT-PCR test which detects the novel coronavirus. This has been our principal strategy for testing," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gay and bisexual men excluded from coronavirus blood plasma trial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gay and bisexual men have been told they cannot take part in a blood trial which experts hope could serve as a potential coronavirus treatment.
People who have recovered from Covid-19 have been encouraged to donate their blood plasmas, which will then be transfused to infected patients at London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital.
It is hoped the process, called convalescent plasma, will help patients whose immune systems are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the novel virus.
But any man who has had sex with another man in the last three months is excluded from the trial, which echoes current guidance on giving blood.
Critical care manager Andy Roberts, who had tested positive for Covid-19, said he was told he could not take part as he is in a same-sex relationship.
After a 20 minute call with an operator, Mr Roberts said he was quizzed on his sexuality before being turned down.

His long-term partner, Keith Ward, said the rules were discriminatory against the LGBT+ community and that the situation made him ‘feel very angry’.
He told ITV News: ‘We have been together in a monogamous relationship for more than 30 years and I previously didn’t know of this outrageous three-month rule.
‘It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer according to [the rules].’
Current guidelines set by the NHS Blood and Transplant service says ‘men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of acquiring certain infections through sex’ and they still apply to those who have used protection.
The official Give blood website states: ‘Gay and bisexual men are not automatically prevented from giving blood.
‘However, all men must wait 3 months after having oral or anal sex with another man before donating.
‘This rule applies to every man, regardless of their sexual orientation, whether they’re in a stable relationship or whether they use protection such as condoms or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)’.
So far, more than 6,500 people have signed up to donate to the plasma trial. Although it is not yet known how many antibodies build up in people who have beaten Covid-19, there have been some promising signs of immunity with patients who have retained antibodies long after recovering.
If the treatment proves to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.
But Director of Policy at Stonewall, Laura Russell, told ITV the donor guidelines were ‘really upsetting’ for gay and bi men who want to help in finding a Covid-19 treatment.
She insisted the decision on who can donate blood or a plasma ‘should be based on individual risk assessments, not on people’s sexual orientation’.
A spokesperson for the NHS Blood and Transplant service said the trial will initially be run using the current donor selection guidelines but will ‘keep this under review’.
It acknowledged ‘this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives’ but said the three-month guidelines are in place to ‘protect the health of the donor and the recipient’.
The spokesperson added: ‘Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gay and bisexual men to be excluded from Covid-19 plasma trial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gay and bisexual men have been told they cannot donate their plasma to a trial hoping to provide a treatment for Covid-19.
Doctors at London's Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital are aiming to use the plasma from recovered coronavirus patients to treat others with the disease.
It is hoped that the possible treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help Covid-19 patients whose bodies are not producing enough antibodies to fight the disease.
But any man who has had sex with another man within the past three months is excluded from donating their plasma, in line with the current rules for donating blood.
Those guidelines explain that "men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of acquiring certain infections through sex", which could be passed on during a transfusion.
Critical care manager Andy Roberts told ITV News that he was turned down for the plasma trial, after testing positive for Covid-19.
He says that at the end of a 20 minute phone call with an operator working on the trial he was asked about his sexuality and subsequently told that he could not donate plasma due to being in a same-sex relationship.
Mr Roberts' partner Keith Ward told ITV News: "It makes me feel very angry.

"It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer according to [the rules]."
The guidelines around donating blood are set by the Department of Health on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs.
They are implemented by the NHS Blood and Transplant service, which told ITV News that in relation to the plasma trial: “We will initially be using the current donor selection guidelines although we will keep this under review."
A spokesperson added: "The guidelines are there to protect the health of the donor and the recipient.
"Under the current guidelines, men must wait three months after having oral or anal sex with another man. We appreciate this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives.
"Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">ICMR plans to study whether novel coronavirus strain in India changed form</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is planning to study whether the novel coronavirus strain in India has undergone mutation while spreading within the country over the last two months.
According to a senior scientist of the country’s apex health research body, determining whether or not the SARS-CoV2 strain has changed form will help in ensuring the effectiveness of a potential vaccine. “The study will also indicate whether it has become more virulent and increased transmission capability.”

Samples will be collected from COVID-19 patients to study whether the novel coronavirus strain has mutated or not, he said.
However, the study can begin once the lockdown is lifted since currently there are difficulties involved in transportation of samples from different states and Union Territories, scientists said.
As per Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), so far the maximum difference in the novel coronavirus strain in India has been found to be between 0.2 to 0.9 per cent as compared to the strains in other countries, another scientist said.
GISAID, which promotes international sharing of all influenza virus sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data, has over 7,000 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 deposited by various laboratories across the world where they have classified the virus based on their mutations.

There are chances that people arriving in India from different countries are bringing various strains of the virus.
Three strains of the virus have been traced in India so far. One was from Wuhan, and the other two from Italy and Iran. The sequence of the coronavirus strain from Iran was similar to that of China.
“It will take some time for us to know the predominant quasi-species of the novel coronavirus in the country. But mutations are not likely to make potential vaccines ineffective, as all sub-types of the virus have the same enzymes. Also, it has been in India for three months and it does not mutate very fast,” Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar had said earlier.
Six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19, joining the global race to find a preventive for the deadly infection spreading rapidly across the world.

Nearly 70 ‘vaccine candidates’ are being tested and at least three have moved to the human clinical trial stage, but a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021.
India has also collaborated with WHO’s multi-country “solidarity trial” for developing potential treatments and drugs for COVID-19.
The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,218 and the number of cases climbed to 37,336 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 26,167, while 9,950 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hunt for Covid-19 vaccine: ICMR to probe whether novel coronavirus strain in India changed form</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a senior scientist at ICMR, determining whether or not the SARS-CoV2 strain has changed form will help in ensuring the effectiveness of a potential vaccine
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is planning to study whether the novel coronavirus strain in India has undergone mutation while spreading within the country over the last two months.
According to a senior scientist of the country's apex health research body, determining whether or not the SARS-CoV2 strain has changed form will help in ensuring the effectiveness of a potential vaccine. "The study will also indicate whether it has become more virulent and increased transmission capability."
Samples will be collected from COVID-19 patients to study whether the novel coronavirus strain has mutated or not, he said.
However, the study can begin once the lockdown is lifted since currently there are difficulties involved in transportation of samples from different states and Union Territories, scientists said.

As per Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), so far the maximum difference in the novel coronavirus strain in India has been found to be between 0.2 to 0.9 per cent as compared to the strains in other countries, another scientist said.
GISAID, which promotes international sharing of all influenza virus sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data, has over 7,000 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 deposited by various laboratories across the world where they have classified the virus based on their mutations.
There are chances that people arriving in India from different countries are bringing various strains of the virus.
Three strains of the virus have been traced in India so far. One was from Wuhan, and the other two from Italy and Iran. The sequence of the coronavirus strain from Iran was similar to that of China.
"It will take some time for us to know the predominant quasi-species of the novel coronavirus in the country. But mutations are not likely to make potential vaccines ineffective, as all sub-types of the virus have the same enzymes. Also, it has been in India for three months and it does not mutate very fast," Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar had said earlier.
Six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19, joining the global race to find a preventive for the deadly infection spreading rapidly across the world.
Nearly 70 'vaccine candidates' are being tested and at least three have moved to the human clinical trial stage, but a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021.
India has also collaborated with WHO's multi-country "solidarity trial" for developing potential treatments and drugs for COVID-19.
The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,218 and the number of cases climbed to 37,336 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 26,167, while 9,950 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global smartphone market suffers worst contraction in history due to coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus has had a drastic impact on the smartphone industry as it faces the fastest ever first-quarter year-on-year decline, according to new data released by Counterpoint and Canalys, analyst firms.
There is an overall decrease in global shipments at 13 per cent, while Counterpoint suggests the drop in China alone was 27 per cent while Canalys estimates it at 18 per cent.
Shipments have fallen under 300 million since 2014 with a swift decline in smartphone demand in China and around the world.
“By the end of the quarter, as Covid-19 started to spread to other regions, and lockdowns of varying severity were imposed, the pendulum of disruption started to swing from supply to demand,” Counterpoint’s team of analysts writes in a statement.
“Demand for new devices has been crushed,” says Canalys senior analyst Ben Stanton.
“In February, when the coronavirus was centered on China, vendors were mainly concerned about how to build enough smartphones to meet global demand. But in March, the situation flipped on its head. Smartphone manufacturing has now recovered, but as half the world entered a lockdown, sales plummeted.”
“From the consumer standpoint, unless replacing a broken phone, smartphones are mostly a discretionary purchase,” says Tarun Pathak, associate director, Counterpoint.
“Consumers, under these uncertain times, are likely to withhold making many significant discretionary purchases. This means the replacement cycles are likely to become longer.”
 
Samsung and Apple still maintain their first and third spots on the leaderboard but are both expected to lose market share to Chinese rivals, according to TrendForce, a market research firm.
Xiaomi ranked fourth, accounting for 10 percent of the global market share for the first time.
Apple has slashed prices of its iPhone 11 in China, the only major market where its stores are open. It also launched a $399 iPhone it hopes will find takers in a frugal economy.
Further, the estimates suggest that iPhone production fell nearly 9% to about 38 million units in the March quarter, and expects a further drop of 2 million units in the current one.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gradual lifting of circuit breaker depends on mass testing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Advertisement -
Singapore — A gradual lifting of the current circuit breaker measures will depend on the country’s ability to do mass testing, according to an article in straitstimes.com on Thursday (April 30).
In an interview, the director and chief scientist of Singapore biotech firm Acumen Research Laboratories (ARL), Dr Ong Siew Hwa, shared that: “We are in a good position to do mass testing.”
Singapore’s testing ability has grown from 2,900 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to 8,000 tests daily. While this might sound like a large number, it will have to be ramped up exponentially if the country wants to move forward and out of the ongoing circuit breaker measures, which have been enhanced till June 1.
As mentioned in the article, the PCR tests work by identifying the genetic material of the virus from the sample that a person gives in order to tell whether they are infected with it or not.

ARL, known for its work in infectious disease diagnostics, managed to develop and manufacture its own Covid-19 detection tests in January, and it now can administer up to 20,000 tests per day.
The company has been making and selling the kits to different countries in the nearby regions. However, due to the increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in Singapore, it is now looking into working locally for the most part. It is also hoping to begin reviewing patient results within its laboratory.
And it is not only ARL that has come up with its own test kits, but a number of other companies that the Government is attempting to reach in order to achieve mass-testing capacities in the country.
Dr Ong mentioned that if mass testing is to go under way, there needs to be a joint effort among both private and public institutions. She explained: “Some smaller companies, like us, have the expertise but may not have the financial resources and strong infrastructure of large healthcare groups to scale up production and testing capabilities.”
She continued: “Hence, there needs to be a marriage between these two types of companies to allow for large-scale testing.”
She also iterated that the entire world is racing to do mass testing, which means that certain chemicals required to do analysis may end up in a global shortage, prompting Singapore-based companies to create these reagents locally.
Dr Ong stressed: “There remains a need for us to be more self-sufficient in this aspect. This, as well as the production of masks, may not be the most profitable business during peacetime. But moving forward, people should explore new business models and possible policy changes so that businesses which are traditionally unprofitable during peacetime can survive, allowing us to be more prepared for future pandemics.”
She added: “We hope to be able to contribute to this national effort — to let the science, data and technology guide our decision-making.”
Dr Ong is not the only one to think this way either. The article also mentions Professor Edison Liu, who was the head of the Genome Institute of Singapore at the time the country battled Sars. He shares his sentiments in Singapore’s abilities to battle this novel coronavirus due to being “advanced and organised” in its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
He stated: “I am honoured to have had a role in shaping (Singapore’s) strategic approach to pandemics in the past and know full well Singapore’s capabilities. Singapore’s small size and compact geography also is an advantage.” He also said that “viral testing will be the most important tool in the control of the pandemic until a vaccine and antivirals can be developed”.
Until a vaccine is found, the only fight the world has against Covid-19 is basically testing the public in order to quickly detect who is positive with the virus. That way, they can be kept in quarantine so that they do not continue spreading the virus to others. /TISG

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus | European leaders push vaccine financing drive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros (£6.6 billion, $8.3 billion) to find a vaccine to curb the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined the fund-raising plan for the scientific fight-back against COVID-19 on Friday.
An online pledging conference will take place on Monday to plug gaps in financing of research.
Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave their support in an open letter published in weekend newspapers.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and Norway’s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, also signed and all gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism about its handling of the crisis.
The funds raised will “kickstart an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals”, the leaders said.
But they warned that more money would still be needed to manufacture and deliver “available, accessible and affordable” medicines across the world.
“If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,” they added.
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Saudi Arabia and the European Commission, are co-hosting the conference, which is part of a month-long international investment drive before the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with COVID-19, said finding a treatment was “the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”.
He will confirm Britain’s pledge of £388 million for vaccine research, tests and treatments, which is part of a wider £744 million to the global effort against the virus.
“To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,” he will tell delegates, according to his office.
“The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed.”
Dozens of research projects are under way around the world to find a vaccine, which the United Nations has said is the only way for a return to normal life.
On Thursday, British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced a partnership with Oxford University for the large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently on trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shocking pics of Wuhan scientists handling bat samples deleted from website of institute blamed for coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WORRYING photographs of scientists handling bat samples have been deleted from the website of the institute blamed for the coronavirus pandemic.
The images - which reveal a shocking lack of safety - were taken down by the Wuhan Institute of Virology after diplomats and scientists raised the alarm about its work.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates on Covid-19
And it appears to have also removed all reference to a visit in March 2018 by Rick Switzer, a science and technology expert from the US embassy in Beijing who then raised the alert.
As a result of his visit, cables were sent to the US State Department from the embassy warning about the risks of  experiments on bats.
One read: "During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory."
US and British intelligence officials suspect bungling scientists at the science hub spread the killer disease during risky coronavirus tests on bats.
And President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he had seen intelligence that gave him a "high degree of confidence'" that the global crisis had its origins in the institute.
It was claimed that Covid-19 was "developed in the Wuhan lab as China hoped to prove it's greater than the US at battling deadly diseases".
The Sun has already revealed a page of the Wuhan institute’s website - deleted suddenly last month - showed no safety precautions were employed.
One worker admitted being sprayed with bat blood or urine as images showed staff brazenly collecting samples with no face masks or protective suits.
Incredibly some scientists didn’t even wear gloves as they entered caves to collect fecal bat swab samples, beaming for the camera and oblivious to the dangers.
The damning photos tell a different story to an official 2017 journal, when the institute insisted: "Bat samplings were conducted ten times from April 2011 to October 2015 at different seasons in their natural habitat at a single location (cave) in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.
“All members of field teams wore appropriate personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, tear-resistant gloves, disposable outerwear, and safety glasses.
“Bats were trapped and fecal swab samples were collected as described previously.”
One of the party even gave an interview to state-run news agency Xinhua, admitting he forgot his protective gear and was sprayed with bat urine or blood.
Intelligence sources in the US and UK were “monitoring the deleted photos with great interest”, The Sun was told.
Matthew Henderson, director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, and a former British diplomat in China, told The Sun: "China has still not clearly explained how the outbreak started, without it we are obliged to draw our own conclusions.
“There is ample evidence of such a cavalier approach to biosecurity by Chinese scientists based in Wuhan laboratories that it is no surprise that western Governments are now seriously considering whether COVID-19 could have escaped from one."
Earlier this month photos from the same Wuhan lab showed a broken seal on a store containing 1,500 virus strains - including the bat coronavirus linked to the devastating pandemic.
The images were published by the state-owned China Daily before they too were swiftly deleted.
A picture of the fridge-freezer revealed a flimsy loose seal on the door, as a lab worker pulled out a chilled box containing deadly samples while wearing gloves and a mask.
Several insiders claimed the deadly bug wasn't manufactured as a bioweapon but to prove China was on par with - or superior to - the US, in its ability to fight infections.
“Patient zero" was a laboratory worker at the Wuhan lab who spread the virus into the community, sources said.
When President Trump was asked about the extraordinary claims, he said: "More and more we’re hearing the story.
"And we'll see. We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened."
Blaming the Wuhan meat market - where bats are not sold - was reportedly an effort to deflect blame from the communist government when the lab's containment efforts failed.
US officials warned two years ago that safety lapses during the study of bats could lead to a coronavirus outbreak.
Secret cables from American embassy officials were obtained following their 2018 visits to the Wuhan lab now at the centre of a global focus.
The missives revealed fears of inadequate safety precautions by those conducting the bat studies could result in a deadly new strain of coronavirus.
One US official said: “The cable was a warning shot. They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”
The cables reveal that the US Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
In 2015, the lab had become China’s first to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety.
But the cables argued that the US should give the Wuhan lab further support – because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but dangerous.
In 2017 the institute published research showing that horseshoe bats they collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same population that spawned the 2003 SARS virus.
The Chinese government has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins.
Beijing has yet to provide samples of the coronavirus collected from the earliest cases.
Officials at the Wuhan lab have dismissed allegations coronavirus came from their facility, branding them ‘baseless conspiracy theories’.
But genetic evidence indicates the virus was not artificially engineered and likely originated in bats.
The genetic data cannot yet indicate exactly where and how the virus first crossed to humans.
China President Xi Jinping warned the public about the virus on January 20 - when more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence.
During the six days the world was unaware of the virus, the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the global outbreak - hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people, and millions began to travel through for Lunar New Year celebrations.
On March 11, the virus was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
Other reports have also emerged alleging China attempted to cover up its role in the extent of the pandemic by silencing whistleblowers and muzzling scientists, while concerned doctors have ominously disappeared.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chinese lab removes photos of scientists working on coronaviruses ahead of global outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A laboratory in Wuhan city of China has removed photographs of the scientists from its website which purportedly showed the Chinese scientists taking swabs from bats carrying coronaviruses ahead of the global spread of COVID-19 disease.
The Institute of Virology of Wuhan removed the photographs amid growing pressures being levied on China by the Western States including the United States.
It also edited the references to visits by US diplomats who subsequently raised the alarm about the laboratory’s work on bats, according to Mail Online.
A reference regarding the visit of Rick Switzer, a science and technology expert from the US embassy in Beijing has also been removed from the website of the institute.
Cables were sent to the State Department from the embassy of the United States following the visit by Switzer which read: “During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they [the diplomats] noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.”
Last month, The Mail on Sunday published alarming pictures from inside the institute showing a broken seal on the door of one of the refrigerators holding 1,500 different strains of virus.
This comes as President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had seen intelligence which gave him a ‘high degree of confidence’ that the global crisis had its origins in the institute.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scientists to test sewage for years to track COVID bug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victorian’s sewage looks set to be monitored for COVID-19 outbreaks for years after the current pandemic, with the state’s effluent a potential early warning system for new outbreaks.
Scientists from Melbourne Water have been quietly taking samples of sewage from around the city for weeks and working on a diagnostic test for the virus.
They hope this will lead to an early-warning system that senses an outbreak before it shows up in clinical testing.
The project team believes it could be just weeks away from a reliable method of detecting COVID-19 in sewage, with overseas experience suggesting surveillance of human waste can be a powerful weapon in public health officials' armoury against the virus.
Testing sewage for viruses is not new, said project manager Dan Deere, who has been hired by national body Water Research Australia to work on what has become a nationwide effort. The periodic monitoring for polio have taken place for decades.
Dr Deere said there is a lot of science to be done before a working sewage surveillance system is in place for COVID-19.
“We know we can test sewage and find diseases,” he said.
“The problem in this case is that this is a new virus and the methods for testing for it haven’t been through the usual rigour.”
Dr Deere said once a reliable test was in place, along with the know-how to use it most effectively, the team could move to “phase three” of their task – “routine surveillance”.
“This may go on for a year or two when the health department would say they want us to and test Ballarat or Shepparton and do it once a month or once a week and keep going,” Dr Deere said.
The science could also be used to detect COVID-19 in small enclosed environments such as planes and cruise ships.
But developing the test is a big job, with 12 water utilities around Australia, six health departments and 10 research organisations involved.
Nick Crosbie from Melbourne Water is leading a team that is working out the best way to sample wastewater, finding the best points in the sewage systems of Victoria’s towns and cities to tell him and his colleagues if COVID-19 is lurking in local populations.
But the detection method must be sensitive enough to be able to track down the killer bug in waste from large populations, Dr Crosbie said.
“If you take, say [Werribee’s] Western Treatment Plant, there are over 2 million people in that catchment,” he said.
“Likewise if you take a small town of say 40,000 people, if you have a sensitive method and you were able to detect COVID with that method, then that gives you another line of information to provide to health authorities.
“It won’t replace clinical testing, its additional information they can use to help target their screening and also to see if there’s anything unexpected.”
Early reports from the US, France and the Netherlands have raised hopes and Dr Crosbie said he is cautiously optimistic.
“You’d call it high risk, high gain,” he said.
“It’s technically challenging so its high risk but if you can crack that technical nut and the preliminary evidence from overseas is promising, then it’s high gain because you’d have that ability to screen a large population efficiently.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Wars threat: study
The Star Wars military program had the potential to “tear the Western Alliance apart”, the Australian-born director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Dr Robert O’Neil, said. Star Wars, officially called the Strategic Defence Initiative, had reopened the old arguments of the late '60s about the desirability of anti-ballistic missile systems. Dr O’Neil was launching the institute’s 1984-85 Strategic Survey.
No sale of the century
“A champion contestant on the television quiz show Sale of the Century has been forced to return all her prizes after the producers discovered she had appeared on the program before,” wrote entertainment reporter Richard Glover. “She did well during her first appearances on the show 2½ years ago. During her second try, recorded over the past few weeks, the woman did even better, winning eight episodes.”
Rector quits over wine
“An Anglican rector is to quit his parish in a dispute concerning the use of non-alcoholic grape juice in Holy Communion. The Rev Lance Keogh, rector of St Barnabas’s, Oberon, is at loggerheads with the Bishop of Bathurst, the Rt Rev Howell Witt, who adopts the traditional line that fermented or alcoholic wine should be used. It was hinted that the rector was concerned with the situation of recovered alcoholics.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the Geula neighborhood of Jerusalem, a special Coronavirus swab samples station was activated recently.
The station, built in a container, developed by the IDF and MDA, is designated to swab civilians without signs and symptoms who may reach the location on foot. The name of the station is "Keren Or" – "A ray of light", it includes 6 windows enabling teams to take hundreds of samples a day. Until now 3,166 people have been sampled.
Due to its unique design, the "Keren Or" station can be relocated on the back of a truck, and maintain the public order and social distancing procedures during operations. MDA team members are operating the station and the technical aspects are the responsibility of the soldiers and officers IDF's Technology Brigade.
The new innovative station was stationed at the Shneller compound, located in Jerusalem's Geula neighborhood, and order was kept by ushers in order to maintain social distancing. The MDA sampling teams sitting inside the container are protected by a high pressure air system that pushes out the air and maintains a fully sterile environment.
Brigadier General Tal Aharon the head of the IDF Technology & Logistics Brigade: "the mobile lab was developed by the technology division who worked day and night in order to quickly find an innovative solution and assist in the battle against the Coronavirus outbreak. The mobile station is able to conduct multiple swab samples in a relatively short amount time and by doing so assisted in reducing the rate of infection and maintaining the safety of the medical teams. The Technology and Logistics Brigade as well as all the IDF will continue to assist in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak".
MDA Director General Eli Bin: "the Keren Or station is an amazing development by the IDF Technology & Logistics Brigade, that placed the public health at the front and utilized their knowledge and expertise for the Israeli citizens. This development, like the DriveThru compounds, has a crucial role in the struggle against the Coronavirus outbreak, and make it possible to increase the number of swab samples taken throughout the country, while maintaining the safety of the Israeli public and the MDA teams. MDA will continue to be at the forefront of the struggle against the Coronavirus outbreak, with hope for better days soon".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Random coronavirus testing indicates nearly a third of Kabul could be infected</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some countries have been receiving relatively good news about their coronavirus epidemics — Spain for instance is easing restrictions thanks to a dwindling case load, and Madrid just reported its lowest one-day death increase since March 18. South Korea, meanwhile, reported only 13 new cases Sunday, and is getting prepared to rollback some elements of its lockdown, as well. But those positive steps are far from a global trend.
India and Russia both reported record daily infections, while deaths continue to climb in the United States and the United Kingdom. One country that has people particularly worried is Afghanistan, where the health ministry revealed Sunday that a small study indicates about a third of Kabul's residents could be infected with COVID-19. The study involved 500 random COVID-19 tests that resulted in 156 positives. Overall, Afghanistan has taken close to 12,000 samples, with 2,700 coming back positive.
The latest news has officials worried the disease is spreading more rapidly than originally thought. Afghanistan has long been seen as a country vulnerable to the pandemic, especially as the government and the Taliban struggle to broker a peace deal to end their violent, decades-long conflict. Kabul and other cities in the country are on lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oxford scientist says if coronavirus vaccine is effective it will likely be seasonal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir John Bell, an immunologist and the Regius Chair of Medicine at the University of Oxford, said we'll probably know pretty soon whether Oxford's highly anticipated coronavirus vaccine works.
Bell told NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday's edition of Meet the Press that researchers will likely "get a signal by June" about the vaccine's efficacy. The Oxford vaccine has made waves because of the rapid and unprecedented pace of its development and the possibility that it could hit the market in a limited capacity during the fall.
If it does prove successful — and Bell's tempered opinion is that "prospects are pretty good" — it likely won't be a one-time vaccine. Bell said as far as anyone can tell the coronavirus doesn't mutate quite as easily as the flu, whose vaccine needs to updated every year to keep up with the changes, but there's a lot that still needs to be learned about potential immunity to the new virus, so chances are seasonal vaccination will be the norm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JERUSALEM (AP) — Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, winner of the 2020 Genesis Prize, announced Monday that he will donate the $1 million award to organizations fighting the coronavirus pandemic and assisting people most affected by the outbreak.
In a statement released by prize organizers, Sharansky said he would support organizations in Israel and abroad, some delivering immediate relief to victims and others pursuing longer-term research against the disease. In forgoing the prize money, he follows a tradition set by previous winners.
“Many people of good will around the world have given generously to help organizations and individuals who have been devastated by COVID-19. I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this humanitarian effort,” Sharansky said.
The Genesis Prize Foundation said donations would go to organizations providing emergency services to Jerusalem residents of all faiths, and assisting severely disabled children, domestic violence victims, African migrants in Tel Aviv and people in need of mental health services.
He will also support research at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science, Columbia University and New York University, and help elderly Jewish communities overseas.
The $1 million award is granted each year to a person recognized for outstanding professional achievement, contribution to humanity and commitment to Jewish values.

Sharansky rose to prominence in the 1970s as a dissident in the Soviet Union, where he worked closely with the human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andre Sakharov. He was a founding member of the Helsinki Group, which monitored rights abuses by the Soviets, and became one of the best-known “refuseniks,” Soviet Jews who were denied permission to emigrate to Israel.
In 1977, Sharansky was imprisoned on fabricated charges of spying for the United States. He spent nine years in prison, serving much of that time in solitary confinement.
Sharansky was freed in a prisoner swap in 1986 after an intense international campaign led by his wife, Avital, and immediately moved to Israel.
The following year, he led a demonstration in Washington where, on the eve of a visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, some 250,000 Jews called for an end to persecution of Soviet Jews and for the freedom for them to emigrate. Gorbachev subsequently opened the country’s borders, clearing the way for an estimated 1.6 million Jews to emigrate.
In Israel, Sharansky has spent a lengthy career in politics and public service. He also has authored three books and received a number of prestigious recognitions, including Israel’s highest award, the Israel Prize, as well as the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medal.

Like power lines in an electrical grid, long wiry projections that grow outward from neurons -- structures known as axons -- form interconnected communication networks that run from the brain to all parts of the body. But unlike an outage in a power line, which can be fixed, a break in an axon is permanent. Each year thousands of patients confront this reality, facing life-long losses in sensation and motor function from spinal cord injury and related conditions in which axons are badly damaged or severed.New research by scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine Temple University (LKSOM) shows, however, that gains in functional recovery from these injuries may be possible, thanks to a molecule known as Lin28, which regulates cell growth. In a study published online in the journal Molecular Therapy, the Temple researchers describe the ability of Lin28 -- when expressed above its usual levels -- to fuel axon regrowth in mice with spinal cord injury or optic nerve injury, enabling repair of the body's communication grid."Our findings show that Lin28 is a major regulator of axon regeneration and a promising therapeutic target for central nervous system injuries," explained Shuxin Li, MD, PhD, Professor of Anatomy and Cell Biology and in the Shriners Hospitals Pediatric Research Center at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and senior investigator on the new study. The research is the first to demonstrate the regenerative ability of Lin28 upregulation in the injured spinal cord of animals."We became interested in Lin28 as a target for neuron regeneration because it acts as a gatekeeper of stem cell activity," said Dr. Li. "It controls the switch that maintains stem cells or allows them to differentiate and potentially contribute to activities such as axon regeneration."To explore the effects of Lin28 on axon regrowth, Dr. Li and colleagues developed a mouse model in which animals expressed extra Lin28 in some of their tissues. When full-grown, the animals were divided into groups that sustained spinal cord injury or injury to the optic nerve tracts that connect to the retina in the eye.Another set of adult mice, with normal Lin28 expression and similar injuries, were given injections of a viral vector (a type of carrier) for Lin28 to examine the molecule's direct effects on tissue repair.Extra Lin28 stimulated long-distance axon regeneration in all instances, though the most dramatic effects were observed following post-injury injection of Lin28. In mice with spinal cord injury, Lin28 injection resulted in the growth of axons to more than three millimeters beyond the area of axon damage, while in animals with optic nerve injury, axons regrew the entire length of the optic nerve tract. Evaluation of walking and sensory abilities after Lin28 treatment revealed significant improvements in coordination and sensation."We observed a lot of axon regrowth, which could be very significant clinically, since there currently are no regenerative treatments for spinal cord injury or optic nerve injury," Dr. Li explained.One of his goals in the near-term is to identify a safe and effective means of getting Lin28 to injured tissues in human patients. To do so, his team of researchers will need to develop a vector, or carrier system for Lin28, that can be injected systemically and then hone in on injured axons to deliver the therapy directly to multiple populations of damaged neurons.Dr. Li further wants to decipher the molecular details of the Lin28 signaling pathway. "Lin28 associates closely with other growth signaling molecules, and we suspect it uses multiple pathways to regulate cell growth," he explained. These other molecules could potentially be packaged along with Lin28 to aid neuron repair.Reference:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Related stories about antibiotics:</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antibiotics are a popular group of medicines that help the body fight bacterial infections. In 2017, alone, physicians wrote Americans around 260 million antibiotic prescriptions, according to the Center for Disease Control.
Here’s what you need to know about this essential class of medication.
Antibiotics treat bacterial infections in a few different ways that involve disrupting various parts of the way bacteria survive and multiply in the human body.
Bacteria have cell walls that help protect them against the harsh environment inside you. These cell walls protect the fragile interior that contains the DNA and essential proteins that bacteria use to reproduce asexually. Antibiotics often work in one of three ways:
Bactericidal antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria outright. Examples include penicillin, vancomycin, and cephalosporin.
Bacteriostatic antibiotics are drugs that prevent bacteria from multiplying. Examples include antibiotics include ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and rifamycin.
Some antibiotics can both kill bacteria and prevent farther growth. It just depends on the dose you’re prescribed as well as how far your bacterial infection has progressed.
Doctors prescribe antibiotics for all types of bacterial infections from minor strep throat or urinary tract infections to severe, life-threatening conditions such as bacterial pneumonia or sepsis.
“The properties of some antibiotics make them amenable to other medical conditions, as well,” says Anthony Kaveh, MD, physician anesthesiologist, and integrative medicine specialist. For example, the quinolone and tetracycline groups of antibiotics are used in anti-malarial therapy.
Certain antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory effects, which may be useful in treating inflammation caused by a viral infection. For example, researchers are investigating how the antibiotic azithromycin may help reduce inflammation, may also help COVID-19 patients.
However, Kaveh points out that, “We are still learning about this effect of antibiotics. Azithromycin is one of these antibiotics. It is possible that some of the reported success from azithromycin is from its anti-inflammatory effect.”
Depending on the type of infection, a physician may prescribe you one of two types of antibiotics: broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria, whereas narrow-spectrum antibiotics attack specific types of bacteria.
Physicians will often times try to prescribe narrow-spectrum antibiotics when they know which bacteria caused the infection. For example in pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, a physician may prescribe benzylpenicillin.
Because using broad-spectrum antibiotics unnecessarily can contribute to antibiotic resistance. “Unfortunately, the side effects of antibiotics must be taken into account […]. In particular, bacterial resistance must be considered whenever using antibiotics for non-bacterial infections,” says Kaveh.
Scientists agree that antibiotics don’t directly affect SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. That’s because “antibiotics do not treat viral infections,” says Kaveh.
Yet, figures from China show that a large percentage of patients with severe cases of COVID-19 receive antibiotics. But it’s not the viral infection they’re treating.
Often times it’s a secondary bacterial infection that patients develop due to a weakened immune system. In a review of 247 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China, the researchers found that 15% of survivors and 50% of those who died, acquired secondary bacterial infections.
COVID-19 isn’t the only disease that causes dangerous secondary infections. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the CDC estimates that globally 151,700 – 575,400 people died. Around half of these deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia.
So physicians may prescribe an antibiotic as a precautionary measure. “We do not yet have accurate tools for determining when an infection is bacterial or viral, and in those cases, an antibiotic may be given empirically if deemed appropriate by the physician,” says Kaveh.
Antibiotics start working almost immediately. For example, amoxicillin takes about one hour to reach peak levels in the body. However, a person may not feel symptom relief until later.
“Antibiotics will typically show improvement in patients with bacterial infections within one to three days,” says Kaveh. This is because for many illnesses the body’s immune response is what causes some of the symptoms, and it can take time for the immune system to calm down after the harmful bacteria are destroyed.
Some antibiotics, such as fosfomycin that’s used to treat certain cases of UTIs, work immediately and usually only require one dose. Other antibiotics, including tetracycline that’s used to treat a wide range of conditions from acne to syphilis, may take several weeks of treatment with multiple doses before the patient notices any improvement in symptoms.
“The timeframe depends on the type of infection and whether the bacteria are susceptible to that particular antibiotic,” says Kaveh.
It’s important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better beforehand.
Because if you discontinue the treatment early you may not eliminate enough bacteria, and the condition could re-occur, as surviving bacteria multiply. Doing so also contributes to the growing issue of antibiotic resistance.
However, in the continued battle against antibiotic-resistant superbugs, researchers have started to study the dosage amount. A growing body of evidence suggests that shorter regimes of antibiotic treatment may be just as effective as the longer courses traditionally prescribed.
However, more research is needed so you should still complete the full course of antibiotics you’re prescribed for an infection.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ‘class divide’ among Covid-19 victims features prominently in the nation’s papers on Saturday.
The plight of Britain’s poorer areas in the coronavirus crisis and moves to ease lockdown measures are among the main topics on Saturday’s front pages.
The Daily Mirror and The Independent say people living in poorer parts of Britain are twice as likely to die of Covid-19 as those in the richest places, a situation The Guardian calls the “UK’s corona divide”.
The Sun reports on Boris Johnson’s goal to have Britain back at work from May 26, and Premier League’s possible June 12 return.
The i leads on the key factors which would lead to the end of the UK’s lockdown.
These could include the relaxation of the two-metre distancing guideline, according to The Daily Telegraph.
The Financial Times says offices in the UK are set to stay shut “for months”, while The Times leads on a possible “fever test for commuters”.
The Daily Mail reports on a fund set up for the purchase of personal protection equipment.
The Daily Express leads on Health Secretary Matt Hancock reaching his target by hitting 122,000 coronavirus tests in one day.
And the Daily Star says “hungry, disease-spreading rats” are invading homes in search for food.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pop diva Madonna has revealed that she has tested positive for the COVID-19 anitbodies.
The singer shared the news in the 14th edition of her “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram TV.
“Took a test the other day and I found out that I have the antibodies. So tomorrow I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car, and I’m gonna roll down the window and I’m gonna breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining,” Madonna said.
According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US, antibody tests are used to determine whether or not a person has been exposed to COVID-19 by finding proteins the body produces to fight the virus. However, the CDC has yet to confirm if the possession of antibodies is equal to immunity.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Singer Madonna says she plans to “breathe in the COVID-19 air” after testing positive for antibodies.
The 61year-old took to Instagram on Thursday to post a video that she called Quarantine Diaries No. 14, reports people.com.
“I took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies,” Madonna said in the clip, in which she uses a typewriter.
She added that she plans to spend some time out of her house.
“So tomorrow I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car, I’m going to roll down the window and I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining,” she said in the video.
She concluded by saying: “Here’s the good news: tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”
Madonna also shared a few photos on her Instagram Story, with “#staysafe” and “#staysane” written on them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Say There Were a Black Hole in Our Solar System: How Would We Find It?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year, scientists published a paper with an iconic diagram: a black circle representing, to scale, a 5-solar-mass black hole – and the size of the hypothetical Planet Nine if it were a black hole instead of a planet. So, if Planet Nine really is a black hole, how would we find it?
Physicist Edward Witten, famed theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study, has an idea. All it requires is an army of small, laser-launched spacecraft with really accurate clocks.
The solar system, at present, has eight planets and a host of dwarf planets (including former planet Pluto). But astronomers have long wondered whether there could be a large ninth planet beyond Neptune that has so far eluded telescopes. Evidence for this planet stems from the strange collective motion of rocks past Neptune; they seem to move as if another massive object, five to 10 times the mass of Earth, were orbiting out there.
Telescope searches haven’t found Planet Nine, nor have they proven that it doesn’t exist. But last September, scientists James Unwin at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Jakub Scholtz at Durham University released a paper suggesting that Planet Nine could be a black hole that has stuck around since the beginning of the universe and now orbits the Sun. They realised that they’d made a provocative proposal and that their theory was unlikely, but they hoped that scientists would open their minds to looking for a ninth planet in different ways, such as with gamma-ray telescopes.
Witten took the idea a step further and imagined a mission specifically to hunt for Planet Nine assuming it were a black hole, publishing his paper on the arXiv physics preprint server. The work has not been peer reviewed.
The proposed mission relies on the Breakthrough Starshot proposal, where lasers on Earth are used to guide and power ultra-light spacecraft weighing just a few grams each. Witten proposes that you could send out a thousand of these spacecraft travelling fast enough to reach a distance of 500 AU (Pluto’s distance from the Sun is around 40 AU, on average). Each of these spacecraft would send timing information back to Earth. Slight changes to one of the spacecraft’s clocks could signal that it had intersected the strong gravitational field of tiny black hole.
So should we start building these craft? No, not yet. Witten said that the proposal should follow telescope searches or other, less conventional hunts. And it wouldn’t be easy. “Sufficiently accurate timekeeping in a miniature spacecraft may be the biggest obstacle to this project, though there are numerous other challenges,” Witten wrote. But hey, NASA is currently in the midst of testing an atomic clock for deep-space exploration, so many a breakthrough is on the horizon.
It’s good to know we have a backup plan for finding Planet Nine, should searching with telescopes alone fail us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Killer Asian Giant Hornets Discovered in U.S. for First Time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Asia’s ‘murder hornets’ were spotted in the United States for the first time recently, causing scientists to worry that the insect might be colonizing.
“In Japan, the hornets kill up to 50 people a year. Now, for the first time, they have arrived in the United States,” the New York Times reported Saturday.
The article continued:
The initial sightings occurred in Washington state in December, and scientists have since launched a full-scale hunt for the deadly pest over concerns it might “establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost,” the Times noted.
During the winter, state agriculture biologists and local beekeepers joined forces and set up traps to find and kill the hornets.
“This is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can’t do it in the next couple of years, it probably can’t be done,” said Chris Looney, an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture.
Sunday, ABC 13 shared a photo of an Asian giant hornet on Twitter.
An infestation of the hornets could be devastating for beekeepers who bring their hives to Washington state to pollinate Northwest Pacific crops such as cherries, blueberries, and apples, according to UPI.
“Commercial beekeepers have 300 to 400 hives in the area,” said Timothy Lawrence, director of the Island County extension office at Washington State University. “They may not want to go to certain counties if this infestation takes hold.”
Global economies and travel to and from distant places have caused invasive species to be more common, according to Todd Murray, a Washington State University extension entomologist.
“When we do get establishment of a new invasive species, its’ [sic] a ‘forever change,’ and becomes something we learn to live with,” he explained, adding, “This is definitely a hornet I don’t want to learn to live with.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Asian giant hornets - aka the 'murder hornet' - expected back in B.C.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER -- With a terrifying new moniker, social media is abuzz with tales of the "murder hornet," an flying insect that rips bees apart and "carries a painful, sometimes lethal sting," according to entomologists at Washington State University.
The Asian giant hornet has been spotted for the first time in Washington State, setting off a wave of media coverage that has resonated with the "end times" feeling of the spring of 2020.
But Asian giant hornets have been in British Columbia for some time, with the first hornets spotted near Nanaimo in August 2019. The provincial government has warned that they'll likely return this spring and summer after they wake up from winter nesting.
Two Asian giant hornets were discovered near Blaine, Wash. in December, and one was found in White Rock in November.
"These findings indicate a probability that nesting hornets are overwintering in the area," the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement March 20.
Residents who live along the B.C.-Washington border could be the first to spot the Asian giant hornet this year. The hornet prefers wooded areas, which proliferate along the border, so the Ministry of Agriculture has warned residents who live near Zero Avenue, from Surrey to Aldergrove, to be on the lookout for the hornets and to report any sightings to the Invasive Species Council of BC by calling 1-888-933-3722 or visiting online at https://bcinvasives.ca/report.
The hornets make their nests in the ground and not in trees or buildings. If people stumble upon a nest, officials recommend that they avoid it and leave the area immediately.
A provincial apiculturist also set up traps in the area to catch hornets.
The hornet's stinger can pierce through normal beekeepers' suits, according to Washington State University. In fact, the Washington State Department of Agriculture has ordered special suits from China to help tackle the creatures.
WSU researchers describe their stings as "big and painful, with a potent neurotoxin" and caution they can even be lethal, warning "multiple stings can kill humans, even if they are not allergic." They also warn the public not to attempt to deal with the hornets themselves.
Despite this terrifying description, B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture says the hornets are not usually interested in humans, pets or livestock. Rather, they eat honeybees — a significant concern since pollinating bee populations are already struggling.
But if the hornets' nests are disturbed, "they will attack with painful stings, which can be hazardous to people’s health," according to the ministry.
The B.C. Ministry of Agriculture describes Asian giant hornets as "large compared to other hornets, with noticeably large orange heads and black eyes." Worker hornets are around 3.5 centimetres in length, while queens can be up to four cm to five cm in length, with a wingspan of four cm to seven cm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A giant panda loaned by China to a Dutch zoo as part of a breeding pair has given birth to a cub.
Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub “are staying in the maternity den and are doing well”.
The zoo said following Friday’s birth that it is “delighted and proud to contribute to the protection of this endangered species in a natural way”.
Wu Wen and male panda Xing Ya arrived in the Netherlands from Sichuan province in 2017, as part of a loan programme. The zoo said the new cub also belongs to China and can remain in the Netherlands for four years before going to China to join the breeding programme there.
Around 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, the majority within China, while an estimated 1,864 live in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant panda gives birth at Dutch zoo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A giant panda loaned by China to a Dutch zoo as part of a breeding pair has given birth to a cub.
Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub “are staying in the maternity den and are doing well”.
The zoo said following Friday’s birth that it is “delighted and proud to contribute to the protection of this endangered species in a natural way”.
The new cub’s gender will not be known until it leaves the maternity den, likely in a few months’ time, with its mother.
Wu Wen and male panda Xing Ya arrived in the Netherlands from Sichuan province in 2017, as part of a loan programme. The zoo said the new cub also belongs to China and can remain in the Netherlands for four years before going to China to join the breeding programme there.
Around 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, the majority within China, while an estimated 1,864 live in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Baby wipes are not meant to kill germs or viruses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Baby wipes don’t kill germs because they’re not designed to. In this article, we discuss the ingredients in baby wipes, why they’re not designed to kill germs, and how to keep you and your baby clean through the whole diaper changing.
Baby wipes are designed mostly to clean the poop off a baby’s bottom without damaging the skin or making it red and sore. To do this, baby wipes are made from cloth, that’s soaked in a water-based solution and contains softeners and conditioners like aloe vera. Baby wipes may also contain preservatives.
But what baby wipes don’t include are germ-killing disinfectants. For example if you compare a baby wipe with what’s in a traditional disinfecting wipe – in the disinfecting wipe you’ll find sodium hypochlorite, the germ-killing ingredient in many bleach-based cleaning products. There’s also an antimicrobial ingredient called Alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride that’s common in household disinfectants.
For more information on which cleaners do – and do not – kill bacteria and viruses, check out our guide on how to kill germs.
The reason baby wipes don’t contain disinfectants, and therefore don’t kill germs is that “a baby’s skin is very sensitive because it hasn’t been exposed to a lot of things,” says Ilan Shapiro, MD, a pediatrician and medical director of health education and wellness for AltaMed Health Services in California.
Therefore, don’t use a household cleaning wipe on your baby because they’re not designed to be used on a person’s skin. Similarly, don’t bother using your baby wipes as makeshift wipes for cleaning and sanitizing your counters and faucets because they don’t contain those disinfecting agents.
Don’t rely on a baby wipe to get your hands clean. If you’re worried about germs, it’s really not enough to swab your hands with a baby wipe after a diaper change, according to Shapiro.
“The most important part is washing your hands,” he says.
So, when changing a baby’s diaper, follow these steps to be sure that everyone’s clean:
The bottom line on clean bottoms: a baby wipe is good for getting the situation clean, but not sterile. To really kill off the germs, opt for soap and water.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus 2 May: at a glance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
At least 3,334,406people have been infected and at least 238,787 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.
The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.
UK health secretary Matt Hancock has been accused of changing the criteria for counting Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,00 per day. But critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday were tests that had been mailed to addresses and had not been carried out.
Top US health official Anthony Fauci will not testify next week to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the White House said on Friday, calling it “counterproductive” to have individuals involved in the response testify. Also in the US, a New York nursing home has reported 98 residents have died from the disease.
Medics, funeral workers and gravediggers in Somaliahave reported an unprecedented surge of deaths in recent days amid growing fears that official counts of Covid-19 deaths reflect only a fraction of the virus’s toll in Africa .
Singapore’s health minister says the city-state will relax some anti-coronavirus measures after a fall in the number of cases in the broader community. Some businesses will be allowed to open again after 12 May while some schools will reopen from 19 May. Singapore saw cases flare up recently in a second wave as infections spiked in its crowded migrant worker dormitories.
The US congress has launched an investigation into the conduct of Carnival Cruise Line over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, questioning why the company did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival’s ships, which saw major outbreaks at least nine ships including the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. Many cruise ship crew remain trapped on board cruise ships around the world.
Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country’s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Over 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday’s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers live, rights groups had said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How coronavirus is spurring the cause of a united Ireland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The outset of the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland was beset with political disputes. First Minister Arlene Foster, of the DUP, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, of Sinn Féin, held opposing views about the closure of schools, universities and childcare facilities. In the Republic, schools were closed by 13 March, but the UK planned to close schools a week later, on 20 March. As often happens, the situation in the North evoked the Irish saying idir dhá stól, a shorthand for falling between two stools, neither here nor there.
While the Irish government offered grave clarity, the North remained caught up in the UK government’s widely criticised tactics. These divergent responses to coronavirus established an accidental case study of two separate but overlapping approaches to the pandemic taking place on the same island – something researchers will no doubt pore over in the future.
The Irish caretaker taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had spoken to Boris Johnson about the island of Ireland being one epidemiological unit, but the political divisions north of the border did not allow for that. Instead, different approaches were taken at the crucial first stage of the pandemic. While the British government leapfrogged over the containment phase, largely abandoning the WHO’s mantra of “test, test, test”, the Irish government scrambled to keep a lid on things, gradually introducing early lockdown measures, which benefitted from huge public cooperation. One of the most frequent refrains here in the patter of Covid smalltalk among friends and neighbours is “at least we’re not in England or America”. But of course, part of the island is in the UK.
Border counties are experiencing a different pattern of cases compared with much of the rest of the Republic. The border county of Cavan now has the highest number of cases relative to its population, even though it is only the 25th largest county by population in Ireland. Early on during the pandemic, it was reported that up to 70 healthcare workers in Cavan general hospital had contracted Covid-19, and there are also clusters of cases in residential-care settings in the region. While Dublin and its surrounding counties have been the worst affected, the border counties of Louth, Donegal and Monaghan have a higher rate of infection than those further south.
The tendency to jump to a conclusion that the number of cases in border counties is related to the porous nature of the border itself, and so is a consequence of travel between north and south, may be misleading. We just don’t know yet. Ireland’s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, who has cut a stoic figure throughout the crisis, has said it is unlikely that the high rate of infection in border counties is due to a “spillover” from the North.
The public health doctor Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, has said such hotspots require investigation. Scally lambasted the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on Twitter, saying the department “is in deep and very hot water over their provision of statistics about Covid-19. I’ve been very critical of their dreadful performance, and now the UK Statistics Authority have quite correctly, reprimanded them.” He referenced a letter from Ed Humpherson, the director general for regulation at the statistics authority to Richard Pengelly, the permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Health, indicating that speculation about border cases is just one element of a wider issue about statistics related to the pandemic in the North.
Right now, people are viewing the question of Irish unity through the lens of epidemiology. The pandemic is many things, but it is political, and so too will be its consequences. The DUP showed that it was content to sacrifice the economic stability of Northern Ireland in pursuit of the empty, jingoistic rhetoric of Brexit, and at the outset of this pandemic, it did seem that public health was playing second fiddle to the party’s lemming-like tendency to follow Westminster’s instruction.
Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil’s recent (and vague) framework document for government formation, drafted as bait for the smaller parties they need to form their “grand coalition”, having frozen Sinn Féin out of the process, tried on some of its policies, which essentially represent the mandate for “change” voted for in the recent general election. One of the document’s proposals is to establish a unit in the taoiseach’s department “to work towards a consensus on a united island”, signifying a growing political case for a united Ireland, as well as something of an appeal to Sinn Féin’s massively increased voter base.
Unexpected events often act as a catalyst for finding new pathways towards a goal. Nobody could have conceived that the case for a united Ireland would dovetail with the now urgent practicalities of a united approach to a public health crisis. But the big ideas we have about society often don’t pan out how we anticipate. Eradicating the border’s segmentation of two jurisdictions has been a peacetime issue, a Brexit issue and is now a public health issue.
“Disease knows no border. We have to work on all-island collective basis in what is an emerging crisis,” O’Neill said early on, a narrative that has continued through the course of the pandemic. “It’s pure common sense that we need an all-island and a unified approach in dealing with this pandemic,” Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said on an RTÉ radio programme, after she was praised for the low-key manner with which she dealt with a nasty bout of Covid-19, removing herself from the spotlight and only emerging when she recovered. And it’s not just politicians proposing a unified Ireland in this context. The University of Limerick’s professor of general practice, Liam Glynn, told the Irish Times, “Anything other than an all-Ireland approach is bananas. We are an island.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
At least 3,357,450people have been infected and at least 238,787 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.
The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak, due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.
Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country’s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. More than 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday’s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum seekers live, rights groups said.
Russia has had another record daily increase, with 9,623 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the total to 124,054.
Reuters reported the nationwide death toll rose to 1,222 after 57 people died in the previous 24 hours, according to Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre. Russia has been in partial lockdown since the end of March.
The mayor of Moscow said about 2% of the city’s population, more than 250,000 people, had the virus.
Officials have allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19.
Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19.
A nursing home in New York has reported a “horrifying” death toll of 98 people from Covid-19 as residential facilities continue to emerge as a deadly source of outbreaks around the world.
The death toll at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan is one of the worst such outbreaks in the US and caused a shock even in hard-hit New York, where the official state tally of nursing home deaths listed only 13 at that particular home as of Friday.
)fficials at the 705-bed centre later confirmed that up to 46 residents who tested positive for Covid-19 had died, as well as an additional 52 people suspected to have had the virus, Associated Press reported. Some died at the nursing home and others in hospitals.
The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been accused of changing the criteria for counting Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,000 a day. Critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday were tests that had been mailed to addresses but not yet carried out.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If we are to return to our normal lives, we need answers to many questions and they will only be delivered by science and medicine and their applications. In fact, the speed with which the virus has spread around the globe has been matched by the speed with which many scientists have mobilised themselves to take on this pandemic.
The British science community has responded rapidly. The government’s funding agency, UK Research and Innovation-Medical Research Council (UKRI-MRC), has created new funding schemes, the Wellcome Trust has partnered with the Gates Foundation to speed up research and Cancer Research UK is supporting work into how Covid-19 is disrupting cancer treatment. In the last weeks, Oxford University and Imperial College London have reported on their plans for new vaccines and on more modelling of the impact of the virus. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Sanofi have put competition behind them and are working closer together to develop drugs and new vaccines. “Mega-labs” have been set up to undertake virus testing, supported by “small-boat” laboratories in research institutes and commercial testing facilities.
Suddenly, science is being done differently. Scientists have made dramatic shifts in their research, often without the funding in place to support these new directions. Results are shared rapidly, with papers in research journals being published in days and weeks rather than months and years, and through informal channels not always peer reviewed, like the popular press and social media. Barriers have been broken down between different areas of science, blurring the boundaries between disciplines and the conventional separation of basic discovery research from research aimed at developing useful applications.
The breakdown in barriers is very obvious at the Francis Crick Institute in central London, where I work. The institute was set up deliberately mixing research groups of all types together. Basic research biologists are cheek by jowl with clinical researchers and with translational scientists who work closely with industry. So when Covid-19 hit the UK it was easy for these scientists to shift from their established programmes to work together on the virus. They brought different skills and expertise to the endeavour, stimulating each other, driving new ideas, thinking “out of the box”.
In less than three weeks, with no government support, working in close collaboration with UCL Hospitals Foundation Trust and the diagnostic company Health Services Laboratories, an accredited virus testing facility was put in place, testing NHS frontline workers and providing a new team that can help research into the virus. Being locally organised, the team was well placed to solve problems in all parts of the virus testing workflow, from sample collection to laboratory analysis, and to returning the information back to hospitals within 24 hours. This helps to keep patients and healthcare workers safe by tracing those who are infected, assisting hospitals to run securely and maintaining the trust of patients who are avoiding hospitals because they are worried about infection.
These experiences gained locally will help the mega testing labs get their workflows operating effectively. The mega labs will encounter similar difficulties to those the Crick has faced, including issues that have arisen due to NHS guidelines that prevented frontline care workers being routinely tested when they do not have symptoms but may still be infectious. Problems such as these have contributed to the challenges of getting to the government’s target of 100,000 tests a day.
A number of Covid-related research projects have also rapidly sprung up at the Crick. These include how the virus replicates in human cells, why for some people the disease is mild and for others it is deadly, how the virus gets into cells and is transferred from animals to humans, what happens to the human immune system after viral infection and how the treatment of cancer patients is affected by the virus. The projects addressing these questions range across scientific disciplines and ways of working and involve a wide spectrum of expertise from fundamental researchers to frontline healthcare workers.
Science is crucial to developing sound public policy to manage the pandemic, but it is important to recognise that at this stage scientific knowledge of the virus is still tentative. Scientists can only give the best advice available at the time, but some of that advice will turn out to be incorrect. It is only through sustained quality research that clarity will emerge and advice will become increasingly reliable and that will take time.
There has also been a sea change in the relationship between politicians and scientists. This is important because as well as high-quality scientists, we need high-quality political leadership to guide us through this pandemic. The political populists, so vocal at the election and before, have gone strangely silent.
We are not hearing experts being scoffed at or simplistic soundbites such as “get Covid done”. These may win elections but if there is nothing beneath them they are useless to deal with complex political issues such as the present crisis. Perhaps this pandemic will lead to a more mature relationship between politicians and experts, which will help strengthen our country’s leadership at a time when we need it most. Maybe dealing with the current crisis will not only get rid of the coronavirus but also the virus of unsubstantiated populism.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pandemic! by Slavoj Žižek; Where Is God in a Coronavirus World? by John Lennox – review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Detained at home with time to write instant books, two septuagenarian sages here make very different attempts to wrest a meaning or moral from the coronavirus pandemic. The Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek treats the disease as an intellectual malaise from which we will only be rescued by a “philosophical revolution”; John Lennox, an Oxford mathematician who moonlights as a Christian evangelist, approaches Covid-19 as a theological conundrum and tries to explain why God seems so unbothered by our distress. While clinicians work on decoding the coronavirus, Žižek unhelpfully inflates it to an imaginary bogey, a “spectral fantasy”. In the absence of a vaccine, Lennox prescribes prayer, which at least is better advice than injecting bleach.
Žižek deplores our superstitions about the virus as a regression to “pre-modern thinking” and in Pandemic! he rethinks the crisis with the aid of the usual postmodern gurus. Michel Foucault’s account of the disciplinary state prompts him to mock hygiene rules: warned against touching our faces, are we being told not to play with ourselves? (Well, no, because the health authorities in New York have officially recommended masturbation to the shut-in users of dating apps, advising ”you are your safest sex partner”.) Drawing on the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Žižek says that a blindly self-replicating pathogen has loosened our hold on reality and exposed “the ultimate abyss of our being”. The remedy is a dose of updated Marx: because the pandemic is a byproduct of global capitalism, the solution must be “some kind of reinvented communism”.
The pandemic reminds Žižek of the alien invasion in HG Wells’s TheWar of the Worlds, where humanity is fortuitously spared because the Martians have no resistance to microbes, “the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, put upon this Earth”. But what if it were God who, in his malice, concocted coronavirus in the first place? In the Old Testament, the vindictive ogre whips up an exterminating deluge, followed later by the 10 plagues of Egypt. Lennox, however, is anxious to rule out divine retribution and in Where Is God in a Coronavirus World? he declares that the “wonderful and good capacity” of free will with which the creator endowed us “also makes us capable of evil”. This means, I assume, that airborne contagion must be a consequence of our bad choices. It’s a grotesque notion, though it could be applied to the Trump-loving protesters against lockdown in American states: for them, liberty means the right to go back to the diner or the nail salon and to die after doing so.
Lennox backtracks by defining Covid-19 as a specimen of “natural evil”, which sounds like an invitation to demonise the bats, civet cats and scaly anteaters at the Wuhan market, even though they too are surely God’s creatures. As so often, theology stumbles over the problem of undeserved suffering and Lennox defies both logic and common decency when he contends that Covid-19 might turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Viruses, he insists, “are in the main beneficial”. They recycle nutrients through food chains, regulate which species eat what and keep ecosystems functioning smoothly; a medical researcher therefore calls them “unsung heroes”, as if they were selfless NHS workers. Agony like that caused by the coronavirus can be an aid to what Lennox calls “character formation”: after all, “American football, British rugby and boxing” demonstrate that “enthusiasts will put up with a great deal of pain in order to excel”. So should we admire the sporty zeal of patients on ventilators and see them as athletes in training for some spiritual version of the Tokyo Olympics?
By contrast with this happy talk, Žižek describes the virus as “a dark shadow” that will continue to haunt us. At one point, he pictures it as a ghoul from a horror movie, calling it “undead” like a vampire or zombie. Elsewhere, he visualises this invisible enemy as a sci-fi monster: like Wells’s Martians sucking blood from their human prey, it is a parasite with a “stupidly repetitive, pre-sexual life” that uses the bodies of those it infects as “its copying machine”. Television news reports show us a purple grenade studded with spiky red coronets; Žižek’s less decorative image is grislier and truer.
Lennox may be God’s apologist, but it is Žižek, paradoxically identified as “a Christian atheist”, who does a better job of deriving good from evil. Invoking Hegel’s idea of a spirit that pervades nature, he calculates that the pandemic has already resulted in “some kind of ethical progress”: next time you deliver an elderly neighbour’s groceries, please consider your act of kindness an exercise in transcendental idealism. But Žižek zanily overdoes it when he volunteers to grapple with the devil and harrow hell. He says that he sometimes longs to contract the virus, which would demystify the “spectral agent” and drag it down into physical reality. I’d advise him to be careful what he wishes for.
Housebound isolation even leads Žižek to liken himself to “Christ on the cross”, abandoned by God but accompanied on Calvary by Julian Assange, who is crucified “in his prison cell, with no visits permitted”. Despite such grandiosity, Žižek does acknowledge the stress or dread we are all experiencing. Lennox is more glibly optimistic. Playing on words, he makes the coronavirus mutate into the “crown of thorns” worn by Christ, which somehow enables him to conclude that the pandemic may ultimately prove to be “very healthy”.
Perhaps as a sign of desperation, Žižek’s book begins in the same way that Lennox’s ends: both ponder Christ’s resurrection, luckily without noting the coincidence of BoJo’s emergence from hospital on Easter Sunday. Žižek remembers the risen Christ telling Mary Magdalene not to touch him and ingeniously links this with the protocols of physical distancing. We must learn, he says, to transmit emotion by semaphore, relying on a “deep look” into someone’s eyes rather than a handshake. Lennox finishes with another slippery pun, promising that when Christ next reappears he will perform a mass coronation and award “the crown of righteousness” to those who have kept the faith. We’re given no date for the saviour’s second coming: let’s hope that while we wait we’ll be reprieved by medical science.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The promise of an Oxford vaccine reveals how a new Britain could thrive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was some good news last week. Oxford University’s Jenner Institute announced it was teaming up with AstraZeneca to take a promising prototype of coronavirus vaccine into volume production by the autumn. Of course there are caveats – the institute’s confidence in its vaccine may not be validated by the trials that began last week.
Still it was heartening, after so much tragic incompetence, that a British university and a British company could forge a relationship of such potential national importance.
AstraZeneca’s recent history also tells a cautionary tale – pointing to how our financial, ownership and banking ecosystem is fundamentally decadent. But it also points to a story of promise: if we can be as fast as we’ve been in developing a potential vaccine, in building Nightingale hospitals and in learning to live online, perhaps we can repurpose the British financial system just in time.
The cautionary tale: Britain very nearly did not have AstraZeneca. If six years ago the company had not had some lucky breaks it would not now exist, taken over by the US drug company Pfizer that had no parallel commitment to sustaining drug research in Britain. It was and is run by a Frenchman, Pascal Soriot, passionate about medicine (his three brothers are doctors), who knew the long-term value of the company, did not accept that the share price was all and was backed by an unexpectedly determined board. What’s more, the company being half Swedish – the result of an EU-driven merger between the Swedish Astra and the best of the old ICI – it had the unwavering support of long-term shareholders, notably the Wallenberg family holding. They, together with some unfashionably long-term British shareholders, held the line.
It was a close-run thing. David Cameron’s government won some worthless promises from Pfizer, but it said it would not stand in the way of “market forces”, whatever the company’s strategic importance. No thanks to it, but rather those long-term shareholders, Britain now has one of the world’s great drug companies, beginning to flourish while Pfizer is in the doldrums. Its value is crystal clear.
Sadly, the same cannot be said of Britain’s capacity to manufacture a range of medical equipment – witness the ongoing debacle over PPE, ventilators, face masks and the rest. The same decadent financial and ownership system is in part to blame. One statistic reveals its priorities: of the £1.7tn stock of British bank lending, £1.45tn is on real estate while a tiny £10bn has been advanced to small- and medium-sized manufacturers.
But as economic disaster looms, British banks could, and should, become conduits for finance to flow to our crippled business sector, and in particular manufacturing – as urgently as the Jenner Institute is trying to develop a vaccine. Unless that happens, Britain is going to have the deepest and most prolonged recession in its history.
In fairness, the Treasury and Bank of England have been quick in creating some genuinely innovative financial support packages. There is the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the generous term funding scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises, which banks can access to finance up to £190bn of new lending over the next 12 months. As the Bank of England dryly observes, that is 13 times more than the banks managed themselves over the entirety of 2019. On top, the banks were told not to pay any dividends to help conserve capital, better to support the impending scale of lending to distressed companies.
British banks are trying – £1.3bn was lent last week and 25,000 applications processed – but the degree of cultural and organisational change required is dramatic. To avert a disastrous wave of closures, bankruptcies and redundancies by the summer, the weekly rate of lending has to rise to between £12bn an £15bn. That’s lending in a week what banks used to lend in a year. It is telling that Britain’s 10,000 bank branches have been closed or are working greatly reduced hours during lockdown. They do not have the economic function of supermarkets, which have had to stay open.
British banks have a longstanding aversion to business lending: it is regarded as too risky and costly. With the same ruthlessly short-term shareholders owning them as those prepared to sell AstraZeneca to the highest bidder, banks know that they must deploy their capital to where profits are high and reliable – real estate lending. This means that the piping through which emergency credit must flow is atrophied and weak.
The chancellor should chair an emergency financial task force with the purpose of driving lending up by the day, to be monitored with the same intensity as we monitor Covid testing. The British Business Bank, embarrassingly minuscule compared with its foreign counterparts, needs immediately to be given the mandate and capital to increase its own lending 10 times – across the country. Bank shareholders need to declare much more publicly and vocally than they have that they understand the demands being made.
Nor can the insurance industry, with funds under management of £1.9tn, stand on the sidelines. The loans the banks make, some with government guarantees, could be packaged in “cover bonds” that the insurance industry commits to buying – relieving pressure on bank balance sheets and recycling vital cash.
Some companies will not need loans but equity investment: the venture capital and private equity industries must transmute themselves from their default role as predators and asset-sweaters to long-term, patient investors – working with the newly created Future Fund to take generous equity stakes in companies in need. Supporting intellectual capital rather than seeking property collateral should become the new north star of British finance. If there is not to be a terrifying slump, the British financial and ownership system needs a revolution – and it has to take place in mere weeks.
Good people abound, marginalised until now by the predominant culture of wealth extraction. They need to be unleashed. And once we get to the other side, the new systems of engagement and support need to be retained. Good, perhaps, might yet come from all this pain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Ratline by Philippe Sands review – on the trail of the Nazi who got away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In his much-celebrated 2016 memoir, East West Street, Philippe Sands deftly wove together the story of a personal quest to uncover family secrets in the Ukrainian city of Lviv with the great arcs of global history that surrounded them – the Nazi occupation of Lviv in the 1940s, the Holocaust and the establishment of international law in Nuremberg in the aftermath of the second world war.
The result was compelling: a feat of narrative intensity and worldly insight that Sands has surpassed in his follow-up, The Ratline, an investigation into the life and mysterious death of Nazi Brigadeführer turned man on the run Otto von Wächter. This is a taut and finely crafted factual thriller, reminiscent in density and pace of John le Carré (who is also revealed here as Sands’s real-life neighbour).
A professor at UCL and renowned international barrister who has been engaged with human rights violations in Chile, Guantánamo Bay, Congo and Iraq, Sands grapples here with material left unresolved at the end of East West Street, where Von Wächter, though indicted in 1945 for mass murder, is the man who escapes justice, the one who gets away.
In The Ratline, we delve deeper into the story of the escape of a committed Nazi, a party member since 1923 who rose through the ranks as Hitler consolidated his power to be appointed governor of Kraków in 1939 and then of Galicia in 1942, directly accountable to Heinrich Himmler until the fall of the Nazi regime.
In 1945, wanted by the allies, Von Wächter evades capture, surviving as a fugitive for three years in the Austrian Alps before coming under the protection of a Vatican bishop, Alois Hudal.
Hiding in Rome, an anonymous tenant in the Vigna Pia monastery, Von Wächter waits for safe passage via the secret channels by which Nazi refugees were trafficked to Argentina along “the ratline”, a shadowy pathway out of Rome in a city now abuzz with Soviet and American spies.
Three months in, Von Wächter is taken ill under mysterious circumstances. Two monks drop him off at the nearby Santo Spirito hospital, under a false identity. Four days later, he’s dead.
Sixty years after the event, Otto’s youngest son, Horst von Wächter, is still haunted by his father’s death. He believes Otto was murdered in Rome in 1949.
He is the inhabitant of the family seat – “a vast, dilapidated, empty, magnificent castle” in Upper Austria bequeathed to him by his mother. He’s also the last defender of his father’s honour and, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Horst refuses to believe that his father was a criminal at all.
He was “against the racial theories”, he insists. “[He] didn’t see the Germans as supermen and all others as Untermenschen. He wanted to do something good, to get things moving.”
His evidence is, at best, circumstantial – letters and diaries, the artefacts of a life that he says speak to his father’s basic decency. But in spite of himself, Sands hears him out. He finds he likes Horst. He sees him as “gentle and open, seemingly with nothing to hide” and Horst in turn seems to need Sands. He says he brings relief to his “solitude”.
An unlikely friendship develops as Horst looks to Sands, inheritor of his own and strangely interconnected family tragedy, to help him do the work that he cannot do alone: to exonerate his father’s soul.
Horst shares everything: every letter, every diary, every photograph, bequeathed, along with this castle, by his mother, Charlotte. He urges Sands to get to the bottom of the mystery of his father’s untimely end.
What emerges is the mesmerising story, both of an extraordinary love that bound Charlotte and Otto and that endured even as their world was brought to ruin and a forensic investigation into the shady world of plots and double-dealings that saw the emergence of a new world order taking root in postwar Rome.
What is evil? The possibility, as we travel with Sands into the moral maze that he sets up is that we will come to see how a man’s capacity for love, not his crimes, constitutes the real measure of his soul.
Sands is unflinching, though, where Horst cannot be. He pursues the details and we are left with the unsettling, discordant portrait of a man who is conceivably a passionate husband and devoted father, but irrefutably a war criminal with blood, including that of Sands’s own family members, on his hands.
It’s treacherous terrain, but in Sands we have an incomparable guide who finds a kind of redemption on every road of the human experience, though never at the expense of responsibility or truth. The outcome is a feat of exhilarating storytelling – gripping, gratifying and morally robust.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
The number of people who have died after testing positive for Covid-19 has reached 244,320, according to Johns Hopkins University. A total of 3,452,285 infections have been recorded globally.
Frenchfeminist advocacy groups have reported an increase in sexual assault and harassment incidents in daylight, as aggressors know their victims are unlikely to be able to summon help. French prosecutors recorded two rapes in public spaces within a 24-hour period, in a district north of Paris.
Singapore has confirmed 657 new coronavirus cases, the vast majority of them foreign workers living in dormitories, taking the city-state’s total to 18,205. Cramped living conditions for migrant workers are are thought to be contributing to the country’s high number of cases.
The Pope has called for any successful Covid-19 vaccineto be shared worldwide. He said international scientific cooperation would be important in discovering a vaccine, stressing that it is “important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way”.
The Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove gave the UK government’s daily briefing and announced that the country’s death toll had reach 28,446, an increase of 315. He also announced that the number of tests carried out in the previous 24 hours was less than 80,000 despite a target of 100,000 a day.
A coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned that Brazil’s indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 “genocide”.Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Vietnam has confirmed its first coronavirus case in nine days, bringing its total to 271.The country’s lockdown was eased in late April and it is yet to record a Covid-19 death.
Footballers in Serie A, Italy’s top division, will be allowed to resume individual training sessions from Monday. It is the latest step in a series of cautious moves towards restarting top-level sport across Europe, which has also seen players in England and Germany permitted different degrees of training ground work.
One-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, have come back positive.It has raised fears that one of the world’s most fragile states may be harbouring widespread undetected infections.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus crisis could increase users' drug habits – report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic could push some recreational drug users into more serious and potentially harmful substance use, while use of “party drugs” declines, a leading addiction expert has said.
For some casual users of cannabis or cocaine, the lockdown will probably prove to be a mental health crisis point that leads them to take drugs more frequently, said Prof Adam Winstock, the founder and director of the Global Drug Survey.
Some drug users, whose habits already verge on being problematic, could also switch to using different and possibly harder drugs, increasing the risk of dependency, overdose and other harms, he said before the launch of the 2020 survey.
But Winstock, a London-based consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, said it was also probable that many recreational drug users would reduce their intake during the Covid-19 outbreak, with early evidence showing a drop in demand for party drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine.
“I’m certain there will be a proportion of people for whom Covid will be the tipping crisis,” said Winstock. “Where previously their use of weed or coke was once or twice a week, it’s now three or four times a week, and when they don’t use, they’re feeling anxious and miserable.
“If you were someone who was verging towards problematic use, you’re either going to use the pandemic as an opportunity to reduce use and improve mental health, or your use is going to escalate. And as you run out of your preferred choice of drug, you will look for other drugs to compensate for that.”
This year’s survey asks respondents to describe how the coronavirus has affected their drug use, mental health and personal relationships. For the first time, it will also include questions about domestic violence owing to a spike in cases during the lockdown.
Research led by Prof Gail Gilchrist, of the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London, who advised on the survey, found an increased risk of men perpetrating intimate partner abuse when they were in withdrawal or craving alcohol and heroin.
Winstock said evidence from other drug experts and law enforcement worldwide suggested a drop in demand for drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, which were usually taken socially, partly due to the increased risk for dealers of doing home deliveries.
He added that supplies of some drugs could start to run out in the coming weeks, leading vulnerable users in particular to take more dangerous alternatives.
For example, there were reports of homeless users in the UK turning to heroin and alcohol because of a shortage of synthetic cannabinoids, such as spice.
Interesting trends in drug use overseas during the pandemic included a spike in demand for ketamine in Berlin, said Winstock, adding that at low doses the dissociative anaesthetic had a numbing effect that may appeal to people wanting to cut themselves off from the crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flattening the Truth on Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The People (P): What is happening?
Answer (A): A virus has come.
P: Is it dangerous?
A: Very dangerous. But not dangerous to most. It strikes the elderly most viciously. But it can kill the middle-aged, the young, the thin, the healthy.
P: What should we do?
A: Stay away from others. Stay inside.
P: And then we won’t get the virus?
A: Absolutely you will get it. Everyone will get it.
P: Wait. No one told us this. They’re telling us to stay inside and we won’t get it.
A: Well, I’m telling you now. Almost everyone will get it. Seventy percent of you, give or take. Think about it. It’s everywhere, and there’s no vaccine. But we want everyone to get it at different times. Like on a schedule of getting it. At least five million people already have it in the United States.
P: Wait. Five million? Everyone says one million.
A: That’s the known, confirmed cases. We just started testing in earnest like, an hour ago. For every case we know, there’s five, 10, 50 that we don’t know. Maybe they got it and were asymptomatic. Maybe they got sick but not sick enough to go the hospital or get tested. Five million is an extremely low estimate of how many cases there are. It’s probably more like 20 million.
P: Twenty?
A: That’s good news! In a way. That means it’s less deadly to most people than we thought. And it proves the inevitability of you getting it yourself. So stay inside till it’s your turn to get it.
P: How long should we stay inside?
A: I’m thinking two months. No, three. Six? No, 12. Yes, 12!
P: Then it will be gone?
A: The virus? Lord no. It could be 18 months till we get a vaccine. But by then you’ll have already gotten it, so the date doesn’t really matter. Especially given that the virus will come back double-strong in the fall.
P: So it’s less potent in the summer?
A: Absolutely not. Who told you that?
P: You just said it’ll come back stronger in the fall. Which implies its power is dissipated in the summer.
A: Are you a doctor? No? Good. Then pay attention. The virus is everywhere, in every city and state, but we’re flattening the curve. Then it’ll very likely come back with a vengeance in the fall. Winter, too. Also, in the meantime, it’ll be with us all summer with probably no change in its potency. Capiche?
P: No one’s giving us this information.
A: Well, you know how we’re stretching out the cases over a longer period of time? Flattening the curve? We’re also flattening the truth. So just stay inside, and you’ll be fine. Order stuff online. Support your local restaurant.
P: Whew. OK. We can do that.
A: But do so knowing that you are putting the lives of everyone at risk — the cooks, the clerks, the delivery people. I’m actually a bit shocked by your selfishness and the cavalier way you’re sacrificing the lives of people who have no choice but to expose themselves to grave danger during a pandemic.
P: It sounds like you’re saying we shouldn’t order stuff to be delivered.
A: You shouldn’t. Unless you want local businesses to die.
P: So we should support local businesses …
A: Absolutely. While risking their workers’ lives. Yes. Order food, eat it, watch the news about the pandemic that can’t be stopped. Get plenty of sleep, and start smoking. Turns out smokers are less likely to get sick.Which only makes sense! So remember to exercise. Go for a run!
P: Where should we go for a run?
A: Ideally some place where you can spread out, where you aren’t in close proximity to other people.
P: Like the beach? A park?
A: Sure. Beaches and parks are wide-open spaces. They’re about as safe as you can be.
P: We just went to the beach and the park. There were hundreds of other people there.
A: You went to the beach? The park? What were you thinking? There are hundreds of people there! Go home. Be with your kids. Do you have kids?
P: Yes.
A: Well, make sure they keep up with school. Keep up with their worksheets and Zoom, and check their work, and keep them off screens, and go outside, and don’t worry about school. It’s a pandemic, after all.
P: Um. Many of the things you just said sound contradictory.
A: Not at all. I’ll rephrase: Your kids are living through a crisis. It’s all right if they feel anxious, or if you can’t maintain routines or keep up with regular school schedules. Just make sure they don’t fall behind, and remember that kids thrive on routine. So stick to a schedule, but give them space, and stay inside, and go outside, and use technology to connect with teachers and friends, and limit screen time.
P: Wait. So …
A: But enjoy some downtime together! Relax and watch a movie. Cook some food! Just don’t go to the stores, because that’s dangerous to everyone. Order in! But don’t. Stay home. Move to the country. And stay in the city. If you get sick, go to the hospital. But don’t get too sick, because you wouldn’t want to be going to one of those hospitals now! They’re full of sick people!
P: When did you say this would all end again?
A: Eighteen months. That said, the soonest we’ve ever come up with a vaccine was four years.
P: But everyone’s talking about reopening stores and everything now. How does that square with 18 months?
A: That’s easy. People will die.
P: Wait. What?
A: Oh sure. So many more. Oceans of people. Even just 1,500 a day for eighteen months means 800,000 in the U.S. alone will die from this virus.That’s what the Minnesota scientist says. Osterholm. He’s one of the foremost experts in the world. He’s been right every step of the way so far.
P: What? 800,000?
A: That’s if things stay more or less steady. It could be higher, much higher. With the easing of restrictions and all.
P: But isn’t the rate of death declining?
A: Friday was one of the deadliest days yet! And that’s after everyone’s been inside for a month. Once everyone goes back to work, it’ll probably go up significantly. Total blood bath.
P: So why are we easing restrictions?
A: Something something the economy?
P: Excuse me?
A: Mumble mumble the economy maybe?
P: We don’t understand.
A: Listen. People are fatigued. They want to go back to work. They want to shop. More than anything, they want to roll balls toward white pins and make loud bang-bang sound. And then possibly end up with a tube inserted in their trachea, helping them breathe while their lungs cease to function, until they almost invariably die and die alone.
P: Why don’t we just freeze the economy? Just close most businesses and have the government give everyone a living wage while we wait until there’s a vaccine?
A: Hmm. First of all, ridiculous. Second, that would take significant coordination between local, state and federal governments.
P: Can we do that?
A: Well. I don’t know … I mean … OK. For starters, we’d need superadvanced ways to coordinate everyone. We’d certainly need phones. Maybe email. We might even need spreadsheets and/or computers.
P: Do we have all those things?
A: I think we … might? But there are still so many questions. Like, how would we know who to give money to? We’d have to have a national database with all the salaries of all the nation’s workers.
P: Don’t we have that? Seems like we could get that.
A: Here’s another plan: We promise money to pretty much every person and every business. We give this money to maybe half the people, and to a very small percentage of businesses. We let big banks control most of this money meant for small businesses, and the big banks can funnel it to their biggest clients.
P: That sounds terrible.
A: Those big banks sure know how to handle cash!
P: It seems it would just be easier to give people the exact salaries they had before they lost their jobs to one of the deadliest viruses in 100 years. Just freeze everything. Just mutually agree to pause, together, so we don’t have to lose 730,000 more souls.
A: First of all: boring. Where’s the intrigue? The drama? With our system, you have wave after wave of unemployment, with no end in sight. Every week brings something new: business closures, bankruptcies and ruptures of the supply chain — a never-ending, cascading, domino-orgy of lost savings, empty storefronts and shattered dreams. That’s much more exciting than some boring old guaranteed income that would allow everyone to simply ride out the pandemic knowing their jobs and businesses would be there when the virus was defeated.
P: So there’s no plan.
A: Having no plan is the plan! Haven’t you been listening? Plans are for commies and the Danish. Here we do it fast and loose and dumb and wrong, and occasionally we have a man who manufactures pillows come to the White House to show the president encouraging texts. It all works! Eighteen months, 800,000 deaths, no plan, states bidding against states for medicine and equipment, you’re on your own, plans are lame.
P: I’m going to lie down. I don’t feel good.
A: Should we sing a patriotic song? I feel like our forebears would be so proud of us now. It’s just like how we all pulled together in World War II, every element of society, from the White House to Rosie the Riveter, with common purpose and shared sacrifice. This is just like that, except instead of coordination, we have competition, and instead of common cause, we have acrimony and chaos. Instead of fireside chats, F.D.R. and Churchill, we have tweets, Lysol and Ron DeSantis. Other than that, it’s exactly the same.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Piers Morgan off Good Morning Britain to await test result</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Piers Morgan has said he will temporarily step back from presenting Good Morning Britain after developing a "mild" coronavirus symptom.
The ITV programme will be hosted by Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid, as Mr Morgan awaits test results on Monday, he said.
In a tweet, Mr Morgan said he was acting "on medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution".
Last week, he was cleared of breaching TV watchdog Ofcom's rules after 4,000 complaints about his questioning.
During an animated interview, he asked care minister Helen Whately for the number of health workers and care workers who had died from the illness.
She accused him of "shouting at me and not giving me a chance to answer your questions" and "attempting to score points".
Mr Morgan defended his approach, saying it was not as "uncomfortable" as the conditions for the carers on the front line of the coronavirus crisis.
The presenter has also attracted positive publicity recently, as one of the famous faces taking on the 2.6 challenge, which replaced the London Marathon and raised money for struggling charities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From the archives: Unlocking the mystery of superhuman strength</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Editor's note: This story, on the mystery of superhuman strength, was originally published on July 8, 2019. Watch "The Mountain" Thor Bjornsson, 2018's World's Strongest Man, attempt the world deadlift record of 1,105 pounds at 12 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 2, on ESPN.
HANNAH SMITH WAS a 16-year-old high school basketball player in rural Lebanon, Oregon, when she heard her father scream. She was outside with her younger sister, who was 14 at the time, walking the dogs. The date was April 1, 2013.
Given the date, her first thought was that this was a joke. The sisters walked on. Then there was another scream, desperate, real. They dropped the leashes and ran. Their father was probably 500 feet away, on the other side of a utility shed and workshop, in the vegetable garden portion of their 5-acre property, which sat "in the middle of nowhere." Though not a working farm, the Smith homestead had cows, pigs, chickens, sheds and various large machines for outdoor labor. Their father, Jeff Smith, a millwright at a local factory, particularly enjoyed performing tasks while perched atop his classic 1949 fire-engine-red Ferguson TO-20, an agricultural tractor with enormous rear tires and an exposed engine block, like what's used for hayrides.
On this day, Jeff had been using the rig to pull a tree stump out of the ground. When the Smith girls rounded the corner of the shed, they saw their father's legs sprawling from under the engine block of the Ferguson. Somehow the machine had turned upside down. It did not have a roll cage. Its motor was still running. The weight of the engine block lay across him. The steering wheel pinned his chest to the ground. According to specs listed on TractorData.com, a fully fueled 1949 Ferguson TO-20 weighs approximately 1.4 tons.
ON THE CUSP of battle, members of the Viking warrior cult known as the berserkers stripped down naked. They also chewed on the rims of their iron shields, foamed at the mouth and howled like beasts. They were, now, berserk. Then they hacked their way through opposing armies, killing until there was no one left to kill. For as long as the frenzy lasted, they were "not of human nature," in the words of one Icelandic saga; they were immune to both "fire and iron." The state they entered had a name. It was called berserkergang, and when it finally wore off, the warriors would collapse in total fatigue and sleep for days. (If you wanted to kill a berserker, that, apparently, was the time to do it.)
Not only in war could they summon berserkergang. One evening in the Norse town of Borg, a berserker hero named Skallagrim was playing a friendly "ball-game" -- the sagas give few details about the nature of this sport -- against a team composed of his son and his son's friend, Thord. Frustrated that he was not winning, Skallagrim suddenly went berserk. Whether he also went on to win the match, the saga doesn't say, but he did kill Thord by lifting him in the air and smashing him on the ground, and he would have killed his own son if a bystander hadn't snapped him out of his frenzy.
No one knows if, or to what extent, the berserkers actually existed. Some scholars believe they're rooted in fact. Others assert they're simply figures of legend. But they are part of a deep tradition. The mythologies of countless cultures include stories of altered psychophysiological states in which superhuman deeds become available to the select. Like the related search for fountains of youth, humans have for eons sought the keys that might unlock access to this mysterious matrix of mind and body.
There is anecdotal evidence that humans carry unfathomed reserves of strength. Stories abound of those -- often mothers -- who lift burning cars off trapped children. It raises the question: What would we be capable of if we could access it all?
And so the quest to find the maximal limit of human physical performance has persisted -- in the military, in sports, in science and in pseudoscience. And it has taken many, often quixotic, forms.
The CIA's lunatic studies to create superwarriors were part of the search. Ditto athletes who dose with PEDs. But the quest began long before that.
In 1747, in his lab in Lake Geneva, Swiss scientist Jean Jallabert sent bolts of electricity through the arm muscles of a patient who'd been paralyzed for 15 years. The muscles moved -- violently, strongly -- and the patient, Jallabert reported, eventually recovered the use of his arm. All over Europe, scientists were suddenly conducting batteries of such experiments, electrically stimulating muscles in animals and humans both dead and alive. Especially dead. There was a craze, a fad, of corpse animation, scientists inducing cadavers to sit bolt upright on stages in theaters packed to the rafters with thrilled, gasping audiences -- leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of human neuromuscular mechanics.
Jokichi Takamine, a Japanese chemist and inventor -- the scion of an ancient samurai family -- was among the first to isolate adrenaline, squeezing it from the glands of sheep and oxen, in 1900. His patents on the technique made him as rich as a robber baron. At Harvard, some 20 years later, the scientist Walter Cannon surgically altered the nervous systems of lab cats and dogs, stressed them out, and was thus able to discern that a blast of adrenal hormones in moments of emergency taps into hidden "reservoirs of power" and induces a "violent display of energy." For this crisis response, he coined the phrase "fight or flight."
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union poured money into finding the maximal limits of athletic performance. From the sport-research labs of Moscow came some of the first performance-enhancing drugs. From the same institutions came strength-training techniques still in currency today.
Vladimir Zatsiorsky was a champion competitive Russian acrobat. But while earning a doctorate in biomechanics from the renowned Central Institute of Physical Culture -- where his roommate was powerlifter Viktor Bushuev, future gold medalist at the 1960 Olympics in Rome -- Zatsiorsky found himself hanging around a group of Soviet muscle heads. "They respected one quality in people: strength."
Zatsiorsky went on to become chair of the biomechanics department at the Central Institute, where he would lead the Soviet Union's research into maximal strength. Among other things, he wrote that most people are able to access only 65 percent of their total theoretical muscle potential, while the best weightlifters can approach about 95 percent. He also observed something strange about heart rates. "If you test marathon runners, their highest [heart] rates will be somewhere close to finish line." But the elite Soviet weightlifters Zatsiorsky studied achieved maximal heart rates, in excess of 180 beats per minute, before performing any physical act. They knew how to "bring themselves to this condition, the huge emotional excitement. They don't do anything, no running around. They're just preparing mentally in these extreme ways."
In 1990, Zatsiorsky came to the U.S. and stayed, teaching for 25 years at Penn State. He's now 87 years old and retired in California. His treatise Science and Practice of Strength Training, he said, will soon go into its third edition. Like all the other editions, it will contain a photograph of Zatsiorsky from way back in his Soviet acrobat days. "You will see I have good six-pack."
But one thing Zatsiorsky's work does not contain? The secret to harnessing the outermost reaches of human strength.
THE FIRST THING Hannah Smith thought to do was dig. Just the day before, her father had tilled this patch of garden in preparation for planting. The ground, in other words, was soft. Hannah -- all 5 feet, 3 inches and 125 pounds of her -- dropped to her knees beside him and clawed at the earth with her bare hands, screaming at her sister to do the same. Hannah clawed so frantically that only later did she notice that she'd torn some of her fingernails off and that her fingers were covered in blood. "There was no pain," she says.
When she realized that digging wouldn't work, she stood up and looked around. Leaning against the nearby shed were a bunch of two-by-sixes. She took one of them, wedged it under one of the front tires nearest her father's chest and, using two cinder blocks as a fulcrum, tried to lever the tractor off him. The wood bowed under the strain but did not budge the Ferguson. She tossed the lumber aside.
Her father, meanwhile, was struggling to breathe; at one point she thought he'd lost consciousness. Hannah took out her cellphone and dialed 911. "But we're out in the middle of nowhere and it's a 30-minute drive just into town. I knew we didn't have time to wait."
SINCE AUGUST 2006, a term called "hysterical strength" has enjoyed its own Wikipedia entry; its etymology is unclear. The entry, regardless, contains a list of 10 incidents, anecdotal evidence of the phenomenon the term is supposed to describe.
In an Inuit community in northernmost Quebec, near the Arctic Circle, a woman sprints and "tackles" and fights off a polar bear that is predatorily eyeing her 7-year-old son and a friend as the boys, unaware, play hockey, reported the Nunatsiaq News in February 2006.
One night in a parking lot in Tampa in 2011, Danous Estenor, then a 295-pound lineman at the University of South Florida, sees a woman and two men trying and failing to lift a 1990 Cadillac Seville off another person stuck underneath. Estenor takes action. "When I first tried, it didn't budge," he later told a reporter with the St. Petersburg Times. "I backed up. I don't know. But I felt this energy come, and I lifted it."
A year later, in Glen Allen, Virginia, a man is working underneath his BMW in his garage when the jack fails and the car crashes down. His 22-year-old daughter, Lauren Kornacki, home from college, walks into the garage, sees this and takes hold of the car's undercarriage. Like Estenor, she at first fails to lift it. Frustrated, she begins throwing her shoulder against the machine and screaming with such wild abandon that, she says, her little sister, standing nearby, "has a little bit of PTSD from it." The next thing Kornacki recalls is being on top of her father, administering CPR.
E. PAUL ZEHR, a neuroscientist at the University of Victoria, in British Columbia, is something of the go-to expert on the physiology of maximum human physical performance. "What we think are human limits," he says, "are, in fact, just soft barriers." He is familiar with the phenomenon termed hysterical strength, but, he says, "It's not an area that gets research attention." Why? Designing experiments to study it in human beings in the lab would be difficult to achieve, he explains, without also violating the norms of modern scientific ethics.
But those codes weren't always in place. Consider 1961, in Chicago, where a visiting professor of physiology from the University of Tokyo named Michio Ikai teamed up with Arthur H. Steinhaus, an American physiologist and fitness expert with a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, to run some experiments. They recruited a group of 25 people, hooked them up to a device to measure "maximal efforts to flex the forearm" by pulling on a cable, and asked their subjects to flex as hard as they could; then they walked behind their subjects and, without warning, fired a gun -- a starter's gun! -- next to the subjects' ears. Pow! They asked them to pull the device again. When scared, the subjects overall were 7.4 percent stronger.
That wasn't all. Ikai and Steinhaus also hypnotized their subjects, assuring them in pacific tones that they were really, really strong. One, two, three,flex: 26.5 percent stronger. Then they handed their subjects Dixie cups with pills inside them -- 30 milligrams of amphetamine sulfate, better known on the street as speed. Swallow, wait for it, woo! Flex: 13.5 percent stronger. Then they got their subjects drunk, or at least buzzed, on grain alcohol. Flex: no improvement. Then they took a big syringe and injected their subjects "intramuscularly" with half a milliliter of adrenaline. How did this make their subjects feel? Who knows? Those details went unrecorded. But the flex numbers were, and the results were surprising: A literal shot of adrenaline produced a statistically insignificant rise in muscle strength.
What did it all add up to? Ikai and Steinhaus thought their findings showed that "psychologic rather than physiologic factors determine the limits of performance." Which is akin to saying they had no idea. Chalking something up to "psychologic" factors is, in science, the equivalent of a shrug.
HANNAH SMITH TOOK hold of one of the small front tires, wrapping her arms around it. Her sister, Haylee, did the same with the other. Then they counted -- one, two, three -- straining to raise the tractor into the air until it felt like the capillaries in the sclera of their eyes had burst. The red Ferguson didn't budge. Their father wheezed, losing air. They tried again, urgent, desperate.
Early spring in Oregon's Willamette Valley can be balmy and fragrant, and so it was on this day. Birds sang, indifferent to the crisis. Sweat ran down from Hannah's face and forehead. She felt lightheaded. Behind her forehead, deep in her temporal lobe, twin nut-sized neuron clusters had by this point shot an electric signal over to her hypothalamus, another neuron cluster, which in turn had activated the adjacent pituitary gland, whose function it is to broadcast a portfolio of hormonal messengers throughout the body's various systems. Hormones triggering hormones, an endocrine cascade. The pituitary signals would almost instantly have reached two yellow blobs of tissue perched atop each of her kidneys like mushroom caps: the adrenal glands. These would then have brewed and spewed more epinephrine and norepinephrine, crucial chemicals and neurotransmitters, than almost assuredly they'd ever produced in Hannah's young life to date.
Among other things, the epinephrine would have flooded her liver, then bound chemically with cells there to help form glucose -- giving her a burst of energy, the stressor equivalent of a sugar high.
Coursing through her bloodstream, the epinephrine would have entered her heart, found the pacemaker cells there and emboldened them to make that muscle beat harder, faster, stronger -- a myocardial turbocharge for the whole of her anatomy.
Hannah and Haylee lifted again ... and this time the tractor moved. It moved maybe an inch in the air and an inch laterally, but it moved. Then they did it again. And again. Up and down, up and down. They were oonching the Ferguson's front end across their father's chest.
IN THE EARLY 1960s, when Jan Todd was a 9-year-old girl growing up in Nova Scotia, she heard a story. A bad accident had left a child trapped underneath a car. The child's mother, apparently unharmed in the crash, had lifted the car and saved her child. The story fired young Jan's imagination. She determined that when she grew up, she too would be strong like this woman who'd performed this heroic feat. And so when she got older she began lifting weights. This was in the early 1970s: not an era when the gyms of America were known for their gender diversity. By the time she was 25, she could dead-lift almost 450 pounds and was profiled in Sports Illustrated as "the world's strongest woman." She eventually broke more than 60 world records.
"The trick of competitive lifting is: Your mind isn't part of the process. You want to be on some strange autopilot," Todd says. "You want to be almost blacked out. On the other hand, if you want to lift something really large, it's sort of like being a Viking berserker. He goes into battle and is some other person during that period of time."
To entertain friends, Todd would bend down and grab hold of the undercarriage of her Ford Fiesta. As she rose into a standing position, up would climb that side of the car.
Today Todd is a historian of physical culture at the University of Texas at Austin. When asked about the term "hysterical strength," she says she's never heard that locution before. But she does note that the word "hysterical" comes from the Greek for "womb" and emerged out of a kind of fearful, premodern gynecologic pseudoscience. "There was this concern that your uterus could travel, that it could move upward." It was believed that this propensity made women physically and mentally frail. In his 1615 anatomical tome Mikrokosmographia, a Description of the Body of Man, Helkiah Crooke, the king's physician, wrote of the "hysterical women ... such as are in fits of the mother." Hysterical came to mean a kind of female madness tied to a woman's very anatomy, and "hysterical strength" came to refer to the episodes of physical power that would supposedly come over women afflicted with it. Over time those gendered meanings faded but were never fully erased. Victorian novels are full of men and women -- but mostly women -- who fall into spells of mania, rage and "hysterical strength." The term even found its way into the science fiction of the Cold War, with characters capable of harnessing it at will, weaponizing it. In Joanna Russ' 1975 feminist classic, The Female Man, one of the heroines, an assassin and man hunter living in a dystopian world, does just that: "The room is beginning to sway with the adrenaline I can pump into my bloodstream when I choose; this is called voluntary hysterical strength and it is very, very useful, yes indeed."
According to Todd, it used to be axiomatic that "women could be no stronger than two-thirds of a man. But that was an era when no woman lifted weights." A strength gap still exists, but one woman, a powerlifter, recently squatted 800 pounds, which would've set the men's world record a few generations ago. "At every Olympic Games," Todd says, "it seems like there's always a trainer who will come out and say: 'We're getting close to the limit of human performance; there won't be much record breaking in the future.' But pretty much everything gets broken."
EACH TIME THE Smith sisters lifted the tractor off their father's chest, Hannah could hear him wildly gasping for air. And each time they set it back down they could hear its weight squeeze the air out. Hannah recalls being "super frustrated" by their slow pace, by their failure to remove the machine in one swoop. "I wanted to move it faster," she says. "I wanted to get it up and off of him." She recalls that frustration welling up inside her, fueling bursts of energy, what she calls the "adrenaline pumping."
The girls bent down and hugged the tires and lifted again. It was a kind of positive feedback loop. Feelings of frustration causing energy bursts causing little lifts, which caused more frustration and more energy bursts ... until finally, the tractor came off their father's chest. The girls had moved it about 3 feet. He could finally breathe. His life was no longer in danger. When he was ultimately freed, Jeff stood up and looked at his daughters. "When your mom calls," he said, "don't tell her anything."
Jeff Smith suffered only minor injuries, a broken wrist chief among them. As for Hannah, she collapsed that night in total fatigue. "I did not feel any pain until the next day." She basically couldn't move. She'd strained every muscle in her body from the neck down. She was bedridden for two weeks and never played competitive basketball again.
IN ICELAND, ON a farm in the village of Husafell, a boulder called the Kvíahellan, or the Husafell Stone, has beckoned strongmen for more than 200 years. It is one of the world's most famous tests of strength. These often take the form of boulders, often called "lifting stones" or "strength stones" or, sometimes, "manhood stones." The Husafell Stone reportedly weighs 409 pounds. Legions of confident, burly men have grunted over it and, hours later, dejected, have left it where it lay. No woman had ever gotten it off the ground. Few, if any, had ever tried.
In April, Liefia Ingalls arrived in Husafell from her home in Orange County, California. She is not only a professional competitive strongwoman but a trainer of professional competitive strong people. Just a month before traveling to Iceland, she'd set the world record on monster-dumbbell press at The Arnold, Schwarzenegger's annual extravaganza of strength, for the second time. She'd been planning the Iceland trip for a year with her powerlifting friend Sandra Bradley. "The Husafell is sort of regarded as the archetype of strength," Ingalls says, "and, specifically, male strength."
In some ways, Ingalls says, she prefers stone lifting to other, more technical, strength challenges. She has called herself "overanalytical" and "a highly anxious kind of person." "I'm more of a stoic lifter, a thinking lifter," she says. "But when it comes time to lift stones, that's when I need to tap into all of my energy and all of my power and just be explosive and violent and go. You're talking about maximal capacity. It's just grit. It's just pain tolerance. There's something fatalistic about pushing yourself to the extreme. In that moment, there's nothing else you can do. You can't make a different choice. You can't go back in time and train differently. It's like freedom from analysis. All the thinking goes away. All the worrying goes away. All that matters is that one simple task. Pick up the thing."
The heaviest stone she'd lifted previously was a 340-pound "atlas stone" -- a rock cut into a perfect sphere. The Husafell Stone is shaped like a wedge. It's also dense and smooth and thus difficult to grab and difficult to balance. She wore no gloves. In jeans, a fleece and a green knit cap over shoulder-length hair dyed a shocking pink, she paced around the stone, looking at it, thinking. She squatted down and embraced it. She tried once and failed. She tried again and dropped it. On the third try, she rolled the thing into her lap, stood up ... and walked with it for 30 feet. She felt pride but at the same time frustration. She hadn't carried the stone far enough. "I didn't make it all the way around the pen," she says, which is the traditional Husafell task. "That's going to have to be for later."
Later that day, her friend Sandra also lifted the stone.
As Ingalls learned on this trip, a little-known legend lies behind the Husafell Stone and its origins as a test of strength. The stone sits in a sheep pen adjacent to a 12th-century church. The pastor of this church 200 years ago was also a sheep farmer. He had three sons and four daughters and employed them all on his farm. But he paid his daughters less than his sons. One day, one of the girls challenged this arrangement, agitating for equal wages. Her father replied with a challenge of his own. The wedge-shaped boulder wasn't just a random slab sitting in the yard. The pastor and his sons, all brawny, used it as the pen's gate. When the herd went out to graze, someone lifted the rock out of the way. When the animals came back, back went the 409-pound door. Inefficient, yes, but a good workout. If the daughter could lift the stone and put it back in its place in the gate, well, then she could receive the same wages as her brothers. The father's challenge: Pick up this rock.
Liefia Ingalls finishes the story: "And so she did."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Clinical Trials Of Mesoblast’s Stem Cell Treatment For COVID-19 Set To Begin Soon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Melbourne-based biotech company Mesoblast announced earlier this week that it’s begun enrolling up to 300 patients for a randomized, controlled study of its stem cell therapy remestemcel-L in the treatment of COVID-19 patients experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Over 20 hospitals will participate in the study, which is anticipated to last 3-4 months.
The announcement came about a week after the company reported that treatment with remestemcel-L in a group of 12 COVID-19 patients with ARDS at Mt. Sinai hospital in New York had a survival rate of 83%. The purpose of the randomized, controlled clinical trial is to test that survival rate on a larger scale. 
“We were very pleased with preliminary data demonstrating the cells seem to have benefitted some of these patients,” says CEO Silviu Itescu. “If the cells work in COVID-19 ARDS, we’re in a position to provide products to as many patients as possible.” 
For coronavirus patients, ARDS is one of the deadliest complications of the disease, and often ends up requiring the use of ventilators in order to ensure they’re getting sufficient oxygen. It’s caused by what’s known as a “cytokine storm” - an overreaction of the immune system in which the body ends up damaging the lungs in an attempt to destroy the coronavirus and the lung cells that it has infected. 
“The cytokines these cells make destroy lung tissue,” says Itescu. “It’s a trade-off being trying to get rid of the virus and trying to limit destruction to your own lung tissue.”
According to the CDC, between 20-42% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop ARDS, with as many as 85% of patients admitted to intensive care having this complication. Among those ICU patients who develop ARDS, over 40% die (some studies show that number as high as 72%) and those who survive spend an average of 10-13 days in the hospital. 
Mesoblast’s remestemcel-L treatment is derived from allogenic mesenchymal stem cells, which when infused into the body can slow down an immune response and prevent the body from damaging itself. Its technology originally spun out of a research collaboration between Columbia University and Australian scientists, leading to the founding of the company in 2004. 
One of the diseases the company has been working to treat is graft-vs-host disease, a condition that arises in patients who receive bone marrow transplants. In that disease, the donated bone marrow begins to see its new host as “foreign” and directs the immune system to attack it in a manner similar to that of the cytokine storm seen in ARDS. 
The company is one of several biotech firms aiming to use mesenchymal stem cells as a potential COVID-19 treatment. Cleveland-based Athersys, which is working on stem cell therapies for strokes, heart disease and other conditions, is also expected to begin clinical trials soon. Haifa, Israel-based Pluristem, which is developing stem cell treatments as well, secured 50 million Euro (about $55.4 million) in financing this week from the European Investment Bank to support its COVID-19 trials.
So far, says Itescu, Mesoblast’s treatment has been tested in clinical trials in over 1,100 graft-vs-host patients. On April 1, the FDA accepted a priority review filing for use of the treatment against graft-vs-host disease. On April 6, the FDA gave clearance for an investigational new drug application for remestemcel-L in COVID-19 patients, which paved the way for this clinical trial.   
Using Mesoblast’s treatment for coronavirus patients with ARDS “has a rationale behind it” says Dr. Wayne Marasco, who’s studied a number of coronavirus diseases and is currently researching potential antibody treatments for COVID-19. “That would be in line with how it works with graft-versus-host disease.”
Itesecu says that his company is focused on the next phase of its clinical research in the midst of this pandemic, and hopes it proves to be part of a number of effective therapies against the disease. 
“We’re going to do our best to provide a solution to those patients in greatest need: those who are in intensive care on ventilators, where I think a safe and effective way to reduce severe inflammation is needed,” says Itescu. “We hope that what we’re doing is complementary to what folks who are developing vaccines and antivirals are doing.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Assess Talent And Conduct Annual Reviews During COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Due to COVID-19, employers may be shying away from reviewing employee performance, preferring to deliver feedback in person as opposed to over the phone or in a virtual video conference. But employees are gauging right now whether their manager and their employer are treating them with respect and care. They’re also making decisions now about whether they want to stay with that organization.
69% of employees say they would work harder if they felt their efforts were better recognized. Nearly one-quarter of employees that don’t feel recognized when they do great work have interviewed for a job in the last three months, compared to just 12% that do feel recognized. And recognition is the number one thing employees say their manager could give them to inspire them to produce great work.
With U.S. COVID-19 cases causing stay at home orders as early as mid-March, some employees haven’t received performance feedback for nearly two months. Alex Rizzuto, a talent management leader, believes now, more than ever, consistency in communication and strong leadership is critical. Rizzuto focuses on executive and leadership coaching to transform leaders by guiding them to define and achieve their development and career aspirations. She has led the global talent management and organization and performance functions at multi-billion-dollar, multi-national organizations such as McCormick & Company, Dentsply Sirona, and Oshkosh Corporation. Rizzuto explains:
“Not only do you need to share with your team what is changing, as quickly as possible, but you also need to keep communicating what is NOT changing. This will help dispel any rumors of what might be changing and focus your team on what is important. The traits that strong leaders are demonstrating now – agility; resilience; ability to lead in ambiguity; and inclusion and engagement - will continue to be traits for successful leaders in the future.”
Rizzuto shares three ways employers can continue to evaluate talent so employees can continue to receive constructive feedback during the stay at home orders:
Rizzuto describes, “in any time of disruption, organizations, and teams naturally experience a decline in productivity. While external factors can’t be controlled, internal factors- such as how individuals, team members, and the workload- can be controlled.” For female leaders within an organization, the ambiguity of the pandemic is unsettling. Ambiguity decreases the opportunity to control and perfect. But right now, managers should focus on strengthening other traits team members can deliver in this disruptive time (such as encouraging creativity and learning). It can help individuals contribute new solutions that might become part of future work methods.
“As we lose the work world we knew, it’s natural to feel anger, fear, anxiety, loss. We are concerned about letting go of the known and moving into doing things outside our current comfort zone. Some employees will spend a great deal of time in this phase; others will just want to move quickly to the ‘what next.’ You’re probably not a certified therapist, but you are a leader. It’s essential to listen to what your employees are saying informally (such as through their tone of voice, body language, and casual conversation at the start of calls). The best managers will recognize and empathize where each employee is and acknowledge the grief they’re experiencing in losing their ‘old normal.’ Most importantly, they won’t chastise employees for their grief, but coach them so that business goals can be accomplished and productivity can get back to an appropriate level.”
“If it’s been a while since you evaluated your talent, either through a self-assessment or 360° feedback assessment, consider a formal refresh in the coming weeks,” Rizzuto encourages. “Consider your style and approach with your team. You cannot pay attention and manage your team’s emotions and uncertainty if you are not clear on where you are yourself. Are you managing your stress, your workload, setting realistic expectations of what you can get done? When you show up for your team or individual employees, are you prepared – do you know what information you need to share? Are you communicating priorities? What is your tone, method, etc.? What questions do you anticipate? How will you answer what you don’t know? Get feedback from your team on the new methods and practices – what’s working and what needs to be adjusted.”
Rizzuto also provides additional ways to assess talent and conduct annual reviews during COVID-19 stay at home orders, including varying communication methods, ensuring two-way communication, checking for understanding, and telling the truth. Additionally, she encourages documenting approaches to the crisis so that the entire team can address challenges, opportunities, and debrief on lessons learned post-pandemic.
Employees are turning to their leaders and their organizations for stability in our uncertain world of divisiveness and environmental unrest. Some leaders and organizations will emerge more successfully than others, having better prepared and honed new leadership skills in existing talent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Entire Stockpile Of Coronavirus Treatment Remdesivir Donated To Government, Says CEO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Sciences—which manufactures Remdesivir, the antiviral found to help hasten coronavirus patients’ recovery—is donating its entire Remdesivir stockpile to the government, said the biopharma company’s CEO in a Sunday interview on CBS.
The drug supply will be given to the federal government, which will then allocate it on as-needed basis across the country starting early next week, Gilead Sciences chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day said in the Sunday morning interview.
“We’ve donated the entire supply . . . because we acknowledge and recognize the human suffering . . . and want to make sure nothing gets in the way of this getting to patients,” said O’Day.
Though Remdesivir is not a coronavirus cure, in a study of 800 patients, the antiviral drug shortened the duration of hospital stay in users to 11 days on average, versus 15 days for COVID-19 patients who were not administered the drug.
Gilead says that 140,000-plus prescriptions will be available by the end of May, with 1 million available by 2020’s end. 
The company has yet to share what it will charge for the drug, should it be approved in the long term.
“This is really quite important,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci with a smile after Remdesivir’s promising clinical trials on Wednesday. “This will be the standard of care.”
The Food and Drug Administration gave Remdesivir emergency use authorization to treat COVID-19, meaning that it has not undergone the standard FDA vetting required of drugs on the market and it is only available for use by doctors in hospitals. In the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ 800-patient study on the drug, 50% of COVID-19 patients on the drug had shorter hospital stays than those who did not receive the drug. Also, patients who received the drug had an 8% mortality rate, compared to the 11.6% mortality rate for the non-Remdesivir group.
Foster City, California-headquartered Gilead Sciences develops and manufactures a slew of other medicines for HIV/AIDS, liver disease, hematology/oncology, inflammation and respiratory diseases, but perhaps the most common is Tamiflu, which is used to treat the common flu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Temple Grandin: Big Meat Supply Chains Are Fragile</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About five years ago, I was giving a lecture in my livestock handling class at Colorado State University about animal welfare, and when I turned to write on the whiteboard, I had a light bulb moment. I immediately was triggered to recall a moment during the floods of 2013 when I was driving home to Fort Collins from the Denver airport. Interstate 25 was flooded so I first drove east to get around it. Then I drove north, and everywhere I went, I found roads impassable. Finally, I got out past Greeley, the agribusiness hub where JBS’s American division is currently headquartered, and went around the huge Kuner feedlot, which at the time was owned by JBS. The cattle were all dry but the flooding lapped around the edge of the feedlot. The water stayed out because JBS had done an excellent job of rebuilding it. And it was there that I finally found a bridge that was dry. It was only a foot out of the water and closed an hour later.
My students are often concerned that large corporations are bad, but my answer has always been badly managed is bad. I was thinking about that when this new epiphany struck me. Big is not bad, it is fragile. 
That’s important now more than ever, because everything is bigger. When I first started my career as a designer of cattle handling systems in the early 1970s, the meat supply chain was more diversified with many smaller packing plants. In the city of Denver, there were several slaughterhouses and Los Angeles even had a whole row of companies on a single street. Each one of these plants processed 500 to 1,000 cattle per day.
But almost all of these smaller, independent plants have now closed. What drove these packers out of business was the transformation of the entire industry in the 1980s from selling retailers carcasses to packing and shipping meat in boxes. Most of these independents were located in major cities. There was no room to build the additions required for all the extra cutting and they couldn’t afford to build new plants outside the city. It ushered in an era of closures and acquisitions. And today the big companies are running plants that are really massive: a single plant may process 2,000 to 6,000 cattle per day if it runs two shifts. A large, double-shifted pork plant may process 20,000 pigs per day.
Because today’s system is so concentrated - and slaughter and processing is done in fewer, larger plants - the pandemic we’re facing has overwhelmed this supply chain. There is an old saying “do not put all of your eggs in one basket.” When a supply chain becomes more concentrated, there is greater loss of supply when a single plant is closed. A Tyson beef plant in Kansas closed last year due to a fire, and it did cause some production disruptions, but other plants ran Saturday shifts to compensate. The supply chain was able to compensate for the temporary closure of a single large plant.
But without sufficient slaughterhouse space to process all the pigs and chickens that are growing today, farmers have been forced to euthanize poultry and pigs. This is both a tragic waste of food and if euthanasia is done poorly there could be great animal welfare problems, and it can be really traumatic for the farm workers who have to do this.
A disruption or plant shutdown at any point along the chain is more likely to cause shortages that consumers can eventually see. Meat is not the only industry with a concentrated supply chain. Other food processors have shut down recently. And the pharmaceutical industry’s supply chain for common generic drugs may be even more concentrated. The raw materials are made in China and the pills are manufactured in India. There is a major difference between pigs and raw materials for manufacturing generic medicines. The system can handle a short disruption of several months because a supply of chemicals can be stored. Pigs cannot be stored because their numbers would quickly overcrowd the buildings.
Big operations are extremely cost efficient. That’s why they’ve been built this way. The downside is the fragility of the supply chains, as Covid-19 proves. This pandemic is going to be a wakeup call and I expect many to become a lot more interested in more distributed local supply chains. Local production provides the opposite: it will always be more expensive because fixed costs such as labor, electricity, and water to process each pig will be higher. But a local supply chain is less prone to disruption. It also has a lower dependence on long distance trucking. During the floods in Colorado, semi-trucks had a difficult time re-supplying many stores.
The bottom line is, there will always be a tradeoff. Big suppliers are low cost, efficient and fragile. More numerous local producers are more expensive, but the entire supply is more robust. It will be less prone to disruption from floods, fires, electric power failures, storms or diseases like coronavirus or others in the future.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like the COVID-19 coronavirus may be able to live in water for a few days, potentially even a few weeks. There is a big but, though. And you’ll like this big but. Just because a virus can survive in water doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s present in large enough concentrations to infect you.
Is this situation a bit like a teenager pointing out a few hairs on his face and then claiming that it’s a beard? There actually has to be enough hairs to make it a beard. When you can still count the number of hairs, it’s not a beard, unless, of course, the hairs are really, really long and very, very curly.
Similarly, consider what is known about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in water. Indeed studies have suggested that the SARS-CoV2 could actually hang out in the wet stuff for a little while. For example, a study published in the journal Water Research in 2009 found that two viruses that have similarities to the original SARS virus, the transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV) viruses, could survive up to days and even weeks in water. The University of North Carolina team (LisaCasanova, William A.Rutal, David J.Weber, and Mark D.Sobsey) that conducted the study concluded that “coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated.”
Then there was the poopy study described by a paper posted April 17 on medRxiv. For this study, the team sampled sewage (you know, the watery stuff in sewers) in the greater Paris, France, area for over a month. They found that concentrations of the SARS-CoV2 correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in the region over time. In other words, when COVID-19 cases were rising, so did the concentrations of the SARS-CoV2 in the sewage. This seems like one more reason why splashing sewage or taking a deep breath near sewage is probably not a great idea.
Take this second study with a grain of sewage though. It has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. That means real scientific experts haven’t had a chance to review the study for quality or accuracy. Telling people that you’ve posted something on medRxiv can be a bit like telling people that you’ve auditioned for America’s Got Talent. There’s no guarantee that this study will ever make it close to the final stage of getting published in a reputable peer-reviewed scientific journal.
Regardless, the results from both studies do suggest that the virus can survive for a little while in water, which initially may cause you to wet yourself. Before you do, here’s the big but again. Neither study showed that you can actually get infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus from water under the conditions that you’d normally be exposed to water. That means via drinking (assuming that you aren’t drinking sewage or some other type of dirty water), showering, or swimming (assuming that you don’t swim in sewage.)
In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 coronavirus hasn’t even been found in drinking water. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said that “the risk to water supplies is low. Americans can continue to use and drink water from their tap as usual.” Such a virus would have to get through all of the filtration and water treatments that drinking water typically goes through, and that can be harder than getting on to the red carpet at the Oscars.
Moreover, the great thing about water is that it’s water. It tends to dilute things. Even if the COVID-19 coronavirus were to somehow make the epic journey of getting into your drinking water, it may not be at high enough concentrations to be of risk to you. This goes back to the whole beard thing. Every virus has a minimum infectious dose, the amount of virus that needs to be present to cause illness. Although it’s not completely clear yet what the minimum infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 may be, dilution makes it less likely that what reaches you can surpass this threshold.
The same probably goes for water in pools and hot tubs. The CDC indicates that “there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas.” For these things, not only would the water dilute the virus, but also disinfection with chlorine and bromine would likely inactivate the virus.
If you are actually thinking of swimming or soaking in a pool or tub that is not properly chlorinated or bromated, don’t. Just don’t. There’s a whole lot of other nasty, disease-causing microbes that could then be swimming or soaking along with you. The poop about many swimming pools and hot tubs is that’s what people may do in them. As I have described previously for Forbes, 24% of respondents to the 2019 Healthy Pools survey indicated that they would enter a swimming pool "within one hour of having diarrhea." Yes, diarrhea. Yes, within one hour of having it. And those are just the people who admitted to doing this. Still don’t want to social distance from others?
As for the ocean, it is pretty big. Then there’s the motion of the ocean, so to speak. Both of these aspects can dilute and separate viruses fairly quickly. The salt in the water may decrease the survival of the virus as well.
This doesn’t mean that you should rush to the beach to do what’s seen in this Reuters video:
Sun of a beach. Does this look like social distancing to you? Is everyone in the video staying six feet away from each other? Six feet apart means roughly one Denzel Washington apart, since Washington is about six feet tall. See any people less than one Denzel apart?
When it comes to the COVID-19 coronavirus, the riskiest thing at swimming pools, hot tubs, and oceans is not the water itself. No, it’s the coughing, sneezing, panting, face-rubbing, and diarrhea-ing things that are in or next to the water: people. It’s also the things that people touch frequently such as guard rails, chairs, towels, and thongs.
So, the key once again will be doing what you should be doing on land: practicing good social distancing, good hand hygiene, good disinfecting (of objects), and good avoid-touching-your-enormous face. And if you see any random objects such as a sign post, a statue, or a thong, don’t touch it if you don’t have to do so. You don’t know where it has been. Actually, in the case of a thong, you know exactly where it’s been. That’s the problem.
Also, wait until beaches, swimming pools, and other water areas are officially open before going to them. Yes, staying inside is not easy. Yes, there are only so many episodes of Breaking Bad that you can watch or mind games that you can play with your cat. But patience now will pay off later.
Once such places are officially open, it won’t be the time to release the kraken, so to speak. Sure you may have stored up all this energy, all those ingenious pick-up lines that probably won’t work anyway, and all the urges to do what you have done before while cooped up inside. But (there’s that word again), try to remember that the virus is still circulating. It will be some time before it is water under the bridge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID19: A Stress Test For Couples</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everything about this crisis is revelatory – for countries, companies and… couples. Countries are discovering whether their leaders care more about their power or their people. Companies are revealing the values they stand for and killing or strengthening their brands as a result. So too for couples. Some will emerge from this turbulence stronger and more united. Others will be adding to the growing number of COVID divorces.
It’s the ultimate bake off. Take your average couple, stick them in a smallish, lidded pot. Throw in equal measures of ambiguity, fear, boredom, and ambient anxiety. Add spice with kids (one to three works well). Additional heat comes from two jobs, two bosses and no home office or daycare. Or two layoffs, no money and no end in sight. Add in lashings of guilt from not being able to care for elderly parents, some possibly in high-risk care homes. Stir, then leave to marinate for a couple of months.
Exceptional circumstances don’t create entirely new relationships – they simply expose its usually invisible underbelly. This COVID crisis is like a ton of bricks suddenly fallen from the sky, smashing onto the foundations that couples have built – over the past few months or the past few decades. Like the three little pigs, couples are getting a report card from the wolf – did they build in sticks, straw, or stone? If there were cracks, they become more visible. If these aren’t addressed, plastered and filled, they morph into ever-deeper gullies, which end up ripping homes apart.
One of the things the stress test reveals is how genuinely gender balanced a couple is at its heart. That’s a polite way of saying it reveals the power dynamics in a relationship (so it’s not just true for opposite-sex couples). Power plays inside couples are a fascinating, if hard-to-measure, phenomenon. There is the obvious, physical sort of domination, that is being horrifically reported in countries around the globe, with escalating rates of domestic abuse.
But more commonly, there are the millions of minutes of what couples have or haven’t done together. To change metaphors, have they built roots, rituals and respect? Or seeded resentment, indifference or doubt. This Covid-spring, have the flowers in their garden blossomed, or are the weeds running amok?  Does one person’s opinion, preferences or career dominate? Has the crisis been an excuse to spread their dominion and further silence anyone else’s needs? Or, on the other hand, have you carefully used the crisis to consciously couple, with the expressly democratic objective of building a life of mutual enhancement – which integrates the little ones and the elders into the voting system? In these cases, the crisis becomes an exercise in cooperation and mutual support which nourishes everyone’s roots and responses for the decade to come.
I have been listening to both in my coaching Fridays. There are families discovering the delicious luxury of time together. Daily family meals. Quality time with children. Pulling the net closer in as the storm clouds gather. Contracting to establish schedules and rhythms that accommodate everyone’s needs. There are others where proximity is pushing all the buttons they haven’t yet taken time to explore. Low self- (and other-) awareness, combined with a dose of culturally reinforced self-centredness, is hard to overcome when crises come calling.
I once wrote that any ambitious human, but especially career-prioritising women, really only have two choices when it comes to their partners: a super-supportive spouse, or none at all. “Anything in between becomes a career and moral-sapping mess.” Never has this proved more true than in the current circumstances. If dual career couples haven’t found a way of re-designing life around their respective personal and professional obligations and expectations, they are likely planting seeds of discord deep into their relational DNA.
If men revert to traditional gender roles in pulling the blanket of money, work or pre-eminence over their heads, they are likely to lose more than they are yet measuring. The Economist warns of this, but seems to put women into the active tense, as though it were their choice, rather than their partner’s withdrawal from active duty: "Women are more likely to take care of home-schooling and entertainment of bored children, meaning their careers suffer more than men’s.”
This may not lead to immediate ruptures, although China is seeing a sudden, post-crisis spike. As I found researching my book on Late Love: Mating in Maturity, people don’t necessarily split quickly. They wait, often for many years, until they feel ready to move on. They wait for the kids to have grown, for their finances to steady, for their confidence to have been fired by the no-longer tenable. The fissures fester, confirmed with each repetitive turn of the sterile, hope-draining patterns. And yes, it’s mostly women who do the walking. Seventy percent of divorces are initiated by women – and that’s been true for the past 100 years.
Like the leadership of countries, the leadership in couples comes down to a simple question. Are you together because of love or fear? There is nothing more resilient in a crisis than the immunity built by love and strong relationships. But if the only reason you are together is because you fear the alternative more, you can probably hear the cracks deepen… So if things at home are tough right now, don’t just assume it’s a bad patch that will pass when the lockdowns lift. Lean into your couple as though your life depended on it. It does.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As researchers race to find an effective treatment or vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus, a new study is underway to determine if the power of prayer helps heal ICU patients sickened with the virus.
Cardiologist Dr. Dhanunjaya “DJ” Lakkireddy, Medical Director of the Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute, recently announced a Covid Prayer Study, described as “the first global, multinational, multilingual double blinded randomized control study” to find out if remote intercessory prayer improves patient outcomes.
The four-month study, launched on May 1, will enroll 1,000 COVID-19 ICU patients with half receiving a daily “universal” prayer from five different religions: Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. The standard of medical care will remain the same for both groups.
Participating institutions can enroll virus-sickened adults from all over the world. To protect patient privacy, each participant is identified by a unique COVID PRAYER STUDY identification (CPS-ID).
Assessments will be performed daily on each participant to assess organ health and need for ventilators. The study will continue until the patient is transferred out of ICU or dies.
This isn’t the first time the power of prayer has been studied in relationship to patient healing. Dr. Lakkireddy’s study information references cite previous limited clinical trials focusing on prayer. While some of those recorded minimal improvement, other past studies revealed “no scientifically discernable effects” for intercessory prayer for healing.
In a recent interview, Dr. Lakkireddy said he understands some people will respond to the study with skepticism, but added “It’s not like we are putting anyone at risk. A miracle could happen. There’s always hope, right?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Iran and Russia launch hacking attacks on British universities in attempt to steal coronavirus vaccine secrets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British institutions fighting Covid-19 have been subject to cyber attacks traced back to Russia and Iran, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.
Hackers linked to hostile states have targeted UK universities attempting to produce vaccines and testing kits as well as scientists and doctors studying the virus.
Spy bosses at the National Cyber Security Centre branded the attacks ‘utterly reprehensible’ and confirmed they were working ‘round the clock’ to battle the online menace.
Security and Whitehall figures have revealed a sustained attempt to target Britain’s efforts to fight the virus by accessing emails and servers in universities and scientific facilities. One said: ‘It looks like they’re trying to steal or borrow information about our response to coronavirus.’
A separate security source said: ‘This problem – intellectual property theft and a blurred line between state and serious crime – has been around for a while but there’s obviously now an increased need to ensure we protect UK PLC and its assets.’
However, it is understood that so far no major attack has been successful – and there has been no attack on NHS computer systems, as happened in May 2017 with devastating effect.
The incidents mirror activity detected in the US last week. The director of America’s National Counterintelligence and Security Center, Bill Evanina, said the US government had warned all its medical research organisations of the threat. 
He told the BBC: ‘We have been working… to ensure they are protecting all the research and data as best they can. 
'We have every expectation foreign intelligence services, to include the Chinese Communist Party, will attempt to obtain what we are making here.’
Britain’s security services and online crime fighters have passed a similar warning to UK researchers. Last night, Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Committee, said Britain should ‘not hesitate in retaliating appropriately’. He added: ‘The global distraction of Covid-19 provides the perfect fog of war to conduct cyber attacks. Especially when the prize of a vaccine is so huge.’
The National Cyber Security Centre said: ‘We have seen an increased proportion of cyber attacks related to coronavirus and our experts work around-the-clock to help organisations targeted.’ 
GCHQ has been drafted in to protect the NHS from cyber attacks.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock issued a directive giving the intelligence agency oversight of the NHS IT network to combat criminal gangs and foreign spies.
The National Cyber Security Centre has taken down more than 2,000 online scams since the pandemic began.
GCHQ is also providing the encryption for a coronavirus contact-tracing app being devised by NHSX, the digital arm of the health service.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Owners who tug on their dog's leash risk injuring the animal's neck - and it can lead to breathing difficulties, research finds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Owners who yank at their dog’s lead when out walking risk injuring the animal or causing it breathing difficulties, according to new research.
Even the lightest tug exerts a force on the animal’s neck that is double the pressure felt from a tourniquet used to prevent bleeding, say scientists.
And when a dog on a lead suddenly lunges after a squirrel or its owner jerks the lead to correct their pet, the force can be at least six times greater.
Anne Carter, a canine scientist at Nottingham Trent University and co-author of the study, wants dogs to be trained to walk on a loose lead or in a harness to prevent choking, breathing problems and neck damage. Laboratory tests were conducted on seven types of dog collar sold at pet shops. None measured a force low enough to avoid the risk of injury when a dog pulled on the lead.
‘I was surprised by the findings,’ Dr Carter said. ‘All types of dog collars have the potential to cause harm when the dog pulls on the lead.
‘Collars are important to display identity tags but we don’t want owners to use them for restraint and control, especially on dogs that like to pull on the lead. If a dog is trained to walk nicely to heel, it will do so.
‘Dogs should be trained to walk on a loose lead or in a harness, which distributes pressure on the dog’s body rather than the neck.’
Dr Carter warned that the dangers posed by leads could be even greater for dogs prone to breathing difficulties, such as short-snouted breeds like bullmastiffs, pugs and shih tzus.
During the study, reported in the science journal Veterinary Record, tests were conducted on a simulated model of a dog’s neck.
Each collar, which included leather, padded, rolled, webbing, rope and chain types, was pulled using three rates of force – firm, strong and jerk – for five seconds and the pressure on the neck was recorded.
Animal psychologist Roger Mugford, who has trained the Queen’s corgis, said: ‘I have never approved of yanks to the lead or dogs pulling leads and have been trying to educate owners to “chuck the choke” for years. Pulling is bad.’
Rachel Casey, canine behaviour director at the Dogs’ Trust, added: ‘We advocate dogs being walked on loose leads or in harnesses. They can be retrained to walk on a loose lead.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former chief scientific adviser sets up rival to Sage in wake of secrecy row to offer alternative advice that Britons can follow on YouTube</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former chief scientific adviser has assembled a rival team of experts to the government's Sage panel after the group became engulfed in a secrecy row. 
Sir David King's group will run parallel to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which has been guiding Boris Johnson's coronavirus crisis response.  
It will broadcast its 'robust, unbiased' advice on YouTube which will likely underscore splits among the country's top scientific minds.
Sir David's transparency mission comes amid mounting concerns over the secrecy of Sage, whose membership is classified and advice is not immediately published.
A simmering row over the group's covertness reached fever pitch last month when it emerged top Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings had attended its meetings. 
Sir Patrick Vallance, who chairs the group and is a podium regular at the daily Number 10 briefings, moved to calm the storm by agreeing to reveal Sage's membership list 'shortly'.
But Sir David's new team could prove a fresh blow to the government panel if its advice runs contrary to the Prime Minister's current battle plan. 
Sir David told the Sunday Times: 'I am not at all critical of the scientists who are putting advice before the government... but because there is no transparency the government can say they are following scientific advice but we don't know that they are.'
The group will submit their findings to the Commons' health select committee and hold their first meeting tomorrow.
The 12-strong team includes some of the world's most distinguished experts, including former World Health Organisation director Anthony Costello, who lashed out at Sage for being 'somewhat opaque'.  
Ahead of their first roundtable, Sir David described Mr Cummings's attendance of some Sage meetings as 'dangerous'. 
He said: 'Cummings is an adviser to the prime minister, and the chief scientific adviser is an adviser to the prime minister.
'So there are two voices from the scientific advisory group and I think that's very dangerous because only one of the two understands the science.' 
The PM's chief adviser came under fire when it emerged he had sat in on some meetings, but Downing Street insist he was not a 'member' of the panel.
It was reported last week that he attempted to sway the scientists towards enforcing a lockdown sooner. 
Sir David worked under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 2005 to 2007 and was at the centre of the foot and mouth crisis. 
He has been particularly scathing of the decision to allow the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead and believes it helped 'accelerate' the spread of the disease on UK soil.
While Sage's membership list is not published, some scientists have revealed themselves to be members. 
They include Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College whose initial modelling forecast a potential 250,000 deaths prompted the current social distancing.
Today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 'transparency is incredibly important in this crisis,' as he prepared to answer questions from the public.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elderly coronavirus patients should be given anti-ageing drugs to make their immune systems 'younger' so they can fight the virus faster, scientists claim</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elderly coronavirus patients could be given anti-ageing drugs to restore their 'young' immune system and help them fight the coronavirus, scientists say.
Over 80 per cent of COVID-19 hospitalisations are those over 65 years of age with a greater than 23-fold increased risk of death. 
As a person ages, their immune system becomes suppressed and it takes longer for their body to recognise and attack the virus.
It gives the virus time to replicate and cause serious disease - which may be heightened by pre-existing health conditions.
But Harvard scientists say this could be fixed with NAD boosters, a relatively new class of anti-ageing supplements. 
Lower levels of NAD+ in the body as a result of ageing are thought to impair biological functions important to health, which might contribute to age-related diseases. 
One of the paper authors sees NAD as the 'closest we’ve gotten to a fountain of youth'. 
The Harvard paper, which is yet to be peer reviewed by other scientists, said: 'The most exciting and potentially impactful technologies to treat Covid-19 are those that activate the body's defences against ageing.
'It may even be possible to reset the age of cells and tissues so currently high-risk individuals can respond to viral infections as though they were young.'
Even though the science is still developing, the available evidence supports the notion that older people are more at risk of the coronavirus.
For example, NHS data shows of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 72 per cent are over the age of 60 - 58 per cent of which are men. 
And more than 91 per cent of people who have died from the virus in England (total 20,853) are over the age of 60, data shows.
More than half of deaths have been in those over 80. 
The Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School team said the severity of coronavirus symptoms experienced by a patient depend on how their body responds to the virus when it enters the body.
The presence of already existing health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, fail to explain exactly why the elderly are less resilient, the team said. 
An effective immune system response is to recognise the virus, alert the body to it and then destroy it with speed and then clear it from the body.
In a young person, immune cells recognise the SARS-CoV-2 virus when it first enters the upper respiratory tract.
The immune cells act appropriately to directly kill the virus and infected cells, preventing the spread of the virus.  
These mechanisms are 'known to be dysfunctional' in the elderly, the paper, authored by three scientists, said.  
Viral alert signals are slow, resulting in greater viral replication and the movement of the virus into the lower respiratory tract where it can infect more cells.  
During ageing, the immune system changes in two fundamental ways which are 'major drivers of the high mortality rates in older patients', according to the research.
Firstly, there is a gradual decline in immune function, called immunosenescence, which hampers the body's ability to recognise pathogens and respond to them effectively. 
The second immune change is a chronic increase in inflammation. It means the body overzealously registers the presence of a pathogen but fails to effectively respond to it.
The team added that in half of fatal COVID-19 cases, the patient experienced a cytokine storm - 82 per cent of whom were over the age of 60.
A cytokine storm is when chemical-signalling molecules which guide a healthy immune response become overactive and go haywire. 
COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome experience a cytokine storm that features high level circulation of inflammatory cytokines in the body.
It exacerbates symptoms and triggers inflammation in major tissues such as the lungs, kidneys, liver and brain. 
Why the elderly are more at risk of a cytokine storm is not known, but there are some ideas - one of these being a decline in levels of NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
'Stiff' lung tissue seen in the elderly may be why the novel coronavirus is more deadly to older patients, a new review article suggests.
The virus invades mucosal cells - cells that produce mucus - before multiplying and spreading throughout the body.
Researchers say the virus replicates itself better in these stiff cells, found in the lungs and upper respiratory tracts of older people, which allows the disease to spread faster.
The team, led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says its findings indicate the prevalence of the virus may not be due to the weakening of the elderly's immune systems as many scientists suspect.
When humans are infected with the new strain, known as SARS-COV-2, the virus first attacks cells that secrete mucus in the respiratory tract. 
After the virus invades a cell, it 'hijacks' the machinery of the cells to replicate itself thousands of times.
These copies infect other cells the body or are expelled via droplets from a cough or sneeze that then infect other cells.
In older people, tissue in the lungs and respiratory tract are stiffer due to a larger supply of protein fibers, according to the researchers.
The researchers say stiff cells 'favor the multiplication of the virus' meaning they replicate themselves easier.
'Biopsies or cell culture experiments could now be used to determine whether this is indeed the case,' they wrote.
The team says this could help scientists determine where to focus their efforts as they research and develop drugs to fight against the virus.
NAD+ lowers as we age, which results in the depression of other important proteins and enzymes, and the surge of others.  
NLPR3, centrally responsible for the activation of inflammatory responses, are thought to be hyperactivated when NAD+ levels drop.
It doesn't help that NAD+ levels are depleted during the course of COVID-19, according to early research. 
And, there is 'increasing evidence that lower NAD+ levels in the lung and vascular endothelium contribute to poor Covid-19 outcomes'. 
The team envision a 'two-step model' whereby inflammation increased due to ageing, and the hyperactivation by SARS-CoV-2 triggers a cytokine storm. 
'Maintaining NAD+ levels may therefore alleviate COVID-19 symptoms,' the authors of the paper said. 
NAD boosters are supplements that contain nicotinamide riboside, a form of vitamin B3. When taken as a supplement, the body converts the nicotinamide riboside to NAD+ - the prized coenzyme in youngsters. 
There is scarce evidence that NAD boosters work. They have only started to creep onto the market in the last 10 years or so.
But a 2017 study published in the journal Science found that boosting NAD+ levels in mice reversed the signs of aging in the tissue and muscles of older mice. 
The reversal was so drastic that researchers could no longer tell the difference between four-month-old mice and two-year-old mice, Futurism reported.
Though it was on animals, the study strongly suggests that boosting NAD+ levels in humans could have health benefits by optimising cellular health.
David Sinclair, an author of the recent Harvard paper, said at the time: 'NAD+ is the closest we’ve gotten to a fountain of youth.
'It’s one of the most important molecules for life to exist, and without it, you’re dead in 30 seconds.' 
The team also said NAD boosters and other techniques may be needed to improve the effectiveness of vaccines, which typically are weaker in the elderly.
They write: 'In the aged, immune responses to vaccination are often weak or defective...Therefore, in designing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, it will be important to consider that older people may not respond as well to vaccines as young people.'
The academics concluded that research into older people will be essential for understanding the threat of the virus among different ages.
There is still 'much to be elucidated' about the varying effects of Covid-19 on people of different ages.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gay and bisexual men are BANNED from Covid blood plasma trials: Volunteer who was turned down despite being in monogamous relationship for 30 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gay and bisexual men are not being allowed to take part in a blood plasma trial to help in the battle against coronavirus.
The NHS is looking for plasma donors from recovered patients to used in the trial by doctors at London's Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.
Earlier today it was reported that 6,500 people have already registered interest in taking part.
But under rules that enraged potential donors, gay and bisexual men will be barred from donating unless they had already abstained from sex for three months. 
Critical care manager Andy Roberts told ITV News that although he had tested positive for coronavirus and has since recovered, he was turned down for the trial.
During a phone call with someone working on the trial, the married NHS worker was asked about his sexuality before being told he was not allowed.  
Keith Ward, his partner of more than three decades, said Mr Roberts being barred from the trial just because he is a gay man made him 'angry'.
'We have been together in a monogamous relationship for more than 30 years and I previously didn’t know of this outrageous three month rule,' he said.
'It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer according to the rules.'
General blood donation guidelines stipulate gay and bisexual men are not permitted to donate blood unless they have abstained from oral or anal sex with another man for three months.
The time limit was reduced from 12 months in 2017. There is no exception given to married gay men or those in monogamous relationships.  
The NHS Blood and Transplant service told MailOnline that the decision to use current donor selection guidelines are to 'protect donors and recipients'.
The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) makes recommendations to the Department of Health which decides on guidelines which NHSBT follow.
So the guidelines mentioned are Department of Health guidelines which we implement. Any reporting needs to be clear on this please.
An NHS Blood and Transplant spokesperson said: 'We will initially be using the current donor selection guidelines although we will keep this under review.
'The guidelines are there to protect the health of the donor and the recipient. Under the current guidelines, men must wait three months after having oral or anal sex with another man.
'We appreciate this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives.
'Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.'
For those who are permitted to take part in the trial, the donations have been collected and transfusions will begin in 'the coming weeks', the hospital's Biomedical Research Centre said.
It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.
The hospital says if the trials prove the treatment to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan coronavirus fears: GMB host tweets he is taking time off 'out of an abundance of caution' while he awaits results of a Covid-19 test after feeling unwell</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Piers Morgan will be taking some time off Good Morning Britain while he awaits the results of a coronavirus test.
The presenter, 55, started feeling unwell over the weekend and will stay off the programme 'out of an abundance of caution'.
He had been going into the west London studio every morning, doing his own make-up and sitting two metres away from co-host Susanna Reid.
Mr Morgan tweeted on Sunday night: 'UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won't be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow.' 
It comes after Ms Reid self-isolated at her London home for two weeks in March following a member of her household developing symptoms of the bug.
Mr Morgan, who is usually on the show with Ms Reid from Monday to Wednesday, has been one of the strongest voices holding the government to account during the crisis.
Since the country was put in lockdown on March 23, he has become the interviewer ministers fear most due to his ruthless scrutinising of the facts.
He has spoken truth to power at every turn, including fiercely questioning decisions made by both the UK and US governments.
In an article for MailOnline on Thursday, the columnist branded Prime Minister Boris Johnson's first press briefing back after beating Covid 'complete and utter bullsh*t'.
He said Mr Johnson's speech had made US President Donald Trump seem credible and that his Brexit strategy cannot be used to beat the virus.
Mr Morgan wrote: 'When Boris fans, the vast majority of them with union jack flags and Brexit slogans in their profiles, scream abuse at me all day long on Twitter for challenging their hero's coronavirus strategy, they do so because to them, any criticism of the government over this crisis is a re-run of the viciously toxic and partisan Brexit campaign.'
He added: 'None of Boris Johnson's political skills that won him the Referendum and December's election are working like they did before the virus struck.'
The journalist pointed to a chart that was shown at the end of the briefing on the 'Global Death Comparision'.
He spotted how it showed the UK was trending to be the second worst hit country in the world for Covid-19 deaths.
On Sunday the number of fatalities in Britain rose by 315 to 28,446, putting it on course to become the hardest hit in Europe.
Its toll is now 264 behind Italy - the continent's original epicentre - which it will likely overtake tomorrow to suffer the second highest fatalities in the world after the US.
Mr Johnson was not the only world leader Mr Morgan has targeted, with him going toe-to-toe with President Trump over the US's coronavirus strategy.
The presenter has repeatedly called out Mr Trump's approach to the bug, which has rampaged across the US and killed more than 65,000 people.
This culminating in him saying Mr Trump was 'batsh*t crazy' for his handling of the crisis.
The US President faced widespread ridicule after he suggested tackling coronavirus with the use of 'powerful' UV light or even injecting patients with disinfectant. 
Starting his column by telling Mr Trump to 'shut the f*** up', Mr Morgan admonished the President for using his position to air the 'batsh*t crazy theories'.
The presenter later announced Mr Trump had unfollowed him on Twitter.
Mr Morgan's approach to politicians was vindicated last week when OFCOM  cleared him for his 'combative' style.
The GMB host attracted more than 3,000 complaints from two interviews with care minister Helen Whately on the show last month.
Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview with Health Secretary Matt Hancock on April 16.
But Ofcom said: 'It is clearly in the public interest that broadcasters are able to hold those making political decisions to account.'
Mr Morgan grilled Ms Whately about the number of NHS and care workers who have died from Covid-19 and accused her of 'massively understating' the effects of the virus.
In the interview Mrs Whately claimed 76 NHS and care workers had died from the disease, to which the host replied: 'You see these numbers again, are completely wrong.
'The real figure of all the people who work in the NHS and care homes who have died is actually 111.'
Mr Hancock was challenged by the MailOnline columnist on whether he would volunteer for a salary reduction.
During the exchange on April 16, Morgan was also angered when the politician claimed the Government was prepared for the pandemic, telling him: 'Stop playing that game with me, Mr Hancock. You're buying yourself a bit of time.'
Mr Morgan said he would have 'admired' Mr Hancock more if he would have just admitted that the Department of Health 'had not been prepared' for the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the National Health Service.
He added: 'Your resolute refusal to concede you made any mistakes here grates with me and misjudges the public mood'.
The pair continued to clash as Morgan chastised Mr Hancock, reminding him he runs the show after the politician urged him to 'let him speak', during the interview.
On Good Morning Britain Mr Morgan said of the watchdog investigation: 'They have not held up any of the complaints. I'm glad about that.
'Freedom of speech matters and journalists doing their job matters. Getting the government to think about every decision they are taking matters, holding them to account matters.
'We do our job they do theirs. But we are all on the same side here and we shouldn't mistake challenging government's with wanting government to fail. 
'I want our government to succeed. We do this challenging everyday with ministers to help them make better decisions, so that fewer people die. 
'We are on the same side against the same enemy. It's not a referendum, its not an election, its one virus against the world.'
It is not clear who will step in for Mr Morgan while he is off.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The world may have to live with Covid for years to come: Imperial College London scientist warns vaccine may NEVER be created and outbreaks and lockdowns could become the norm</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A professor at Imperial College London claims there may never be a coronavirus vaccine and that governments will be left to respond to future outbreaks of the pathogen with regional or national lockdowns. 
Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Covid-19, said no 'absolute assumption' can be made 'that a vaccine will appear at all'.
The global health professor argued that 'high hopes' are 'dashed' because scientists are 'dealing with biological systems, we're not dealing with mechanical systems'.
He added that restrictions to movement 'may apply to parts of a country, or it may even apply to a whole country' in the face of another outbreak.
Dr Nabarro's intervention comes as the British public increasingly turn to scientists under huge pressure to develop a vaccine for an end to the pandemic. 
Already a team at Oxford University are racing to test a vaccine made from a chimpanzee virus. In the US, scientists are trying a different vaccine.
Ministers have signalled that the quarantining of the elderly would only occur if a vaccine were developed. It is estimated this could take at least one year. 
Dr Nabarro, who has warned that people can expect to wear face masks in the future, told CNN:' There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against.
'We can't make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety. 
'You have high hopes, and then your hopes are dashed. 
'We're dealing with biological systems, we're not dealing with mechanical systems. It really depends so much on how the body reacts.' 
Dr Nabarro suggested that lockdowns, many of which are in the process of gradually being lifted by governments, could be implemented at any moment.
'From time to time there will be outbreaks,' he said. 'Movement will be restricted and that may apply to parts of a country, or it may even apply to a whole country.'
Michael Gove told a coronavirus press briefing of the Government's so-called 'whack-a-mole' policy, which involves gradually easing the lockdown.
Restrictions can be quickly snapped back into effect in light of future outbreaks. 
Imperial College London encouraged the Government to pursue a lockdown after it projected that half a million people could die if no action was taken.
It has led to the furloughing of millions of workers and the closure of huge swathes of the economy - chiefly in food, retail, hospitality, travel, and manufacturing. 
Cabinet Ministers are quick to say that the lockdown has saved lives. So far, no concrete proof backing the claim has been presented.
Meanwhile, economists have estimated that the policy could be costing Britain £2.4billion per day. Others say the economic crisis is the most severe in 100 years.
A Bank of England official recently warned that the UK economy is facing an extreme contraction, the likes of which may not have been felt in centuries.
The spiralling crisis has led to the repeated intervention of Lord Sumption, one of Britain's most distinguished historians and jurists.
In a piece for the Mail on Sunday, Lord Sumption called the continued locking up of the elderly a 'cruel mockery of basic human values'. 
He criticised the Government's 'blind panic following the delivery of Imperial College London's Professor Neil Ferguson's statistical projections'.
Lord Sumption also took to task the 'money question'. 'People decry attempts to measure the mortality of Covid-19 against the economic cost of reducing it,' he writes. 'But this too is rhetoric, and hypocritical rhetoric at that. 
'Money is not just for plutocrats. You and I and the editor of The Guardian and the driver of the No 9 bus and the Archbishop of Canterbury and the cashier at the supermarket all value and depend on money.
'Not just in the sense that it pays our wages or pensions. Hundreds of thousands of businesses are going under. Millions are moving from jobs to universal credit. A thriving economy, of the kind that we are now throwing away, is the source of our security and the foundation of our children's future.
'We would do well not to sneer at it. Poverty kills too. And when it does not kill, it maims, mentally, physically, and socially.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche wins U.S. nod for COVID-19 antibody test, aims to boost output</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) has won emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to determine whether people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said on Sunday.
Thomas Schinecker, Roche’s head of diagnostics, said the company aims to more than double production of tests from about 50 million a month to significantly more than 100 million a month by the end of the year.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests to learn who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to help end national lockdowns.
Basel-based Roche, which also makes molecular tests to identify active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test has a specificity rate exceeding 99.8% and sensitivity of 100%, meaning tests would show very few false positives and no false negatives.
A false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity. Roche said its test relies on intravenous blood draws, with higher accuracy than finger-prick tests.
“If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve ... when you take blood from the vein,” Schinecker said.
“You have to have very, very high specificity. Even 0.1% or 0.2% makes a difference.”
Similar antibody tests have also been developed by companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Becton Dickinson (BDX.N) and Italy’s DiaSorin (DIAS.MI).
Abbott has said the specificity and sensitivity of its test are 99.5% and 100% respectively. Diasorin has said its Liason XL test has 97.4% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity.
As demand escalates for antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established testing competency have also joined the experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
Roche did not disclose a price for its test but said that it would be identical worldwide.
Schinecker foresees a high need for testing healthcare workers and their families for exposure, and those who showed signs and symptoms, to see if they have antibodies.
While antibodies typically confer some immunity, Schinecker acknowledged that much remains to be learned about the novel coronavirus before drawing definitive conclusions.
“Since this virus is not well known, one can hypothesise, but the proof will take longer,” he said. “Testing these people ... is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The mysterious lights were recorded days before the Pentagon officially released much-debated videos taken on board aircraft of alleged guests to Earth in order “to clear up misconceptions” about the authenticity of the circulated clips.
A strange triangle-shaped UFO is claimed to have appeared above Texas in what has been reported as the fourth such sighting in a year, according to a YouTube channel dedicated to suspicious hovering objects.
A new video from the town of Tomball has emerged showing one of the clearest sightings to date, featuring three bright “rings” slowly forming into a triangle. Hardly do they start to vanish before they re-emerge, stunning a woman behind the camera, who can be heard uttering “oh my God” before questioning what it might be.
The previous sightings of this kind in Texas - at least three of them - were dismissed as Chinese lanterns, balloons, and kites.
The Texas video comes after the Pentagon officially released intriguing footage taken by the US Navy of “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena”. The clips were recorded in 2004 and 2015 by infrared cameras on US Navy aircraft and show what the Pentagon calls “unidentified aerial phenomena”. The oblong objects appear to move through the sky in elaborate ways, while the pilots can be heard in the videos wondering about the breakneck speed they were moving at and how they managed to fly into a substantial headwind with ease.
The declassified videos have been circulating for a few years after first being reported in 2017. This week, the DoD made them officially available for download in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request “to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos”, according to Sue Gough, a DoD spokeswoman, who said that the objects in the records remain unidentified.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (Sputnik) - The German government said earlier that Merkel would be participating in the conference of donor countries on the fight against pandemic on Monday at the invitation of the European Commission.
Vaccines against the coronavirus disease that the European Union is planning to develop will be globally available, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday.
It is about "how we are developing vaccines, drugs, and good diagnostic options for all people around the world," Merkel said in a statement, adding that Germany "took this responsibility."
According to Merkel, about eight billion euros are still not enough to develop a vaccine. Germany "will make a significant financial contribution" to this work, she stressed.
The chancellor welcomed the fact that not only government agencies were involved in this activity, but also private foundations, vaccine and drug manufacturers.
Merkel added that Germany intended to continue working closely with the World Health Organisation on this matter.
Merkel and other EU leaders have previously called for fundraising in the amount of 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and medications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Highly Unlikely’: US Researcher Rebuts Coronavirus Lab Leak Theory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the greatest mysteries of the coronavirus pandemic is how exactly the virus made its way to humans. The most widespread theory holds that it jumped from bats to humans, but some insist that a virus lab in Wuhan was at the epicentre of the outbreak.
There is very little chance, for several reasons, that the SARS-CoV-2 has been accidentally released from a Chinese laboratory, according to a US pandemic specialist who has worked with Wuhan researchers.
Mazet has led a US-funded pandemic early warning programme called PREDICT, which was wound down just months before the novel coronavirus was detected in China. That project provided money and training to virologists across the globe, including in Wuhan, the Chinese city where SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory – a rare type of lab that deals with the most dangerous pathogens in the world, with the highest level of biocontainment.
There is still scarce evidence as to where the coronavirus came from. The most widespread assumption, backed up by research, is that it has a natural origin and jumped from bats to humans, either directly or through an animal intermediary.
However, there is also a yet-unconfirmed theory that SARS-CoV-2 was leaked from the Wuhan lab. US President Donald Trump has publicly backed this theory, and the US intelligence community is currently investigating it. The lab has denied any role in spreading the virus.
Notably, however, the US national intelligence director's office has ruled out that the coronavirus was either man-made or genetically modified.
Jonna Mazet told Business Insider that she had spoken to Shi Zhengli, a prominent Wuhan researcher of bat-borne coronaviruses. She said that Zhengli is “absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening”.
Zhengli said in an interview published last month that she had gone through the lab's records and found that none of the sequences of the new coronavirus matched those of the viruses sampled by her team in the past - something that rules out a leak.
Secondly, Mazet said, Wuhan virologists use “extreme personal protective equipment” and study only the samples that have been deactivated using chemicals, while the containers with the “active” virus are kept in a special area.
She also pointed out that some visitors of bat habitats, like tourists and poachers, wander into those places less protected and are at a high risk of being exposed to viruses, unlike virologists who collect samples wearing protective equipment.
Daszak estimated that from 1 million to 7 million people get infected by bat-borne viruses in Southeast Asia every year.
“If you look at the labs in Southeast Asia that have any coronaviruses in culture, there are probably two or three and they’re in high security,” he said. “The Wuhan Institute of Virology does have a small number of bat coronaviruses in culture. But they’re not [the new coronavirus], SARS-CoV-2. There are probably half a dozen people that do work in those labs. So let’s compare 1 million to 7 million people a year to half a dozen people; it’s just not logical.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus disproportionately affects women's health, finances</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus crisis is not without its little pleasures. For Audrey Lebeau-Live, one of them is pushing the mute button on the video and audio conferences from her work. This button allows her to do the washing up, listen with one ear to her daughter giving a presentation in the next room to her computer camera and — if all goes well — put a load of washing in the machine.
Since the French government imposed comprehensive stay-at-home regulations and temporarily closed schools in mid-March, Lebeau-Live has been feeling like many parents across the world who have to work and look after children at the same time. "You have the sense of never getting enough done, never coping with everything," she says on the telephone.
Under normal circumstances, she and her husband used to share household chores. But now, for example, cooking lunch is an additional task, as everyone ate in the canteen before the coronavirus crisis hit. "It's mostly the mothers who get burdened with the extra work," Lebeau-Live says, and laughs, even though she doesn't really feel like laughing. She says she feels responsible for it all, unlike her husband, who thinks: What I manage, I manage; the rest can wait for the time being.

The missing female perspective
Lebeau-Live feels that this has to do with the fact that women still have to prove themselves more, especially when they have a leadership position. She heads a small team at IRSN, the French agency responsible for protection against radiation and for nuclear security, situated near Paris. She criticizes the fact that those who decide on making people work at home and forbidding them to leave the house are often men who do not take into account the perspective of women.
Hannah Elsche, an art therapist from Berlin, sees things in a similar light. Like Lebeau-Live, she has three children. Because of the coronavirus crisis, she decided — of necessity — to extend her parental leave. "Many women are looking after children more at the moment because their husbands or partners earn more," Elsche says. She says she sees this happening around her as well, and that her husband wasn't even asked who was looking after the children at home.
Although many may call these "First World problems," Catriona Graham sees the situation as serious. "Gender stereotypes are among the strongest and most rigid causes of sexism and inequality," she says. Particularly in times of crisis, many people find security in going back to stereotyped roles, says Graham, who works for the European Women's Lobby, an organization that advocates women's interests.
Among these cliched role stereotypes is the one that women are more responsible for children and the household, and perhaps care for older family members as well. According to UNICEF, women across the world did three times as much unpaid care work as men even before the current crisis. And the UN says this type of work is now growing "exponentially."

Keeping things running
Single mothers are affected particularly severely by the restrictions imposed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Some 85% of parents who look after children on their own are women. Some years ago, Laurence Helaili-Chapuis from Dublin founded a group to support these mothers. She says many such women are now getting in touch with her because they are "in a complicated situation." Helaili-Chapuis says even shopping is difficult for a lot of them, while some are also worried about their professional future.
And not without cause. The UN is already warning that women will be the ones to suffer the most under the economic consequences of the crisis. It estimates that almost 60% of women worldwide work in the informal economy; they earn less than men, can save less as a result and are at greater risk of descending into poverty.

At the same time, it is largely women who are keeping things running at the moment. In the European Union, for example, women make up almost 80% of workers in the health sector. Employees in supermarkets who continue to operate the tills and cleaning personnel who are still keeping things hygienic are mostly women. And because of the types of work they do, they are exposed to a higher risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus.
It is not the first time that women have been the ones to bear the brunt of a crisis. Studies on the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, for example, show that women were in greater danger of being infected, partly because it was mostly them looking after those who were ill.
Codeword 'Mask 19'
There is also another type of danger lying in wait for women who have to stay home during the coronavirus crisis, and this one is homemade: domestic violence.
Evelyn Regner, an Austrian Social Democratic politician who is the chair of the committee for women's rights in the European Parliament, says that one in three women had already had an experience of violence in her direct environment even before the current crisis.
She says that number has now exploded, with the UN saying that in Italy, 75% more women are ringing helplines; in other countries, such calls have doubled.
But Regner also mentions some hopeful developments. In Spain, for example, women can get help in pharmacies — one of the few places they are still allowed to visit amid the restrictions — if they use the codeword "Mask 19." The pharmacists will then know what is meant and tell the police, Regner says.
"The coronavirus is making crises worse," Regner says, whether violence against women, the salary gap, or the difficulties faced by single mothers. "Things that were already bad are now getting even more serious."

Helaili-Chapuis says even shopping is difficult for a lot of them, while some are also worried about their professional future.
And not without cause. The UN is already warning that women will be the ones to suffer the most under the economic consequences of the crisis. It estimates that almost 60% of women worldwide work in the informal economy; they earn less than men, can save less as a result and are at greater risk of descending into poverty.

At the same time, it is largely women who are keeping things running at the moment. In the European Union, for example, women make up almost 80% of workers in the health sector. Employees in supermarkets who continue to operate the tills and cleaning personnel who are still keeping things hygienic are mostly women. And because of the types of work they do, they are exposed to a higher risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus.
It is not the first time that women have been the ones to bear the brunt of a crisis. Studies on the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, for example, show that women were in greater danger of being infected, partly because it was mostly them looking after those who were ill.
Codeword 'Mask 19'
There is also another type of danger lying in wait for women who have to stay home during the coronavirus crisis, and this one is homemade: domestic violence.
Evelyn Regner, an Austrian Social Democratic politician who is the chair of the committee for women's rights in the European Parliament, says that one in three women had already had an experience of violence in her direct environment even before the current crisis.
She says that number has now exploded, with the UN saying that in Italy, 75% more women are ringing helplines; in other countries, such calls have doubled.
But Regner also mentions some hopeful developments. In Spain, for example, women can get help in pharmacies — one of the few places they are still allowed to visit amid the restrictions — if they use the codeword "Mask 19." The pharmacists will then know what is meant and tell the police, Regner says.
"The coronavirus is making crises worse," Regner says, whether violence against women, the salary gap, or the difficulties faced by single mothers. "Things that were already bad are now getting even more serious."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Koalas lick tree trunks to quench their thirst when it rains, scientists just learned. It upends what biologists long thought about koalas: that they get almost all the water they need from the eucalyptus leaves they eat.
But koalas probably lap up water like many animals — except they do so from trees, according to the findings published today in the journal Ethology. With fires, heat waves, and droughts putting more and more stress on the critters, scientists have been paying close attention to how koalas are keeping hydrated.
“This significantly alters our understanding of how koalas gain water in the wild. It is very exciting,” lead author of the Ethology paper and University of Sydney researcher Valentina Mella said in a statement.
The surprising discovery was made by enlisting the help of citizen scientists and independent ecologists who had observed the koalas’ behavior in the wild between 2006 and 2019. One koala was caught lapping up rainwater for more than 30 minutes, at “a steady pace” of two licks per second. Altogether, they documented 46 instances of koalas drinking in trees during and after it rained. Koalas were recorded drinking every time observations were made in the rain. One of the reasons why scientists hadn’t noticed this before is because people are less likely to go out and look for them in bad weather, according to Mella. The marsupials seem to prefer smooth parts of the trees where it’s easier to collect the trickling water.
Koalas are considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which keeps track of endangered species. They were devastated by massive bushfires that swept through Australia late last year. Nearly a third of all koalas were thought to have been wiped out in the state of New South Wales, which was the hardest hit by the fires.
The same hot and dry conditions that fueled the flames left koalas parched. Photos and videos of koalas approaching people to drink went viral as the wildfires raged throughout Australia last year.
Even before the latest fires, Mella’s previous research found that climate change was leaving koalas thirsty. In 2017, koalas were caught on camera standing up to drink at artificial water stations set up by researchers — a very unusual behavior for animals that spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees.
At the time, Mella and her colleagues thought the behavior was because hotter temperatures and changing rainfall patterns were drying up the leaves that koalas eat. Now, she and her co-authors of the new paper think that less rainfall could be another, more direct factor leaving koalas with less rainwater to lap off of the tree trunks they call home.
Mella is currently raising money to continue her research and set up more drinking stations for koalas. She hopes the drinking stations, which are placed in trees, will give the koalas a safe way to cool down even as the world around them continues to heat up.

President Trump renewed his criticism of the World Health Organization Thursday for the way the United Nations organization failed to challenge false information China initially provided minimizing the coronavirus outbreak in that country. He should also call out the WHO for its disgraceful role in spreading absurd lies and hatred about U.S. ally Israel for years.
Trump recently suspended U.S. funding of the WHO. America is by far the largest donor to the agency and was scheduled to give it $894 million during the current two-year funding period.
The president said Thursday that “the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they’re like the public relations agency for China.” He could have also added that the WHO has operated like a PR and propaganda agency for the enemies of Israel – the only democracy in the Middle East.
GOP REP UNVEILS BILL TO PROBE WHO’S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, PAST ACTIONS
A year ago, WHO member countries voted 96 to 11 – with the U.S. in opposition – for an annual resolution blaming Israel for “health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syria Golan.”
While one might expect the WHO to be apolitical, it – like nearly every other U.N.-associated organ – is used by Israel’s enemies as a platform for viciously attacking the Jewish state. What may be even more disturbing is that democracies that should know better – including France, Belgium and Sweden – joined in the unjustified condemnation of Israel.
As U.N. Watch noted, out of 21 items on the WHO agenda, the only one focused on a specific country applied to Israel. This targeting of Israel has been going on since at least 2000.
U.N. Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer noted that “anyone who has ever walked into an Israeli hospital or clinic knows that they are providing world-class health care to thousands of Palestinian Arabs.”
It will not be surprising if this year the WHO adopts the usual Israel-bashing resolution and falsely accuses Israel of preventing Palestinians from getting treatment for COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus.
In fact, Israel is doing a great deal to help the Palestinians contain the coronavirus outbreak that first apparently arrived in the West Bank in Bethlehem.
Israel quickly provided 250 coronavirus test kits to the Palestinian Authority and began joint training sessions for Israeli and Palestinian medical personnel to study the coronavirus, the protection of medical personnel, and the testing of patients suspected of being coronavirus carriers.
In Gaza, the Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed the receipt of test kits and medical equipment from Israel that were requested by Palestinian medical personnel.
“Handling the coronavirus outbreak takes precedence over any political consideration, and without help from Israel, Gaza would be in a very difficult situation in the case of an outbreak,” a Palestinian Health Ministry official told the Israel Hayom newspaper.
Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, Israel permitted thousands of Palestinians to enter Israel for medical treatment. After Israel instituted a lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, it continued to provide medical supplies to Gaza – 88 tons during one week in April alone.
On March 20, Israel delivered hundreds of test kits and 1,000 protective medical gear kits to Gaza. Five days later, more than 3,000 test kits and 50,000 masks from the WHO were delivered to the Palestinian Authority.
Israeli and Palestinian health and security officials are in frequent contact and have coordinated training sessions for Palestinian medical professionals. A training session was held, for example, for medical staff from Gaza at the Erez Border Crossing by a team from the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan in Israel.
The Palestinians benefit from the Israeli assistance, since Israel was just ranked the safest country in the world during the pandemic by the Deep Knowledge Group.
But despite all this, it will be no surprise if the WHO has the chutzpah to condemn Israel this year once again. We don’t know if Western democracies will again go along.
Last year’s WHO resolution attacking Israel ignored the impact of Palestinian terrorism on the health of the Palestinian people, as well as the mistreatment of Palestinians by the Hamas terrorist group that governs Gaza and by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
Just five months ago, the Palestinian Authority objected to an American plan to build a hospital in Gaza. And, of course, the same group has utterly rejected the peace plan advanced by President Trump to end hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians – and has even cut off contacts with the Trump administration.
Hamas goes even further, refusing to even acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and harshly condemning the U.S. and the Trump administration.
In 2017, reportedly under pressure from Syria, the WHO hid a positive report on Israel. This was especially galling given that four years earlier the Israel Defense Forces had begun treating hundreds of sick and wounded Syrians at field hospitals staffed by volunteers in the Golan Heights.
In 2016, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Good Neighbor to expand its aid program and allow Syrians to be treated in Israeli hospitals. According to the IDF, more than 4,900 Syrians – including 1,300 children – were brought to Israeli hospitals during the five years of providing medical assistance.

During that time, Israel transported into Syria 1,700 tons of food; 1.1 million liters of fuel; 26,000 cases of medical equipment and medication; 20 generators; 40 vehicles; 630 tents; 350 tons of clothing; 8,200 packages of diapers; and 49,000 cases of baby food.
The operation was shut down in September 2018 after Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Assad reestablished control over southern Syria in that country’s civil war.
While the WHO condemns Israel for health conditions on the Golan Heights, it says nothing about Assad’s attacks on hundreds of Syrian medical facilities and the humanitarian disaster he has created in the war against his own people. The WHO simply refers to “attacks” as if no one is responsible.

Meanwhile, Israeli medical supplies have continued to flow into Gaza even as terrorists attack Israelis at the border and fire rockets into civilian areas. Tens of thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza are admitted to Israel every year for medical treatment.
Even Palestinian leaders who call for Israel’s destruction send their family members to Israeli hospitals. For example, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s daughter was hospitalized in Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. His brother-in-law, mother-in-law and one of his granddaughters were also treated in Israel.
The sister of another senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, was treated in Israel for cancer and an Israeli medical specialist went to Ramallah on the West Bank to help save the life of Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. A year later, Abbas said Palestinians would be barred from treatment in Israel.

If the WHO had any integrity and honesty it would be praising Israel as a model of good neighborliness for the massive medical assistance is has provided to the Palestinians for years, including during the coronavirus pandemic.
The truth is that Israel has done far more than both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to care for the health of the Palestinian people. It’s long past time for the WHO to recognize this and end its dishonest Israel-bashing campaign once and for all.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, New Jersey has begun issuing temporary emergency licenses to doctors licensed in other countries. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy called the new policy "entirely fitting" for the state, which has the second-most cases of COVID-19 and the second-most deaths after New York.
It's a smart move.
The United States was suffering from a shortage of doctors long before the coronavirus landed on our shores. The pandemic has cast that shortage into even starker relief. Right now, we need every qualified doctor we can find – and that need will not go away after the pandemic ends.
KATHY GIUSTI: WAR ON CORONAVIRUS CAN TEACH US HOW TO MORE EFFECTIVELY WAGE WAR ON CANCER
State and federal regulations make it hard for physicians licensed in foreign countries to practice medicine in the United States. Doctors from other countries, with the exception of Canada, must pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Fair enough.
But doctors from outside the U.S. must also complete a three- to seven-year residency – even if they've already trained and practiced in their home countries. Some states even make established doctors redo part of their graduate education before granting them a medical license.
It can be next to impossible for these doctors to secure the medical residencies they need. This year, more than 40,000 applicants vied for just over 37,000 residency positions.
These regulations force even the most qualified foreign physicians to essentially redo their medical training if they want to practice in the United States. That's time-consuming and expensive. So many of them take on other jobs for which they're supremely overqualified.
The stories are astonishing. A Macedonian primary care doctor became a nurse in Boston. An accomplished Sri Lankan anesthesiologist taught medical test prep courses in New Jersey. Other doctors work as waiters or cab drivers while trying to gain a U.S. medical license.
Our country can't afford to turn away talented physicians. The United States will need an additional 122,000 physicians to meet patient demand by 2032, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Public officials have taken some steps to address the shortage. The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact allows doctors to get licensed simultaneously in multiple states. In theory, the compact allows doctors to move freely to in-need areas. But the compact only applies in 26 states. Big states including California, New York and Texas are not among them.
Given the six-figure shortage of doctors we're facing, we must do much more to increase the supply of physicians.
Some may worry that foreign-trained doctors provide worse care than those educated in the United States. Sure, we need standards. But is a policy that makes it harder for doctors educated at the likes of Oxford or Cambridge to come to the United States really all that wise?
Further, there's plenty of evidence that doctors educated abroad provide excellent care. For example, a 2017 study led by a Harvard researcher found that patients treated by international medical graduates posted lower mortality rates than those treated by U.S. medical graduates.

Besides, we already rely on foreign doctors to fill gaps in our nation's health care workforce. Half of all foreign-trained doctors work in areas where the annual per-capita income is less than $30,000 per year. These doctors also make up one-third of our country's primary care physicians.
An influx of immigrant doctors could also lead to more experimentation in the provision of care – and ultimately spur competition throughout the health care system.
Immigrants are more likely to start businesses than people born into the United States, according to the National Immigration Forum. Perhaps they'd be more willing to try out direct primary care, where patients pay a flat monthly fee for a suite of services. These models have the potential to yield lower costs and better care for patients.

Entrepreneurial foreign doctors may also be more interested in launching independent practices, which have been on the decline. Increasingly, doctors are working for big hospital systems with few competitors. That's one of the reasons health care costs have been on the rise.
Many foreign-trained doctors are ready, willing and able to help the United States battle pandemics, doctor shortages and more. All we have to do is let them.

Big Tech companies should make up their minds. Are they public fora, open to one and all, that faithfully carry an infinite spectrum of messages — much as AT&T phone lines transmit liberal, moderate, and conservative robocalls during election season? Or are they private institutions, exclusively for those with whom they agree — much as Mother Jones peddles the Left and National Review promotes the Right?

Either approach is fine and honorable. But Facebook, Google, YouTube, and their ilk should not do both — especially while morphing into the private/exclusive model, and savoring government protection to boot.
DEROY MURCOCK: DEMOCRATS ON CORONAVIRUS — CANDIDATES MUM ON COVID-19 DURING DEBATES
Big Tech’s private-sector censorship has been on vivid display during the COVID-19 crisis. Opinions with which these companies differ simply disappear, as three examples show in just the last week.

Department of Homeland Security scientist William Bryan said at President Donald J. Trump’s April 23 press briefing that ultraviolet light seems to kill COVID-19. Trump wondered aloud, “supposing you brought the light inside the body.” That’s all it took for Hate Trump, Inc. to hammer the president for medical malpractice. (He also mused over the prospect of doctors using disinfectants to treat patients, which the Trump-loathing press wildly inflated into “reports” that he wanted physicians to inject COVID-19 patients with Lysol.)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commentary: 10 signs a greater depression is coming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We may see an L-shaped greater depression later in this decade even if there is lacklustre economic recovery this year, says economist Nouriel Roubini.
NEW YORK CITY: After the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, the imbalances and risks pervading the global economy were exacerbated by policy mistakes.
So, rather than address the structural problems that the financial collapse and ensuing recession revealed, governments mostly kicked the can down the road, creating major downside risks that made another crisis inevitable.
And now that it has arrived, the risks are growing even more acute. Unfortunately, even if the Greater Recession leads to a lacklustre U-shaped recovery this year, an L-shaped “Greater Depression” will follow later in this decade, owing to 10 ominous and risky trends. 
DEBT AND FISCAL STRENGTH
The first trend concerns deficits and their corollary risks: debts and defaults. 
The policy response to the COVID-19 crisis entails a massive increase in fiscal deficits – on the order of 10 per cent of GDP or more – at a time when public debt levels in many countries were already high, if not unsustainable.  
Worse, the loss of income for many households and firms means that private-sector debt levels will become unsustainable, too, potentially leading to mass defaults and bankruptcies. 
Together with soaring levels of public debt, this all but ensures a more anaemic recovery than the one that followed the Great Recession a decade ago.
A second factor is the demographic time bomb in advanced economies. The COVID-19 crisis shows that much more public spending must be allocated to health systems, and that universal health care and other relevant public goods are necessities, not luxuries.
Yet, because most developed countries have ageing societies, funding such outlays in the future will make the implicit debts from today’s unfunded health-care and social-security systems even larger.
A third issue is the growing risk of deflation. In addition to causing a deep recession, the crisis is also creating a massive slack in goods - unused machines and capacity - and labour markets - mass unemployment - as well as driving a price collapse in commodities such as oil and industrial metals.
That makes debt deflation likely, increasing the risk of insolvency. 
A fourth and related factor will be currency debasement. As central banks try to fight deflation and head off the risk of surging interest rates - following from the massive debt build-up - monetary policies will become even more unconventional and far-reaching.
In the short run, governments will need to run monetised fiscal deficits to avoid depression and deflation. 
Yet, over time, the permanent negative supply shocks from accelerated de-globalisation and renewed protectionism will make stagflation all but inevitable.
DISRUPTION OF SYSTEMS
A fifth issue is the broader digital disruption of the economy.
With millions of people losing their jobs or working and earning less, the income and wealth gaps of the 21st century economy will widen further. 
To guard against future supply-chain shocks, companies in advanced economies will re-shore production from low-cost regions to higher-cost domestic markets. 
But rather than helping workers at home, this trend will accelerate the pace of automation, putting downward pressure on wages and further fanning the flames of populism, nationalism, and xenophobia.
This points to the sixth major factor: de-globalisation.
The pandemic is accelerating trends toward balkanisation and fragmentation that were already well underway. 
The United States and China will decouple faster, and most countries will respond by adopting still more protectionist policies to shield domestic firms and workers from global disruptions. 
The post-pandemic world will be marked by tighter restrictions on the movement of goods, services, capital, labour, technology, data, and information.
This is already happening in the pharmaceutical, medical-equipment, and food sectors, where governments are imposing export restrictions and other protectionist measures in response to the crisis.
The backlash against democracy will reinforce this trend. Populist leaders often benefit from economic weakness, mass unemployment, and rising inequality. 
Under conditions of heightened economic insecurity, there will be a strong impulse to scapegoat foreigners for the crisis. 
Blue-collar workers and broad cohorts of the middle class will become more susceptible to populist rhetoric, particularly proposals to restrict migration and trade.
IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ORDER
This points to an eighth factor: the geostrategic standoff between the US and China. With the Trump administration making every effort to blame China for the pandemic, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime will double down on its claim that the US is conspiring to prevent China’s peaceful rise.
The Sino-American decoupling in trade, technology, investment, data, and monetary arrangements will intensify.
Worse, this diplomatic breakup will set the stage for a new cold war between the US and its rivals – not just China, but also Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
With a US presidential election approaching, there is every reason to expect an upsurge in clandestine cyber warfare, potentially leading even to conventional military clashes.
And because technology is the key weapon in the fight for control of the industries of the future and in combating pandemics, the US private tech sector will become increasingly integrated into the national-security-industrial complex.
PANDEMICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
A final risk that cannot be ignored is environmental disruption, which, as the COVID-19 crisis has shown, can wreak far more economic havoc than a financial crisis.
Recurring epidemics - HIV since the 1980s, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2011, Ebola from 2014 to 2016 - are, like climate change, essentially man-made disasters, born of poor health and sanitary standards, the abuse of natural systems, and the growing interconnectivity of a globalised world.
Pandemics and the many morbid symptoms of climate change will become more frequent, severe, and costly in the years ahead.
These ten risks, already looming large before COVID-19 struck, now threaten to fuel a perfect storm that sweeps the entire global economy into a decade of despair.
By the 2030s, technology and more competent political leadership may be able to reduce, resolve, or minimise many of these problems, giving rise to a more inclusive, cooperative, and stable international order.
But any happy ending assumes that we find a way to survive the coming Greater Depression.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adopt a sun bear or terrapin: Wildlife conservationists in Malaysia appeal for donations to ride out COVID-19 impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR: On a normal day, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Sandakan, Sabah, would have tourists and schoolchildren coming in droves to see rescued Bornean sun bears, the smallest species of bears, and hiking through part of the Kabili-Sepilok forest complex on elevated walkways.
Since Malaysia’s government imposed a nationwide movement control order (MCO) in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, the centre has fallen quiet. The only activities there now are of the bears roaming the forest enclosure, and the keepers going about feeding their charges and maintaining the centre.
With only essential travel allowed, the country’s tourism has ground to a halt for over six weeks. This has greatly impacted eco-tourism sites like the Bornean sun bear centre, which is also a wildlife conservation and rehabilitation centre for rescued sun bears.
"We depend on tourism revenue for our operations. In 2019, we counted 84,496 visitors through our gates," its founder and chief executive officer Wong Siew Te told CNA. 
The centre has 43 rescued bears and 30 staff members, who are divided into teams in-charge of taking care of the bears, education outreach and tourism. Since its founding in 2008, the centre has released seven rehabilitated bears back into Sabah’s forests.
The Gibbon Conservation Society in Raub, Pahang, is also facing the same predicament. With an aim of rehabilitating the gibbons and releasing them back into the wild, the organisation had always depended on contributions and donations to fund its expenses.
It used to take in volunteers, usually university students studying zoology, to help with preparing the gibbons’ feed, running data collection and helping with the gibbons’ learning enrichment.
Not anymore. Project leader Mariani Ramli said she had stopped taking student volunteers just prior to the MCO, which restricts both domestic and international travel. 
“As it is, one of our four employees is stuck in Kedah, and can’t return to the centre to help. We managed to get a local volunteer to help with the centre’s daily operations,” she said. 
With the MCO disrupting the traditional means of funding for these private wildlife conservation efforts, they are now compelled to re-orientate and source new means of revenue to ensure the animals’ eventual return to the wild is not affected.
FUNDING DRIES UP
Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre is cutting costs wherever it can, but there are fixed costs even though it is temporarily shut. 
“It takes about RM120,000 a month to run the centre and to pay for the bears’ food and medicines, as well as staff salaries,” Wong said.
The centre relies on a local supplier, who sources vegetables from local farmers in another town. Wong said he would not consider switching to other suppliers who might be able to offer a cheaper price for now. 
“Sometimes you have to look at the bigger picture. If I were to start looking for an alternative now, that would mean difficulties and problems up the supply chain. The supplier and farmers in turn would face problems too,” he said.
Along Peninsular Malaysia’s East Coast in Kemaman district, Terengganu, the Turtle Conservation Society’s executive director and co-founder Dr Chen Pelf Nyok said she had never expected a pandemic to hit Malaysia.
But the past nine years educating and working with the local community about conserving the river terrapin along the Kemaman river has borne fruit, she said. Previously, terrapin eggs were part of the locals’ diet, a threat to the population of the riverine turtle known as tuntung in Malay.
“Now they are the ones on hand to help with ensuring that the 700 terrapins hatched at the conservation centre’s incubator are cleaned and fed daily, until they are old enough to be released back into the rivers,” Dr Chen said. 
Besides conservation, the Turtle Conversation Society also carries out education outreach programmes for both government students and home-schoolers to highlight the local fauna and ecosystem. 
The centre derived about one-fifth of its operating budget from small eco-tourism activities, where tourists and visitors could visit the centre and enjoy firefly watching along the Cherating River. The rest came from donations, contributions and merchandising. 
All that is gone now, hit by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting MCO. 
Dr Chen explained that she could not be at the hatchery, as her home was more than 10km from the conservation centre. Instead, work is currently being carried out by a local, Wazel Mahad, 57, who spends about six to seven hours each day to clean the tanks, refill them with fresh water and also feed the turtles. 
“This community-based conservation project was at the back of my mind when we started TCS. It was a long and difficult journey for nine years, but I’m glad it happened, because it has paid off with the local participation,” said Dr Chen. 
DONATION AND ADOPTION CAMPAIGNS
To ensure their continuous operations, the sun bear and river terrapin centres are ramping up promotional efforts for their "adopt an animal" programmes, besides soliciting donations online. 
Donors for specific animals will receive certificates, gifts and updates on the recipient animals. 
In the case of the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, those interested could donate money to a “Share A Bear” campaign for RM300 (US$69) a year, or opt for the more personalised “My Bear” adoption for RM600 a month or RM7,200 a year. 
“I am also writing everywhere to apply for grants. The only issue is that grants are tricky, there are not many organisations which provide that sort of funding and they are usually for a specific project and time frame,” said Wong.
He and his non-bearkeeping staff have turned to social media to drum up financial support.
“I’m actually busier than before the pandemic,” he said, adding that he was scheduled to give a webinar for a US audience at 3am local time the next day. 
Similarly, the Turtle Conservation Society is also running an “Adopt A Terrapin” campaign, with the adoption fee helping to defray the costs of searching for and incubating the eggs for hatching and release later. 
Bulk of the adoption fee will go to microchipping the turtles, Dr Chen explained. This provides another avenue of scientific research come nesting time and if the locals happened upon a turtle carcass.  
Dr Chen is also working with the local women’s community to produce and market local handicrafts such as terrapin-motif batik, batu seremban (five stones game) painted with turtles, tote bags and others. 
“This doesn’t just raise funds for the project, but also provides them with a way to earn a living during the MCO. Many of the men here earn day wages and are itinerant workers. With the MCO, there’s no work coming in, so it’s a way to help the community as well,” she said. 
With everyone working from home, Dr Chen has had to re-orientate herself from doing fieldwork for the moment to learning new skills and settling down to tackle paperwork concerning TCS.
“I will miss out on taking the turtles’ measurements and all this year, but it’s alright, we’ve already built up a large database from the previous years’ sampling. Luckily this MCO wasn’t imposed during nesting season (usually mid-January to mid-March)” she said. 
Meanwhile, Gibbon Conservation Society's Mariani and her team have not run any adoption campaigns, but instead are highlighting the individual gibbons on social media while soliciting for donations in the same post. 
“We’ve cut down and are stretching everything as much as we can," she said. 
Previously, the team had a permit letter to travel to the Selayang wholesale market to buy supplies for the gibbons. The market has a lot of variety and prices are cheaper. 
Her colleague would drive 90 minutes from Raub to the Klang Valley, decked out in their personal protective equipment (PPE), purchase the fruits and vegetables needed and drive back to Raub again.
As an additional measure, Mariani and her staff also turned to home gardening, and occasionally foraging from the surrounding jungle to supplement their food supply. With the Selayang area now under an enhanced MCO, the centre is also sourcing from local farms. 
While adult gibbons are frugivores, infants rescued from illegal wildlife trade still require milk formula until their digestive systems can handle solid food. 
THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME: CONSERVATIONISTS
While the nationwide MCO has been extended to mid-May, majority of businesses have been allowed to reopen from May 4 onwards under a "conditional MCO". 
However, even if the MCO is lifted one day, things would never be the same, all three conservationists noted.
Dr Chen does not foresee resuming the turtle centre’s eco-tourism activities for a long while. A terrapin gallery that Dr Chen and her colleagues set up at Kampung Pasir Gajah in Kemaman will remain closed. Usually, it is visited by people coming from near and far. 
“Life for the centre post-MCO would still be a very cautious one, and we will focus more on education,” she said. Incubation and release would still go on, but she would start exploring alternative channels for her outreach programmes, such as webinars.
The Gibbon Conservation Society’s set-up has also taken on a regimented outlook, with only one staff member designated for supply runs. She undergoes disinfection after every outing.
“Actually, pre-MCO I was already strict about noise levels and human interaction with the gibbons, including who’s to feed the babies and sanitary procedures, to prevent any human-animal disease transmission. Now we’ve just tightened it to make doubly sure,” Mariani said.
The centre will still continue its pared-down operations and continue stretching every ringgit. "Because who knows how long it will be before we can get funds again,” she said. 
For Wong, tourists numbers back to Sepilok and his Bornean sun bear centre are unlikely to achieve their former numbers for the foreseeable future.
“We’ll probably not have tourists coming back until the world economy improves, and it’s safe to fly again. But everything’s for the bears. If it means having to work harder and stay up later, it’s fine,” he said. 
He also appealed for government help, noting that the his centre was assisting in preserving the country’s wildlife heritage, as the bears legally still fell under the Sabah Wildlife Department’s jurisdiction. At the same time, the centre has long been a favourite destination for tourists in Sandakan.
The drop in funds also has the centre rethinking its previous methods of releasing bears into the wild, where a helicopter was chartered to fly the bear in a transport cage into the middle of Tabin Wildlife Reserve, a 1,225 sq km forest near Lahad Datu.
"We released in the middle of Tabin because it was large and very remote from any human settlement. We will need to think about releasing them in other forests closer to Sepilok, and different modes of transport," Wong said.
More worrying for Wong though was the possibility of the sun bears being poached for their bile, especially after bear bile was promoted as a coronavirus treatment by the Chinese government.
“People who are desperate for a cure might hunt bears for their gall bladders, further contributing to the decline of the wild sun bear population,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: UAE Cardiac patients warned against delay in seeking medical help</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Faced with fears about contracting coronavirus, cardiac patients in the UAE are shying away from seeking medical help, even during emergencies, leading to further complications, doctors have warned.
Speaking to Gulf News, they said patients are seeking medical help as late as four to six days after developing symptoms like chest pain and tightness.
Dr Walid Shaker
“In our most recent case, a 44-year-old patient visited the hospital three days after he had started experiencing chest pain. When we carried out an angiogram, we found that his left main coronary artery had narrowed – a condition that can suddenly become life-threatening,” Dr Walid Shaker, cardiothoracic surgeon at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, said.
“We understand that people prefer to stay at home at a time like this. But it is essential to consult a doctor in case of certain emergencies, especially cardiac ones. Otherwise, they could be risking their lives,” Dr Shaker said.
Dr Brajesh Mittal, interventional cardiologist at Medcare Hospital, Dubai, said 30 to 35 per cent of patients with acute cardiac emergencies have delayed presentation at the hospital, compared to just 10 to 15 per cent before the coronavirus outbreak.
Dr Brajesh Mittal
“Patients are obviously afraid to contract the virus, so they may be hiding symptoms for as long as possible. But it must be remembered that delays in medical intervention can increase complications, including permanent damage to the heart muscles, while also slowing down recovery,” he added.
As Gulf News reported earlier this month, patients have been delaying medical care since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, in an attempt to limit any exposure to the virus.
However, certain emergencies require prompt medical attention, and doctors have to intervene even before patients can be tested for COVID-19.
“In all cases, patients experiencing symptoms like chest pain, tightness and increasing breathing difficulties should at least consult their physicians, especially now that telemedicine options are available,” Dr Shaker said.
When patients present to an emergency department with symptoms, they are first tested for COVID-19. But test results become available only after 48 hours or more, but delaying treatment until then can be dangerous.
“Holding off on treatment until we can confirm if a patient has COVID-19, especially one with acute cardiac symptoms in unstable condition, can prove fatal. So we’ve been undertaking surgeries in full protective gear,” Dr Shaker said.
Over the last month, the surgeon and his team have performed about five surgeries while donning full personal protective equipment, including hazmat suits, N95 masks, as well as surgical gowns for surgeons, assistant surgeons and scrub nurses.
“It is difficult, especially as procedures can last up to six hours, but this is the only way to keep patients and surgical teams safe,” Dr Shaker explained.
According to Dr Mittal, other precautionary measures are also important.
“We minimise the number of medical staff in the cath lab, and only allow cleaning staff to sterilise it after an hour following a procedure,” he said.
The doctor has carried out four emergency cardiac procedures over the last month.
Experts around the world have also observed a 40 per cent reduction in the presentation of cardiac emergencies at healthcare facilities.
“It could be because fewer people are facing myocardial emergencies, perhaps as a result of being largely at home and facing somewhat less stress, or because they are eating healthier. But this trend is not yet fully understood,” Dr Mittal said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Why field hospitals are so important in the battle against COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: As the world watched the coronavirus rage across China two months ago, it also saw the rapid pace at which two hospitals were built.
Within 14 days, the two facilities in Wuhan were set up to provide 2,600 additional hospital beds for those infected with the virus. And when the pictures were revealed, it was clear that these were field hospitals.
Now, as the virus ravages other countries, field hospitals have become a mainstay of coronavirus treatment, with countries ramping up construction and operations to convert existing buildings into fully-fledged hospitals. New York’s first field hospital was set up at the Javits Convention Centre and London converted its massive ExCel London exhibition and convention centre into the NHS Nightingale Hospital.
The UAE has followed suit, opening up its first field hospital at the Dubai World Trade Centre on April 18. Fitted with 300 beds, the facility can be expanded to accommodate 3,000 beds.
Soon after, three other field hospitals were announced, including a 1,000-bed one at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre in the capital, another with 1,200 beds at the Emirates Humanitarian City in Abu Dhabi’s Mohammad Bin Zayed Suburb, and a third with 1,200 beds to be located at the Dubai Parks and Resorts. These will be managed by the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (Seha), Abu Dhabi’s public health provider.
According to Dr Sherbaz Bichu, chief executive officer and specialist anesthetist at Aster Hospitals, the concept of a field hospital is one rooted in the battlefield. This is not surprising, given that much of the current pandemic has been referred to as an ongoing battle against a microscopic enemy.
Dr Sherbaz Bichu
“Field hospitals are common in war zones, where they are set up to a large number of wounded personnel at the same time. In the case of a pandemic, with many people getting people at the same time, they are just as useful,” Dr Bichu explained.
With dozens of beds placed adjacent to one another, these facilities allow for cohort care, where a dedicated team of healthcare professionals care for patients infected with a single infectious agent.
“Cohort nursing is the most obvious advantage of designated field hospitals to treat COVID-19. In such a setting, one nurse can tend to up to a 10-12 patients, instead of just 4-5 at a time. This decreases staffing needs, and as a result, less personal protective equipment is required,” Dr Bichu said.
Because personal protective equipment like masks, gloves and surgical gowns have become valuable commodities in the fight against COVID-19, this is an important benefit.
In addition, all operations are centrally controlled, allowing for quicker decision making as treatment protocols change for a disease that is still being explored and understood, Dr Bichu said.
And, given that many expats in the UAE live in shared housing, the large number of beds at field hospitals allows infected patients recover in in quarantine, away from uninfected roommates and flatmates.
However, field hospitals do have certain disadvantages. For example, privacy can be limited, given that beds are placed in close proximity to one another. Patients also have to share bathrooms, while staff are usually allocated separate bathrooms.
Unlike mainline hospitals, field hospitals have limited surgical intervention capacity.
And because people treated at these field hospitals carry a contagious virus, patients have to be isolated from family members and friends, who cannot visit the facility.
Facilities in the UAE have however overcome many of these challenges.
The Dubai World Trade Centre hospital, which has 300 beds and can be expanded to accommodate 3,000 beds, quickly facilitates hospital transfers for patients in critical condition.
Meanwhile, the 1000-bed ADNEC hospital has curtains installed for privacy between beds at the 1,000-bed ADNEC hospital. In this way, each patient has a pseudo-cubicle to himself.
And going beyond basic amenities, it also offers free high-speed Internet, personal iPads for each patient, as well as access to gym facilities and shared televisions.
“There are 48 urgent care beds with oxygen supply to stabilise critical cases and a plan is in place to transfer critical cases to hospitals in a timely manner,” said Dr Anwar Sallam, group chief medical officer at Seha.
Each bathroom is shared by seven patients, and that the beds are placed in single cubicles.
Dr Anwar Sallam
“This facility has been designated only for male patients, whereas female patients and families will be treated at the Emirates Humanitarian City,” he said. Presumably, this has been done in response to cultural privacy preferences in the UAE.
Abu Dhabi’s field hospitals are designed to manage and treat mild to moderate cases, whereas patients with severe infection, the elderly and children are being treated at mainline facilities.
As announced, each of Seha’s field hospitals will be manned by 150 to 200 medical professionals.
Till date, the number of coronavirus cases in the UAE has exceeded 10,000. It is however hoped that a fully active and advanced healthcare sector, bolstered by multiple field hospitals, will help the vast majority of COVID-19 patients to safely recover from the disease.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UAE stem cell therapy: Revolutionary treatment helps cure COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI: Adult stem cell therapy is dubbed as the new healing force of the 21st century, much as the internet revolutionised the past century.
Now, UAE researchers have demonstrated they're in the leading edge of this breakthrough in medicine. Abu Dhabi-based doctors have announced pioneering work in stem cell therapy to repair lung damage caused by coronavirus infection. One simple yet fascinating aspect of this new therapy: it's administered through inhalation.
It's a potential "wow" moment for immunotherapy and regenerative medicine — the Abu Dhabi team sucessfully treated 73 COVID-19 patients, who were cured of COVID-19 before hospital discharge.
Numerous vaccine trials are undeway for COVID-19, but a safe and effective jab that can be used on a massive scale on healthy patients is at least a year away.
Speaking at a press conference on coronavirus updates on Saturday night, Dr. Fatima Al Kaabi, Head Hematology and ncology Department at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi, explained the results of the stem cell therapy.
“At the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center, we are proud to work on developing a supportive treatment for COVID-19 patients which is undergoing clinical trials for the first time in the UAE. This is a national achievement,” Dr. Fatima Al Kaabi, who is part of the stem cell research team against COVID-19.
The announced treatment is supportive and not curative, she explained, and helps alleviate COVID-19 symptoms rather than eradicating the virus itself.
Treatment was administered on 73 confirmed positive COVID-19 patients, and was considered a success, after they were cured of the virus by inhaling the treatment into their lungs after it has been "nebulised into a fine mist".
The pioneering treatment is hypothesised to have its therapeutic effect by regenerating lung cells and modulating the immune response to keep it from overreacting to the COVID-19 infection and causing further damage to healthy cells.
COVID-19 patients in the UAE who have all been successfully treated -- and cured -- of the virus by inhaling the treatment into their lungs after it has been nebulised into a fine mist.
The treatment was developed by a team of doctors and researchers at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center (ADSCC).
A patent has been granted by the UAE Ministry of Economy for the development of an innovative and promising treatment for COVID-19 infections using stem cells.
It involves extracting stem cells from the patient’s own blood and reintroducing them after "activating" them.
The treatment has successfully undergone the initial phase of clinical trials, demonstrating its safety.
IMMUNOTHERAPY: WHAT IS IT?"THERAPY": Treatment intended to relieve or heal a disorder (from Latin therapia and Greek therapeia, meaning "curing, healing, service done to the sick).IMMUNOTHERAPY OR BIOLOGICAL THERAPY: The treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system. Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as "activation immunotherapies". immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as "suppression immunotherapies".
None of the patients who had received the treatment reported adverse effects, according to the Abu Dhabi research team.
More importantly, there have been no interactions found with the conventional treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients.
ROLE OF STEM CELLS IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINERegenerative medicine aims at repair, replacement of cells or organs to recover the impaired function. It helps the body to form new functional tissue. It includes cell therapies, tissue engineering, gene therapy and biomedical engineering techniques.So, cell therapy and tissue engineering are parts of the field of regenerative medicine, whose aim is production of safe and effective therapies. Stem cells present in almost every type of tissues and represent an endogenous system of regeneration and repair. Therefore, stem cells represent great hope for the future of translational medicine.[International Journal of Stem Cells: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4961101/]
A stem cell is a cell with the unique ability to develop into specialised cell types in the body. It's the basic building block of life.
In the future, they may be used to replace cells and tissues that have been damaged or lost due to disease.
They can become cells of the blood, heart, lungs or other body parts. Stem cells also have a strong secretory function, promoting the formation of new blood vessels, cell proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting inflammatory response, experts say.
TWO MAIN CATEGORIES OF STEM CELLSIn humans, stem cells can be subdivided into two main categories: intrinsic and extrinsic stem cells.A large variety of cell types has been used for regenerative medicine, including adult cells, resident tissue specific stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, Umbilical cord blood stem cells, embryonic stem cells and the recent breakthrough discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells from mature/adult cells (iPS) (called reprogramming, induced a pluripotent state in a previously differentiated cell type). [Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376801]
Stem cells can self-renew or multiply while maintaining the potential to develop into other types of cells.
For example, right now, your body's stem cells are working hard replacing your skin every two weeks, creating new red and white blood cells.
Yes. At least two studies had demonstrated this.
First, in 2016, a team of Egyptian experts showed that stem cells help in lung regeneration, according to a study published in the International Journal of Stem Cells.
The airway epithelium is exposed to inhaled particles and pathogens that may lead to the development of a many infectious and inflammatory respiratory diseases. The study investigated promising stem cell therapy to treat lung and tracheal tissue damage.
The second recent study we found, published on Nature Communications on February 28, 2020, shows that an inhalation treatment of secretome and exosome exhibited therapeutic potential for lung regeneration.
These were based on two experimental models of pulmonary fibrosis (lung disease in which persistent injury results in scar tissue formation — as fibrosis thickens, the lung tissue loses the ability to facilitate gas exchange and provide cells with needed oxygen).
SARS-CoV-2 is a newly-discovered pathogen that primarily attacks the lungs (and airway epithelium). This leads to the development of an infectious and inflammatory respiratory disease, called COVID-19, partly as a result of the over-reaction of the human immune system which then leads to acute pneumonia — and can be deadly. 
SECRETOME AND EXOSOMEExosome: They are cell-derived vesicles encompassing lipids, DNA, proteins coding genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). They are present in diverse body fluids. They offer novel biomarker and drug therapy potential for diverse diseases, including cancer.Secretome: The stem cell secretome produce tiny “communication vesicles” (paracrine soluble factors) that interact with surrounding (stem) cells. Healthy Mesenchymal Stem Cells do this intensively with signals that have almost exclusively “positive” effects on surrounding cells and hence change not only the local tissue environment but also the whole immune system. The properties of the secreted factors are anti-inflammatory, neuro- and angio-trophic, immune modulatory, anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective and anti-oxidatory.[Sources: https://bit.ly/2YnEBqp; https://bit.ly/2WnyfEI]
In March, Chinese researchers announced they were studying the use of stem cell technology in the treatment of people critically ill with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Xinhuanet reported then.
Four COVID-19 patients who received stem cell treatment while in a serious condition have been reportedly discharged from hospital following recovery. The Chinese researchers said they will expand the clinical trial of the therapy.
Yes. Stem cell therapy has been used in the treatment of some infectious diseases and complications. For instance, it has been tried in treating H7N9 avian flu and showed good results.
According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new stem cell drug, CAStem, which has shown promising results in animal experiments.
The research team has applied for urgent assessment by the National Medical Products Administration. Approvals by the ethics committee, and clinical observation and evaluation are in progress.
More trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment are ongoing and are expected to be completed "in a couple of weeks".
The treatment has been given to patients along with the conventional medical intervention and will continue to be applied as an adjunct to established treatment protocols rather than as a replacement.
A UAE patent was granted for the innovative method in which the stem cells are collected, or "harvested".
The innovation represents a pay-off from numerous scientific research work being conducted in the UAE and laws enacted to attract talent from different parts of the world. It also promises to potentially turn the tide in the global effort to fight SARS-CoV-2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19 UAE: Stem cell treatment is supportive, not curative</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: The innovative and promising treatment for COVID-19 infections using stem cells is supportive not curative, it helps patients to defeat the COVID-19 symptoms rather than eradicating the virus itself, a top health official has revealed on Saturday.
While speaking during the UAE Government regular media briefing , Dr. Fatima Al Kaabi, Head of Hematology and Oncology Department at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, and research assistant of the Stem Cell Project, said: “At the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center, we are proud to work on developing a supportive treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is undergoing clinical trials for the first time in the UAE, this is a national achievement”.
Dr. Fatima added: “We have successfully passed the initial phase of clinical trials - with 73 patients making full recoveries without any adverse side effects. The recipients were moderately or severely ill before treatment, with 25 per cent of them were at ICUs”.
“We are finalizing data collection to establish the effectiveness of this treatment, comparing a control group with the same characteristics of the patients that received the treatment. Next steps involve evaluating its effectiveness and application to a wider group”.
She further said: “A total of 28 researchers at Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center worked on isolating an early-developed stem cell that maintains regenerative qualities. The procedure is less invasive, only requiring drawing blood from patients, and administration is done via jet nebulization method”.
“After we collect blood and separate cells, we put them through a biochemical process whereby the patient’s own platelets growth factor is used to activate the cells. We believe they are able to regenerate damaged cells, help in repairing pulmonary damage,” Al Kaabi noted.
Dr. Fatima also said: “Stem cells are a special type of cells found throughout the human body. They have multiple characteristics including the ability to transform into other types of cells and reproduce indefinitely to create more of the same cells. The idea behind using stem cells in treatments is to harness their unique characteristics to regenerate cells that do not regenerate on their own”.
She highlighted that stem cells have been used as supportive therapies in many cases, including leukemia and immunodeficiency disorders for more than 30 years.
Also speaking during the briefing was Prof. Alawi Al Sheikh-Ali, Emirates Scientists Council‘s spokesperson.
“The scientific community of the UAE continues to focus on the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). Several research groups across UAE universities are conducting extensive studies to reach a deeper understanding of the virus” Prof. Alawi said.
He added: “A group of researchers from the University of Sharjah and Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences worked on a study to understand why older adults and patients with comorbidities get severe COVID19 symptoms than younger populations”.
Emirates Scientists Council‘s spokesperson noted that the study has found that children have less of specific receptors called (ACE2) in their nasal and lung tissue compared to adults, which make the virus entry possible. Also, the study has found that these receptors are increased in smokers, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthmatic patients, and patients with pulmonary hypertension.
Another study with collaborative team including Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Sharjah and Al Jalila Children’s Specialty Hospital is examining the relationship between obesity and COVID-19, he underlined.
The findings of the studies contribute to our understanding of why older adults and people with comorbidities may be at a higher risk of infection and develop severe COVID19 symptoms. They also confirm the need to adhere to the precautionary measures set by the UAE Government, he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Who knows where the time goes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Absent any other marker, nature indicates the passage of time. Daffodils and hyacinths give way to roses. Blossoms fall; new leaves bud; pink petals are gone from empty New York streets. Frozen figures in rumpled clothes may note some slight change in the canvas. Who knows where the time goes?
We met in the warm season. We met in the cold season. It becomes possible to imagine time reordered in such a way. Oh, yes, in the warm season, I remember the peonies. A friend tells me her marker of time’s passage in Paris has become the advancing decomposition of a dead rat in the bike lane on her circumscribed daily outing. Who knows where the time goes?
We are all in a box. A smaller or larger Zoom box, depending on the number of people in the conversation. A sidewalk box that sets appropriate social distancing. The box behind the new plastic panels in stores, the box of four too-familiar walls, a mental box of insistent yet unanswerable questions — and in those boxes we are all grieving.
Grieving for a loved one lost to the coronavirus, for lost cities, for lost worlds, for America lost. The virus has revealed a nation in decomposition, incapable of coherence, un-led, angry, disoriented, scattered.
The pathogen itself becomes a political Rorschach test, perceived according to tribal allegiance. The vice-president refuses to wear a mask on a visit to the Mayo Clinic, a wink to one of those tribes. Why the heck did the hospital break its own rules and let him in?
Who would have thought it is possible to become nostalgic for alternate-side New York parking, that implacable marker of the days? Anything is possible; the proof is before our eyes.
Grieving is not missing. We miss conviviality. We grieve for life. For loves lost and retraced, for the precious moment unappreciated. Perhaps at root we grieve for the failure of our imaginations.
That is to say for our inability to grasp what W.G. Sebald, the German writer, called “the ghosts of repetition,” the ever-recurring patterns of dislocation and disaster that punctuate human history until they impose themselves on the present.
A middle-aged woman sits on the steps of a synagogue sobbing. A young woman props her bike against a fence and sobs. It seems indelicate to intrude on such grief. The loss of time itself can engender a terrible emptiness. I see the clock without hands, and the face without features, in the deserted streets of the shattering nightmare sequence in Ingmar Bergman’s “Wild Strawberries.” Who knows where the time goes?
Speaking of dreams, here is another one. A friend finds herself in a cumbersome crude contraption that looks like a beekeeper’s bonnet but is made of sheets of clear plastic screwed together with wood framing. She cannot figure out why it is there, until she learns that banks now require clients to box their faces in this way to get money from an ATM. Perhaps, in intimate circles, the box-bonnet bump will replace the elbow bump.
In our boxes, the great health-versus-wealth debate rages. How, when and where to restart the economy, the appropriateness of this or that trade-off. As if the great trade-offs that produced this dysfunctional America had not already happened.
The trade-offs that disempowered the body politic and democratic practice, and empowered special interests and the wealthy; that starved a health system that might have helped people survive better; that conferred sanctity on soaring executive compensation but not on a decent living wage for the mass of Americans; and on and on and on.
The pandemic is also an urgent call for national and personal reinvention and rebalancing. After the Black Death came the Renaissance. From the depths of economic horror came Roosevelt’s New Deal. From this horror, so far, come the senseless twists and turns of the orange Narcissus.
Bandits hold sway. I have visions of Howard Beale in “Network,” and his that brought screaming Americans to their windows.
“All of humanity’s problems,” said Blaise Pascal, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” We are learning. Seeing frenetic consumption for what it was, shuddering at the frantic quest for distraction and status in the time before.
I have been listening to “Who Knows Where the Time Goes?” Fairport Convention, 1969, wonderful song, transporting. Turned time’s arrow backward for me, listening to Pink Floyd in Hyde Park in 1968. An ache, we all feel it now.
A cemetery may seem an unlikely source of solace, but Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, ranging over 478 acres, is a beautiful sanctuary. At the main entrance, a large colony of blue-green parrots has established itself. Urban legend has it the birds escaped from a transport at JFK. I watched them for a while swooping in mesmeric patterns with twigs in their mouths to add to a multistoried nest that appears to need no additions whatsoever. The parrots get on with their DIY anyway.
Stir, breathe, look around, do something. Who knows where the time goes? The birds know.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will COVID-19 kill the human in us?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You know that something is wrong when your doorbell starts ringing at 2am. You know it is very bad when the person outside starts pounding at it with his/her hand.
A light sleeper, I am always half-awake, so when this happened, I rushed to the door, barefoot and shirtless, only to open it to a lady who in desperation muttered: "Please, help my son." I followed her.
A man around my age was lying on a sofa, close to their main door, struggling to breathe, irresponsive. I panicked a bit; I told myself: "He is infected, he has it."
I admit I was afraid and seconds later ashamed that I left my neighbour in her home, waiting for a few seconds while her son struggled for his life. It had gotten to me, "coronaphobia".
I rushed back home, grabbed gloves, a face mask, sandals, and a T-shirt, then woke up my adult son and told him to help me.
It may have taken less than 30 seconds to do that, yet I felt guilty; I believe I did the right thing, but I left a person who needed me in fear, in uncertainty.
I sent my son to the security guard, to call an ambulance, which he did as I remained there, helping move the suffering man. His mum was unable to tell me what was wrong with him, I am sure fear was increasing the language barrier. I thought of everything - heart attack? intoxication? stroke? nothing seemed to fit the symptoms.
He was just there, fighting to breathe, and I could not do anything and afraid I would bring the virus, COVID-19, home. Then I felt guilty for being irresponsible, I was doing everything against what guidenlines on social media had been advising.
"I am not a medic, I have no equipment or means to handle the COVID, I should leave it to the qualified people, I should avoid contact, Am I really thinking on mouth-to-mouth respiration?, I should not be here, I should not be risking my family." The thoughts came fast, tumbling over each other.
But, how can one leave another human to their luck at a time like this? I don't know how, because I could not; at the same time, my mind was wandering. "Who else is here to help right now? At least they won't be alone, we are with them - I know CPR, he will be fine, I will be fine, I can do this, I will isolate myself after."
My neighbour had recovered by the time the paramedics arrived - he was suffering something totally unrelated to any respiratory disease, he was not even taken to the hospital, but to his private doctor.
It was a relief - I know the mother will see her son in the morning, eat a happy favorite breakfast and perhaps make some jokes about the night before. It was a relief too to know I didn't put myself or my family at risk.
I've been in a quite a few emergencies through my life, as a Mexican journalist in the north of Mexico, I've been through accidents, narcos pointing a gun centimeters away from my face, attacks on our newspaper office, and I managed to remain calm.
I was the one that first jumps to help back in the day, so what changed? is it that the pandemic has made social distancing such that we fear to help, fear touching others even in an emergency?
Certainly, fear is there now, but that seems not to be enough to deter us from being kind to each other.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Khalifa University researchers studying virus load from Abu Dhabi wastewater</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Estimating the spread of the novel coronavirus in any population has so far proved a challenge, given that many individuals who contract the virus remain asymptomatic or untested.
To get a better understanding of the spread of the virus, researchers at the Khalifa University of Science and Technology have launched a project to estimate the level of the virus in municipal wastewater.
A statement by the university today (May 3) said the project will help surveil the viral load in municipal wastewater as a method for early detection, and for tracking the spread of the coronavirus in the general population.
Studies have so far indicated that people infected with the coronavirus, including asymptomatic individuals, shed the virus through human waste.
“Since the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater should mirror the number of detected infections in the population, testing a municipal wastewater sample will be tantamount to essentially testing everyone who has contributed to that sample - in other words a way of mass testing,” the university’s statement said.
Through this research, Khalifa University aims to establish a surveillance system for COVID-19 in municipal wastewater streams, linking it with simulation models developed for predicting and controlling the spread of the pandemic, together with the health authorities,” said Dr Arif Sultan Al Hammadi, executive vice-president at the University.
The project is led by Dr Ahmed Yousef, assistant professor for Chemistry, Dr Shadi Hasan, associate professor for Chemical Engineering, and Dr Habiba Alsafar, acting associate dean for student affairs at the University’s College of Medicine and Health Sciences. Dr Alsafar is also the associate professor at the Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, and director of the Center for Biotechnology.
Once further studies assess the levels of coronavirus found in COVID-19 patient fecal samples, scientists will be able to construct a model that estimates the total number of symptomatic and asymptomatic people in the population based on wastewater levels.
Similar studies to estimate coronavirus load in wastewater are also being undertaken around the world, and results have already been published by authorities in Netherlands and Paris. However, these papers have not yet been vetted and approved by the wider scientific community as a viable method for estimating the spread of the virus in the general populatioon.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Residents experiencing coronavirus symptoms can now get tested for free at all healthcare facilities in Abu Dhabi emirate, the Department of Health (DoH) announced today (May 3).
In addition, free tests are available at all facilities, for the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic diseases.
Today’s announcement means that COVID-19 tests are now being conducted at public and private hospitals and clinics, in addition to those at drive-through screening centres run by Abu Dhabi’s public health provide, the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (Seha).
Other residents who wish to confirm they are virus-free must pay Dh370 to get tested, the DoH said in a statement.
“Testing is one of the key steps to curbing the spread of the virus and one of the most influential preventative measures to maintain the health and wellbeing of the community. This has pushed all [public and private facilities] to come together [and] further expand the scale of coronavirus screening services, thus ensuring its availability and easy access to all members of the community,” the statement added.

As per Sheikh Mohammed’s directives, a series of intensive federal and local government meetings featuring ministers, undersecretaries, executive councils and global experts will be held regularly to shape the UAE’s post-COVID-19 strategy.
He called for developing detailed policies in the short and long term to ensure the recovery of economic activity as well as growth and stability across economic and community sectors in the country.
Sheikh Mohammed stressed the importance of engaging brilliant local, Arab and international minds and experts to participate in intellectual and analytical seminars, whose outputs constitute theoretical and practical frameworks for policy-making and setting visions to build new foundations and action mechanisms in all sectors.
The new plans and policies should take into account vital sectors that are key to development and community mobility, primarily health, education, technology and food security.
Sheikh Mohammed underlined that people’s safety, security, well-being and mental health must be at the heart of such policies and plans, and in parallel with state’s foreign policies in coordination with the international community to ensure a global economic and geopolitical cooperation to best address, contain and reduce the consequences of health and environmental disasters.
Sheikh Mohammed also ordered the setting up of a working group to study the dossier of the national medical and pharmaceutical industries in the UAE to develop investment opportunities for the medical industry sector and enhance production capacity.
The team, chaired by the Ministry of Energy and Industry, will roll out an emergency plan to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the medical industries sector as part of preparation for the post-COVID-19 era in the country.
Other teams have been set up to work swiftly in response to daily and rapid changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Our national priorities need to reviewed to cope with the post-COVID-19 world…Our financial and human resources need to be redirected to strengthen our medical, food and economic security through new programmes and projects… Preparing for the post-COVID-19 is preparing for a new future that no one predicted a few months ago,” Sheikh Mohammed said.
During the remote meeting, the Cabinet approved a draft law amending some provisions of the Federal Law on Commercial Companies aiming at strengthening and raising UAE’s rankings on global competitiveness indicators.
The amendment also aims to create an attractive business environment supporting the national economy. The draft law targets companies and foreign investors representing international companies and investment funds.
The Cabinet also approved a federal law regulating the union of landlords to enhance the sustainability of infrastructure and increase community engagement in preserving sustainability of infrastructure within housing projects and residential communities to preserve and ensure sustainability of common properties in communities.
The organisational structure of the Ministry of Justice was approved during the virtual Cabinet meeting, within the framework of upgrading the work system at the ministry in all its sectors, strengthening legislation and the rule of law and upgrading the services provided to customers, which reflects positively on the indicator of competitiveness in the advancement of the UAE’s position at the international level.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: The Higher Sharia Authority (HSA) for financial and banking activities in the UAE held its second meeting of 2020 on April 26.
The meeting was chaired by Sheikh Dr. Ahmed Bin Abdulaziz Al Haddad, the Chairman of the HSA, and attended by members including Sheikh Prof. Dr. Jassim Ali Al Shamsi, Sheikh Issam Muhamad Ishaq, Sheikh Dr. Aznan Hasan, and Sheikh Dr. Usaid Muhammad Adeeb Al Kilani.
The HSA adopted its report for the year 2019, which maps the most significant achievements, initiatives and resolutions conducted during the year.
The authority also discussed COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy and approved a set of Sharia parameters to mitigate the affect on individuals and companies.
It also urged Islamic financial institutions to join their efforts in supporting sectors and individuals affected by the pandemic.
The HSA also issued Sharia parameters related to the postponement of installments for Islamic financial institutions’ customers and how to deal with such postponement from a Sharia perspective, based on the type of transaction and Sharia contracts.
Moreover, the HSA reviewed its agenda and adopted some Sharia standards and parameters for calculating the collections costs incurred by Islamic financial institutions from late payment transactions.
The HSA also discussed issues related to the imposition of fees on loan-based transactions. The Islamic Banking Committee of the UAE Banks Federation will be consulted to identify best practices in this regard.
The HSA also reviewed requests for new financial products submitted by some Islamic financial institutions, and approved the applications that comply with the applicable Sharia standards. The HSA stressed the need to strike a balance between development and innovation in Islamic financial products and the regulatory and Sharia requirements.
Furthermore, HSA reviewed the requests submitted by Islamic financial institutions regarding the approval of annual Sharia reports, the appointment of members of the Internal Sharia Supervision Committees, and the heads of the Internal Sharia Control and Sharia Audit Departments, and issued resolutions in this regard.
To further improve the role of Internal Sharia Supervision Committees in Islamic financial institutions, the HSA was instructed to prepare a charter template for the Internal Sharia Supervision Committees based on best practices and to initiate a consultation about it with Islamic financial institutions.
The HSA completed the discussion of the remaining topics listed on the agenda and undertook the necessary action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PhD candidate at QF homegrown university talks about air pollution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doha: Air pollution is harmful — we know that — but it becomes deadly in a global pandemic of a disease that attacks the lungs. With water quality taking precedence, it may seem that the quality of air we breathe is taken for granted. Polluted air has killed millions around the world, and a large number of deaths caused by COVID-19 have been linked to pre-existing health conditions similar to diseases caused by air pollution, according to Hanadi Al Thani. 
Studies have shown that over the past few years, air quality in Qatar, especially in its major urban centres, has been deteriorating due to rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and increasing traffic. Qatar is also known to have a dusty climate, and Al Thani’s research is in close relation to the impact this has on human health and environment. 
“For example, we have found out that 60 percent of this dust comes from natural resources while the rest comes from human activities such as transportation and construction. While the natural sources of dust might not impose critical health impacts, it still stimulates allergic reactions, such as asthma, in a large number of children and adults.
“Hence, we have recommended several sustainable policies and solutions for air pollution problems in urban areas, including planting certain types of trees that have proven efficiency to enhance air quality such as Samar and Sidra trees. These findings can be relevant to other countries in desert regions as well,” Al Thani, a Ph.D. candidate at Qatar Foundation’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University’s Environmental Sustainability programme, said. 
With the current pandemic forcing everyone to stay indoors, air quality in various parts of the world has improved. Satellite images of China, for example, showed a dramatic reduction in air pollution. And research has shown a drastic “decline in NO2 concentrations compared to early January when power plants were operating at normal levels in industrial locations,” said Al Thani. 
In Qatar, traffic has reduced by a large measure due to online work practices and the closure of malls and recreation areas, and “this would have significant impact on air quality – reducing harmful emissions much below the normal levels. Hence, it is expected that fewer asthma and emergency entries, due to respiratory diseases related to dust, would be admitted to hospitals,” Al Thani said.  But the question remains – if air quality has improved amid the current lockdown, are there lessons to be learned for future actions and policies? 
“Indeed, this is a very important point to highlight. Although the current situation has improved the air quality in Qatar and other parts around the world, we have learned many lessons from COVID-19,” said Al Thani.  The first lesson is that work and learning can be successfully accomplished online, she says. Also, that people should maintain hygiene and implement safe distancing while shopping for necessary items. Al Thani suggests that although the long-term impact is unpredictable, especially if life goes back to normal once the crisis ends, it is the responsibility of governments to implement strict measures on the use of transportation and other emission polluting practices where a balance is achieved between productivity and acceptable air quality.
As someone who is at the forefront of research that is designed to help build a more sustainable Qatar, and as a mother of four and a researcher, Al Thani’s vision of herself was to contribute to building a sustainable environment in Qatar. “It was something I have always aspired to do and it’s only the beginning for me as my research will expand,” she says. But surely her contribution comes with a tough ask – of balancing her work life and her personal life. 
“There is no perfect formula to balance being a mother and having so many commitments. If I did, I would solve a lot of mothers’ problems. Sometimes I wish there were 30 hours instead of 24 in a day, but I work with what I have. 
“Compromise is my solution, and it is something I learned to do quite well. I may not be doing activities with my kids every afternoon, but I will make sure to make it up to them during the weekends.
“The love for STEM fields is growing nowadays with all the exciting new breakthroughs and I would love my children to explore them. And there is no better way of encouraging them than to do it myself first.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blood pressure patients are more susceptible to complications from COVID-19, says HMC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doha: Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) has warned that patients with high blood pressure may be at greater risk of developing severe complications if they are infected with coronavirus (COVID-19), therefore they must take more preventive measures to prevent this infection.
Dr Mawahib Ali El Hassan, Acting Director of the Coronary Intensive Care Unit (CICU) at HMC's Heart Hospital said patients who have high blood pressure may be more susceptible to complications from COVID-19 and should take extra precautions to avoid contracting the virus.
"We don't yet fully understand why people with poor cardiovascular health and high blood pressure seem to be at higher risk for more severe illness from this virus, but what we do know is that COVID-19 puts a strain on the lungs and this also burdens the heart. For this reason, it is extra important that anyone who has poor cardiovascular health takes extra precautions," said Dr El Hassan.
"COVID-19 is a new coronavirus so we are still learning about its pathology, including how it attacks the body. Available data from China, where the virus originated, seems to indicate that individuals with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are among those who experienced worse outcomes. We strongly encourage people with these conditions to exercise a greater degree of prevention and protection," said Dr. El Hassan.
Dr. El Hassan explains that high blood pressure means the heart must work harder to pump blood around the body. She says high blood pressure causes the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart to lose their elasticity and narrow, which places individuals with the condition at an increased risk for a heart attack. She says patients with high blood pressure should not panic but they should ensure they follow their doctor's instructions and take extra precautions to prevent contracting the virus.
"It's normal for people to feel concerned, especially if they have a preexisting medical condition. My advice for any patients with high blood pressure is to follow prevention guidelines around personal hygiene and social distancing, which includes avoiding places where they might encounter crowds, like busy grocery stores. They should also continue to follow whatever direction they've been given by their doctor, including taking any prescribed medications. It is also really important for people to ensure they are getting information about COVID-19 from reliable sources, like the Ministry of Public Health and the World Health Organization (WHO)," says Dr. El Hassan.
Dr. El Hassan says defensive steps everyone can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include avoiding people who are sick, thoroughly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with unclean hands, and frequently cleaning surfaces touched often, like doorknobs, handles, steering wheels, and light switches.
The Ministry of Public Health has established a dedicated website (www.moph.gov.qa) to provide the public with updates on the current situation as well as information on how to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. A hotline (16000), which is available 24-hours a day to answer COVID-19 related queries, and an educational social media campaign have also been launched, with the MoPH, HMC, and Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) sharing infographics and videos through their social media channels.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Qatar eyes new medicine showing positive results in COVID-19 treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Qatar is eyeing to bring a new medicine which has shown potentially effective results in the treatment of COVID-19 patients during trials, said a health official.
“Recently some results of the experiments which were conducted by the US on using a new medicine called ‘Remdesivir’ for coronavirus patients were found effective somehow,” said Dr. Abdul Latif Al Khal, Head of the Infectious Diseases Division at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) while speaking to Qatar TV yesterday.
He said that the new medicine which is administered through veins of critical cases of coronavirus showed help in alleviating the symptoms of disease in the patients in 11 days instead of 15 days and the mortality rate also reduced from 11 percent to 8 percent.
“We are awaiting more results and details of the experiments on the new medicine and also awaiting when this medicine is made available to buy and provide to the patients in Qatar,” said Dr. Al Khal. He said that there are a number of medicines which are being used for the treatment of coronavirus patients and the medicine is being given when needed.
“However, cases that do not show the symptoms or carrying very mild symptoms are not given medicines of coronavirus,” said Dr. Al Khal. He said that the patients suffering from coronavirus severely with symptoms like high temperatures and breathing problems are being given medicines like hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and others which help in treatment and recovery.
Dr. Al Khal called upon people to not come out from homes at the time when the positive cases are on spike except in the cases of utmost need. He said that people should wear face masks while going out and interacting with others. “They are also needed to keep sanitising their hands and keep safe distance, at least two meters, especially when they are in public places like shopping complexes,” he added.
He said that Qatar is tracing and screening all cases which came in the contacts of the confirmed positive cases of coronavirus. 
“The Ministry of Public Health dispatches immediately a medical team to the accommodations and work places of infected people to screen all those came in their contacts,” said Dr. Al Khal.
He said that sometime thousands of people of contacts were screened in a day which led to detect more cases that did not show any symptoms of coronavirus but if they were left without screening, they might cause spreading virus largely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">QF webinar urges individuals to reduce food wastage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Qatar Green Building Council  (QGBC) of Qatar Foundation (QF) has hosted a webinar to discuss easy methods that can be incorporated into daily lifestyles to reduce food wastage, in the present pandemic situation.  
Experts discussed methods of responsible shopping and how governments make policies to reduce food wastage. 
The webinar featured Nodoka Nakamichi, Co-Founder/Marketing and PR Manager, QUBE; Kim Wyatt, TV Presenter and Food Writer & Co-Director; and Aisha Al Maadeed, Founder, Greener Future at the webinar. The discussion was led by Ruba Hinnawi, Technical Coordinator QGBC.
Food wastage accounts for around 7-10 percent of global greenhouse gases, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. And, in Qatar alone, nearly 60 percent of the total domestic waste is organic, and comes from within the home. 
In the backdrop of this situation, when COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic — and nations began locking down — stockpiling goods became a worldwide issue, and in turn many perishables were wasted. 
Nakamichi said that the freezer can be our best friend. “If you can see that things are going to go off, put it in your freezer. I think people will be surprised with the amount of things you can actually freeze for later consumption.” 
Wyatt also spoke in the same lines and said that people should utilize their freezer – it’s as it is  great way of reducing food wastage.  
“And saving money, too. The other plus on reducing food wastage and storing it well is that you will save money, reducing your food bill and reducing the amount of times you need to go to the supermarket,” she added. 
Another key topic within the discussion was about holy month of Ramadan, which started last week, and how, because of COVID-19, the world is experiencing a new side of the holy month, including smaller tables and no gatherings. 
“Statistically, Ramadan is one of the peak times of the year for excess food wastage, and I think that’s certainly a cultural part of society, because food is love. And like any celebration, we want to share with our guests; we want to show our appreciation and our love. And it’s prevalent throughout different cultures around the world, be it birthdays, weddings, or other occasions,” said Wyatt. 
While AlMaadeed suggested solutions such as portion control and asking family members what they would like for Iftar ahead of preparing meals. 
The panelists also addressed how to choose produce at supermarkets highlighted the importance of seasonal buying.  “Things that are in season have the least carbon footprint because there is less storage. Buy local produce. Qatar is doing a great job at growing vegetables locally — they’re expanding every week, growing so many different varieties. I think the most important thing we can do is support the local market,” said Nakamichi.  
Panelists also called for new government policies and legislation by citing South Korea, which has reduced the nation’s food wastage immensely. But the panellists agreed that reducing food wastage is about individuals taking small, sustainable steps.

Dogs in Corsica are being trained by the emergency services to try to detect people who may be infected with coronavirus.
Firefighters in Ajaccio are doing this by using sweat samples from COVID-19 patients who've agreed to be part of the trial.
Corporal Mar Anto Costa, a firefighter based in Ajaccio, said: "Dogs are known for their capacity to recognise other diseases including cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers and even diabetes, although it has not been officially proven.
"What remains to be proven is whether the COVID-19 molecule emits a particular odour."
The samples are placed in particular places to see if the dogs can then detect them.
Brice Leva, another Coriscan firefighter, said:
"It's simply a plastic tube by which the smell is placed, leaving the smell-emitting molecules. And then, with these plastic tubes, we train the dogs."
If this test is successful and the results are confirmed, it would allow rapid and massive screening of the population.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hitting the Books: Without glass, we'd have never discovered the electron</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From the dawn on time, humans have manipulated the material world around us to suit our will. We started off banging rocks together before moving on to wielding bronze and then iron tools. We parlayed iron into steel and built an industrialized existence before entering the modern silicon era. But there is one ancient technology without which today’s world would not exist: glass. Because without glass, we’d likely never have uncovered the true nature of cathode rays. CRT televisions and monitors would not have been devised, nor would the subsequent smartphone screen you’re reading this text on.
In her latest book, The Alchemy of Us - How Humans and Matter Transformed One Another, Pulitzer-prize winning author Ainissa Ramirez takes readers on a fascinating journey through the stories of eight inventions — from clocks and copper wiring to light bulbs and hard drives — that have fundamentally altered (both intentionally and unintentionally) the ways in which we live our lives. In the excerpt below, Ramirez examines the efforts of an absent-minded 19th century British scientist along with the labware that allowed him to uncover the existence of electrons and usher in the modern era.
Excerpted from The Alchemy of Us - How Humans and Matter Transformed One Another by Ainissa Ramirez. Reprinted with permission from The MIT PRESS. Copyright 2020.
Long before the Great War, in 1895, science and magic were hard to separate. That year, Wilhelm Roentgen took a ghostly picture of his wife’s hand using mysterious rays that showed her bones. These invisible rays, later called X-rays, shot out of a contraption made of metal and glass that looked like something out of Dr. Frankenstein’s laboratory. Newspapers packed their pages with depictions of a person’s insides on the outside, and readers snatched up copies. Scientists were also enchanted by X-rays. Some of them wanted to know what else they could do. Others wondered where they came from. All these scientists understood that a battery attached to a stretched glass globe spawned a glowing stream called a cathode ray, and when this cathode ray collided with a piece of metal inside the globe, out came X-rays. Their thinking was that there must be more to these cathode rays. So while the whole world was wowed with X-rays, a few scientists were hoping to find the next great thing in cathode rays. Little did they know that this bright stream would explain how the world worked.
Cathode rays had been known for decades, but there was little consensus about their origin, and eventually the case went cold. With the renewed interest in them, scientists obsessed over every move of cathode rays, writing articles with reports of their behavior, though not yet knowing that cathode rays held a key to their science understanding. Locked in those cathode rays was the currency of all chemical reactions. Locked in those cathode rays was the answer to science questions from how toasters work to how planets were born. Locked in those cathode rays were the droplets that powered a river of modern technologies from televisions to computers to cellphones. Unbeknownst to these early scientists was that inside the cathode ray was a part of the atom that they didn’t know existed—the electron. But deciphering the puzzle of cathode rays required uncovering clues. Just as the popular character Sherlock Holmes used his intellect and his magnifying glass to solve mysteries, scientists too had to observe cathode rays under glass. For some scientists, this puzzle was too delicious to turn down, and Joseph John Thomson was one of them. It was this short man from the nineteenth century who would make the giant leap that made the technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries possible.
Thomson’s potential in answering one of the biggest questions of his day seemed doubtful when he was fourteen years old in 1870. All he wanted to be was a botanist. As a small boy growing up near the city of Manchester, England, he spent all his pocket money on weekly gardening magazines. His father, a modest bookseller, wanted him to have a stable trade as an engineer. Being an engineer was good work, as Manchester’s textile mills turned American cotton into goods. To please his father, J. J., as Joseph John Thomson was nicknamed, attended Owen’s College in Manchester in 1870. But when his father died, J. J. scrambled to stay in school by winning scholarships. He entered Trinity College in Cambridge to study mathematics, choosing the beauty of numbers, instead of their utility, as in engineering. Walking on the hallowed grounds that Sir Isaac Newton strolled was an achievement for any son of a bookseller. But J. J. never fit in.
J. J. may not have felt at home at this old university, but his genius certainly was at home there. By 1895, Thomson was the thirty-nine-year-old head of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, blossoming into an absentminded mathematics professor. His eyeglasses had two positions—one on his nose, which meant he was thinking, and the other on his forehead, which meant he was thinking more. He did not trouble his brain with worry about his appearance so his hair was long, his mustache overgrown, and his chin badly shaven. His brain was congested with abstract ideas, so his new research on cathode rays meant there’d be even less space to worry about ordinary things.
Uncovering the origin of the cathode rays was a perfect puzzle for J. J. because it challenged him by linking abstract ideas with observable events. Cathode rays shot from one electrical connection to another inside of a glass tube without air, and there were two dueling beliefs among scientists about how cathode rays moved in the world. One group thought that cathode rays were a wave that was a wrinkle in the ether. Others concluded that the beam was made up of small bits of particles acting together, like a migrating flock of birds. “Neither side was wholly right nor wholly wrong,” said J. J. There was evidence to support both ideas, but the cathode ray could not be both.
One definitive way to see if a cathode ray was a wave or a particle was to observe its dance with magnets. There was an old theory that said that if cathode rays fly undisturbed by a magnet, they are a wave; and if a magnet deflects the ray, they are made up of particles. J. J. wanted to test this theory and learned that fourteen years earlier, in 1883, another scientist performed this very same experiment. Cathode rays did not move when a magnet was nearby, supporting the wave argument. But J. J. thought there was something wrong with that earlier attempt. Scientific tools had advanced since then, and could draw more air out of a glass tube to better create a vacuum. A vacuum with less air was the habitat where cathode rays thrived best. So J. J., who believed that cathode rays were full of particles, wanted to repeat this old experiment using a glass tube with less air in it, made possible with an improved vacuum. J. J.’s mathematical genius, unfortunately, did not translate into manual dexterity. For such a small man, he was a Victorian bull in a china shop. When he visited his students in the laboratory, they’d wince when he offered help, and quickly tried to move fragile things out of his way. They took deep breaths when he sat on a lab stool to speak. Life was no better at home. J. J.’s wife did not permit him to use a hammer in the house.
J. J. needed help with his experiments and that help came from a former chemistry assistant, Ebeneezer Everett. While the name Ebeneezer conjures a miserly image, Everett was a dashing, mustached man, with cowboy good looks, who leaned a bit to seem less tall. Little is known of this Everett, except that he was a patient soul and a virtuoso for making laboratory glassware out of common soda lime glass into works of art that would have pleased a Murano glass master. Lab benches were full of Everett’s glass constructions, braced in place with wood brackets, with wires on every surface and sticking up into the air. Everett was the scientific brawn to J. J.’s brain. Starting in late 1896, J. J. wanted to make a cathode-ray Obstacle course to settle this wave/particle debate. Everett made a sophisticated glass bulb with pieces inside, reminiscent of a model ship in a bottle. On one end of the glass two metal pins stuck out that were attached to the ends of a battery to produce the cathode ray. Inside the glass, the cathode rays sprayed out in many directions like water out of a hose and were focused into a narrow stream, with two slits that acted like a nozzle. That beam then hit the interior surface of a round bulb, creating a green glow.
Cathode rays required that there be very little air inside the glass tube. “This was more easily said than done,” said J. J. To remove the air, Everett poured liquid mercury into a tower, which he connected to his glass bulb with a glass bridge. As the heavy liquid fell, it sucked air across the bridge from the glass bulb, creating a vacuum. Removing the air sometimes took most of the day, so Everett started in the morning before the hurricane in the form of J. J. Thomson arrived in the laboratory in the afternoon.
Only glass worked for these experiments. Copper would not do, nor any metal for that matter, for metals would bury the cathode ray. Wood or clay would not work either, for they could not hold a vacuum. Clear plastics hadn’t been invented yet. Glass was the best keeper of a vacuum; transparent, uninterested in conducting electricity, and malleable to an inventor’s imagination. But, mostly, glass was vital in science because it allowed scientists to do what they do best, which is to use their power of observation—and this was what J. J. excelled at.
Sometimes J. J. complained to his colleagues about his glassware. “I believed all the glass in the place is bewitched,” he said. Standard recipes did not yet exist for glass. Some parts of a glass tube were richer in key ingredients than others. To build with glass required compositions that were uniform all over, so that they would melt at the same temperature. And a glass piece divulged how well the bond was made only after many hours of work had passed. Sometimes glass whispered with a small air leak that there was something wrong, other times it screamed with explosions. Glass was temperamental, and it was up to Everett to tend to it like a newborn baby. In the summer of 1897, Everett completed J. J. Thomson’s obstacle course for testing cathode rays. He inserted two additional metal plates and attached them to another battery, creating an electric field, as a way to nudge the rays. As Everett turned the contraption on, J. J. saw that the cathode ray moved downward to the metal plate connected to the positive end of the battery. This told J. J. that the cathode ray was negative. Everett then put a huge horseshoe magnet around the center of the glass tube, and when he turned it on, J. J. saw that the cathode ray moved up, like migrating birds swept up by a strong wind. From J. J.’s mathematical calculations, written on the backs of random scraps of paper, he was able to deduce that the cathode ray was made of small bits that were electrically charged and negative. He calculated they were smaller than an atom, and were thus the tiniest part of matter yet discovered.
And when he and Everett repeated these experiments with different metal plates and with different gases inside the tube, J. J. saw that these same small negative charges existed in all materials. He called these bits corpuscles, but they would later be known as electrons. J. J.’s discovery changed the world, but he could not predict that it would. This small and odd man found the small and odd electron, opening up a door in science and expanding the understanding of matter. The discovery of the electron gave us clues about how galaxies and planets formed, because the exchange of electrons, in chemical bonds, explained how hot gases from the Big Bang coalesced into us. This discovery also revealed the basic building block of technology. With the electron, scientists would come to understand the workings of circuits, static electricity, batteries, piezoelectricity, magnets, generators, and transistors. With the knowledge of electrons, technology—and society—blossomed.
When J. J. Thomson was growing up, many inventions that we now take for granted did not exist. There was “no car, no airplane, no electric light, no telephone, no radio.” But the electrons in his glass, which made up electricity, would power all these machines as well as later developments such as computers, cellphones, and the internet. As smart as J. J. was, he could never have predicted that this abstract science would have practical implications. But it did, and it had many. With his discovery, humanity was thrust into a new age—an electronic one. None of these technologies, however, would have happened if it weren’t for the ability to see electrons in action. Our modern world was made possible by the ancient and old material of glass.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Highest-ever concentration of microplastics found on seafloor: scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Scientists say they have discovered the highest levels of microplastics ever recorded on the seafloor.
As part of an international research project led by the University of Manchester, scientists were able to uncover a staggering 1.9 million pieces of microplastics in a single square-metre of the ocean’s floor in the Mediterranean.
In a study, published in the journal “Science” on Thursday, the researchers showed how deep-sea currents act as conveyor belts to transport and deposit tiny plastic fragments and fibres across the seafloor.
As a result of these currents, “microplastic hotspots” or large accumulations can occur in certain locations, the study said.
“Almost everybody has heard of the infamous ocean ‘garbage patches’ of floating plastic, but we were shocked at the high concentrations of microplastics we found in the deep seafloor,” Ian Kane, the study’s lead author and an earth scientist at the University of Manchester, said in a press release.
“We discovered that microplastics are not uniformly distributed across the study area; instead, they are distributed by powerful seafloor currents which concentrate them in certain areas.”
While people often think of microplastics as tiny pieces of plastics in exfoliants, detergents, and glitter; the deposits found in the study area of the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea, consisted primarily of fibres from textiles and clothing.
These types of microplastics can easily enter rivers and oceans because they’re not effectively filtered out in domestic waste water treatment plants, the researchers said.
According to the scientists, more than 10 million tons of plastic waste enter the oceans each year.
And although there has been much attention given to floating debris, such as plastic drinking straws and bags, which are visible on the surface, it only accounts for one per cent of the plastic that enters the world’s oceans.
The other 99 per cent of plastic waste is believed to be somewhere below the surface in the depths of the oceans.
The difficulty for scientists, however, has been locating where exactly all that plastic waste has wound up in the oceans.
That is why the international team set out to determine how deep ocean currents affects the location of microplastic hotspots. To do this, they collected sediment samples from the seafloor of the Tyrrhenian Sea and combined them with calibrated models and deep ocean currents and detailed mapping of the seafloor. They then analyzed all the samples using infra-red spectroscopy to determine the different plastic types.
“Our study has shown how detailed studies of seafloor currents can help us to connect microplastic transport pathways in the deep sea and find the ‘missing’ microplastics,” Mike Clare, a co-lead on the project and a researcher at the National Oceanography Centre, said.
The researchers said understanding where the microplastic hotspots are is vital because deep ocean currents carry oxygenated water and nutrients, which means these areas are also likely to house important ecosystems with marine life that can consume or absorb the harmful plastics.
“The results [of the study] highlight the need for policy interventions to limit the future flow of plastics into natural environments and minimize impacts on ocean ecosystems,” Clare said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Invasive 'murder hornets' have been spotted in the U.S.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just when you thought 2020 could not get any worse. Now we have giant hornets with freakish eyes and a venomous sting to add to this year's list of worries.
For the first time, Asian giant hornets have been spotted in the United States, specifically in Washington state, scientists say. Beekeepers have reported piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off, an alarming sight in a country with a rapidly declining bee population.
At more than two inches long, they're the world's largest hornets with a sting that can kill humans if bitten multiple times, according to experts at the Washington State University. Researches have nicknamed them "murder hornets."
"They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face," Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at the Washington State University's department of entomology, said recently.
Scientists don't know how these giant hornets native to Asia ended up in Washington state.
They're sometimes transported in international cargo -- in some cases deliberately, said Seth Truscott with WSU's college of agricultural, human and natural resource sciences.
The giant hornet was first spotted in the state in December, and scientists believe it started becoming active again last month, when queens emerge from hibernation to build nests and form colonies.
"Hornets are most destructive in the late summer and early fall, when they are on the hunt for sources of protein to raise next year's queens," Truscott said on the WSU's Insider.
"They attack honey bee hives, killing adult bees and devouring bee larvae and pupae, while aggressively defending the occupied colony," he added. "Their stings are big and painful, with a potent neurotoxin. Multiple stings can kill humans, even if they are not allergic."
Washington state agricultural officials are asking beekeepers and residents to report any sightings of the giant hornets. But don't get too close. Its sting can penetrate a regular beekeeper's suit, and state scientists had to order special reinforced suits.
"Don't try to take them out yourself if you see them," said entomologist Chris Looney of the state Department of Agriculture. "If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we're going to have any hope of eradication."
State officials are asking people in Whatcom, Skagit, Island, San Juan, Jefferson and Clallam counties to be especially vigilant.
The giant hornets especially target bees between late summer and the fall.
"The most likely time to catch Asian giant hornets is from July through October -- when colonies are established and workers are out foraging," the Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a statement. "Traps can be hung as early as April if attempting to trap queens, but since there are significantly fewer queens than workers, catching a queen isn't very likely."
State officials set up traps and launched an app to quickly report sightings, saying just a few of the hornets can devastate a hive within hours.
Bees pollinate plants producing fruit, nuts and vegetables, and are crucial to the nation's food industry. Attack by the hornets risks decimating bees, which are already on endangered lists due to their sharply declining numbers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Canadians who were among the first to receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) must now reapply for another four weeks of benefits.
CERB offers $500 per week for Canadians who’ve lost work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but recipients must confirm their eligibility for the program every four weeks.
The renewal payments are not automatic, meaning anyone who applied for CERB between April 6 and April 10 will now need to reapply for the benefit. 
To qualify for the benefit, Canadians must be at least 15 years of age and have been forced out of work due to the pandemic. They must also have earned at least $5,000 in the previous calendar year and now expect to make less than $1,000 per month while collecting the CERB payments.
Recipients can reapply for the benefit either online or by calling 1 (800) 959-2019.
Those receiving the benefit through Service Canada must fill out their EI Report Card to receive the payment.
A previous version of this story gave an incorrect phone number for reapplying for CERB. The correct phone number is 1 (800) 959-2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A critical coronavirus patient in Hyderabad has been administered an experimental therapy involving injecting convalescent plasma for passive immunisation to treat the disease, it emerged on Sunday.
The development was confirmed by the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) isolation ward's focal person Dr Aftab Hussain Phull.
Does plasma therapy treat Covid? Is it safe? Here's all you need to know about the approach
The plasma — donated by a recovered coronavirus patient to the Diagnostic and Research Laboratory at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences — was administered to a patient under treatment at the isolation ward.
"He was given the plasma after managing his condition as best as possible under the given circumstances," Phull said.
On April 30, the Sindh government had allowed three hospitals in the province to carry out clinical trials for the “experimental use of Covid-19 convalescent plasma for passive immunisation".
The hospitals included the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital in Karachi, the National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD) in Karachi and LUH, a government facility in Hyderabad.
Prior to this, the government had approved clinical trials for plasma therapy in addition to approving locally made ventilators for treating critically ill patients and granting permission for manufacturing sanitisers and producing chloroquine.
The experimental therapy involves collecting blood from someone who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing separated plasma to a critically sick patient; plasma is the clear part of blood that is left when blood cells have been removed and contains antibodies and other proteins.
The transfusion of plasma with its antibodies provides a form of 'passive immunity' to the sick recipient to fight the infection.
The protection offered by passive immunisation, however, is short-lived, usually lasting only a few weeks or months.
The science behind plasma therapy and passive immunisation is not new; the concept has been widely applied for treating different infectious diseases including mumps, measles and polio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The lucrative trade in human blood samples</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After 10 terrible days of chills, nausea, a fever of 103 and a headache of such intensity that her nose bled, Aleacia Jenkins knew she had been stricken with the coronavirus even before she tested positive.
So when a friend told her about an obscure California company that was asking for blood donations from people who have recovered from the virus to help researchers develop tests for antibodies, she didn’t hesitate.
“If my blood donation could help save someone’s life who is older or more vulnerable,” said Jenkins, 42, of Shoreline, Washington, “it would be crazy not to want to help do that.”
But what she did not know at the time was that the company, Cantor BioConnect, was selling those donations to laboratories and test manufacturers at sometimes exorbitant prices: from $350 up to $40,000 for a rare sample from a single donor.
Cantor BioConnect said its prices were directly related to the “high costs” of its supply chain, which includes finding donors, testing the samples, safety costs and shipping logistics.
Around the world, scientists are racing to develop and mass-produce reliable antibody tests that public health experts say are a crucial element in ending the coronavirus lockdowns that are causing economic devastation. But that effort is being hamstrung, scientists say, by a shortage of the blood samples containing antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, that are needed to validate the tests.
Recognising a rare opportunity, some companies are seeking to cash in on the shortages, soliciting blood donations and selling samples at rich markups in a practice that has been condemned by medical professionals as, at the very least, unethical.
While the trade is happening worldwide, there is a particular shortage in Britain, which has only a small number of positive COVID-19 blood samples, public health officials said, because it was slow to roll out testing.
Traditionally, blood samples have been provided at low cost by Britain’s largely centralised public health system to labs and clinics. In contrast to the private market in the United States, the British system is not set up to distribute samples to a large network of labs and test manufacturers, leaving many of them now to fend for themselves.
Strict rules govern the collection and use of human samples in the country, banning the payment of donors (past a small expense fee) and prohibiting third parties from making a profit from blood samples sourced from the National Health Service.
But that has not stopped businesses from trying to make a profit by selling blood donated in other countries to Britain and elsewhere, which they can do legally.
Documents, emails and price lists obtained by The New York Times show that Cantor BioConnect is one of several companies throughout the world offering to sell COVID-19 blood samples to labs and test manufacturers at elevated prices. The higher the level of antibodies in the blood, the higher the price.
From March 31 to April 22, prices asked by Cantor BioConnect for its cheapest samples — always sold by the millilitre, the equivalent of less than one-quarter of a teaspoon — rose more than 40%, to $500 from $350. In addition to the $40,000 sample, the company also increased the amount of blood samples for sale for $3,000 and introduced new prices of $1,000 to $2,000 for other “premium” stock.
“I’ve never seen these prices before,” said Dr Joe Fitchett, medical director of Mologic, one of the British test manufacturers that was offered the blood samples. “It’s money being made from people’s suffering.”
Stymied by the soaring prices, scientists in Britain say they have been forced to turn to personal connections and word-of-mouth to procure the blood donations they need.
Human tissue samples are critical for virologists, medical researchers and pharmaceutical companies trying to develop vaccines, cures, treatments and tests. The samples include things like organs and bones as well as blood.
“Any drug or vaccine or test kit being developed needs to go through trials and tests and validations, and to do that you need to have positive samples,” said Kelly Sapsford, who manages blood collections for Clinical Trials Laboratory Services, a private blood donation centre in London. “They’re critical.”
All of the companies mentioned in this article have denied any profiteering.
Cantor BioConnect was founded in 2016 in a San Diego suburb. Its creator, David Cantor, was following in the footsteps of his father in what was then a sleepy business. He said in a statement that he was “proud to be playing a role in the scientific research that will eventually help neutralise this deadly virus.”
Cantor was early to spot a gap in the market. On March 18 of this year, he posted on Facebook, “As you know, the war against coronavirus is currently hampered by lack of testing availability.”
He added, “I’ve been flooded with requests for this blood, and we need to find 50 patients willing to help the cause by donating some tubes of blood.”
Cantor and his employees began contacting coronavirus patients on social media to solicit blood donations. In a since-removed online advertisement, they said they were working “in conjunction” with the White House COVID-19 Task Force and offered $100 for each donation.
Dozens of donations began to flood in from across the United States. Within days, he was shipping out vials of blood to customers across the world.
The greatest demand, Cantor said, came from US labs and antibody test manufacturers. But the company also drew major demand from Japan and Europe, he said, including several “middlemen” in Britain.
Some of Cantor BioConnect’s blood samples are reasonably priced for the US market, industry experts said. But many said that the “premium inventory” price of $3,000 per millilitre was far higher than normal. And they all described the company’s price of $40,000 for a “seroconversion panel” of three blood donations from one patient as exorbitant.
The company said that its overall profit margin on the project was 30% to 40%, which it said was in line with industry norms. It said that the $40,000 price tag was for a “single transaction” of an extremely rare and valuable sample and that it did not track the profit margin of each individual sample sold.
Cantor outlined his costs per sample as the $100 donor fee, a maximum of $200 to ship the donation to his company and payment for a phlebotomist to collect the blood sample.
In response to further questions, he said in a statement that the process of collecting blood from COVID-19-positive donors was “complex” and “extremely difficult and costly” because of safety protocols and the small number of coronavirus cases known when he first started sourcing blood donations.
“There are ways to do things well and safely, and then there are other ways to do them cheaply,” he said, adding that the company had sold samples to “one of the world’s largest test manufacturers,” helping it to “save lives.”
In a final step, Cantor BioConnect relies on a web of middlemen, companies that find buyers for its products around the world. Cantor declined to name his customers or partners, but documents show that Advy Chemical, a major biotech manufacturer in Mumbai, is one of his middlemen.
The Indian company produces diagnostic kits and materials needed to develop tests for various diseases, which it then sells through its worldwide network of customers. It is certified by Germany’s safety regulator and licensed by India’s Food and Drug Administration.
According to emails and price lists reviewed by the Times, in the space of a single day its price for the cheapest blood samples more than doubled, to $950 a millilitre from $350, while “premium” inventory increased to $5,000 from $3,000. The most expensive blood sample was $50,000, an increase of $10,000 over Cantor BioConnect’s.
Advy Chemical said in a statement that the company did not sell any blood samples itself but that it helped facilitate connections for products that other manufacturers might need. It said it had not yet sold any of the Cantor BioConnect samples.
Asked why it had inflated the prices so greatly if it was merely a facilitator, the company cited “strict” nondisclosure agreements and said it would not comment on “business speculation and business specifics.”
The company strongly denied increasing prices by the amounts shown in the emails and price lists.
“Our only intention was to help bring more accurate tests and more quickly,” it said in the statement. “We had hoped this would help humanity, in a small way, in these trying times.”
There is no doubt that market pressures are severe. In Britain, where the cost of a human sample is usually low, scientists and manufacturers were shocked to be quoted $925 for a blood sample by a Scottish company called Tissue Solutions — far higher than the maximum $50 that they said they would normally pay hospitals.
Tissue Solutions’ chief executive, Morag McFarlane, said the company was not making a profit from the samples, which would violate England’s ban on third parties profiting from NHS blood collections.
He said that its higher price was a result of hospital biobanks charging more to collect blood because of the complex nature of gathering potentially contagious COVID-19 samples.
Such explanations, whatever their validity, did not go far with Jenkins, the would-be blood donor. After being told by a reporter how much money was being made from blood donations solicited by Cantor BioConnect, she said she had decided that she wanted “no part of it” and would instead donate her blood to a non-profit clinic in Seattle.
“Anyone trying to take advantage of a pandemic,” she said, “I think that’s really sad and wrong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">What is ‘COVID toe’? Maybe a strange sign of coronavirus infection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Dr Lindy Fox, a dermatologist in San Francisco, used to see four or five patients a year with chilblains — painful red or purple lesions that typically emerge on fingers or toes in the winter.
Over the past few weeks, she has seen dozens.
“All of a sudden, we are inundated with toes,” said Fox, who practices at the University of California, San Francisco. “I’ve got clinics filled with people coming in with new toe lesions. And it’s not people who had chilblains before — they’ve never had anything like this.”
It’s also not the time of year for chilblains, which are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions. “Usually, we see it in the dead of winter,” Fox said.
Fox is not the only one deluged with cases. In Boston, Dr. Esther Freeman, director of global health dermatology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said her telemedicine clinic is also “completely full of toes. I had to add extra clinical sessions, just to take care of toe consults. People are very concerned.”
The lesions are emerging as yet another telltale symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. The most prominent signs are a dry cough and shortness of breath, but the virus has been linked to a string of unusual and diverse effects, like mental confusion and a diminished sense of smell.
Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called COVID toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. (COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.)
Several medical papers from Spain, Belgium and Italy described a surge in complaints about painful lesions on patients’ toes, Achilles' heels and soles of the feet; whether the patients were infected was not always clear, because they were otherwise healthy and testing was limited.
Most cases have been reported in children, teens and young adults, and some experts say they may reflect a healthy immune response to the virus.
“The most important message to the public is not to panic — most of the patients we are seeing with these lesions are doing extremely well,” Freeman said.
“They’re having what we call a benign clinical course. They’re staying home, they’re getting better, the toe lesions are going away.”
Scientists are just beginning to study the phenomenon, but so far chilblain-like lesions appear to signal, curiously enough, a mild or even asymptomatic infection. They may also develop several weeks after the acute phase of an infection is over.
Patients who develop swollen toes and red and purple lesions should consult their primary care doctor or a dermatologist to rule out other possible causes. But, experts said, they should not run to the emergency room, where they risk being exposed to the coronavirus or exposing others if they are infected.
“The good news is that the chilblain-like lesions usually mean you’re going to be fine,” Fox said. “Usually it’s a good sign your body has seen COVID and is making a good immune reaction to it.”
Patients who get the painful lesions are often alarmed. They appear most frequently on the toes, often affecting several toes on one or both feet, and the sores can be extremely painful, causing a burning or itching sensation.
At first, the toes look swollen and take on a reddish tint; sometimes a part of the toe is swollen, and individual lesions or bumps can be seen. Over time, the lesions become purple in colour.
Hannah Spitzer, 20, a sophomore at Lafayette College who is finishing the academic year remotely at her home in Westchester County, New York, has lesions on all 10 of her toes, so uncomfortable — painful during the day, and itchy at night — that she can’t put anything on her feet, not even socks.
Walking is difficult, and she has trouble sleeping. “At first I thought it was my shoes, but it got worse and worse,” Spitzer said. “Most of my toes are red, swollen, almost shiny. It looks like frostbite.”
She has used hydrocortisone and Benadryl to alleviate the discomfort, and said ice is also helpful. Doctors say the lesions disappear on their own within a few weeks.
Adding to the mystery is that some teens and young adults with the lesions have tested negative for the coronavirus.
Dr Amy Paller, chair of the department of dermatology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said one possible explanation is that these patients had such a mild disease and that viral replication was limited, making the virus undetectable.
Another possibility, she said, is that the lesions are what is called an epiphenomenon — a symptom may accompany a disease without being causally related. For instance, perhaps more people are developing the lesions because they are staying inside and walking around barefoot more than usual.
But she also dismissed that idea as highly unlikely. “I don’t think that’s it — I think it’s a mild inflammatory process manifesting in this way,” Paller said. “It’s a real phenomenon. We don’t really understand it at all.”
Spitzer had a test shortly after developing the lesions, and the result was negative, but she is convinced the toe lesions are a delayed response to an earlier infection that was so mild she barely noticed it.
“I’ve never had anything like this,” she said. “It’s completely new.”
A recent paper by doctors in Spain, published in the International Journal of Dermatology, described six cases of patients with toe lesions and included pictures of the chilblain-like bumps that patients had emailed to their physicians.
Most of the patients were teens or young adults, including one 15-year-old who found out he had COVID-19 pneumonia when he went to the emergency room seeking medical attention for his toes.
Another patient was a 91-year-old man who had been hospitalized with the coronavirus three weeks earlier, and had recovered and returned home.
While dermatologists say it’s not unusual for rashes to appear along with viral infections — like measles or chickenpox — the toe lesions surprised them.
Other problems like hives have also been linked to the coronavirus, but COVID toes have been the most common and striking skin manifestation.
Patients with viral infections often get a pink bumpy rash called morbilliform, or hives, Fox said, but added that the toe lesions were “unexpected.”
The toe cases make up half of all reports filed by skin doctors around the world to a new international registry started by the American Academy of Dermatology, which is tracking the complications.
No one knows exactly why the new coronavirus might cause chilblain-like lesions. One hypothesis is that they are caused by inflammation, a prominent feature of COVID-19. Inflammation also causes one of the most serious syndromes associated with the coronavirus, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Other hypotheses are that the lesions are caused by inflammation in the walls of blood vessels, or by small micro clots in the blood. (Clotting has been another feature of the disease.)
The lesions seen in otherwise healthy people appear to be distinct from those that doctors are seeing in some critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care, who are prone to developing blood clots.
Some of these clots may be very small and can block the tiny vessels in the extremities, causing rashes on the toes, said Dr. Humberto Choi, a pulmonologist and critical care physician at the Cleveland Clinic.
Some experts now believe COVID toe should be recognized as sufficient grounds for testing, even in the absence of other symptoms.
“This should be a criteria for testing, just like loss of smell, and shortness of breath and chest pain,” Fox said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bees dying of disease eerily similar to coronavirus, British scientists say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest buzz in the science world: Honeybees are dying of something that is freakishly similar to the coronavirus.
Bee populations around the globe have been decimated by a viral disease that creeps into hives via asymptomatic insects and spreads like wildfire, British researchers discovered. Their research even suggests the insects could benefit from social distancing. 
The scientists found piles of bee carcasses outside hives infected with chronic bee paralysis virus, which causes severe trembling, flightlessness and death within a week, the Guardian reported. 
The infection was once a rarity but has spread rapidly, according to the researchers at Newcastle University, who examined bees in 25 countries. 
In Britain, for example, chronic bee paralysis virus took only a decade to invade 39 of 47 English counties and six of eight Welsh counties. In the US, the infection rate jumped from 0.7% in 2010 to 16% in 2014.
The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggests that the disease is twice as likely to infect commercially harvested bees — and that colonies not confined to the close quarters might fare better. 
“You can’t do social distancing in a hive as easily, but you can manage it by increasing the space in there,” Professor Giles Budge told the website.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stop destroying the environment or face deadlier pandemics, scientists warn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Environmentalists and scientists issued dire warnings this week: Stop environmental destruction and the illegal wildlife trade now — or face another pandemic that could wipe out civilization.
On Monday, Professors Josef Settele, Sandra Díaz and Eduardo Brondizio, along with Dr. Peter Daszak, wrote an article for The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) titled: “COVID-19 Stimulus Measures Must Save Lives, Protect Livelihoods, and Safeguard Nature to Reduce the Risk of Future Pandemics.”
The scientists warned that “Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a ‘perfect storm’ for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people. This often occurs in areas where communities live that are most vulnerable to infectious diseases.”
The scientists then pointed out that animal-to-human diseases that already exist, like Ebola, rabies or avian flu, already “cause an estimated 700,000 deaths each year.” Deaths in 2020 will skyrocket due to COVID-19, but if nature isn’t protected and animals aren’t isolated from humans, the next pandemic, they warn, will be worse.
“Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,” the scientists write.
Peter Knights, the CEO of WildAid, a conservation organization that works to end illegal poaching and consumption of wild animals, agrees. He told the Post: “Sixty percent of infectious diseases originate in animals and are transferred to humans … and the risks are increasing with deforestation and climate change. When someone logs in a rainforest and builds roads into the wild, we come into contact with species we aren’t supposed to. Humans then drive these animals into big cities and sell them at live markets, where the risks increase when you stress these animals or mix these species together.”
Some scientists believe the COVID-19 pandemic started in a wet market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, possibly jumping from humans via bats or perhaps pangolins, the world’s most trafficked animal.
“The way these cross-species jump happened is by mixing species that wouldn’t mix in the wild; they transmit diseases in close contact and under stress,” said Knights, who has started a petition calling for the end of wildlife poaching. “The wildlife trade is associated with disease. SARS [allegedly] came from bats via civets cats; HIV was [allegedly] transferred to humans via the bushmeat trade in monkeys and chimpanzees, and now COVID-19 is believed to come from bats, possibly transferred through pangolins.”
The recent decimation of the tourism industry has led to a huge uptick in poaching, which exacerbates the problem. According to the New York Times: “Heads of poaching gangs in Mozambique are planning to take advantage of reduced ranger patrols and the lack of tourists in Kruger National Park in neighboring South Africa.”
Meanwhile, CNBC reports: “In Botswana, at least six rhinos have been poached since the virus shut down tourism there … In northwest South Africa, at least nine rhinos have been killed since the virus lockdown.”
The killings affect multiple generations, as many of the rhino babies left behind either starve, are killed by other wild animals or end up in a rhino orphanage.
Even more poaching recruits are expected to sign up in the coming months.
“African countries are in dire economic straits,” Knights said. “There are a lot of unemployed people, and without tourists on safari or people working in lodges, you have less surveillance. We’re very concerned that is what is leading to the poaching spike.”
Knights and his team have been working non-stop with the governments of China and Vietnam — the largest procurers of illegally poached animals and animal parts — to try and stop this trade at the source.
“There is a demand from China and Vietnam for these exotic animals as they have traditions of eating wild animals. The size of their economies fuels a large trade,” Knights said. “But the governments are much more ready to act now than they were five years ago.”
In January, China imposed a ban on all farming and consumption of “terrestrial wildlife of important ecological, scientific and social value,” which is expected to be signed into law later this year.
After conservationists sent an open letter to Vietnam’s prime minister recommending action against the wildlife trade as a means of preventing future outbreaks of disease, that country — where wildlife restaurants have bats, civet cats, snakes, bear, monkeys and pangolins on the menu — is also looking to stop importing imperiled animals to eat.
And recently, both China and Vietnam introduced airport detection systems that can help expose someone trying to smuggle in animal parts. It’s already helped in efforts to curb the ivory trade: In early April, 11 large rhino horns were seized in Vietnam after a flight from Hong Kong was diverted from Ho Chi Minh city to Can Tho.
“Many people in China [and Vietnam] find this illegal wildlife trade as abhorrent as everyone in the west,” Knights said. “When the coronavirus broke out there was a tremendous uproar. But in a country of 1.4 billion, you don’t need that many bad actors to have (a huge impact).”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can children spread the coronavirus? It’s complicated.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As most of the world continues to socially distance because of the coronavirus, Switzerland’s infectious disease chief wants to loosen restrictions for children — so they can hug their grandparents.
It’s a poignant move, as it was made in part to benefit older people’s mental health. But it’s also very risky, as it’s unclear whether or not young children, who generally seem to get mild cases of Covid-19, transmit the disease to others at similar rates as adults.
As that scientific debate rages, Daniel Koch, the Swiss infectious disease chief, firmly planted his flag on one side of it Wednesday. “Young children are not infected and do not transmit the virus,” he told reporters, referring to a study released this month as well as his conversations with Swiss health experts.
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, where Koch works, says children under 10 years old rarely get the virus. “When they get sick, they often have only light symptoms,” spokesperson Yann Hulmann told me in an email. “They are apparently not big spreaders and are often infected by adults. So reopening schools does not seem to be a major problem.”
The risk of such a hug “is very low compared to the benefit for the mental health of the grandparents,” Hulmann added.
The views of Swiss officials didn’t come out of nowhere. They come amid a growingnumber of released reports from public health and infectious disease experts suggesting children spread the virus far less than adults. They form part of the justification for why Denmark reopened its schools earlier this month and why Spain this week allowed children 13 years old or younger to play outside.
But the science is far from settled. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says kids “can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.” And other studies show children continue to display similar transmission abilities as adults, leading experts to caution against trusting kids not to spread the disease.
“What we don’t know yet is the degree to which children can transmit the virus,” Dr. Danielle Zerr, an infectious disease expert at Seattle Children’s Hospital, told me.
This isn’t some trivial debate. World leaders face hard choices over which parts of society to reopen, when, and how quickly. Plus, staying home from school could curb children’s educational progress, while disrupting the work-life balance for adults. If children can head back to school with minimal health risks, then that could prove a major benefit for the child, their parents, and society at large.
But at the moment, the only thing that’s clear is that there’s no real clarity on this issue. Still, it’s worth looking into the science for each case, and what the data does and doesn’t say about coronavirus transmissibility from young children.
It’s not entirely clear why, but so far, children don’t seem to be getting Covid-19 as often as adults. As Business Insider pointed out on Thursday:
And there is a growing body of scientific literature showing young children may not be as likely to spread the virus to others as older people.
Take this April 22 study from the government of New South Wales, the Australian state that contains one-third of the country’s population and the city of Sydney. Researchers looked at five primary schools, with kindergarten through seventh grade (in US terms), from March to mid-April of this year. Schools prove a valuable testing case, not only because there are many children to observe, but also because they allow experts to gauge when the right time to restart normal schooling might be.
As the chart below shows, they found that only one person out of 168 in close contact with an infected person got sick with the virus.
Which led to the following conclusion: Covid-19 “transmission in children in schools appears considerably less than seen for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.”
Top Australian officials, including Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, are now citing this report to say social distancing measures don’t need to be followed in schools as the country considers reopening them fully in the near future.
But Dr. Kristine Macartney, the study’s lead author, pushed back on such conclusions. “We did see low transmission, we didn’t see no transmission,” she told me. “I think children can still transmit coronavirus. That’s certainly the case. We’ve seen that.”
Macartney also noted the study is still a preliminary finding — it will go through the peer review process soon — and that more research is required. Her team “didn’t actually evaluate” whether the observed schools followed social distancing guidelines or not, and class attendance dropped considerably in April, meaning new cases of community spread among her study’s population could have emerged after its conclusion. “I don’t think our findings should be used as a single piece of evidence in anybody’s policy,” she said.
What she does emphasize is: “It’s not that transmission can’t happen, it’s just that evidence is suggesting ... that [transmission among children] happens at a lower rate than does transmission between adults.”
Other evidence for that claim includes a March non-peer-reviewed study from experts in China and Australia. Between December 2019 and March 2020, researchers looked at 31 households with coronavirus infections in China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Iran.
What they found was someone 18 years or younger brought the disease into the home in just under 10 percent of cases. That’s remarkable, since previous studies had shown children were responsible for infecting their families with H5N1 bird flu in about 50 percent of cases.
The preliminary evidence for the claim that children don’t transmit the coronavirus at high rates also led the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) to be optimistic about kids and transmission on their website: “Data from population-based and cross-sectional studies indicate that children are unlikely to be primary source cases.”
However, when I followed up with the ECDC, spokesperson Alexandru Niculae told me in an email these and other studies “cannot be considered as ‘enough evidence’, this is still considered limited data; so we need to take this with a pinch of salt for the time being.”
Despite all those studies, multiple experts told me it’s still completely possible that kids could be significant spreaders of the disease. Seattle Children’s Zerr is one of them. “If we document high levels of virus in their nose, I don’t know why they would be less likely to transmit,” she told me.
In other words, a child doesn’t necessarily have to be very ill to spread the virus. As long as a kid is near others with a load of virus in the nose or mouth — symptomatic or not — they could be a carrier and a transmitter.
A study released by Germany’s chief virologist Christian Drosten and others this week backs Zerr’s skepticism. Here’s what they found: “Analysis of variance of viral loads in patients of different age categories found no significant difference between any pair of age categories including children,” the researchers wrote. “In particular, these data indicate that viral loads in the very young do not differ significantly from those of adults.”
“Based on these results, we have to caution against an unlimited re-opening of schools and kindergartens in the present situation,” they concluded. “Children may be as infectious as adults.”
You can see a chart from the report below, which Drosten tweeted out Wednesday. What it makes clear, though, is the study looked at fewer cases of infected children than other age groups, which may have skewed the results. The paper also hasn’t yet been peer reviewed.
All this means there’s no scientific consensus on the infectiousness of children — and that has many health officials urging caution.
The US CDC’s website, for example, says:
And Beth Riggs, a spokesperson for the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told me they continue to ask visitors — including young people — to follow “universal masking policies in place to help limit the potential spread of the virus and protect our patients, their families and our staff.”
Which makes the Swiss case — allowing health children to hug their grandparents — all the more troubling. It’s not that the country’s health officials say kids can roam free, but suggesting they effectively pose no risk is too absolute for experts like Zerr. “We have so much evidence of children with infections,” she told me after I read her the Swiss infection disease chief’s statement to the press. Koch’s statement, she told me, is “just not true.”
Covid-19 is a new disease, and as such, scientists have a lot more replicable research to do before the world can begin to even come close to understanding how children may spread it. And this uncertainty has many still taking necessary precautions until there’s more and confirmed evidence about whether children are actually rare spreaders of the disease.
In times like these, then, the cautious approach might be the best one.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Does Geographic Residency Predict COVID-19 Risk?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The extended travel restriction between the U.S. and Canada will expire on May 17, 2020. Although it is up to the two governments to make the decision regarding when to restore the normal border operation, two main arguments against lifting the restriction seem flawed. Both regard residents of the U.S. as linked with a major risk factor for the infection.
The first opinion emphasizes the risk of spreading the virus to Canada by travelers from the U.S. For example, the Global News recently cited a professor at University of Ottawa as saying that because the U.S. has the biggest epidemic in the world with less sticking to social distancing, removing the restriction is likely to put Canadians at risk. Using the numbers in the report, we can get that the infection rates for the two countries: there are about 30 confirmed cases per 10,000 population in the U.S. and about 12 cases per 10,000 population in Canada, respectively.
His assumes that the geographic “group” with the higher infection rate will proportionally carry the higher risk for the other. However, this assumption lacks supporting evidence.
Let’s look at two examples:
1. Health Canada website reported that during the flu season of 2018-19, there were 12,200 flu-related hospitalizations in Canada. Adjusted for the population, it shows about 3 hospitalizations per 10,000 Canadians. At the same time, American CDC reported there were 490,600 flu-related hospitalizations, or about 15 cases per 10,000 Americans.
In spite of the gigantic contrast in the infection rate between the two countries, there was no shutdown or restriction at the border during the season. People on both sides traveled freely. There is no evidence showing that travelers from the much higher flu-infected U.S. exacerbate the condition in Canada.
2. Washington State and Oregon are two bordering States. Washington has three times of the confirmed COVID-19 cases that of Oregon. The most recent data (April 29, 2020) shows that Washington has 18 cases per 10,000 population, whereas Oregon has less than 6 cases per 10,000 population. There has never been any travel restriction between the two regions. The Greater Portland in OR and Clark County in WA are so connected that many people working or studying in Portland reside in Clark County. People in WA drive over Columbia River to do shopping, recreational, educational and other activities in OR, because of its clusters of business with no sale tax and numerous opportunities. With the stay-at-home stipulation by the States in last several weeks, Oregon local media reported the traffic has not reduced substantially. In short, Washington’s higher cases have not aggravated COVID-19 situation in Oregon with the open commuting.
The second opinion against lifting the border restriction is based on a recent survey of COVID-19 patients in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia about their international travel experiences early this year. As reported in the National Post, those who have traveled to the U.S. account for the largest percentage among the participants. The other top international destinations include United Kingdom, France, Puerto Rico, Austria, cruise ships, Mexico, Iran and Italy. The number of cases related to travel from China is negligible.
However, although the largest percentage among the participants involves traveling to the U.S., this fact is insufficient to establish the association between the U.S. travel and the infection. This is because the data only suggest the exposure to risk (traveling to the U.S.) and the absence of exposure (no traveling to the U.S.) for the cases, but lack information about the controls for comparison.
In epidemiology, a case-control study can answer the question about the association between the U.S. travel and the infection. Researchers need to include the cases and a comparable group of people (e.g., similar in age, health, and gender) as the controls who do not show the outcome—COVID-19. The analysis must integrate information about the exposure (in this case, travelling to the U.S.) and the absence of exposure in the controls before calculating the odds ratio between the cases and controls. If a sizable portion of the controls also have a recent trip to the U.S. (that is, a similar exposure), the result is likely to suggest a weak or no association between the exposure and the outcome.
In short, it is inaccurate to assume that individuals in a geographical area have high or low risk for transmitting an infectious disease just because their geographic “group” has a high or low percentage of the disease cases. The reason is, individuals classified by similar geographic locations may be quite dissimilar in the dimensions related to how the disease is developed and transmitted.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What We Say to Children Can Have Long-Lasting Impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When I was about seven years old, my mother warned me about eating pork products. She told me that pork needed to be cooked thoroughly because if there were even a hint of pink in your pork chop, you could get Trichinosis. Now, I didn’t know what Trichinosis was, however, it was described to me as a terrible disease that I did not want to get. When you’re seven, hearing the words terrible disease was enough, I didn’t need any more warning than that. I had gotten shots for mumps and the measles, and had my sugar cube to protect me from polio, so if just making sure my pork was cooked well would stop me from getting this hard to pronounce disease, I was all for it.
This clear warning from my mother stuck with me that day, and has stuck all of these decades later. There has not been a time in my life when I have ever eaten any pork product before checking that it was cooked thoroughly. Soggy bacon has been suspect, as has any other pork product that frankly didn’t look overdone. A number of years ago (when I was well into middle age) I was eating dinner at a friend’s house and she was serving pork. And (gasp), it had some pink in it!!!!!! I freaked out. I explained to our host and the other dinner guests the danger that was clearly present in this meal. I insisted that the pork had to be cooked further and I felt proud of myself for saving everyone with my quick-thinking and keen awareness.
It was only after I went home that evening that I decided to see how many people in the United States actually get Trichinosis. I checked Google and discovered that the year this happened there were less than 15 cases in the entire United States! Less than 15 Trichinosis cases (and I’m not even sure those were from eating under cooked pork.
The reason I bring this up, is for you to realize the impact that your words have on children. Casual warnings can seem like life and death edicts to young minds. I know my mother was trying to protect me from an illness that may have been more of a danger 50 years ago than it is now. The point is, how powerful those messages are and how long they last.
As adults, we may say things casually to children because we want them to be safe. We may exaggerate, or we may make things seem more dangerous than they actually are. After all, we want children to take what we say seriously. However, we can also overemphasize something and cause fear in a child that they may carry with them the rest of their lives.
This also goes for the way we treat children. Sharp words; lack of compassion; letting our emotions cause us to lash out unfairly; all of these are behaviors that can impact children negatively. They are noticed and absorbed by our kids. Even when children are being defiant, they may be internalizing our words of frustration and anger. The way we behave and the words we use are what they are learning from us. These early internalized behaviors can impact their self-image and may eventually be how they treat their own children and spouses. That’s why it is so important that we stay aware of how we talk to children. The more conscious we are of what we’re saying and the reasons we’re saying it, can help us model positive behaviors.
The bottom line is that our children are listening to us all of the time. Whether we’re praising them, disciplining them, or responding to them out of our own frustrations, we are modeling for them how adults communicate. The more we are aware that they are absorbing what we say, hopefully, the more respectful and careful we are about the ways we are communicating with them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crazed By Coronavirus (Literally)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When quarantine first started, I thought it would be nice in a way. As an introvert who travels almost constantly for work — something that I love, but also find exhausting at times — I was relieved to finally get to spend some time at home. I envisioned quality time with my daughter, age 6; finally, the ability to add fitness to my schedule and keep it; time to take my cooking to a new level; no lost energy and productivity to time zone changes, packing, airport travel... maybe we'd finally even have time to get a dog! Yeah! While the circumstances leading to my time at home were grim, like many people, I was full of hope that I would be able to make the most of this time in quarantine.
Also like many people, the opposite has been true for me. Working from home, there have been days where I’m lucky if I can find 5 full minutes to pay attention to my daughter. I still cook, but lack the energy to level up much of anything. I have exercised once since quarantine began, and every day seems so full that I can scarcely imagine where I might have made time for fitness. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all has been the impact that quarantine has had on my mental health. About a week into quarantine, I started to have trouble sleeping. A week later, trouble sleeping turned into waking up panicked, jolted from a vivid, realistic dream into real life so abruptly that I was unsure what was real. A week after that, panic attacks at night turned into panic attacks during the day. By the end of week four, I had a panic attack during a high-pressure work call, and by the end of that week, I was taking some "unplanned PTO" from work, unsure what to do with myself but knowing that the new status quo could not continue.
It almost seems silly to articulate the worries that were creating this mountain so high that I found myself in a state of panic. Take inventory of your worries and input them here; it’s the same difference. My list of worries goes on and on, so much that it feels like I may drown in them if I stop swimming for even a second. If something gets me thinking about it, really thinking about it — and that’s not hard to do with social media, the news, and anyone I talk to all eager to talk about COVID-19 — the panic looms. I feel the tightness in my chest, the shortness of breath, just writing this paragraph. In the span of a few weeks, I had gone from having no history of anxiety to widespread general anxiety and daily panic attacks.
In clinical psychology, something is only considered a disorder if it brings distress and impairs your functioning, and I suspect a lot of people have entered this “clinical” range since February 2020. I am writing this piece exactly because I believe that many people are currently experiencing clinical levels of anxiety for the first time, and that now is a very important moment to educate, inform, and empower people to take action. Without good ways of tackling anxiety, we cope any way we can -- by drinking, shopping, binge watching TV or playing video games, or otherwise distracting ourselves. If there’s one thing I took away from the neuropsychology classes I've taken, it’s that what you do repeatedly becomes ingrained. The longer this panic persists, and the longer I go on failing to cope, or coping in unhealthy ways, the harder it will be for me to unlearn. Right now, when anxiety may be brand new, is the best possible time to unlearn it. In this uncertain time, where many are experiencing new heights of anxiety, it is important to learn new skills for coping with anxiety quickly, before anxiety becomes “the new normal.”
Though I'm not a practicing clinician, as a psychologist, I was trained in the treatment of various forms of anxiety in graduate school. I knew that the following options could potentially help with this gut-wrenching anxiety: going on medication, receiving psychotherapy, and using self-help tools. The first two can be achieved using telemedicine (I happened to have used Doctor on Demand, which is supported by my health plan, but there are many services like this and each health plan supports something different). The last requires a slog through the massive sea of self-help and digital therapeutic platforms out there, which is no easy task. I will admit a bias here because I am Chief Scientist of one such platform (Happify), but a lot of digital therapeutics companies are providing free self-help content right now (Happify included) so the landscape for research-based self-help tools has never been more lush. If you are trying to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to therapy and self-help that is research based, here are some phrases to look for: cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-basedstress reduction, interpersonal psychotherapy, diaphragmatic breathing/vagal stimulation, positive psychotherapy/positive psychology, and interoceptive exposure (for panic in particular).
Given the severity of the anxiety I was experiencing, I opted to try all three. Armed with new medications, a therapist who gets that I am here to tackle this anxiety thing hard and fast, and a set of tools to help me engage in new behaviors (made possible only by the miracle of telemedicine and digital therapeutics), I found some tools that I feel have potential to work for me. Medication helps turn down the volume knob on my anxiety so that it's (mostly) at a level I can manage. Therapy teaches me skills to cultivate in order to fight my anxiety. The digital self-help tools help me actually use those skills on a regular basis, turning them into habits.
My point here is not at all to tell everyone feeling COVID-19 anxiety to use medication, or seek therapy, or anything else (though I do hope that whatever you do, it’s research based and research tested! See a list of examples below). Rather, I hope to have legitimized the experience of anxiety right now, to have highlighted some of the different options out there to get help. You are not alone, and even though things are — really, really are — totally different, when it comes to mental health, coronavirus doesn’t have to keep you from getting the help you need.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Multidimensional Aspects of Adolescent Well-being</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many online resources are mentioning “well-being” during this pandemic, but teens and their caring adults often have a difficult time talking about what the word means. Here are a few tips for developing a common language around the multi-dimensionality of well-being.
Explain That Well-being Is More Than Just Happiness
In the eudaimonic tradition, one’s overall subjective well-being includes more than just feelings of happiness and life satisfaction. Researchers Ryff and Singer (2008), describe the tradition as rooted in the “realization of one’s self”. Well-being is a virtue that takes consideration and practice. Knowing that well-being is composed of more than just happiness allows teens to see that stress alone does not define them.
When working with teens in an after-school club called The Well-being Club, I use a participatory framework of well-being, designed by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The framework is theoretically grounded in Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory (1977), Elder’s Life Course Theory (1998), and is influenced by the work of Carol D. Ryff (Ryff, 1989) and Connie Flanagan (Flanagan, 2015).
The model recognizes that well-being is rooted in the culture, context, and identities of participants at a specific point in time. The “petals” of the model are the dimensions of well-being. The green circle, or “spheres of influence”, help individuals begin to identify people, systems, and policies that impede or support well-being.
Using the Model with Teens
Read through the dimensions and use the following questions to guide your conversations.
Mutual Care: When do you feel cared for? Do you have any relationships where you feel that care is given and received equally?
Belonging: When do you feel like you belong? With whom?
Engagement: What tasks, hobbies, or work are you engaged with today? When do you feel the most engaged?
Voice: When do you feel empowered to use your voice? In what situations?
Purpose: What passions or interests do you have? When have you felt a purpose?
Growth & Flourishing:How are you growing, despite the difficulties? When do you feel like you are flourishing?
Basic Supports: How are your basic needs being met (food, clothing, shelter, health care)? Are there needs that are going unmet?
Social Protection: What policies and people are supporting you right now? (Government, schools, fire and rescue, etc.) Be sure to validate your adolescent’s feelings if they recognize injustice in their social protection or any other dimension.
Sustenance: Are we able to maintain our current needs without harming the environment? How have you been connecting to the natural world?
Body Sovereignty: Are you feeling ok in terms of your body? Do you feel in control of your body and caring for it? This, is, of course, a sensitive topic, but one that is a valuable part of adolescent development.
Freedom from Harm: In what ways are you taking care of yourself and your community? During the pandemic, what are you doing to stay healthy and free of harm?
Adults should model language about the strengths and challenges they are facing. For example, “I feel really good about mutual care right now, but I am missing my colleagues and the sense of belonging I feel when I get to go to the office.” Share as many positive aspects of dimensions that you can.
Start with a prompt: Choose a dimension of well-being that is a strength for you right now. Draw or color a picture of what that looks like or feels like.
Model the activity and provide a way to invite adolescents to post or share their drawings with their friends or siblings (but don’t require it), as a community can be built through this process. Validate the drawings, even if they represent challenges. Adolescents need to express themselves without adult judgment.
Creating a graphic novel or comic strip that helps teens express themselves during these stressful times can be helpful. Encourage them to incorporate some of the dimensions of well-being into their images, titles, text, or subheadings.
Connection to other peers is imperative. For adolescents in the “The Well-being Club”, one of the significant ways that they described improvements with their well-being was due to having peers to listen to and learn from. Share this blog and partner with other parents to provide teens a way to connect around this topic.
Draw the dimensions into square boxes like a tic tac toe board. Flip a penny over the board. For each dimension landed upon, the coin flipper must state one positive aspect of that dimension they have experienced that week.
Share readings, news articles, blogs, memes, or social media posts created by other teens that express aspects of well-being. Discuss the readings. Ask, “Do you relate to this? In what way?”
Adolescents with the ability to text, may respond to virtual check-ins more than face-to-face. Try texting them, “What’s a strength of your well-being right now? Where do you need my help?” Develop emojis that represent specific often-used dimensions.
Sometimes it is difficult for adolescents to talk with parents about what is causing hurt or anxiety. To shield you from pain, they may begin to disclose less. If your child is notably stressed invite a close adult or mentor to give them a call to check-in. Finally, if conversations using the model uncover a teen’s feelings of long-term sadness or high levels of anxiety, consider connecting them with a professional counselor.
This model provides a communication tool that can be used to contextualize what well-being means for your teen during this time. It provides a common language that encourages dialogue and honors adolescent voice and expression.
Note: If working with a child who needs easier language for the dimensions, contact the author. The featured model is also available in Spanish.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wrapping Your Brain Around a Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As I write this article, the world feels surreal. We’re not supposed to go outside, and when we do, we cover our mouths and noses and stay away from people. I just heard that we’re not even supposed to pet each other’s dogs anymore (though that advice appears to be an over-reaction (Brulliard, 2020). As these new behavior patterns sink in, television and movies start to look uncomfortable as the characters in them don’t practice physical distancing.
Of the varied effects this pandemic is having on the world, it is also influencing our minds. A recent preprint publication led by psychologist Jay Van Bavel tries to wrap our minds around our minds on the pandemic (van Bavel et Al., 2020).
Certain aspects of pandemics and how we are supposed to behave in them exacerbate some of our systematic irrationalities. Many believe fake news, endorse bogus “cures,” or engage in conspiratorial thinking.
This points to a larger problem: that many of the most important ways we should be thinking about problems like COVID -19 are made more difficult by the fearful state it puts us all in. Even in the best of times, we have a hard time thinking straight about magnitudes (Hsee & Rottensteich, 2004)—numbers, probabilities (Rottenstreich & Hsee, 2001), lengths of time (Peters, Kunreuther, Sgara, Slovic & Schley, 2012), and so on. We are more comfortable thinking in terms of absolutes, particularly when we are stressed out.
These rationality problems can prevent us from acting wisely. Our general levels of well-being are also affected through a variety of emotional issues.
An obvious mental health issue comes from the raw fear of what might happen, causing anxiety (Fleerackers, 2020). Nearly half of people in a recent poll say that the outbreak has had a negative impact on their mental health. So if you’re feeling it, too, you’re far from alone (Achenbach, 2020). The recommended responses to a pandemic have their own negative mental health effects: the two primary behavioral changes asked of people are to wash their hands (which seems to have no drawbacks) and physical distancing from other people. Unfortunately, physical distancing is in direct conflict with our need to connect with other people—a need that is increased during times of stress (Baumeister & Leary, 1995).
Separation from loved ones and feelings of uncertainty that often accompany quarantine and isolation can cause boredom, insomnia, indecisiveness, depression, stress, irritability, poor concentration, frustration, anger, and aggression that lasts even after the quarantine is over. Signs of post-traumatic stress disorder were found to appear even three years later for some hospital workers. One study of parents found that during a disease outbreak, 28% of those quarantined developed trauma-related symptoms, compared to a control group at 6%. But the most common psychological symptoms seem to be low mood and irritability (Brooks et Al., 2020).
The financial problems associated with isolation exacerbate all forms of distress, particularly for those who are already poor. Interestingly, other demographic factors, such as gender or whether one has children, do not seem to have an effect, though pre-existing mental health conditions are understudied. Isolation (Cacioppo, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley & Thisted, 2006) and recessions (Cooper, 2011) can cause depression, and some are predicting a wave of depression problems in the wake of all of this isolation (Kanter & Manbeck, 2020). Some of the best practices for reducing anxiety, such as socializing and exercise (O'Connor, Herring, McDowell & Dishman, 2019), are more difficult when we are trying to stay in our homes.
Being isolated contributes to mental health issues, of course, but also physical health problems related to the heart and immune systems (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010). Our craving for social contact resembles brain patterns found in hunger for food (Tomova, Want, Thompson, Matthews Takahashi, Tye & Saxe, 2020). Many people have tried to compensate with communication mediated with technology: texting, phoning, and voice chat.
Although it might feel like all of these methods give us the benefits of socializing, this feeling is deceptive (Helliwell & Huang, 2013). Text messages and online social networks do not provide the benefits of real social connection, and Facebook can even exacerbate feelings of isolation—it’s the junk food of socializing (Davies, 2015). One study had girls take a stressful test and get reassured by their mothers in one of four ways: in person, on the phone, through texting, or not at all. The in-person and phone reassurance caused stress levels to drop, but the text was as good as nothing (Seltzer, Prososki, Zeigler & Pollak, 2012). Even millennials are making phone calls, an activity they have traditionally avoided (Bindley, 2020).
On the other side of isolation is forced company, sometimes with people you might prefer not to be trapped with. Sometimes this can mean your own children, who, love them as you do, can get on your nerves after a while. One friend of mine told me she now has four jobs: she’s a department chair, a professor, a parent, and a teacher. She and her husband struggle to fit everything into their days. People with children at home face a great deal of stress. But there are darker ways of being trapped with someone: There are reports that the “stay at home” advice is leading to increased domestic violence (Sachedina & Forani, 2020).
Undoubtedly some of this increase is simply because domestic partners are spending more time together—that is, even if the probability of violence per hour of exposure remained the same, now there are simply many more hours, which would increase the violence. However, it is also plausible that the confinement and stir-craziness are fraying nerves and making people more prone to hurt others, bother verbally and physically.
Perceived vulnerability to disease has an unfortunate side effect of increased prejudice toward outgroups (Jackson et Al., 2019) and ethnocentrism in general (Schaller & Neuberg, 2012).
Many people have suggested that being online results in an “echo chamber,” where you only interact with people who share your political views, leading to the exclusion of important information and increased polarization. Available data do not seem to support this, however. People do get exposed to cross-political content online (Bakshy, Messing & Adamic, 2015). And studies of online communities find that one’s political leanings are poor predictors of who they talk to. We often “friend” or follow people online for very flimsy reasons (Minozzi, Song, Lazer, Neblo & Ognyanova, 2020)—perhaps because you had a positive interaction with them in a bowling league—and then you see and comment on each other’s political posts, where you might never have engaged in a conversation about politics with them at the bowling alley (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2017).
What is true is that people tend to click on and follow news sources that they perceive share their values and the views they already have. This bias has long been known (confirmation and congruence biases) and is nothing new to online social networks.
Luckily, countering the xenophobia that infectious disease fear encourages in people are feelings of coming together—we are all in this, and being in a shared experience can make people feel as though we are all in the same group (Davies, 2020). Nobody’s immune to this virus, although poorer people and people of color are at greater risk.
Disagreements about the nature of the pandemic and what to do about it can be exacerbated when issues become politicized. This happened with climate change. Before 2010, people’s views on human-caused climate change could be predicted based on their understanding of science. After 2010, this no longer held, and people’s opinions were better predicted by their politics (Nisbet & Myers, 2007), and climate change deniers had a better understanding of the science than believers (Guber, 2013).
Different responses to infectious disease cause different reactions to the left and the right—issues of personal freedom and accountability, the openness of borders, and so on. Rejections of particular responses based on political ideology can lead to acceptance or rejection of beliefs about the state of the world, just like in climate change. This happened in Italy (Boccato, 2020). More extreme anti-immigrant political movements can be strengthened when pandemics stoke the fires of ethnocentrism.
The words we use to describe our problems suggest what kinds of solutions we endorse, as well as having other effects. Are we experiencing a panic, or a pandemic, or a crisis, or a disaster, or a flu season? In some predominantly white countries, there have been coronavirus-related physical attacks on ethnic Asian people. This is probably exacerbated by characterizations of the virus as the “Chinese virus.”
How can we use what we know of psychology to encourage good behavior during a pandemic?
One thing we might want to do is reduce behaviors that come out of feelings of panic. Popular notions of how people respond to crises suggest that people will resort to panic and looting. In fact, the term “panic” describes so poorly how people react in these situations that psychologists have stopped using the term altogether (Quarantelli, 2001). In fact, in the early stages of disasters, people often come together to help each other, a time of universal brotherhood that is often remembered fondly years later. It is true that selfish purchasing behavior can lead to others not getting what they need—a behavior known as “dysfunctional stockpiling” or “panic buying.”
Unfortunately, these runs on products, some important and others not so much, are exacerbated by the very media provider who report on them (van Bavel et al., 2020). (As such I won’t mention any examples from the COVID-19 pandemic, because doing so makes the problem worse).
In fact, reporting on bad behaviors in general encourages those behaviors because of a well-documented effect of “social proof.” Basically, it says that people will tend to think it’s okay to behave in ways that they perceive everybody else behaving (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). By celebrating and sharing stories of good behavior, rather than focusing on those who break the pandemic rules, we encourage more people to get with the program.
We can also appeal to people’s moral sense. When people feel they are physical distancing because it’s the right thing to do, rather than because they feel they are being forced to do it, distress symptoms seem to be reduced (Brooks, et Al., 2020).
During a terrible time, science suggests that focusing on the good seems a wise approach.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Campaigner Mamo McDonald makes virus recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irish feminist campaigner Mamo McDonald - who is 90 years old - is recovering in a nursing home after having contracted Covid-19.
The lifelong campaigner for women's rights and former President of the Irish Countrywomen’s Association (ICA) contracted Covid-19 but has come through it and is recuperating in St Anne’s Nursing Home in Ballybay, Co Monaghan. 
Speaking to RTÉ’s This Week programme by phone from the nursing home, Ms McDonald said she contracted Covid-19 in March. 
She said: "I am recovering. I came through it and I am feeling a lot better. 
"On the good days I feel great but not just as good on the wet days." 
She was honoured with a People of the Year award in 1999 for her services to Irish women and older people. 
Asked what advice she has for older people as over 70s are cocooning in their homes across Ireland, Ms McDonald said: "Keep their hearts up. And keep singing the songs of their own time. That will help them to weather through it. 
"They have fortitude in abundance and older people will manage. I think it is the young people that I would worry about more. They have got used to so much and there is not going to be so much now for them after this." 
Ms McDonald, who is also a former chairperson of the Age and Opportunity organisation, said her thoughts are with people who are cocooning. 
"Can you imagine people in apartments? With no outside space. Imagine what it must be like for them. People living in the countryside have an advantage, that they will be able to go for a bit of a walk now."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can Eritrea's government survive the coronavirus?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The majority of political leaders across the world responded to the continuing coronavirus pandemic, which has already killed more than 190,000 globally, by calling for increased international cooperation and welcoming any financial, medical and humanitarian aid that is offered to them by foreign entities to help protect their constituents. This is why New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo happily accepted China's proposal to send 1,000 ventilators to his state, and Italy gratefully welcomed hundreds of Cuban doctors who offered their help in the country's fight against COVID-19.
Similarly, when the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's founder Jack Ma offered to send hundreds of ventilators as well as hundreds of thousands of personal protective equipment (PPE) to 54 countries in Africa, most African leaders, such as Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Rwanda's Paul Kagame, swiftly accepted the donation and expressed their gratitude. 
The leaders of Eritrea, a country ranked 182/189 in the United Nations's 2019 Human Development Index, however, surprisingly chose to reject the vital equipment Ma offered to send them. On April 5, the head of Economic Affairs for Eritrea's ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) party, Hagos "Kisha" Gebrehiwet, publicly confirmed that the Eritrean government rejected Ma's donation. Talking as a guest speaker at the bi-weekly Hagerawi Nikhat ("national consciousness") teleconference, an exclusive online seminar in which senior party officials get a chance to communicate with their cadres in the diaspora, the man in charge of Eritrea's economy said the country does not want to become a "dumping site" for "unsolicited donations". Accepting such offers would be against "the principled stance of the Eritrean government which advocates for self-reliance," he added.
Within the very same online seminar, Gebrehiwet explained that the Eritrean leadership is now trying to buy the medical equipment needed to treat COVID-19 cases from the incredibly competitive Chinese market and arrange the shipment of these items to Eritrea on chartered planes.  
Of course, despite its rejection of foreign aid, the Eritrean government does not have the necessary funds to swiftly make such purchases. As a result, it turned to its own long-suffering citizens and launched aggressive fundraising campaigns to make them donate the little money they have to the state to help the efforts to combat the virus. Thanks to these aggressive campaigns, some of Eritrea's most penurious citizens, including members of the national service, have already been coerced to make donations. It is not yet known, however, whether these donations proved sufficient for the country to buy everything it needs to contain the spread of the virus. 
While the Eritrean government undoubtedly hindered the country's ability to respond to this public health emergency by rejecting Ma's generous donation, this was only one example demonstrating its tendency to value its own image and survival more than the wellbeing of its constituents, even during a pandemic.
While Eritrea is one of the most isolated countries in the world, it did not escape the pandemic. The first COVID-19 case in Eritrea was reported on March 21, and, as of April 28, there are 39 confirmed cases in the country, of which 19 have recovered according to the Ministry of Health. The country has been in a nation-wide lockdown to slow the transmission of the virus since April 1. 
The pandemic has not yet reached its peak in Eritrea, but all signs indicate that the country is heading for catastrophe.
Eritrea's healthcare system is not strong enough to handle a deadly and highly infectious disease like COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, the country's healthcare facilities had been suffering from an acute shortage of supplies. At certain times, patients have even been asked to buy intravenous (IV) infusions from private pharmacies before being admitted to hospital. The Eritrean government closed all private clinics in 2009. In the second wave of state seizure that started in June 2019, it also took control of 29 Catholic hospitals, health centres and clinics. Meanwhile, the unfavourable working conditions pushed many Eritrean physicians to flee the country, causing major staff shortages in hospitals.
And lack of quality public healthcare is not the only reason why the coronavirus pandemic is likely to have catastrophic consequences for Eritrea.
Although many countries, including some developed nations, are suffering from a shortage of essential products as a result of the pandemic, the magnitude of the problem is double in the case of Eritrea where import and export businesses have been banned since 2003. 
As, even during normal times, Eritreans can only buy rationed essential supplies that are on sale in the governing party's stores, they could not stockpile to prepare for the lockdown. Moreover, even if the state miraculously managed to secure extra goods to put on sale, Eritreans would not be able to do any extra shopping as they are not allowed to withdraw more than $330 in any given month from their own savings. This, despite Eritrea being a complete cash economy. 
Since the mid-2000s, Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki has been spending most of his time supervising dam constructions. Yet the country's major cities, including the capital, are still suffering from a chronic shortage of running water and electricity. In August 2018, the regime rounded up many water-tank truck owners. Many of them remain in prison. All water bottling companies were closed in June 2019. This makes it impossible for many Eritreans to follow the hygiene protocols necessary to curb the spread of the virus.
If not impossible, the regime has also made it very difficult for Eritreans in diaspora to help their family members back home. Eritrean citizens living abroad are required to pay the so called "diaspora tax" first if they want to send goods to their home country. Wiring money back to Eritrea is also not easy for members of the diaspora, as they are forced to use an extremely deflated fixed currency rate imposed by the government to do so.
Eritreans are also suffering from a lack of political leadership during this difficult time. While the leaders of most countries are doing daily briefings to inform their citizens on the latest developments about the pandemic, President Isaias has not spoken to the Eritrean people or media for almost two months after giving an interview to the state-run media in mid-February, in which he did not even mention the growing threat posed by the new coronavirus. His prolonged absence from public life led to rumours that he is incapacitated or even dead. 
Inside sources told me the president was in the port-city of Massawa during his months of absence from public life, as he reportedly plans to relocate his temporary office to Gedem, near Massawa. Sources close to the matter also told me that it has been very difficult to get hold of him during this time. In an extremely centralised system, where senior state officials cannot make the smallest decision without the president's approval, one can only imagine the damage caused by Afwerki's absence during such a crucial time. 
After his prolonged absence, on April 18, the president suddenly sent a five-minute recorded message to the Eritrean people from an unknown location. Afwerki only mentioned the pandemic in the introduction of his message and went on to tell his constituents that COVID-19 should not "derail the development programmes" his leadership has embarked on. The president's message made it clear that the pandemic is just a secondary concern for the government. The Ministry of Information, however, only translated into English the short section of the message where the president mentioned the pandemic.
As it became clear that Eritrea is not going to be able to protect its citizens from COVID-19, rights groups, exiled scholars, and the UN's Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in Eritrea, have called on the Eritrean government to release the tens of thousands of prisoners of conscience who have long been languishing in overcrowded and unsanitary prisons. Many also expressed concern about the thousands of students who are living in cramped conditions at the Sawa military training centre. 
During his online seminar, Gebrehiwet also responded to these calls, brushing them off as "hypocritical". Rather than offering an explanation as to how they are planning to stop the virus from spreading like wildfire in prisons and military schools, he claimed these would be the best places for anyone who needs to be in quarantine. 
In response to the growing criticism of its COVID-19 response and concerns over the wellbeing of its citizens, the Eritrean government issued a statement on April 6, accusing the UNHRC of "harassment" and claiming that the state's "enemies" are using the pandemic to push for regime change. 
While the accusation that rights groups, media organisations and the UN itself are using the pandemic to push for regime change in Eritrea is clearly unfounded, there is a very real chance that this public health emergency is going to spell trouble for Eritrea's authoritarian government. 
History shows that public health crises such as pandemics, food shortages or extreme pollution harm all governments, but pose the most significant threat to authoritarian regimes. The 1973-1975 Ethiopian famine, for example, was the final trigger that ended Emperor Haile Selassie's reign in the country. In Sudan, it was Omar al-Bashir's repeated failure to handle such crises, such as the cholera outbreak of 2017 and the spike in the price of bread in 2018, that led to the demise of his 30-year regime.
The Eritrean government demonstrably failed to respond efficiently to the most significant public health threat the world has faced in a century. If it does not change its ways, accept the global community's help and take action to save the lives of already-suffering Eritreans, it is unlikely to survive past this pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The impact of coronavirus could compare to the Great Depression</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus crisis will be the biggest financial crisis of our generation, much larger than the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.
It is very likely that the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis will be comparable with the Great Depression, the period of devastating economic decline between 1929 and 1939, which saw mass unemployment, factory closures and the accompanying personal trauma.
The coronavirus outbreak will bring an economic depression - that is, a severe and prolonged economic decline with high levels of unemployment and company closures.
Record numbers of people will likely suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the combination of stress, anxiety and depression that develops in some people who have experienced a traumatic event.
The coronavirus outbreak is already such an event. More than three million people around the world have been infected by the virus and more than 200,000 have died of it. Estimates show that the coronavirus may kill 100,000 Americans, the equivalent to double the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam War.
By comparison, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 infected 500 million people, or one-third of the world's population, with 50 million deaths, of which 675,000 occurred in the US. The world's population in 1918-1919 was estimated at 1.5 billion. If one translates this to today's figures, with a world population of 7.8 billion, it would be the equivalent of 2.6 billion people infected and 250 million deaths.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN's trade and development agency, says the slowdown in the global economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak is likely to cost at least $1 trillion in 2020 alone, in terms of reduced growth measured in gross domestic product (GDP). 
Over time, the cost to the global economy is likely to be three or four times that figure.
As a comparison, it is estimated that the 2007-2009 global financial crisis cost the US around $4.6 trillion in terms of lost growth in GDP, or 15 percent of its GDP compared to the years before the financial crisis. 
During the Great Depression, unemployment in many countries hovered around 25 percent, with one in four people in industrial countries made jobless by it. In the US, nearly half of the banks collapsed, 20,000 companies went bankrupt and 23,000 people committed suicide.
The current pandemic will cause individual economies to plunge into recession; businesses will close down and jobs will be lost at similar levels to that of the Great Depression. Moreover, the pandemic is impacting both industrial and developing countries; whereas the Great Depression was largely concentrated in industrial countries.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) has predicted that the pandemic will wipe out 6.7 percent of working hours in the second quarter of this year - the equivalent of 195 million full-time workers. 
This is already playing out. In the US, more than 22 million people filed claims for jobless benefits in the four weeks ending April 11, according to the US Department of Labour. To put these latest numbers into context, in 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, 2.6 million people in the US filed for unemployment in that year, making 2008 the year with the biggest employment loss since 1945. 
Suicides, domestic violence and murders increase during times of economic hardship and this may be further exacerbated by lockdowns and self-isolation.
Wealthier countries such as Germany, the UK and the US have rolled out large aid programmes - larger than those which appeared in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis - to support businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed for loss of income during the lockdown. Germany will give unlimited loans to large companies, pay 60 percent of salaries of troubled companies to allow them to reduce the working hours of employees without having to lay them off and financial support to the self-employed.
The US has unveiled a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package for struggling companies and employees, which includes loans, equity stakes for government in businesses in strategic sectors and direct cash payments to individuals.
While these bailouts might provide interim relief, they will plunge countries, companies and families into debt for years, while we will also have to deal with the social crises of deaths, suicides and mental disintegration for a long time after the coronavirus pandemic. 
After the Great Depression there was a rise in nationalism around the world - as a direct result of the financial, social and emotional hardships of the depression - creating the conditions that eventually led to the second world war. 
There has been a similar rise in nationalism, populism and xenophobia during the coronavirus outbreak. Of course, this had been growing for many years before the pandemic, in part as a result of austerity measures that caused financial hardship in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The coronavirus crisis will likely make those austerity measures worse.
Although there have been pockets of solidarity in response to the coronavirus - Cuba sending medical personnel to Italy and China sending medical equipment to Poland, for example - some countries have stopped vital medicines, equipment and food from being exported to other countries. 
Once the crisis has passed, some countries may continue turning themselves into fortresses, excluding outsiders, whether immigrants, refugees or foreign companies.
Nationalist, populist and extremist leaders and governments could ride the wave of post-coronavirus financial and emotional hardships, in the same way they did after the Great Depression. There is a real danger that the hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic will lead to authoritarian governments coming to power in many countries, while those already in power become more entrenched.
If they do, the methods used to prevent the virus from spreading: sealing off borders, tracking infected individuals using surveillance technology and restricting people's movements, could be used for more menacing purposes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why more Nigerians risk COVID-19 infection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Coronavirus, arguably, is the world’s most dreadful disease of the past few decades. Like the Human Immuno Virus, HIV; COVID-19 has in the past few weeks, driven a wedge of panic into the psyche of men and women across the world.
Since an unnamed Italian first tested positive to the virus in Nigeria on February, 27, 2020; the total number of persons infected has grown to an astronomical 1,728 (as at the time of filing this report), 307 discharged cases with 51 confirmed deaths across the country.
As rightly admitted a few weeks ago by Health Minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire that Nigeria was not prepared for the pandemic, the past few weeks revealed the sorry state of awareness or stark disregard for same by many Nigerians who continued to flout government’s directive to observe social distancing, work from home amongst sundry preventive measures.
In Abuja, the nation’s capital, things are probably worse as they are in rural dwellings. That may sound a bit hyperbolic but how does one explain the mad crowd in Kurudu, Nyanya and Karshi markets where sellers and buyers transact businesses as usual as if no one is aware of the deadly blows of coronavirus?
Penultimate Thursday, a Pickup Van stationed a few metres away from the Karu Market entry gate attracted a sea of heads who formed a semi-circular ring around the owner, to buy crates of eggs. Apart from the seller, a light-skin young man in his mid 30s, none of the buyers wore a face mask. They pushed and shoved, in flagrant breach of the social distancing campaign, as they rushed to identify which crate had the biggest eggs.
Same day, this reporter drove down to the second gate of the Military Barracks, Kurudu, settlement of the Abuja Municipal Area Council, where two Monetary Deposit Banks, Eco Bank and Union Bank for Africa, UBA, have their Automated Teller Machines, ATMs. At Eco Bank, a mammoth crowd of the young and old, each struggling to make a withdrawal, attracted the attention of yours truly, who promptly responded to the stimulus by moving some inches closer to see things for himself. One of the bank’s customers who identified herself simply as Sandra told Saturday Vanguard that there was a sense of order initially until the queue earlier formed was discarded due to what she attributed to the impatience of a lady who saw herself as a god because “she drove here in a big car.”
According to Sandra, “We kept a straight line even though I complained that we were not adhering to the social distancing campaign. We were making withdrawals and there was no problem until a Ford Explorer packed beside us and the driver, a middle-aged woman went straight ahead of everybody to make a withdrawal. We carefully explained to her to join the queue but she ignored us and said she had no time to waste. Those who patiently lined up abandoned the queue and that is why you are seeing this commotion now.” Needless to add, getting a chance to transact business became a survival of the fittest and those without the strength to compete, left to explore other avenues.
There are reports of people caring less about the measures to curtail the spread of the disease. Certainly, the awareness campaign appears inadequate.
Serial violators of the work-from-home directive of government are likely to make the quest to defeat COVID-19 pretty difficult. Apart from city centres like Wuse, Garki, Gwarimpa, Asokoro, Maitama and a few others; satellite town of Abuja are bubbling as ever.
Tricycle (Keke) riders, commercial drivers
Aware people are flouting the stay-at-home order of government, tricycles riders and taxi drivers continue to do business as usual. With four passengers at the back seat and two in front, taxi drivers plying the Nyanya/Jikwoyi/Kurudu/Orozo/Karshi axis are literally aiding possible spread of the disease we are all trying to run away from. It’s the same for keke riders who in addition to stubbornly carrying three passengers behind sometimes convey two others in front, one either side of the rider in total disregard to the social distancing campaign of government, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC and the World Health Organization, WHO.
If this trend is left unchecked, chances are that communal infection would be on the rise, particularly now that government has chosen to relax the lockdown earlier declared in Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, with effect from Monday, May 4th, 2020.
Nigeria and Africa
For those who still bask in the euphoria of the country’s description as the “Giant of Africa,” the poor handling of the coronavirus awareness campaign coupled with the shoddy state of the health sector could probably make them to do a rethink today. In spite of billions of dollars earned from crude oil sale in several decades; the nation’s health sector is as bad as its education counterpart. This much was confirmed by no less a person than Secretary to the Government of the Federation and chairman, Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, who was recently quoted as saying that he never knew that the nation’s health sector was such in a mess until his appointment to lead government’s charge at curtailing and containing the virus a few weeks ago.
In the continent where Nigeria often claimed to be a giant over every other nation; two smaller countries are attracting global attention to their respective anti-COVID-19 campaigns. Madagascar, the East African country with a population of 26.3 million people (2018 estimate) gained independence, like Nigeria, in 1960. As at the time of filing this report, the country had 128 confirmed cases of the coronavirus with 71 recoveries and no death.
The story of Madagascar has become a continental pride so much that even the federal government appears to be flirting with the idea of importing herbs (can you beat that?) from the East African nation to augment present effort aimed at battling the spread of coronavirus.
Briefing health correspondents earlier in the week, Boss Mustapha said: “I want to assure you that whatever is happening in the world, we are mindful of it and we are keeping tab.
“I was reading of the experiences in Madagascar– of why everybody is drinking some solutions that have been prepared. This morning I was sharing with my wife, and I told her that probably I would request that Mr. President allow us import a plane load for a trial because we are all navigating an uncharted cause. Nobody has ever been on this road. So, every attempt to find solution that would bring succour to our people, be rest assure that this task force is very responsible and we would do everything to ensure that we get what will benefit our people, what will help them in the processes that we find ourselves today.”
Like Madagascar, the West African country of Senegal has attracted positive headlines owing to her effort at taming the ugly COVID-19. With 823 confirmed cases, out of which 296 have recovered and nine patients dead, the country has shown impressive effort in curtailing the pandemic, much to the admiration of the world. Dr. Abdoulaye Buosso, Director of Health Emergency Operation Centre of Senegal on Tuesday attributed the country’s story to a system that works, saying, “Senegal has very few severe cases and is taking care of its patients swiftly: test results are available within 24 hours, all patients who test positive are systematically hospitalized, whether they have symptoms or not, and their contacts are quarantined.”
For Nigeria to successfully wage this war against a virus aiming to kill the rich and the poor, old and young, educated and illiterate; she must intensify effort at enforcement of established rules including compulsory wearing of face masks at least in public.
Anything short of this is an invitation extended to the virus, which will be more than willing to strike deadly as it has done in the United States of America and the United Kingdom where 57, 000 and 21, 678 have died respectively from complications related to COVID-19. Testing centres should be replicated across the land and like in Senegal, contacts of confirmed cases should immediately be hospitalized.

The experimental drug remdesivir has been authorized by US regulators for emergency use against COVID-19, President Donald Trump announced Friday.
It comes after the antiviral made by Gilead Sciences was shown in a major clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some coronavirus patients, the first time any medicine has had a proven benefit against the disease.
“It is really a really promising situation,” Trump said at the White House, where he was joined by Gilead’s CEO Daniel O’Day.
“We are humbled with this first step for hospitalized patients,” said O’Day, adding: “We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of these patients getting the medicine.”
The company has previously announced it was donating some 1.5 million doses for free.
This amounts to about 140,000 treatment courses based on a 10-day treatment duration.
Remdesivir, which is administered by an injection, was already available to some patients who enrolled in clinical trials, or who sought it out on a “compassionate use” basis.
The new move allows it to be distributed far more widely and used in both adults and children who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19.
The Food and Drug Administration, which authorized the approval, defines severe as having low blood oxygen levels, requiring oxygen therapy, or being on a ventilator.
The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced the results of a trial involving more than 1,000 people on Wednesday.
It found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress got better quicker than those on a placebo.
Specifically, patients on the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery.
“Although the results were clearly positive from a statistically significant standpoint, they were modest,” Anthony Fauci, the scientist who leads the NIAID told NBC News on Thursday.
While not considered a miracle cure, remdesivir’s trial achieved a “proof of concept,” according to Fauci that could pave the way for better treatments.
Remdesivir incorporates itself into the virus’s genome, short circuiting its replication process.
It was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever, but did not boost survival rates as other medicines.

When you lose your car keys and then go upstairs only to forget why it’s easy to fear your memory is fading. But instead of being a cause for concern, it seems these ‘senior moments’ should be welcomed.
It is when you begin to stop noticing your memory lapses that you should actually start worrying, according to scientists.
A study found people tend to become oblivious to memory problems two or three years before the onset of dementia.
Researcher Robert Wilson, of Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, said: “Our findings suggest unawareness of one’s memory problems is an inevitable feature of late-life dementia, driven by a build-up of dementia-related changes in the brain.’
The study tracked the mental sharpness of more than 2,000 adults for more than a decade. The men and women had an average age of 76 at the start of the study and showed no signs of memory problems.
They underwent annual tests of memory and thinking and were asked how often they had trouble remembering things and how they rated their memory. Some 239 participants developed dementia during the study.
Initially, their judgment of how good their memory was proved accurate, but it started to drop sharply an average of 2.6 years before they developed clear dementia symptoms.
Dr. Wilson said: ‘Although there were individual differences in when the unawareness started and how fast it progressed, virtually everyone had a lack of awareness of their memory problems at some point in the disease’.
Brain examinations of participants who died during the study revealed three dementia-related changes associated with the rapid decline of memory awareness, the journal Neurology reported.
Dr. Laura Phipps of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: The findings highlight the importance of testimony from relatives and close friends at the point of diagnosis to help doctors to gain a clearer picture of someone’s memory problems’.
But she added: This study only focused on memory changes and it will also be important to track other early signs of dementia’.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
AGAINST the backdrop of claims that cure for coronavirus has been discovered in the country, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC, said it was yet to give permission for use of any vaccine to treat the disease. If there was any potent vaccine to the disease, the agency said it was the only constitutionally recognized institution to approve it. To this end, it called on Nigerians to stop making claims that it noted, were not true.
NAFDAC,in a statement Saturday, by its Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, insisted that it had not given approval for any vaccine for the treatment and cure of the dreaded disease. According to NAFDAC,“To put the record straight, no drugs or vaccines have been given approval in the country for the cure of COVID-19.” “NAFDAC is the only authority in the country to grant approval to such drugs and vaccines,” the statement said even as it assured that it would continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to safeguard the health of Nigerians. The agency added that it would inform the public whenever it grants approval for any drug or vaccine for the cure of COVID-19. The statement tasked the public to adhere to measures issued by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Vanguard Kindly Share This Story:

Republic of Congo will take delivery of a Malagasy ‘cure’ for the virus, COVID-Organics, information minister Thierry Moungalla confirmed on Twitter.
According to him, the decision to turn to the Malagasy mixture was reached after a three-way teleconference between presidents of the two countries as well as the President of Guinea-Bissau.
COVID-Organics although not scientifically proven as a preventive or curative mixture for the virus is gaining grounds on the continent as presidents congratulate their Malagasy counterpart, Andry Rajoelina, for the initiative.
Equatorial Guinea this week sent a special flight to take delivery of tonnes of the cure. It is yet to be ascertained whether Congo like Equatorial Guinea will be receiving the consignment as a donation by the Malagasy government.
The World Health Organization confirms that treatment trials are underway across five African countries but did not mention the now ‘controversial’ Malagasy ‘cure.’
The Republic of Congo’s case count (as of May 2) stood at 229 confirmed cases, including nine deaths and 25 recoveries. Government has extended a national lockdown by two weeks to contain spread of the virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: how it hit African athletes’ finances</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
The last two months were supposed to be big for athletics as the season started in earnest ahead of an Olympic Games in July but instead, a host of events have – as in other sports – been either postponed or cancelled.
The first half of the year should have seen the World Indoor and World Half Marathon championships take place in March, and the start of series like the World Marathon Majors, Diamond League and Continental Tour.
The African Athletics Championships slated for June have been moved to 2021 – so with no competition at all, how on earth are athletes coping financially?
“Every athlete is feeling the consequences,” says Burkina Faso’s Hugues Fabrice Zango, who won triple jump bronze at the 2019 World Athletics Championships.
“I know of some African athletes who don’t have sponsors and who usually travel to Europe to compete and get some money. With competitions cancelled, this is going to harm them because they won’t have this income to help them prepare for next year.
“So some athletes will be in a very difficult position.”
Athletes’ training schedules have been hugely disrupted in the last few weeks, and countries like Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa have closed training camps.
Iten is a world famous training base in Kenya thanks to its high altitude and star array of talent, but even this usually-bustling hub is suffering.
“Iten is now weird and boring,” says Dennis Kipngeno, a Kenyan marathon runner who ran his personal best only last month. “Motivation is low to leave the house and run alone. As they say, teamwork makes the dream work.”
Maintaining focus when return dates for competition are so unclear is also a new challenge.
“Being an athlete is all we know, all we do – it is our life,” says Nigerian Blessing Okagbare. “So when things like this happen, it is like a shock. Not knowing what is going to happen is the hardest part in this whole situation for me.”
How do athletes make money?
Runners earn income in three main ways: through sponsors, prize money and/or bonuses from races (dependent on placing and speed), and appearance fees.
“If you don’t run races, there is no chance for bonuses, appearance fees, prize money,” explains Michel Boeting, a Dutch athletics agent who represents several African athletes.
“That will be a big burden for many athletes and their families who depend on them.”
The postponed Olympics means that potential medallists will miss out on significant sums this year, just as they will given the World Indoor and Half Marathon championships’ delay.
“Depending on their level, this can represent two-thirds or even much more (of their income) because you also have the competition’s engagement bonus,” says  Zango “So for sure it’s going to have a financial impact.”
Already mindful that athletics is not as lucrative as some sports, Okagbare points out that her income is reduced when she is unable to compete, in contrast to the incomes of sports people on annual contracts.
“When it comes to athletics, compared to other sports, we are broke,” she says. “Football is very glamorous, and the players make a lot of money. For what I do for a living, I can’t sit on the bench and be paid money – but a footballer can.
“If I want to make money, I have to show up and compete. There are some competitions where if you false start, you don’t get your appearance fee, or you get half if you don’t finish the race.”
Track and field
The track season was supposed to start on 17 April with the Diamond League in Qatar but that, like all but one of the first eight meets, has been indefinitely postponed.
“I have lost over US$20,000 which I was assured of in appearance fees,” laments Botswana’s Nijel Amos, who won silver at the 2012 Olympics.
The 800m star, who crashed out of Rio 2016 in the heats, had been careful about his schedule in a bid to peak at the Tokyo Games, which should have started in three months.
“This year I was saying to myself: ‘Ok Nijel, you’re only picking key races so that you can be fresh at the Olympics’,” he explains.
“I was going to race few races, from which I was going to make good quality financials to be able to sustain me the whole year. But now it’s zero.”
Many athletes are now thinking of two main things – their outstanding Olympic qualification and how to survive financially.
Egypt’s Hassan Abd El Gawad, who won bronze at the last African Athletics Championships, had been training in South Africa ahead of May’s Continental Tour event in Kenya (now postponed) but is now back home.
Organised by World Athletics, the Continental Tour is a second-tier version of the Diamond League where the winner of a core event like the hammer is guaranteed $6,000, with the prize money sliding down to $800 for whoever finishes eighth.
“There are many competitions you can go and win, and when you win you get money, but those competitions are now all cancelled until June,” he says.
“I am surviving because I get a monthly salary of $124 from the Egyptian federation while the club I represent, Al Ahly, give me $622 per month. But this season was important to qualify for the Olympics, not to make money.”
Road racing
Berlin, Boston, London and Paris are some of the major road races that have been postponed to the second half of 2020, while others, such as Rome, have effectively been cancelled this year.
So any athlete who might have run up to four marathons per annum will probably only run one, at best.
“A sub-2:08 marathoner runs up to three marathons a year and a sub-2:13 up to four marathons a year,” says Kipngeno, who had previously planned to compete in four marathons this year. “The faster the marathon, the more recovery you need.”
“Consistent racing means improved times personally and of course more opportunities financially. I was to compete in Grandma’s Marathon in Minnesota on 24 June and then Medtronic twin cities in Minnesota in October, but Grandma’s has been cancelled. No word yet on Medtronic.”
Marathon runners can earn as little as $1,000 a race in prize money all the way up to $100,000 and more depending on race status and final position.
World Marathon Majors races – which encompass Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York and Tokyo – have better appearance fees for a select group of athletes and better prize money too.
At London, for example, elite athletes compete for a total of $313,000 in prize money with the male and female champions each taking home $55,000.
The top 12 finishers are rewarded, with the 12th person taking home $1,000, while there is additional pay for faster times, which can be related to a shoe contract and/or breaking the world or course record.
Nonetheless, the fact that many races will be bunched closer together in the calendar means athletes will inevitably miss some of the marathons, or half marathons and 10k races, which they had once aimed to contest.
“It is going to be a disaster for the athletes,” says Boeting. “Half of the year for road race athletes is already gone with all the races cancelled. This means that athletes without contracts will go to an income of zero for the first six-seven months of the year, and those with contracts will lose 40-70% of their income.”
Amidst all the uncertainty about when races might resume, it is not only the athletes who are suffering but their agents too.
“Agents depend on commission and if income from competitions is zero, it will definitely hurt our business,” he says. “We have to make adjustments, and maybe work with 50% less income than normal.”
Shoe contracts
With no events to contest, some athletes can fall back on their shoe contracts, which range from $5,000 per year for smaller deals to $100,000 plus for bigger ones.
“The ones with small contracts will struggle because if you have a contract of $5,000, is that really enough to sustain the lifestyle you’ve put yourself in?” asks Boeting.
But for some, a shoe deal means there is at least one less thing to worry about.
“During this pandemic, I don’t have to worry about how much to spend buying or replacing running shoes or on getting the right clothes for the training weather – that’s where the contract comes in handy,” Amos explains.
Nonetheless, he freely admits that he is turning to savings and investments to cover this period which highlights how life might be for those without shoe contracts.
What does the future look like?
Boeting says athletics should plan for a very bad 2020 and perhaps 2021 too.
“Who knows what will happen? What will sponsors do? Will they stay in the sport with less money? Let’s hope they will stay, even if with less money, and build again.”
Some federations have tried to cushion their athletes from this financial crisis, such as Ethiopia’s which has given $130,000 to help 211 athletes and 56 coaches.
Meanwhile, World Athletics (formerly known as the IAAF) has launched a fund worth US$500,000 to support professional athletes who have lost most of their income in recent weeks.
“It’s a struggling time for us athletes just to keep our career going, let alone trying to get to the next phase of anything,” says Amos.
“Are organisations going to keep funding us as if we’re getting ready for the Games or are they going to pause that funding until next year? And if they pause that funding, how much damage is that for us? You know, it’s a really tough time being an athlete right now.”

South Korean health officials said recovered coronavirus patients who later tested positive again only did so because “dead” virus particles remained in their bodies — not because they became reinfected.
A total of 292 people in the country who were cleared of the deadly bug later tested positive for COVID-19 again — a phenomenon that initially puzzled officials, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, according to a report in Newsweek.
But they’ve now determined that residual fragments of the virus are likely responsible.
“RNA fragments still can exist in a cell even if the virus is inactivated,” said Oh Myoung-don, who heads the KCDC’s clinical committee for emerging disease control, Newsweek said.
“It is more likely that those who tested positive again picked up virus RNA that has already been inactivated.”
Still, there are some concerns about South Korea’s positive retests as the number of second-time diagnoses has steadily risen. Two weeks ago, repeat diagnoses accounted for about 2 percent of the country’s recovered patients. By Wednesday, the number had risen to 2.7 percent, and 3.4 percent among children.
Preliminary tests released by the KCDC on April 17 determined that those patients re-tested positive an average of 13.5 days after being cleared and discharged from isolation — although the time spanned as long as 35 days, the report said.
Scientists studied 137 of the initial cases and reported that 61 of the patients showed mild symptoms, 72 were asymptomatic and four others were still being studied.
However, health officials said there was no indication yet that those patients had spread the virus to others.
“Contact tracing on these re-positive cases is also underway to identify the possibility of secondary infection,” the center said in an April 26 report. “No new case has yet been confirmed that resulted from exposure to the re-positive cases. The contracts are still under monitoring.”
As of Thursday morning, South Korea had 10,765 reported cases of COVID-19, with 247 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">China lied to world about coronavirus and hurt vaccine efforts, leaked dossier claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bombshell leaked security documents claim that China deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence about the coronavirus outbreak and hampered efforts to develop a vaccine.
The report - produced by the Five Eyes security alliance -accuses China of silencing doctors who spoke out, blocking news reports about the disease and denying it could spread between humans for weeks, despite knowing this was untrue.
This caused the “endangerment of other countries”, and sets out the case against the Chinese government, according to reports in Australia.
The 15-page dossier, by intelligence bosses from the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, was leaked to the Saturday Telegraph, raising grave concerns about research into deadly pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

It also alleges that China continued to deny reports about the killer bug for weeks, giving it time to spread around the world.
Intelligence services reportedly believe evidence of the virus was destroyed in labs and requests to provide live samples to international scientists working on a vaccine were refused.
And the newspaper reports that the Australian government funded a team of Chinese scientists at a lab where deadly coronaviruses were genetically modified - even though they could be transmitted from bats to humans.
China has consistently denied that Covid-19 originated in a lab - a claim voiced again this week by US President Donald Trump.
Intelligence officials are said to be divided over whether the disease came from a laboratory or a wet market in the city of Wuhan.
But the World Health Organisation has said scientists examining its genetic sequences have ruled that "this virus is natural in origin".
Even after the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese government locked down the city while telling the rest of the world such measures were not necessary, it is claimed.
The report claimed "millions" of people left the city before it went into lockdown, spreading the killer disease around the world.
"Throughout February, Beijing presses the US, Italy, India, Australia, Southeast Asian neighbors and others not to protect themselves via travel restrictions, even as the PRC imposes severe restrictions at home," the dossier reportedly states. 
The dossier claimed there was a “deadly denial of human-to-human transmission”, which has cost tens of thousands of lives, while doctors and scientists who spoke out were "silenced".
It is also alleged that China "bleached" wildlife market stalls and refused to provide live samples that could help find a cure.
Intelligence agencies are investigating whether the virus could have accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan - with several studies led by scientist Shi Zhengli said to be the source of concern.
A partnership between Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Wuhan Institute of Virology included research into deadly pathogens in live bats, it is claimed.
The report says China had "evidence of human-human transmission from early December", but denied it could be spread this way until January 20.
The dossier reportedly states: "Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January 20."
And it continued: "The World Health Organisation does the same.
"Yet officials in Taiwan raised concerns as early as December 31, as did experts in Hong Kong on January 4."
Researcher Huang Yan Ling, businessman Fang Bin, lawyer Chen Qiushi and journalist Li Zehua are among those who mysteriously disappeared as the pandemic spread.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus 'more likely' to claim lives of people with vitamin D deficiency</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">People with vitamin D deficiency could be more likely to die from coronavirus, a study has suggested.
As the UK continues following strict lockdown measures – which include restrictions on time outdoors – research has shown that a vitamin usually procured from natural sunlight could help boost Covid-19 survival rates.
In the study, scientists from Queen Elizabeth Hospital Foundation Trust and the University of East Anglia write: “We believe, that we can advise Vitamin D supplementation to protect against SARS-CoV2 infection.”
The paper, published on Research Square, states that vitamin D levels are found to be severely low in the ageing population, especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland.
This is also the group most vulnerable for Covid-19.
It reads: "Severe deficiency is defined as a serum 25(OH)D lower than 30nmol/L. In Switzerland, mean vitamin D levels are 23(nmol/L) in nursing homes and in Italy 76% of women over 70 years of age have been found to have circulating levels below 30nmol/L.
"These are countries with high number of cases of COVID–19 and the aging people is the group with the highest risk for morbidity and mortality with SARS-Cov2.
"The research has not yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists and only offers up tentative evidence at this point."
The authors of the paper also acknowledge: “The number of cases/country is affected by the number of tests performed.”
Currently the NHS website recommends people consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day.
It adds: “This is because you may not be getting enough vitamin D from sunlight if you’re indoors most of the day.”
But while the NHS acknowledges emerging reports of vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus, it states that currently there is no evidence that this is the case.
It also warns people to refrain from buying more vitamin D than they need.
Last week, Dr Rachel Neale said that 10 minutes of sunshine a day could trigger the production of Vitamin D and potentially help reduce the risk of coronavirus, as she has found it does with other respiratory infections.
Dr Neale, a researcher at Brisbane’s QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, says it would "make sense" if having low levels of vitamin D left people more vulnerable to worse symptoms of coronavirus.
However, she added that research was needed to confirm whether or not this is the case.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madonna has revealed that she tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in her latest 'Quarantine Diary'.
Following her results, the 61-year-old singer hoped to take a long drive over the weekend and wanted to 'breathe in the COVID-19 air'.
The presence of antibodies means that a person is likely to have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the past.
The legendary musician's latest revelation came in the form of a moody black and white video that she shared on her social media page.
In the two-minute long edited clip, Madonna sat behind a typewriter for the 14th installment of her quarantine memoirs.
As she tapped on the type writer in front of her, Madonna read out her diary news and calmly revealed to fans that she possessed antibodies against the virus.
“Took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies,” she said.
“So tomorrow, I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car… and I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yep. I hope the sun is shining.”
Throughout the video she also made a number of other remarks regarding COVID-19 as she mused over the deadly virus.
In one line she said: "I have been in quarantine because I know the futility of it."
Later, Madonna shared different thoughts: “It amazes me that we care so much about what people think or winning people’s favor or being right in an argument.”
Ever since the start of the pandemic, Madonna has been documenting her lockdown with a series of unusual diary videos on her social media.
In an earlier post from the start of April, the singer tragically revealed that three people close to her all passed away within the space of 24 hours.
The Material Girl was also forced to cancel her Madame X in Paris tour because of the deadly virus.
The Queen of Pop has been holed up at home with her toyboy lover Ahlamalik Williams, 26, as well as her children, twins Estere and Stella, seven, Mercy James, 13, David Banda, 14 and Rocco, 19.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), officials are unsure whether possessing the coronavirus antibodies make a person immune to future infection.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus peak in care homes 'could be months away', charity warns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus could still be months away from peaking in UK care homes, a charity boss has warned.
Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, said that a second wave of infections and deaths would represent a failure from health agencies to support social care.
He said there is still "no parity whatsoever" between the NHS and social care, with discrepancies evident on every level.
While access to testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) is improving, money given to local authorities is not getting through to the front line despite providers' hugely increased costs, he warned.
And Prof Green said another problem has been the lack of real-time data on care home deaths, with the Government only starting to publish daily updates in the sixth week of lockdown.
The Care England boss, who leads the largest representative body for independent providers of adult social care, warned that the country could face a second wave if authorities do not support the sector properly.
Asked how far behind the peak in hospital deaths the care sector is, he said: "We are a long way behind, because despite what the Health Secretary says about us being always regarded as a priority, well clearly we weren't.
"At the start of this pandemic, the only narrative was 'protect the NHS'. And what that manifested itself in - we had PPE supplies disrupted, we had primary care completely withdrawing from care homes."
From the beginning of the outbreak, the Government should have had plans to ensure the NHS could support residents inside care homes, he said.
Some of the spare beds in Nightingale hospitals could have been turned into mobile units to bring intensive care directly into care homes, he added.
He continued: "Clearly we weren't at the centre of this pandemic.
"So I just think the government needs to understand that, if they knew in January we were the high-risk area, and it's quite clear from the very start of this that people with long-term and underlying health conditions were the most vulnerable, where every single person in a care home falls into that category, why wasn't the response quicker?"
Estimating a time-scale for the care home peak, he said: "I think it will probably, hopefully, be weeks, but it could potentially be months."
But he said NHS England and Public Health England will be held accountable if a second peak emerges.
Responding to reports that NHS England director Professor Keith Willett told NHS chiefs that care homes will be the "epicentres of transmission" for coronavirus spreading back into society, he said: "Care homes are in this situation because of failures of NHS England and PHE and actually, if there is a second wave, it will be a continuation of their failure that produces it."
Prof Green also said "dangerous bureaucracy" is preventing people from responding quickly to the pandemic.
He said he is aware of elements of "defensive decision-making" from Government officials, for fear of repercussions in any future public inquiry.
He said: "What we have got to do in future, we need a root and branch reform of the culture of Government, they need to have cultures that are quick to make decisions, and systems that enable them to implement the decisions immediately."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant Asian 'murder hornets' that kill dozens of people a year spread to the West</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Giant Asian 'murder hornets' which kill dozens of people every year are invading western parts of the world.
The large insects, which are native to tropical climates, have been spotted several times in the US.
The sightings started in November 2019 along the west coast, but it is unclear who they got there.
More than double the size of honeybees, Asian giant hornets have a wingspan measuring more than three inches.
They have a large stinger that contains deadly venom neurotoxin, which can cause cardiac arrest and anaphylactic shock.
Conrad Bérubé, a beekeeper and entomologist, was sent to destroy a hive on Vancouver Island, but was stung several times by one.
He told the New York Times : "It was like having red-hot thumbtacks being driven into my flesh." He added he was left bleeding after being stung.
He still managed to destroy the nest, but he said he suffered from leg pains as if he had the flu.
Despite the deadly threat to humans, entomologists are more concerned that the 'murder hornets' will kill bee populations in the US.
Last month, experts warned an invasion of large hornets in the UK, which could cost £7.6m in research alone.
It will cost the country  millions to get rid  of the potentially deadly two-inch insects and have a devastating impact on the already-dwindling bee population.
Asian hornets were accidentally introduced to France from China in 2004 and they have been spreading rapidly throughout Europe ever since.
Experts estimate the Asian hornet colonised most of France at a rate of 60 to 80 kilometres per year.
And the species has swiftly been invading other countries including Spain in 2010, Portugal and Belgium in 2011, Italy in 2012 and Germany in 2014.
The first invasive hornets made it to the UK in 2016.
Now French scientists have evaluated the estimated cost of the invasion to Europe.
Professor Franck Courchamp said: "In 2006, only two years after the hornet was first observed in France, three departments were already invaded and the cost of nest destruction was estimated at 408,000 euros.
"Since then, the estimated yearly costs have been increasing by about 450,000 euros each year, as the hornet keeps spreading and invades new departments.
“Definitely more actions need to be taken in order to handle harmful invasive species - one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."
Nicola Spence, Chief Plant Health Officer, said: “By ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swift and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets.
“While the Asian hornet poses no greater risk to human health than a bee, we recognise the damage they can cause to honey bee colonies and other beneficial insects.
"Please continue to look out for any Asian hornets and if you think you’ve spotted one, report your sighting through the Asian hornet app or online.”
They analysed the negative impact on ecosystems and the global decline in pollination and honey production.
Attempts to control the invasion concentrate on destroying hornet nests and bait trapping.
But experts say these methods are not enough to completely eradicate the species.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK's largest bird of prey returns to English skies for first time in 240 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">White-tailed eagles disappeared from ­English skies in 1780, but held on in Scotland until 1916.
Now these birds, which spend hours perched on a lookout before soaring to high altitudes, have made a comeback of late.
Also known as the fish eagle, they are the UK’s largest bird of prey with a wingspan of up to 2.5 metres.
They became extinct here early in the 20th century due to illegal killing.
But thanks to Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation, who are leading a project to reintroduce them, releasing a group on the Isle of Wight last year, they may become a more frequent sighting in the skies near you.
They are currently GPS tracking four young birds making their first big trips. During winter, they were ­sedentary, but with better weather they have flown from their nests to Somerset, Kent and Norfolk. Two brave birds, G318 and G393, have flown up as far north as Yorkshire to roost.
Campaigners are appealing to people for sightings and photos. The birds have black-ridged tails, a hooked yellow beak and golden eyes with yellow legs and talons.
Evidence from the ­Netherlands, where there is a small but growing ­population of white-tailed eagles, shows that the species will readily nest in densely populated areas, close to people.
As a generalist predator, an animal that thrives in a wide variety of environments and scavenges on dead animals, white-tailed eagles favour fish in spring/summer, with water birds in autumn/winter, but also take rabbits and hares.
The introduction of sea eagles has not been welcomed by all, with some farmers fearful the eagles may attack their lambs.
An earlier plan to reintroduce eagles in Norfolk was rejected – with the potential dangers to livestock cited.
The Roy Dennis Foundation said: “They are known to explore widely in their first two years before returning to their natural area to breed. There’s a chance of seeing one wherever you live so keep looking up, but please stay home and stay safe.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">10 Unusual Things That Are Common in Other Countries</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When we travel to a new country, we rarely try to learn more about the local traditions and their way of life. And this is our mistake. Some things that we take for granted in our culture, may be considered unusual in other countries and vice versa. But having this knowledge will make your trip easier and help prevent different kinds of embarrassing and funny situations.
We at Bright Side know firsthand how unpleasant a culture shock may be, so we want to draw your attention to 10 everyday things that are done in other countries in quite a different way from what we are accustomed to.
In Japan, block and section numbers are used instead of names for streets. That’s why it’s pretty common there to hear things like, “I work at block 6,” or “I live in section 3.” There are some exceptions to this rule like main streets and highways.
This system might look pretty confusing at first, but if you have a map, it’s pretty easy to find the block you need in a couple of seconds. This may even be quicker than looking for the names of streets on a map, especially in big Western cities, this often causes some difficulties for tourists.
In some European countries, like the Netherlands, you will rarely see curtains on the windows. It’s not common to windows with curtains there. And people who are passing by can easily see everything that happens in an apartment if they want to.
But you might wonder why the locals don’t worry about having some privacy. The thing is that in these countries, people have a different concept of privacy. Locals respect each other’s personal space and no one would even think of peering into a stranger’s window.
Singapore is famous for its numerous unusual tourist attractions, but there is one thing that probably won’t leave any tourist indifferent: the way that locals dry their laundry there. In Singapore, people use bamboo poles for this instead of the usual ropes.
Today, bamboo poles often get replaced with plastic sticks, but initially, bamboo poles were used for this purpose. We must agree that this approach looks pretty colorful.
It turns out that chicken breasts are not only perfect for making meatballs and Caesar salads, but you can actually make a real dessert from them. And the Turkish pudding called tavuk göğsü proves that. This dish is made of chopped chicken breasts, milk, rice, sugar, and cinnamon. This is a signature Turkish dish and a favorite meal of many gourmets.
The extremely steep stairs is a signature trait of Dutch homes. They’re an essential part of canal houses that were built very tall and skinny because of possible flooding. And the stairs had to match the house, so they were built to be narrow and steep too.
While women around the world try to get rid of all the hair on their bodies, Brazilians, on the contrary, consider blonde peach fuzz a sign of beauty. Instead of removing their hair, they lighten it with a special mixture that can be found in any local store. By the way, Brazilian women often perform this procedure right on the beach, applying the lightening agent to their skin like sunscreen.
Another wonder from Japan is the ofuro bath, which is traditionally made of wood. However, today, you’re likely to come across bathtubs made of plastic and stainless steel. You can find ofuro baths in every Japanese apartment, and taking a bath is a whole ritual there. A person plunges into the water, so it covers their body up to the shoulders, and then the bath gets closed with a wooden lid, which helps to keep the water warm.
According to traditions, all family members take ofuro bath in turns without changing the water, so they always shower before they get to enjoy the bath.
People have a special attitude toward chocolate in Colombia. It’s common to drink hot chocolate with cheese. According to the tourists’ reviews, it’s not only pretty unusual, but also insanely delicious.
You can find different kinds of milk at the supermarkets from sterilized to ultra-pasteurized. But most French stores only sell ultra-pasteurized milk. For this reason, it’s unusual to keep milk in the fridge in France, and many people complain that it doesn’t turn sour and tastes different from ordinary pasteurized milk.
In South Korea, writing a person’s name using red ink traditionally means that this person has passed away. That’s why tourists should be very careful when choosing a pen to sign a greeting card.
What things surprised you in foreign counties? What would you add to our list?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Redefining normality in a world turned upside down by COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jan. 1, 2020, dawned bright and clear. So it seems at least in retrospect.
Few would have chosen those adjectives at the time. “Dark and murky” would have seemed more like it. The United States and Iran were on the brink of war. North Korea threatened to produce new nuclear weapons. Australian forest fires raged. Hong Kong was paralyzed — or animated — by mass and swelling protests against Chinese rule. Protesters worldwide drew inspiration, poured into the streets, put arbitrary and oppressive governments on notice. Democracy was reviving.
Where would it end? In freedom, or in bloodbath? No one knew.
Japan, less volatile politically, was shaken by drama of a different color — ousted Nissan Motors chief Carlos Ghosn’s spectacular escape from house arrest pending trial on charges of aggravated corporate malfeasance.
Next door, in China, a mysterious virus had broken out. Few outside China paid it much heed.
Reduced to a few key strokes, such was the state of the world we woke to on Jan. 1. Add the emergence of a new global hero, teen Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, and happy anticipation of the summer Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, and the adjectives “bright” and “clear” do seem, tentatively, to hold — if not in the sense of buoyant and untroubled, at least in that of comprehensible and manageable. It wasn’t all good, much of it was frightening, but it was at least the world we knew, life as we knew it.
That’s something, at least. In fact — as we now know — it’s a great deal.
The five months separating then from now have swept us from there to here, to a hitherto unknown planet called COVID-19. Everything’s different. Orientation has scarcely begun.
Ask people in normal times what constitutes happiness to them, and answers would no doubt vary widely. Ask now and, conceivably, they would all boil down to one: normality. “Give me back my old life!” Such would be the cry, pervasive if not unanimous.
What’s “normal”? Diversifying lifestyles have stretched its meaning and rendered any exclusive definition unacceptable, but, broadly and unexclusively speaking: children in school; parents at work; daily life, daily business, whatever yours happens to be; an atmosphere in which exhaling is not potentially murder or inhaling potentially suicide. Is that too much to ask? For now and for the foreseeable future: Yes.
In normal times, we seek happiness. In times of crisis, we seek normality. That’s normal. Still, as Spa magazine reminded us last month, normality and happiness are not synonyms. Sometimes they’re antonyms. Normal life at work is all too often a grind; normal life at home, a disillusion. Normal circumstances are as apt to derail us as to speed us on our way.
Power and infirmity (two faces of the same coin?) dog us. Masayuki Kazama and Makoto Ishino (both pseudonyms) are 45 and unemployed — Kazama, a victim of power (his boss’), Ishino of infirmity (his mother’s). Kazama was a local government bureaucrat. For five years he put up with “power harassment,” wanting to quit but fearing the insecurity of private sector employment. At last he took the plunge, landing a job with a small PR firm.
No sooner free of his past bondage, he wished himself back into it. He’d been hasty, stupid. He’d thought nothing could be worse. Not so. His new colleagues — superiors, subordinates, equals — dripped contempt for “the bureaucrat.” What did a bureaucrat know of “real life,” with its grim quotas, its relentless competition, its dog-eat-dog, sink-or-swim struggle for survival? The bureaucracy sheltered incompetence, bred laziness, rewarded sloppiness. Wasn’t he, Kazama, proof?
He was hounded until he quit, going on to a series of part-time delivery jobs that broke him physically and left him finally a shut-in case with dwindling savings, leaving his room only for late-night shopping at an all-night supermarket where produce goes for half price after hours.
A poll Spa conducted of 1,000 middle-aged unemployed men found 32 percent had quit jobs to care for infirm parents. Ishino is one of them. His mother’s dementia was worsening. He was her only child. He gave up a job in the auto sector paying ¥7 million per year to become her full-time caregiver. She wanders and is incontinent. She needs constant watching. It is exhausting — emotionally and financially draining. Physically fit, she may live for years. “And after she dies?” asks Ishino plaintively. “There won’t even be her pension. Will I be able to get a job?”
This, for many, was “normal life” — pre-COVID-19.
And now? Shukan Gendai magazine last month introduced Yoshimasa Kubota (another pseudonym) — corporate executive, 49, rarely home normally, suddenly house-bound, teleworking. Banned from taking his office computer home, he works on the family computer in the family living room with the family — his wife and teenage daughter — glaring daggers at him in the background. What’s he doing here? they seem to be asking.
Does he love his family? Do they love him? He’d never asked himself. His family was “normal.” They got along “normally,” lived “normally” — he at work, they doing whatever they did. Now, the tension rose and rose, no one saying anything, but you could feel it.
Then came the shock. The teleconference with his office over, Kubota got up from the table, turning the computer over to his daughter, who had long been showing her impatience. Flinging him a glance that was none too friendly, she gloved her hands and set to work scrubbing the keyboard with alcohol disinfectant.
“It’s come to that!” he laments to Shukan Gendai. “They treat me like a virus!”
A 71-year-old man wrote a letter to the editor of the Asahi Shimbun last month. He is in treatment for cancer — stressful enough in normal times, doubly so now, with the medical system at risk of breakdown. After treatment, he says, he proceeds to a neighborhood park to admire the flowers. A feeling of peace comes over him. Flowers — how simple, quaint, ordinary, normal. We need more of them, he says. He may be right.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US News
Written By Bhavya Sukheja | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 05:48 IST
NASA’s new easy-to-build ‘high-pressure ventilator’ tailored to treat COVID-19 patients was approved by the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Saturday, May 1. The device called VITAL (Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally) was developed by the engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California.
The ventilator is designed to treat patients with milder symptoms, thereby keeping the country’s limited supply of traditional ventilators available for patients with more severe COVID-19 symptoms. 
He added, “This ventilator is one of countless examples of how taxpayer investments in space exploration – the skills, expertise and knowledge collected over decades of pushing boundaries and achieving firsts for humanity – translate into advancements that improve life on Earth”.

According to the press note on the NASA website, the Office of Technology Transfer and Corporate Partnerships at Caltech, which manages JPL for NASA, is now offering a free license for VITAL. Further, they are also reaching out to the commercial medical industry to find manufacturers for the device.
Fred Farina, chief innovation and corporate partnerships officer at Caltech, said that the authorities are working to ‘pass the baton’ to the medical community, and ultimately serve the patients.

The team at NASA detailed that VITAL can be built faster and maintained more easily than a traditional ventilator. It is also composed of far fewer parts, many of which are currently available to potential manufacturers through existing supply chains. Moreover, with flexible design, the device can also be modified for use in field hospitals being set up in convention centres, hotels and other high-capacity facilities across the globe. 
The device, like all ventilators, will require patients to be sedated and an oxygen tube inserted into their airway to breathe. NASA also informed that VITAL would not replace current hospital ventilators as the device is intended to last only three to four months and is specifically tailored to the needs of COVID-19 patients. VITAL is expected to decrease the likelihood of patients getting to that advanced stage of the disease where they require advance ventilator assistance.

Written By Pritesh Kamath | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 09:25 IST
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) former Director-General Dr. Nirmal K Ganguly has said that India can easily do the synthesis of the new antiviral drug Remdesivir if allowed by the US-based pharma company Gilead Sciences. The American Pharma major is now in touch with several Indian Pharmaceutical Companies and is exploring various avenues, even possibly for open licensing of this drug.
"The antiviral was created to treat RNA viruses — Marburg and Ebola. It, however, did not succeed then," he added.

"After the results are known, India will be able to use this drug as this is the largest randomised chemical trial," added Dr. Ganguly.
Dr. Ganguly also spoke about the much talked about drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which India had exported to numerous countries after US President Donald Trump requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for lifting export ban and send the medicine to the US as it was then seen as an only possible medicine to control the virus in the body. He opined that though the medicine did not significantly reduce fatality rates and FDA has taken it out from the list of compulsory drugs owing to the deaths, doesn't mean India cannot carry out trials.

Gilead Sciences is now planning to conduct larger trials of Remdesivir in seven countries. Interestingly, Remdesivir effectively treats COVID-19 from both humans and animals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specified that the drug can be used for both adults and children who are severely ill due to the Coronavirus with low blood oxygen levels or those who are on the ventilator.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">General News
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 21:58 IST
 Nine more people, including doctors and contacts of COVID-19 patients at NDMC-run hospitals, have tested positive for novel coronavirus, officials said on Sunday.
Three doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital and as many doctors from Kasturba Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, an official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC).
Husbands of two nurses working at the NDMC-run Hindu Rao Hospital tested positive for coronavirus, he said.
A patient, who was referred by the OPD of Hindu Rao Hospital, was also found infected with the dreaded virus, the official said.
The total number of staffers who have tested positive for coronavirus at the Hindu Rao Hospital stands at six.
At Kasturba Hospital, two postgraduate students had tested positive for the virus within a span of one week. The tally of infected staffers at the hospital stands at five.
All the COVID-19 confirmed cases have been put under quarantine, the official added.
Meanwhile, the NDMC said it will take strict action against its employee who violated quarantine protocols and came to work.
A lab technician did not inform NDMC officials that his wife had tested positive for coronavirus on April 28.
"Instead of being in quarantine, he did not tell us and kept coming to work till May 2. His own report came on May 1, and he didn't inform the authorities," the official said.
An ambulance was sent to pick up his family members who were yet to be tested for COVID-19, he said.
"While we will help him and his family in view of their current distress, he is also liable for action for having failed to inform us as per law," the official added.

This the daily Covid update from Deccan Herald.On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths… some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients...And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers.---At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today.Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus.More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date.---The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported.---A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark.Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases.---The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours.---All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group.Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest.---Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19.---Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state.---Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients.---In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension.According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral.---E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones.All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines.----Private offices can  resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards.---Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown.---The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‘suitably’ informed about restarting operations.The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation.---In news from Karnataka,The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases.As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as “red zones” within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as “orange zones,” where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days.---State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region.The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers.---The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares.Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so.---If you’ve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard  cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher.---Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons.
This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward.This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral.A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly.What’s the truth then?Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play.According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn’t understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this.Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns.Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth.---Before we go,for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The  National Restaurant Association of India,  which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees.The scheme is known as  Rise For Restaurants.Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250.This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.For the list of participating restaurants in your city, click on the link provided in the description.---For the latest updates, log on to deccanerald.com.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bengaluru records first death of cancer patient to COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the first time, a cancer patient in the city succumbed to coronavirus on Saturday.
The patient — P557 — was a 63-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, renal failure and multiple myeloma. He was admitted with complaints of breathlessness on April 30 and died on May 2 at Victoria Hospital.
Dr Vishal Rao, head and neck cancer surgeon, HCG Hospital, said: “Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. The chance of a five-year survival is 50%.”
Dr C Ramachandra, director, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, said myeloma impacts the bone marrow. “The patients will have more immunosuppression compared to normal people,” he said. “Such patients are at a high risk of getting Covid-19. Several people suffering from myeloma are receiving chemotherapy at Kidwai.” He said Kidwai had tested close to 300 cancer patients for Covid-19, including inpatients and those at the early stages of investigation, but none have tested positive so far.
While Kidwai had tested 45 patients on the first day and 25 in patients on the second, the hospital has ramped up testing to 300 in the past four days. Even those attending patients are screened.
“Any patient who approaches us for chemotherapy, surgery or radiation is tested for Covid-19,” Dr Ramachandra said. “We test both old and new patients.”
Screening area 
A screening area has been set up at Kidwai’s campus under a shamyana (tent). “We have our personnel donning PPEs there. They are either checked for Covid-19 and sent in or sent to a designated isolation hospital if they show symptoms,” Ramachandra said.
Curing myeloma depends on the stage of the cancer, he added. If the cancer is found at a single site, the chances of cure are higher than when the cancer is found in multiple sites.
“Plasma cell is a small cell tumour. So, it responds well to chemotherapy. It is curable if the patients come to us early. If the tumour spreads extensively in the body, they may not be able to tolerate chemotherapy. Such patients succumb (to the disease),” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fatalism, fear and the coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In my 20s, I naively thought I could control my life and it would turn out how I envisaged. However, it turned out I was wrong. Life had something very different in store for me. A series of unplanned events propelled me to take a leap of faith into the unfamiliar, where I often felt like I was being guided by a powerful intangible force -- a force that I hadn’t known existed.
Living in India has been an enlightening journey of adjustment. I’ve experienced events that would be unfathomable for me back in Australia -- a devastating sweeping terrorist attack on my city (Mumbai), debilitating dengue fever and malaria, and the trials and tribulations of a surprise demonetisation. I’ve also witnessed the ongoing tragedies that have given rise to Mumbai being repetitively lauded for its indomitable “spirit”. The floods, the building and bridge collapses, the fires, the stampedes, and the routine hardships.  
The coronavirus grimly shocked the western world, by snatching its freedom and penetrating its illusion of invincibility with death. I’m surprised how calm I am about the virus. To me, it’s just another adversity to be faced and dealt with. A tragedy happens somewhere every day in India. Yet, people pick themselves up and resiliently continue on. They have no choice. More than that though, they’re empowered by the belief that their fate is already set. When and how they will die is out of their hands. There’s nothing they can do about it. Although this fatalistic attitude largely belongs to India’s working-class poor, it’s what gives me the greatest stability in this extreme era of uncertainty. If my time is up, a mask and sanitiser won’t save me. If it’s not up, I’ll survive.  
The reality is that the virus isn’t going to disappear anytime soon in India, where it has proved impossible to enforce social distancing in densely crowded areas. The lockdown can only hold back the spread of the virus for so long, while economic distress deepens and job losses grow. Many experts now believe that the infection is far more prevalent than initially thought, given the number of people showing only mild symptoms or none at all. Without broad testing, no one can be certain what we’re dealing with. Decisions are being driven by fear, rather than conclusive information, and the harsh truth is that there’s no guaranteed solution to the problem. Nevertheless, we are going to have to get on with our lives sooner rather than later. And, we’re going to have to do it alongside the virus, taking whatever precautions we deem necessary. Deaths will inevitably occur -- if not from the virus, from economic depression and destitution.
The possibilities are scary, no doubt. So, how do we not be overwhelmed by fear? By adjusting to what can’t be changed. The virus is just one more thing, out of many, that has the potential to kill us. I’m not pessimistic or hopeless about it. I’ll keep looking after my health and behaving responsibly. However, I’m not going to stress myself out over the existence of the virus. What control do we really have over how our life ends anyway? Even an innocuous act of supposed free will can bring us to our death. Take for example, the Mumbai doctor who decided to wade through waterlogged streets to reach home during the monsoon a few years ago. He fell into an open manhole and got washed away down the drain. When your time is up, indeed it’s up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: It took a virus to show, a man’s place is in the kitchen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was mid-morning. I was glued to Doordarshan channel, watching the great archer Arjuna, for now all feminine and with red painted lips as Brihannala, teaching delicate dance moves to princess Uttara; and He-Man Bheema come out of a palace kitchen with a ladle in his hand. His wife, erstwhile queen Draupadi, her luxurious hair untied, is waiting with flaming eyes to give him a piece of her mind – this, a scene out of Mahabharat, the mega-hit TV serial of the 90s that airs twice a day to keep ‘We, the locked-down people of India,’ at home. Bheema was stirring the ‘bhojan’ pot nicely, when my phone rang.
It was a close friend from Mumbai -- a man from the media world, who lives all by himself. “Listen, I am trying to make small-onion sambhar, ok? I have kept everything here near the stove, the tomatoes, tamarind & sambhar powder, ready-made, I mean. Just go on telling me the sequence in which I have to put things in? And say it slowly.” My eyes still on master-chef Bheema, I rattled out the recipe to this suave, flamboyant friend, who now sounded like an unsure schoolboy taking down missed class notes.
Ever since the lockdown began on March 24, ‘recipes’ have peaked to an all-time high in online searches. Google Trends showed that both coffee and pani puri witnessed a 120% rise in searches. Uttapam and hummus were first-rankers too, but none more than a Korean coffee that took the world by storm this season, rhyming with Corona –- Dalgona. I am not sure what the big deal is about this milky-sweet frothy coffee since Korean actor Jung Il-woo showed how to make it, but what I am sure of is this: Men have morphed in this Covid phase into cooking-cleaning-chopping (& coconut-scraping) creatures like never before in history. Every woman’s dream! Except, are they?
One friend actually posted a picture of the coconut he had cracked using a hammer, like it was a war trophy, and the ‘eelige maney’ (the centuries-old South Indian iron implement attached to a wooden seat), that he sat down to scrape the hard nut with. Another posted a grand picture of a…roti, and the process of how he had made it round. Two dozen comments commended him on the heroic effort. I laughed out loud reading this to the husband, who unsmilingly looked into my eyes: “Do not overestimate the skill of getting a roti right.”
Well, if you try to keep 130 crore people locked up at home, what else will we do if not talk food all the time? Besides watching Netflix, playing Ludo, and ordering condoms and pregnancy kits apparently, as the media reported. So, have all the dish-washing men and kids left the ladies to put their feet up, twirling hair and colouring their nails? Not if you were to read messages on women’s WhatsApp groups, one of which read: “I want to push my husband & the daughter out of the house. They are nice and all, but getting on my nerves.”
With schools showing no signs of opening, online projects promptly arriving, parents, especially moms, can’t wait to run off to office. Except, most companies are now so much at home with ‘work from home’ that home will be the office even when offices open.
Cranky kids’ shrieks, men slipping on shirts on their boxer pants and women wearing jackets right over their nighties, is all legit on video-conference calls. And then comes WWW: World-wide, Webinar, the new virus that will whack humanity even after Corona goes away. ‘Webinarred’ might be an actual disorder psychiatrists will have to figure a cure for. Remember, you read it here first.
So that’s a gist of how we have held up so far. Vanity took a backseat. Selfies vanished, flashbacks flourished. Someone even came up with Me@20 -- a challenge on social media that asks you to post a picture of you as a 20-year-old, in dewdrop-fresh youth; not of the new-and-now you, when salons and beauty parlours lie sealed, that have left your face and hair with one or more of the fifty shades of grey.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – Taiwan's latest Wuhan coronavirus findings were published by a prestigious American journal Saturday (May 2), indicating that COVID-19 is most infectious during the early stages of the disease.
Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) teamed up with National Taiwan University professor Lin Hsien-Ho (林先和) for the report. It was published in the Jama Internal Medicine magazine, established by the American Medical Association, in 1908.
According to a CECC website statement, the report titled, Contact Tracing Assessment of COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics in Taiwan and Risk at Different Exposure Periods Before and After Symptom Onset, was based on the first 100 confirmed cases in Taiwan. The median age of those infected was 44, ranging from 11 to 88 years old, with 56 men and 44 women.
The study showed the most infectious period was in the very early stages of the disease or even before the onset of symptoms. Additionally, the report suggested the pandemic will not be controlled if only symptomatic cases are isolated.
Social distancing is required to contain the epidemic, the study indicated. CECC said the findings will enable the world to have a better understanding of COVID-19 and its transmission, so more effective prevention policies can be implemented.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A coronavirus pandemic was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, but the number of confirmed cases worldwide had shot up to more than 3 million just one and a half months later.
As of May 1, we are in unprecedented terrain, with five countries having reported more than 10,000 deaths and the number of confirmed global deaths passing 230,000.
Despite being just 130 kilometers from China, where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first broke out, Taiwan has thus far managed to control the pandemic. As of May 1, Taiwan had gone 19 consecutive days without seeing a new local case.
People say, "Taiwan is well prepared, and now it's paying off."
But why? And how?
Check out a video, produced by Taiwan News, for the quick answers.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Chang Shan-chwen (張上淳), the advisory specialist panel convener at Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), said on Sunday (May 3) that he expects the spread of Wuhan coronavirus to be slowed by the summer heat; however, he urged the public to remain cautious and observant, CNA reported.
In the past, influenza has typically broken out during the fall and winter seasons, with a comparatively low chance of it happening in summer, Chang said at the CECC daily press briefing. Therefore, he added, it's likely that the epidemic will taper off in the coming months, continuing that there is theoretical basis for the speculation.
Chang qualified his remarks by clarifying that although the above-mentioned view is valid for the temperate region, things may be different in the tropics.
The expert said he looks forward to seeing the virus lose potency with the rising temperatures. He made a point to urge continued caution, saying that prevention measures should still be rigorously practiced despite the heat, as at present there are many unknowns.
CECC Chief Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) urged the public to wash hands often, wear masks, keep social distancing, and check temperatures to avoid the possibility of a second spike in cases.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nuns vs. the Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Until last month, Florence Facciolo and Karen Malzone were the dining-hall queens of their Catholic nursing home in Newark, Delaware. Karen, a mirthful woman in her late 70s, would use a walker to shuffle over to their assigned table, which was adorned with a fresh tablecloth for each meal and a new centerpiece every season. The two women would pass several hours laughing about nothing. When they got in trouble for being too raucous, 87-year-old Flo would give a “Who, me?” look and point at their third seatmate, Pat Klevence, the quiet one, who would just shake her head and smile from her wheelchair.
Karen was the first to get sick, catching a cough in early March that wouldn’t go away. After 10 days in isolation, she seemed to get a little better, but things at the Jeanne Jugan Residence, a facility run by an order of Roman Catholic nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor, were getting worse. At first, residents were seated at opposite ends of each table, then alone. Before long, they were eating meals in their rooms. Confined to her living space, Karen dogged the nurses and cleaning staff for updates about her neighbors on Saint Joseph’s, one of the facility’s two nursing floors. She peeked her head out of her room and saw that a STOP sign had been posted on her door, warning people to check in with the nurses’ station before entering. The same sign had been posted on Flo’s door across the hall, and Pat’s had one too. Oh God, Karen thought.
One in every seven patients in the United States is seen at a Catholic hospital, according to the Catholic Health Association, and similar proportions of the elderly are cared for in Catholic residential homes. Small facilities run by religious orders, including the Little Sisters’ network of more than two dozen homes in the U.S., were already under financial pressure before the pandemic; like many Catholic providers, they fill a major vulnerability in the U.S. health-care system, taking on a significant number of poor patients on Medicare or Medicaid. Many of these facilities are staffed by aging priests and nuns, who are themselves at high risk of infection.
The Jeanne Jugan Residence, named for the founder of the Little Sisters, was the first facility in Delaware to face a COVID-19 outbreak. Over a few weeks in March and April, roughly one in five residents died, and many others fell sick. The staff, along with the 11 sisters who live there, worked frantically as the virus spread through the home, with one resident after another rapidly deteriorating. At one point, three people died in a single day. So far, 11 people have died of complications related to presumed or confirmed cases of COVID-19.
In many ways, the Little Sisters were founded for a moment like this: The nuns take a special vow of hospitality, promising to accompany the elderly as they move toward death. But like other long-term-care facilities in the U.S., the Little Sisters home in Delaware was blindsided by this pandemic. Even those most at peace with death have been deeply shaken by COVID-19.
Sister Raymond Elizabeth Kortenhof describes herself as a “lifer” in the Little Sisters. She first volunteered with the order when she was 11, and soon found herself falling in love with God, who directed her to care for the elderly. “We’re in the antiques business,” she told me. “People like antiques. But they don’t necessarily like old people.” Kortenhof, who has rosy cheeks and wears dark, wiry glasses, likes to joke about slipping the residents cocktails and cheese puffs. She’s a “certified character,” one resident’s son told me.
Kortenhof oversees one of the home’s nursing units, so she experienced the sudden onset of the virus up close. Residents started getting fevers and coughs; their oxygen levels dipped. Many of the home’s 66 residents fit squarely into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s description of the people most at risk for COVID-19: over the age of 65 and struggling with lung or heart conditions or other chronic illnesses. Staff members scrambled to secure the supplies they needed to protect themselves and the residents, putting out calls on Facebook for donations of N-95 masks and money. As the home went into lockdown, the normally bustling hallways filled with rockers went quiet.
The first death came on March 26, and more followed in quick succession. There was Father Hilary Rodgers, a 75-year-old retired priest who spent decades as a Franciscan friar. There was Lucille Williams, a mother of six who would have been 95 in May, and who had recently been crowned queen of the residence’s Mardi Gras celebration. Many of the deaths were unexpected. One nursing assistant told me that staff might check on a resident at 8 p.m. and deem her stable, only to find her dead when checking on her again at 8:30. For safety reasons, family members were not allowed into rooms to visit their sick loved ones, even as they approached death. Residents’ children and grandchildren took to standing outside the windows of the first-floor Holy Family unit, shouting conversations through the glass or holding up signs that residents could see from bed. Jack Williams, Lucille’s son, made one that said Dad is waiting for you. He was too nervous about upsetting his sisters to use it.
Inside the home, the sisters and staff were in shock. Every time they tried to grieve the death of a resident, a new person would die. “It felt like we were robbed,” Kortenhof said. “We may have 13 deaths over a year. We had 13 deaths … over a period of three weeks,” including the 11 COVID-19–related cases and two of unrelated causes. Typically, deaths at the home are slow and gentle, with residents surrounded by family and the sisters sitting by their bedside, holding a prayer vigil in three-hour shifts. COVID-19 has taken away all the normal rituals that might happen close to the end of a resident’s life. Priests cannot visit to take confession or anoint the dying. Because COVID-19 is so contagious, the sisters have to don personal protective equipment over their habits and veils anytime they enter a sick resident’s room. “One man, I was praying with him awhile with full garb on: rubber gloves, goggles, masks, gowns,” Kortenhof said. “It’s just so unnatural for us.”
A few weeks into the outbreak, the nuns started getting sick. Kortenhof and three other sisters went into isolation, leaving the residence with even fewer hands. She found it “torturous” to get messages about residents dying while she wasn’t there. “If you don’t have a strong faith, this thing would just succeed in crushing you,” she said.
Holy Week passed heavily. The deaths had become a drumbeat, and the sisters and staff were exhausted. Volunteers from the nearby Christiana Hospital came to help with equipment and care, visiting residents to take their temperature and measure the oxygen in their blood. Alone in their rooms, many in the home tuned in to channel 50, a live feed of the facility’s chapel. Each morning and afternoon, sisters who were not sick would come in to pray the rosary or recite the Divine Mercy, kneeling far from one another to maintain social distance. The channel was a small thread connecting residents in isolation, a way of being together in days of solitude.
In her room on Saint Joseph’s, Flo would often stay up until 2 a.m. trying to finish her prayers. For a while, she had run a fever, suffered from diarrhea, and kept coughing, but her symptoms didn’t last long. Surrounded by statues of Jesus and Mary, beneath pictures of her six kids, 23 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren, Flo prayed for courage, for the health of the staff, for everybody who was sick in the home. She especially prayed for Karen, her friend from the dining hall. “I was really worried about her. We have different things wrong with us,” Flo told me this week, her voice quiet over the phone. For weeks, she didn’t have much information about how her neighbors were doing, even those who lived just feet away. After a month of separation, toward the end of April, Flo finally left a couple of messages on Karen’s phone.
Since then, the two women have spoken just once, mostly about nothing. They aren’t afraid of death, but they don’t want to talk much about it. Karen told me that she didn’t ask Flo about the coronavirus outbreak, because she was scared she’d start crying. Flo didn’t ask Karen about it either. “Maybe a part of me didn’t want to know,” Flo said.
Karen constantly imagines what it will be like to return to the dining hall when the outbreak is over. Her table, like so many others, will be a little emptier: Pat, who was 87, is among the residents who have died. There was no memorial service where the women could say goodbye to their friend. Pat’s son, a priest in a Delaware beach town, was not even able to celebrate Mass at her funeral.
Both Flo and Karen are lifelong Catholics, and they believe firmly in the promise of Christianity. “When you’re people of faith, heaven is not a scary place,” Karen said. “It’s a place you’re looking forward to, that you’ve been working for all your life.” The residents encourage one another. They’re ready to go home, she said. “Just maybe not today.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">5 ways your pharmacist can help during the COVID-19 outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pharmacists have been under pressure during the coronavirus outbreak, dealing with unparalleled volumes of prescriptions and surging demand for non-essential medicine, says the head of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA).
“Pharmacists have been on the front line, working long hours in very challenging circumstances to ensure patients remain safe and continue to receive essential medicines and protect medicine safety,” says PSA national president, Associate Professor Chris Freeman.
“They have been outstanding in the way they have been able to adapt and innovate to keep themselves and patients safe.”
Here are five ways your pharmacist can help you during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Aside from some short closures to process scripts and clean premises, pharmacies have remained open during the outbreak, some with extended trading hours, Professor Freeman says.
“Physical distancing requirements during COVID-19 is a challenge for many pharmacists, particularly maintaining safe distance between staff and patients,” he says. However, measures have been put in place, including plastic screens and limits to the number of customers that can enter a pharmacy at once.
“Pharmacies continue to ask members of the public not to enter if they are suffering from symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and sore throat.”
Pharmacies are helping people – particularly the most vulnerable – get prescriptions filled online or remotely, and have medications delivered to your home.
Amcal senior pharmacist Brinley Hosking says: “In some states, recent changes to laws mean that you can send a photo of the prescription to have the medicine home delivered, then provide the paper copy to the pharmacy upon delivery. Ask your local pharmacist about the ways they can support you to access your medicines without leaving home.”
“Managing your ongoing health conditions is more important than ever at this time,” Hosking says. “Whether it’s showing you how to use a blood pressure monitor from home, or reviewing your medication regime to ensure it is safe and effective, your pharmacist is a great resource to rely on to support you, particularly if you are unable to visit your GP as often as you normally would.”
“Pharmacies are minimising the time that customers need to spend in the pharmacy by advising patients to phone ahead to request prescriptions, recommending the use of home delivery services or waiting in the car until their items are ready to be collected,” Professor Freeman says.
“More and more we are hearing pharmacists carry out consultations via telephone or video. This will no doubt increase if the government affords the same support to pharmacy telehealth consults as they have other services.”
On top of this, many pharmacies have a series of useful online resources. Amcal have provided answers to common questions on their COVID-19 FAQ site here.
Many pharmacies have apps to help people manage their health and medications. These have become more useful during COVID-19, Professor Freeman says, and will become even more important as Australia moves towards electronic prescribing.
Hosking says the Amcal app allows patients to manage medications through reminders and alerts, send in script repeat requests, and order ahead with click and collect and home delivery. “There is also a carer mode for a carer to manage their loved one’s medications,” she says, “which can be useful if you are caring for relatives who may be self-isolating, or who need a bit of extra help.”
Now more than ever, if you’ve got questions, Just Ask Amcal – your trusted health partner.

I have spent a good chunk of the lockdown (155 hours in fact!) finally replaying Zelda: Breath Of The Wild on master mode, along with the DLC. It’s very rare I ever replay a single-player game but I’m really glad I did. It’s such a magnificent game and finally finding all 120 shrines felt like a real achievement. Master mode may not have changed things all that radically, but I found the difficulty curve much more satisfying. In normal mode I was way too overpowered by halfway through, making combat a bit of a chore, whereas in master mode you have to stay on your toes right up until the end. The DLC as a whole was a pretty mixed bag though.
One of the best things was actually Hero’s Path, just being able to see where you’ve been was a great help. The new shrines were very clever too, making me scratch my head a couple of times even though they used the same set of tools as the rest of the game. Trial of the Sword was a weird mixture of fun and frustration. Some of the scenarios were great but I’m not a big fan of having all the stuff you’ve worked so hard to collect taken away.
The DLC actually did this multiple times with the one-hit Obliterator and the worst bit, the Blight Ganon rematches. The boss fights of the Divine Beasts were a decidedly average part of the main game, so why they chose to repeat them again and make them seem even worse I don’t know. The funny thing is the DLC’s new final boss is actually excellent, both in terms of visuals and its attacks.
Anyway, one of the things I wanted to know on replaying the game is whether it truly does beat Ocarina Of Time. I really wasn’t sure on my first playthrough. Breath Of The Wild is so different, especially the structure. How do you compare a 120+ hour open world game to a tightly structured 30-hour game? It’s really hard but after my second playthrough I think I do have answer. It’s very, very close but I think Ocarina Of Time just keeps its crown.
Breath Of The Wild offers this vast, expansive gameplay experience in which space plays a vital role. But that space affords moments of both magical wonder and aimless mundanity. Ocarina Of Time’s more tight, linear nature means the game is always building to a crescendo whether that’s an area’s dungeon and boss or the final showdown with Ganondorf.
Strangely, Ocarina of Time, even though shorter, feels more epic with an urgency that I would suggest Breath Of The Wild (purposely) lacks. This isn’t to say Nintendo took the wrong direction with Breath Of The Wild at all, they absolutely did the right thing in doing something new. Really, it just speaks to how utterly impressive Ocarina Of Time still is after all these years. Truly one of the greatest games ever made.
But I’m really torn on what I want from the upcoming Breath Of The Wild sequel. Part of me wants it to take a step back towards traditional Zelda design, with proper dungeons and bosses. The Divine Beasts had some clever sections and ideas but really, they paled in comparison to the great dungeons of Zelda’s past. The Blight Ganon bosses in particular were very underwhelming in both visual and gameplay design. Bosses have always been a vital part of Zelda’s DNA. Just thinking of Ocarina Of Time’s gallery of rogues brings me great joy and instantly reminds me of the inspired method of their downfall. Great Zelda bosses should be a puzzle in themselves.
I would worry though, that in taking a step back towards a more traditional design that some of the wonderful new elements might be lost. I really do love the addition of the shrines, having these mini-puzzles and challenges spread throughout the world to discover works brilliantly. Can shrines and a good number of proper big dungeons be made to fit in the same game? I’m not sure, it’d definitely involve a lot of work on Nintendo’s part.
Part of me thinks they should just double-down on the open design of Breath Of The Wild and scrap dungeons all together. Put even more content into the overworld so there’s always something new and exciting happening. The mini-bosses like Hinoxes and Lynels found across the landscape were excellent, especially when you first unexpectedly stumbled upon them, but gradually their impact lessons as you fight them multiple times.
Why not have 20-30 completely unique mini-bosses, each needing their own special technique to defeat? More villages would be very welcome too, discovering a new settlement was always a highlight. Having even more would let them serve as hubs for the action to revolve around to an even greater extent.
Well, I guess I’ll just have to see what Nintendo comes up with, although speculation is always fun. Parts of the Internet seems to think Nintendo have confirmed that they are using the same map, is this true?
(As with most things Nintendo say, it’s somewhat ambiguous. This is the closest producer has come to addressing the issue: ‘One of the reasons we wanted to create a continuation was because I wanted to revisit that Hyrule again and use that world again, while incorporating new gameplay and new story’ – GC)
Obviously, the game is set in the same world but I didn’t realise it’d be the exact same area. I think I might have preferred a brand-new world to explore but if they do a Dark World or time travel twist on the existing map it could work well.
I’d love to see a complex cave network introduced below the world’s surface. Caves were featured in the trailer and it’d fit the seemingly darker tone. The other big Internet rumour/wish is to have Zelda as a playable character. I think this could be amazing but only if they make her Link’s equal. If they make her a weak, stealth character or something which you begrudge playing it’d be a travesty.
Hopefully she’d be designed to fight with both traditional weapons and some really cool, powerful Triforce of Wisdom magic. It’s exciting to think of the possibilities. For me Breath Of The Wild was an exceptionally good starting point, I really can’t wait to see what comes next.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus UK: when will antibody tests be available?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus in the UK, and around the world, continues to dominate headlines, with the UK death toll exceeding 28,000 people.  
Some places across the world have started to ease lockdown restrictions – including France, Belgium and Spain  – and PM Boris Johnson has revealed plans to publish his exit strategy for the UK later this week.
Something that could help more Brits return to a sense of normal life is the unrolling of antibody tests, which can test to see if someone has had Covid-19.
When will the antibody tests be available and who can be tested?
The antibody tests could be ready by the end of May, according to the National testing coordinator for the government, Professor John Newton.

Speaking on the BBC, he said: ‘There has been a lot of work in antibody testing. We are optimistic that we will have a good antibody test when we need it.’
Antibody tests are usually carried out by pricking the finger of a person and then work by detecting a person’s blood for antibodies.
Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to defend itself against a foreign invasion such as a virus.
UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock had previously revealed that 3.5 million antibody tests were ordered for the NHS, but these didn’t work.  
It isn’t yet known exactly how the antibody tests will be rolled out.
It’s possible that when the antibody tests are ready for use in the UK it will likely be essential workers and members of their household that will get the antibody test first.
This is so that they can be tested and return to work on the frontline.
Although essential workers will be a priority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government’s ‘ultimate goal’ is that ‘everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test.’
Madonna revealed to fans on social media that she had taken a test and is thought to have antibodies, but have the antibody tests been rolled out elsewhere?
Germany and Italy have already launched country-wide antibody tests, with more announcing plans to follow.
It’s been reported earlier today by The Guardian that US pharma giant Roche has been given the go-ahead to start antibody tests throughout the US.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Has the UK passed the peak of coronavirus?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the UK approaching its seventh week in lockdown, many are starting to think about if the measures have helped us get over the peak of coronavirus, and what the next steps for the country are.
Other countries have begun loosening lockdown restrictions, including Spain and Italy, and others like Germany considering the next steps for getting back to normal.
Will the UK be reviewing the lockdown rules soon, and have we reached the peak of coronavirus?
Boris Johnson declared in a press conference on 30 April that ‘we are past the peak and on the downward slope.’
However, he elaborated that this didn’t mean the UK could come out of lockdown.
Loosening the restrictions currently in place would depend on ‘where we are in the epidemic’ and what the data suggests, he said.

Sentiments echoed by Professor Chris Witty earlier this week supported this.
Witty warned that a second wave of the virus could be more severe if we were to rush out of lockdown measures too soon.
He said: ‘We need to make sure that R (the R number) does not go back above one. Because if not we will go back to a second wave.
It is entirely plausible for a second wave to actually be more severe than the first if it is not mitigated.
Every country has got an extremely difficult balancing act, and we all need to be honest about the fact there are no easy solutions here. Covid-19 is a very long way from finished and eradication is technically impossible for this disease.’
With this knowledge, the government still need to think about reviewing the lockdown rules.
The Prime Minister said he would be producing a ‘road map, a menu of options’ on how to get the economy moving and children back to school while still displaying best practices to keep the spread of the virus low.
Steps on an exit strategy have yet to be made official, but tentative plans are to be shared later this week.
Initial reports have given ideas of what life after lockdown could look like, with any lifting of restrictions being staggered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Another 358 dead from coronavirus in hospitals across UK</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK’s coronavirus death toll has risen to at least 28,321 after 358 more people died in hospitals.
The toll was updated after England recorded another 327 deaths in hospitals, Wales another 14, Scotland another 12 and Northern Ireland another five.
The UK’s number will rise even further later today, when deaths in care homes and the wider community are announced.
Previously, the Department of Health only included deaths in hospitals in their daily figures. The government began including care home deaths in their figures earlier this week, amid concern it reflected a significant hidden death toll.
The UK now has the third highest number of recorded deaths in the world after the USA and Italy.
This has been partly blamed on a slow approach to testing and tracing, something which the government aims to change with a new app being tested this week on the Isle of Wight.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps said: ‘The idea is that we will encourage as many people to take this up as possible. This is going to be a huge national effort and we need for this to work 50-60% of people to be using this app.
‘Not everybody has a smartphone, and I appreciate that for various reasons not everybody will download it but it will be the best possible way to help the NHS.’
He stressed the app would be completely confidential.
The app will be central to the Government’s efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus and will involve alerting people who have been in contact with an infected person and asking them to self-isolate.
Meanwhile, the Office for National Statistics has released an interactive map showing where deaths from coronavirus have taken place.
The highest concentration of deaths is in London, but there were also hotspots in Manchester, Liverpool and other major cities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wuhan lab 'deletes pictures of scientists handling bat samples'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deleted photographs from the website of a lab in Wuhan are fuelling conspiracy theories over the source of the coronavirus pandemic.
It is believed the outbreak happened at a wet market in the Chinese city, but Wuhan also houses one of the world’s leading virology laboratories leading some, notably the US president Donald Trump, to suggest otherwise.
These pictures, appearing to show low safety standards among staff at the laboratory, will do little to dissuade that view.
In the past month, according to MailOnline, the Wuhan’s Institute of Virology has taken down pictures of people working in its laboratories and removed references to US diplomatic visitors who questioned its work on bats.
Edited pages showed staff wearing minimal protective equipment entering caves to take swabs from bats – what is believed to be the source of coronavirus that would become Covid-19 in humans.
References to a visit by US diplomat in Beijing, Rick Switzer, in March 2018 also appear to have been removed.

Mr Switzer sent official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety levels and the risky coronavirus studies it was undertaking two years before the pandemic broke.
The Washington Post reported that in January 2018 the US Embassy in Beijing repeatedly sent science officers to the lab, which had become China’s first site to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety.
A press release about the visits was published in March that year only for them to be erased in April this year, although they do remain archived on the internet.
One cable from Mr Switzer to the US State Department read: ‘During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they [the diplomats] noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.’
The latest images to surface come after pictures, taken from inside the institute, showed a broken seal on a freezer used to house up to 1,500 different virus strains.
The US’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement saying: ‘The intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Takuo Aoyagi, an inventor of the pulse oximeter, dies at 84 as device proves critical in COVID-19 fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Takuo Aoyagi, a Japanese engineer whose pioneering work in the 1970s led to the modern pulse oximeter, a lifesaving device that clips on a finger and shows the level of oxygen in the blood and that has become a critical tool in the fight against the novel coronavirus, died on April 18 in Tokyo. He was 84.
His death, in a hospital, was announced by his employer, Nihon Khoden, a Tokyo-based company that makes medical equipment. A niece, Kyoko Aoyagi, confirmed the death but said she did not know the cause.
The pulse oximeter has become “an indispensable addition to medicine,” said V. Courtney Broaddus, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Historically, patients were measured by four vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate. “It has become the fifth vital sign,” she said of oxygen level.
While many coronavirus patients do feel chest pain, fever and other symptoms, Broaddus said, the pulse oximeter “has become especially important because humans do not sense a low oxygen saturation alone.”
Moreover, some COVID patients seem not to have other symptoms. As a result, when moderately or mildly ill patients test positive for the coronavirus, they may be sent home with a pulse oximeter so that they can track their oxygen level and return to the hospital if it drops.
Aoyagi’s contribution to medical science was built on decades of innovation and invention. In an essay about Aoyagi, John W. Severinghaus, a professor emeritus of anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in 2007 that Aoyagi’s “dream” had been to detect oxygen saturation levels without having to draw blood.
His early research tried to measure cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps), using a method known as dye dilution, which involves injecting a patient with dye. Instead of withdrawing the blood downstream and measuring the concentration of dye, he attempted instead to use early oximeters, some of which were developed during World War II to help military pilots breathe at high altitudes.
Those early devices, which clamped to the ear, tended to be inaccurate, unreliable and cumbersome, but Aoyagi was fascinated by the underlying technology: using two wavelengths of light — red and infrared — to measure blood oxygen levels. (Hemoglobin, the protein in blood that transports oxygen, absorbs light differently when it binds with oxygen.)
But he soon ran into a problem. Blood does not flow smoothly like an open tap, but pulses through the body irregularly, thus preventing an accurate recording of dye levels. The problem, however, turned out to be an opportunity. By devising a mathematical formula to cancel out this “pulsatile noise,” he created a device that measured oxygen levels with greater accuracy than before.
“Greatness in science, often, as here, comes from the well-prepared mind turning a chance observation into a major discovery,” Severinghaus wrote.
Nihon Kohden applied for a Japanese patent for its pulse oximeter in 1974, with Aoyagi and a colleague, Michio Kishi, listed as inventors. It was granted in 1979.
While many companies sell oximeters today, “all of today’s pulse oximeters are based on Dr. Aoyagi’s original principles of pulse oximetry,” according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which awarded Aoyagi its IEEE medal for innovations in health care technology in 2015. He was the first Japanese person to receive the award.
Takuo Aoyagi was born Feb. 14, 1936, in Niigata Prefecture, on the west coast of Japan, to Monshichi and Tatsu Aoyagi. His father was a math teacher, his mother a homemaker. He graduated from Niigata University win 1958 with a degree in electrical engineering and worked for Shimadzu before joining Nihon Khoden in 1971.
He earned a doctorate in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1993. Other honors include the JS Gravenstein Award from the Society for Technology in Anesthesia in 2013. In 2002, he received a Medal With Purple Ribbon from the Emperor of Japan, given in recognition of achievements in the arts and academics.
Survivors include his wife, Yoshiko, and three children, Yasutoshi, Midori and Kaori.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Canadian doctors notice recent uptick in so-called COVID toes cases in children</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Toronto doctor is suggesting that parents look at their children’s feet to see if there are unusual lesions around the toes that could be a sign of possible COVID-19 infection.
Dr. Elena Pope, the pediatric dermatology section head at the Hospital for Sick Children, said there has been an uptick in skin presentations of this nature – so-called COVID toes – in otherwise asymptomatic kids over the last few weeks in North America.
“The kids are not really bothered by those lesions and I think that’s why it took a while for this to come to the forefront,” she said. “If they were not bothered by it, they maybe didn’t actually report it to their parents … most of the lesions disappear on their own. They fade over time.”
Pope said there have been some cases where fingers are affected as well. The lesions have a red or purple colour and look similar to frostbite.
The Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) issued a public health alert to clinicians this week, advising that these skin lesions should prompt COVID-19 testing. Pope and Dr. Irene Lara-Corrales, a pediatric dermatologist at Sick Kids, helped craft the alert.
“Over all I would emphasize that this seems to be an unusual manifestation in children who potentially have COVID infection and potentially are contagious at the time of the diagnosis, but they’re otherwise asymptomatic and that it seems to resolve spontaneously over several weeks,” Pope said.
Pope suggested that if lesions are discovered, virtual doctor care would be a good first step.
“From what we have gathered so far is the kids present with either itching or some mild pain in their toes associated with some swelling, and then they develop red or purple bumps that are persistent afterwards,” Pope said. “Very few of them may actually have skin breakdown.”
Definitive research in the area is still in the formative stages and specifics on case numbers have not been released. Registries have started around the world to track skin condition cases that may be connected to the novel coronavirus.
Pope said it was unusual to see such a significant uptick in similar skin presentations on a regular basis.
“I might see maybe less than five cases a year and nowadays we’re seeing many, many, many patients with this manifestation,” she said, speaking about the uptick here and in other countries.
They have decided that if the lesions are within the first two weeks of onset, it’s worth testing those patients for COVID-19.
“There have been case reports from other highly endemic areas of the skin manifestation in association with the positive swabs from COVID. And also, in some of the cases, there was evidence of antibodies. So in other words, there was evidence that the patients were exposed to COVID and had antibodies to the virus.
“So I think it’s fair enough to say that based on all those reasons, this is a true association with COVID. What is unusual about this presentation is that children are otherwise asymptomatic. So they don’t have the classic symptoms of COVID.”
Lesions may resemble chilblains or perniosis, a condition that doctors sometimes see in the spring when children are a little too eager to take off their boots and freeze their feet by wading in puddles of cold water, said Dr. Chantal Bolduc, a dermatologist at Universite de Montreal hospital centre.
“We are not sure it is a sign of COVID, but we think so because of the context,” Bolduc said. “We see a little more cases than usual, and cold temperatures aren’t a factor, and it’s happening at the same time as the pandemic.”
The majority of children showing the lesions don’t have a cough or a fever, she said.
“From what has been reported so far, this is something that seems quite benign. The children are not sick. It suddenly appears and it seems a little odd, the children are in good health, it goes away on its own in two to four weeks,” Bolduc said.
Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. They may also include cough, fever and shortness of breath.
“The good news for us is that the kids don’t seem to have any other major manifestations and they simply recover quite fast from this, so that’s reassuring,” Pope said. “But it would be important for us to understand more about the mechanism and why this is happening and why it’s happening primarily in children.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Opinion: COVID-19 can kill off crony capitalism, if we let it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jeff Booth is the author of The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation Is The Key To An Abundant Future.
The economic system we have relied on is breaking down.
Amplified by COVID-19, society is on a collision course that most are not even aware of, caused by two competing forces moving in opposing directions: the exponentially deflationary aspect of technology and an inflationary monetary policy trying to overcome it.
Today, through a simple cellphone and set of interfaces, people have more power at their fingertips than leaders of most countries had only 30 years ago. Technology has changed our lives so much that we take it for granted; we get frustrated when, say, our WiFi won’t transfer in two seconds what would have taken us 20 minutes in the year 2000. Today’s fourth-generation wireless is, on average, 100 times as fast as a dial-up modem two decades ago – and 5G will soon make that feel slow.
Technological advances have swept across society and they have been hugely beneficial. Your smartphone provides a compelling example. Invented only 13 years ago, it is no longer just a phone: It is your camera, assistant, map, music device, guitar tuner and hundreds of other applications that you no longer pay for. When we use technology, we gain efficiency, and with more abundance should come less cost.
That efficiency will reshape our future, across every industry, from automotive, to agriculture, to energy and to health care. In doing so, technology will deliver better outcomes at a lower price.
If technology makes everything cheaper and more abundant, and it’s moving into every industry, it is logical to assume that prices should go down and society should enjoy increasing benefits everywhere. If our economic systems were designed that way, we might be able to enjoy a similar lifestyle to the one we have now while only working 15 hours a week, as John Maynard Keynes famously predicted in his 1930 essay The Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren.
That logic, though, defies current economic theory, which has us on a growth and inflation trajectory that must never end, at all costs. The facts of a new reality – that prices should follow a downward trajectory gained from the efficiency of technology – means that today’s policy is at odds with technology’s growing influence over our economies.
Instead, central banks and governments continually bail out the existing system – not driven by desire, but out of fear that letting the system fail and go through a disorderly unwind is a worse alternative in a set of bad choices. Society is thus forced to run on a treadmill, working more to support ever-higher prices, which have themselves been inflated through monetary easing, artificially low interest rates and bailouts. Enriching some while impoverishing many others.
A financial system based on credit is just an exchange of money today for money later. If I give you dollars today, I temporarily lose the utility of my money in exchange for having more later; you would get the inverse, which is the benefit of more money today and less tomorrow as you pay back the loan with interest. This system works on trust: that you will pay what you said you would pay. While you may look wealthy for a time by spending more of tomorrow’s dollars today, eventually that bill comes due – which means that in the future, you must spend less as you pay back the loan with interest. This is always the case, whether that trust is in a person, company, or government. Remove trust and it affects the creditworthiness of an individual or company, and they can be forced into bankruptcy. Remove trust from a system, and it can unravel very quickly.
Yet, since 2000, the world has been using a lot more credit to achieve growth, adding US$185-trillion of debt to achieve US$46-trillion of global growth a year.
All of this was the case even before our current crisis, which has seen an explosive rise in debt while the economy shrinks even more. In itself, that debt burden must slow growth in the future because taxes will need to go up on the range of industries and households that will have to pay for it.
In their desperate effort to achieve growth and inflation, central banks and governments – through artificially low interest rates and monetary policy – have only created more pain. Incentives designed to make cash less valuable and encourage more spending reduce savings and encourage individuals and companies to take on additional debt.
For the wealthy and those with assets that were artificially boosted by years of this kind of leverage, that has played out well. Assets, including real estate and stocks, were the beneficiaries, and before the pandemic, they had run up in value far beyond what they would have been without the easing. But for every person on the winning side of those decisions, there are many others on the losing side. Their costs of food, shelter, gas and health care are rising because of policies designed to make their cash and wages less valuable. Assets that they don’t yet own are running away in price and they are feeling the squeeze of a system that no longer works. It is no wonder that societies all over the world face a rise of anxiety, anger and populism.
Technological deflation was affecting economies long before COVID-19. That is, without intervention in free markets and the creation of policies to stop prices from falling, the prices of everything would already be much lower. Savings would be much higher, too – which ironically would have created a greater safety net for society in times such as these.
Paradoxically, this pandemic has actually sped up the adoption of technology and driven the trend to lower prices faster. Technology companies have been the beneficiaries. Zoom, for instance, has seen significant growth in the number of people that participate in meetings that use its online conferencing services, with many using the technology to help run their businesses; the longer this crisis proceeds, the less appealing their commercial real estate might look. If that happens, real estate prices would fall – as would rents. Meanwhile, bricks-and-mortar retail, already under enormous pressure before COVID-19, will likely face even more as the trend to e-commerce is amplified.
I grew up in a world where I believed anything was possible with hard work and creativity. I still believe that. I also believe in capitalism, where the free market is the ultimate referee of your value. That’s why it pains me so much to see that worldview breaking down.
Although no system is perfect, the rules by which capitalism operated were well-regarded and understood. You could expect that if you made a big bet and were wrong, you would be wiped out – but if you were right, your effort, ingenuity, or risk-taking would be rewarded. This system dominated over the better part of the 20th century.
But then the rise of fiat currencies that could be manipulated domestically and the bailouts in 2008 changed the rules so that players whose bad bets caused the crisis were rewarded handsomely instead of being wiped out. Capitalism was essentially replaced with today’s version: An economic system that requires ever higher bailouts, negative interest rates and monetary easing to function, which arbitrarily transfers massive amounts of wealth to the wealthy and further escalates the problem.
So, we stand at a crossroads similar to the one we had in 2008 – only bigger, with calls for massive bailouts of taxpayer money to save the same system that was so clearly failing in the first place.
We need a new set of rules.
Policy response is required and justified. People are hurting. As before, there are no easy answers because the magnitude of what we are dealing with is far bigger than most realize. The transition away from the old rules will be painful. But beyond that, it’s hard to imagine why more abundance and less cost would be such a bad thing for society. It’s going to happen anyways, in the end.
By understanding the key structural change that technology has enabled, governments can step in and provide a transition to a brighter future. Not doing so is analogous to Kodak trying to retain their film business while competing against digital cameras, or Blockbuster adding candy aisles to their stores to counter Netflix: Massive amounts of money will be wasted and the efforts are doomed to fail regardless. If that happens, more people will be hurt in the end.
As goes the quote variously ascribed to many, “Never let a crisis go to waste.” So let’s use this as an opportunity to make the system – and the world we live in – much better.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A patent has been granted by the UAE’s Ministry of Economy for the development of an innovative and promising treatment for coronavirus infections using stem cells, Emirates News Agency (WAM) reported on Friday.
The treatment was developed by a team of doctors and researchers at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center, ADSCC, and involves extracting stem cells from the patient’s own blood and reintroducing them after activating them. The patent was granted for the innovative method in which the stem cells are collected, WAM said.
The treatment was administered in the UAE to 73 COVID-19 patients who recovered after they were successfully treated by inhaling the treatment, which had been nebulized into a fine mist, into their lungs.
The treatment has successfully undergone the initial phase of clinical trials, demonstrating its safety. None of the patients who have received the treatment reported immediate adverse effects and there have been no interactions found with the conventional treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients, WAM said.
Trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment are ongoing and are expected to be completed in a couple of weeks, it added.
According to WAM, the treatment has been given to patients along with the conventional medical intervention and will continue to be applied as an adjunct to established treatment protocols rather than as a replacement.
Non-pharmacological interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as staying at home, social distancing and infection prevention and control measures remain necessary to reduce the burden of the disease on the healthcare system, said WAM.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WHO Director General Tedros said he had "grave concerns about the potential impact" of the disease "as it starts to accelerate in countries with weaker health systems"
The pandemic of COVID-19 is clearly still a global health emergency and is of particular concern as it spreads more widely in countries with weak health systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday. Three months after the WHO's emergency committee first advised the WHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to declare a public health emergency over the new coronavirus, Tedros said: "The pandemic remains a public health emergency of international concern".
Tedros said he had "grave concerns about the potential impact" of the disease "as it starts to accelerate in countries with weaker health systems". "As we have done clearly from the beginning, we will continue to call on countries to implement a comprehensive package of measures to find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact," Tedros told a briefing at the WHO's Geneva headquarters.
He said the WHO would "continue working with countries and partners to enable essential travel needed for pandemic response, humanitarian relief and cargo operations, and for countries to gradually resume normal passenger travel."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The regulator body can revise the Remdesivir's status from temporary to full approval if Gilead Sciences or other researchers generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for treating coronavirus patients
The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the experimental drug Remdesivir to treat coronavirus patients.
"I'm pleased to announce that Gilead now has a EUA (emergency use authorisation) from the FDA for Remdesivir," US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
The US food and drug regulatory body allowed the drug's authorisation after some studies, including one led by an Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug Remdesivir shortened the recovery time for the hospitalised patients with severe coronavirus infection.
"Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that Remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug's use," FDA said in a statement.
A government-sponsored study earlier showed that the drug Remdesivir helped recover some of the infected coronavirus patients by 31%.
In a statement, Gilead Sciences said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe infection. The US-based vaccine maker added that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.
Under the EUA, both 5-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of the disease, Gilead Sciences noted.
The research-based biopharmaceutical company is working with the US government, USFDA and National Institute of Health on the logistics of distribution for the vaccine to enable its access across the country.
The authorization is temporary, Gilead said and added that Remdesivir remains an investigational drug, which has not been approved by the FDA.
The regulator body can revise the Remdesivir's status from temporary to full approval if Gilead Sciences or other researchers generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for treating coronavirus patients.
