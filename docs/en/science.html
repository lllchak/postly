    <h5 class="mb-1">Ebola drug remdesivir given ’emergency approval’ to treat coronavirus patients in the US</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A DRUG used to treat Ebola has been given emergency approval for use on coronavirus patients.
Early results from a study by the US National Institute of Health suggests the drug could improve the odds of survival for very ill coronavirus patients by as much as 30 per cent.
It could also speed up recovery time from 14 days to 11 days.
The drug is made by Gilead Sciences and the company’s chief executive Daniel O'Day met with the President in the Oval Office.
"We're humbled by this being an important first step for hospitalized patients,” he said.
“We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of these patients getting the medicine, so we made a decision to donate about 1.5 million vials.”
Vice President Mike Pence said the vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
The drug could also be ready to treat 140,000 coronavirus patients in the UK by the end of May and has been labelled "promising" by UK's Chief Scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.
Interest in the remdesivir has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for the coronavirus.
Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus,
It provided data suggesting remdesivir worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
Remdesivir has been authorised by the FDA using its emergency powers.
In normal circumstances "substantial evidence" in the form of more studies would be required to prove the drug's safety and effectiveness.
But as a result of the pandemic, the FDA only requires a drug maker to prove that the drug's potential benefits outweigh its risks.
It will still need full approval but the FDA can give this if Gilead Sciences or other researchers provide more evidence of remdesivir's safety and effectiveness.
The drug, which is given intravenously in hospital, has not been tested on people with the milder form of the virus.
Remdesivir is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US allows use of remdesivir to help virus recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington: US regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.
The Food and Drug Administration cleared Gilead Science’s intravenous drug for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
 
President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.
“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”
The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
Dr Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.
“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society, it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”
The FDA said preliminary results from the government study warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”
The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.
The National Institutes of Health’s Dr Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.
The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs, tests and other medical products during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies, the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Gilead has said it will donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the US government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to parts of the country that need it most.
No drugs are currently FDA-approved for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”
The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.
The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects. The agency made the announcements after receiving new reports of injury and death with the medication, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about hydroxychloroquine. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given the pill-based drug were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US authorises remdesivir as emergency treatment for Covid-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted authorisation to Gilead Sciences for emergency use of its experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to treat patients with Covid-19, it said in a letter to Gilead.
During a meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating one million vials of the drug to help patients.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
The closely watched drug has moved financial markets in recent weeks, following the release of several studies that painted a mixed picture of its effectiveness.
Vice President Mike Pence said the one million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Businesses reopen in Georgia
Nearly every business in Georgia was free to reopen on Friday after being shut for weeks, in a move closely watched by the US government and other states to see if the lifting of restrictions triggers a spike in coronavirus deaths.
With about half of US states edging towards the partial lifting of shutdowns that had aimed to curb the pandemic, Georgia was trying to get back to business ahead of the others.
Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, decided against extending Georgia’s month-long shelter-in-place orders this week, enabling a full gamut of businesses to open. He approved the reopening of hair salons, gyms and other service businesses last Friday, followed by movie theatres and restaurants on Monday.
By contrast, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday all state schools including colleges would remain closed for the remainder of the academic year due to the pandemic. The coronavirus has hit New York especially hard, making it the world epicenter for the COVID-19 disease.
With stores shut, Americans are relying more heavily on home deliveries of everything from food to clothes and office equipment, giving online retailers like Amazon.com Inc a heavy workload.
Some workers at Amazon, Target Corp and Instacart Inc were staging protests and sick-outs in New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon and other states on Friday to demand a safer work environment and better pay during the outbreak.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and an adviser to President Donald Trump, said on Thursday he was concerned about states and communities reopening ahead of a timeline recommended by the White House.
But Georgia’s rush to get back to work was applauded by Michael Bowers, 55, who co-owns Bowers Watch & Clock Repair in Atlanta’s tony Buckhead neighborhood.
“We need to reopen,” he said of the business his grandfather started in the 1940s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Approval Broadens Use of COVID-19 Drug Remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 US states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
US Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US emergency approval broadens use of Gilead's COVID-19 drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Science Inc's antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
"It's the first authorised therapy for COVID-19, so we're really proud to be part of it," FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalisation stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead's trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 US states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorisation applies to patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
US Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug's limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host's immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US allows use of 1st drug shown to help virus recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — U.S. regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.
The Food and Drug Administration cleared Gilead Science’s intravenous drug for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.
“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”
The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
Dr. Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.
“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”
The FDA said preliminary results from the government study warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”
The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.
The National Institutes of Health’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.
The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs, tests and other medical products during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Gilead has said it will donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the U.S. government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to parts of the country that need it most.
No drugs are currently FDA-approved for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”
The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.
The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects. The agency made the announcements after receiving new reports of injury and death with the medication, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about hydroxychloroquine. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given the pill-based drug were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trump: FDA has approved use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US President Donald Trump says emergency use of remdesivir has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hospitalised patients who tested positive for coronavirus.
He made the announcement on Friday during a meeting with Daniel O’Day, chief executive officer of Gilead Sciences.
On Wednesday, Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company in the US, announced “positive data” in the clinical trial of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.
In a statement issued on Friday, Gilead gave details of the emergency use authorisation (EUA) process for the drug.
“The EUA will facilitate broader use of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to remdesivir at additional hospitals across the country,” it read.
“Allocation of the currently limited available supply of remdesivir will be made based on guiding principles that aim to maximize access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment, with direction from and in collaboration with the government.”
According to the statement, the use of the investigational antiviral remdesivir is authorised in patients with severe complications, while “the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.”
“Under the EUA, both 5-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorization is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process,” it added.
“The EUA allows for the distribution and emergency use of remdesivir only for the treatment of COVID-19; remdesivir remains an investigational drug and has not been approved by FDA.”
The statement also noted that the donation and distribution of remdesivir will be coordinated by the US government.
“This EUA opens the way for us to provide emergency use of remdesivir to more patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19,” O’Day, said.
“We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug’s profile.
“We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: US allows emergency use of antiviral drug remdesivir to treat patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">United States President Donald Trump on Friday issued an emergency approval for the use of remdesivir, an antiviral drug, as a treatment for patients severely ill with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the drug – designed to treat both hepatitis and a common respiratory virus – under emergency use provisions, after a clinical trial demonstrated some improvements among severely ill patients.
There are some reports on the drug, made by American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, being able to help Covid-19 patients.
“It is a really promising situation,” Trump said at the White House, according to AFP. He was also joined by Gilead’s CEO Daniel O’Day. “We are humbled with this first step for hospitalised patients,” said O’Day said. “We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of these patients getting the medicine.” The company has previously announced it was donating some 1.5 million doses for free.

The use of the drug will be authorised for adults or children who are hospitalised with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and those with a “severe” condition, meaning they have low blood oxygen levels, need oxygen therapy or are on a mechanical ventilator, the Food and Drug Administration said. Patients who receive the drug will be provided with a fact sheet, it added.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored clinical trial of the drug included over 1,000 hospitalised patients and found that those receiving remdesivir recovered faster by 31%, or about four days on an average, than those who get a placebo.
Remdesivir, which is administered by an injection, was already available to some patients in intensive care who enrolled in clinical trials, or who sought it out on a “compassionate use” basis.
The approval for the use of the drug came days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, expressed optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial.
“Although the results were clearly positive from a statistically significant standpoint, they were modest,” Fauci told NBC News on Thursday. “While it is not considered a miracle cure, remdesivir’s trial achieved a ‘proof of concept’, which could pave the way for better treatments.”
The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the United States rose by 1,883 on Saturday, taking the toll to 64,808. The total number of cases stand at 11.03 lakh, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.
Meanwhile, globally, the coronavirus has infected 33.43 lakh people and killed at least 2.38 lakh people.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antiviral drug Remdesivir cleared by US regulators for emergency use in Covid-19 cases</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York/ Washington/ Minneapolis: Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral drug remdesivir was cleared by U.S. regulators for emergency use in Covid-19 patients, becoming the first medication backed by early clinical data to be made available to fight the novel coronavirus.
Remdesivir reduced the time it took hospitalized Covid-19 patients to recover in an interim analysis of an ongoing study.The Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency-use authorization, President Donald Trump said on Friday, a step by which the agency can allow products to be used without full data on their safety and efficacy.
Gilead shares closed down 4.8% on Friday at $79.95 in New York. The company has faced questions from investors about how it plans to make money on the drug, but its stock is still up 23% this year, at a time when the rest of the market has cratered.
“This was lighting speed in terms of getting something approved,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking with Trump. “From clinical trial to getting it authorized, it was 90 days.”
Emergency use is limited to hospitalized Covid-19 patients with low blood-oxygen levels or who need breathing support, the FDA said in a statement. A U.S.-led study released this week showed patients given remdesivir, which is administered by an intravenous infusion, recovered in 11 days, on average, while those who got a placebo recovered in 15 days.
Finding a reliable therapy is important for reopening the economy and ending social-distancing measures that have resulted in millions of lost jobs, closed schools and sent the financial markets through the most turbulent period since the 2008 financial crisis. Remdesivir could help curb the coronavirus, which has infected more than a million people in the U.S., and provide a bridge to an effective vaccine.
The FDA has also authorized two malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, for use against Covid-19, but those haven’t undergone rigorous research or shown an effect against the coronavirus.

Gilead is donating 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, its entire current supply, as it continues to seek full FDA approval and clearance from regulators around the world. That would cover 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.
Gilead didn’t comment on what it plans to charge for the medication once the 1.5 million doses have been exhausted.
“Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir,” Gilead said in a statement.
The medication will be produced by Gilead and the U.S. government will coordinate its distribution.
Patients who are hospitalized and in need of oxygen support account for about 14% of Covid-19 patients, according to early studies of the outbreak. Patients on a mechanical ventilator or heart-lung bypass machine should receive it for 10 days, while those who are less sick should get it for five days, the company said.
Gilead has quickly scaled up manufacturing of remdesivir, which it wasn’t producing in January, by working with multiple partners around the world. It plans to make 500,000 treatment courses by October and double that number by December.
The company is also building a consortium of chemical and pharmaceutical companies to help produce it.
Some investors have asked how, or if, Gilead will make money on the product. Analysts asked on an earnings conference call Thursday what its long-term plans were for the drug after it dispenses an early round of the treatment for free.
“There has been no other time like this in the history of the planet,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day said on the call. “There is no rule book out there, other than that we need to be thoughtful about how we can make sure we provide access of our medicines to patients around the globe and do that in a sustainable way for the company, for shareholders, and we acknowledge that.” –Bloomberg

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Several hospitals in the US are using antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 positive patients, a media report has said.
MDedge, a medical publication, on Friday reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently the first-line therapy and Tocilizumab the second-line medication for people hospitalized with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Yale New Haven Health System, which operates hospitals across Connecticut.

“Hydroxychloroquine is first-line at Yale because in-vitro data shows potent inhibition of the virus and possible clinical benefit, which is about as good as evidence gets at the moment,” Indian-American cardiologist Nihar Desai told the medical publication.
"It's cheap, it's been used for decades, and people are relatively comfortable with it," he added.

"We are trying to do the best we can. One hopes we never have to go through anything like this (coronavirus pandemic) again," Desai told MDedge.
His home institution, Yale New Haven Hospital, is almost half full with COVID-19 patients, at more than 400, the report said.
On US President Donald Trump's request, India allowed the export of 50 million HCQ tablets to treat COVID-19 patients in America, the worst-hit country by the pandemic.
On Friday, US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
HCQ was the first drug to receive EAU from FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
US President Donald Trump has been an advocate of use of HCQ, which has reportedly cured patients in New York and several other place.
Reports indicate that the malaria drug has been effective during the initial phases of a person being infected by coronavirus but poses a danger to those having heart ailments.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South Korea said Saturday it is open to importing Remdesivir, an Ebola treatment that has emerged as a new hope in tackling the new coronavirus, if it proves to be effective through clinical tests."Health authorities are working closely with related bodies to follow up on ongoing clinical tests, while preparing to promptly import Remdesivir in case of contingencies," Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.Under local law, the KCDC can request the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to grant special permission to expedite imports of drugs that have not been approved in the domestic market.The drug has drawn keen attention since the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases earlier said its tests showed that the drug "accelerates recovery" of COVID-19 patients.The US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency approval on the pharmaceutical product to treat the new coronavirus as well.Under cooperation with the drug's maker, Gilead Sciences, three hospitals in South Korea are currently carrying out clinical tests of the drug on some 200 COVID-19 patients.Kwon said while South Korea still needs to take a wait-and-see approach on the effectiveness of the drug, it was still notable that a "reputable" organization like the US FDA issued emergency approval.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The vaccine has reportedly cured patients in New York and several other places.
Washington: Several hospitals in the US are using the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as the first-line of therapy for COVID-19 positive patients, a medical publication has reported.
MDedge on Friday reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently the first-line therapy and Tocilizumab the second-line medication for people hospitalised with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Yale-New Haven Health System, which operates hospitals across Connecticut, one of the hotspots in the US.
Hydroxychloroquine is one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs. US President Donald Trump has called hydroxychloroquine a "game-changer" drug in the fight against COVID-19.
At Trump's request, India last month allowed the export of 50 million HCQ tablets to treat COVID-19 patients in America, the worst-hit country by the pandemic.
"Hydroxychloroquine is first-line at Yale because in-vitro data shows potent inhibition of the virus and possible clinical benefit, which is about as good as evidence gets at the moment," Indian-American cardiologist Nihar Desai told the medical publication.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Remdesivir update: FDA issues EUA for COVID-19 treatment days after clinical trial results</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By NewsDesk  @infectiousdiseasenews
On Wednesday, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that preliminary data analysis from a clinical trial on the investigational antiviral drug, remdesivir, showed hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19 and lung involvement who received the drug recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo.
The same day, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) head, Dr. Anthony Fauci said, “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut and significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery”. He called the early findings from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases “highly significant.”
On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease.
“FDA’s emergency authorization of remdesivir, two days after the National Institutes of Health’s clinical trial showed promising results, is a significant step forward in battling COVID-19 and another example of the Trump Administration moving as quickly as possible to use science to save lives,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “NIH, FDA, and scientists across America and around the world have worked tirelessly with patients to get us this new potential treatment for COVID-19. The seamless cooperation between government and private industry under the President’s all-of-America approach to COVID-19 is getting treatment options to patients in record time.”
The EUA allows for remdesivir to be distributed in the U.S. and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease. Severe disease is defined as patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator.
Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating COVID-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug’s use.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US issues emergency approval for remdesivir for COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
The experimental drug remdesivir has been authorized by US regulators for emergency use against COVID-19, President Donald Trump announced Friday.
It comes after the antiviral made by Gilead Sciences was shown in a major clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some coronavirus patients, the first time any medicine has had a proven benefit against the disease.
“It is really a really promising situation,” Trump said at the White House, where he was joined by Gilead’s CEO Daniel O’Day.
“We are humbled with this first step for hospitalized patients,” said O’Day, adding: “We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of these patients getting the medicine.”
The company has previously announced it was donating some 1.5 million doses for free.
This amounts to about 140,000 treatment courses based on a 10-day treatment duration.
Remdesivir, which is administered by an injection, was already available to some patients who enrolled in clinical trials, or who sought it out on a “compassionate use” basis.
The new move allows it to be distributed far more widely and used in both adults and children who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19.
The Food and Drug Administration, which authorized the approval, defines severe as having low blood oxygen levels, requiring oxygen therapy, or being on a ventilator.
The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced the results of a trial involving more than 1,000 people on Wednesday.
It found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress got better quicker than those on a placebo.
Specifically, patients on the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery.
“Although the results were clearly positive from a statistically significant standpoint, they were modest,” Anthony Fauci, the scientist who leads the NIAID told NBC News on Thursday.
While not considered a miracle cure, remdesivir’s trial achieved a “proof of concept,” according to Fauci that could pave the way for better treatments.
Remdesivir incorporates itself into the virus’s genome, short circuiting its replication process.
It was first developed to treat Ebola, a viral hemorrhagic fever, but did not boost survival rates as other medicines.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. emergency approval broadens use of Gilead's COVID-19 drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington – Gilead Science Inc.’s antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31 percent compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 U.S. states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26 percent so far this year, were up 2.7 percent at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON - U.S. regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.
The Food and Drug Administration cleared Gilead Science’s intravenous drug for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.
“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”
The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
Dr. Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug's benefit.
“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”
The FDA said preliminary results from the government study warranted Friday's decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”
The drug's side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.
The National Institutes of Health’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.
The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs, tests and other medical products during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment's potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Gilead has said it will donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the U.S. government would co-ordinate distribution of remdesivir to parts of the country that need it most.
No drugs are currently FDA-approved for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”
The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.
The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects. The agency made the announcements after receiving new reports of injury and death with the medication, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about hydroxychloroquine. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given the pill-based drug were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US regulators authorized Sunday emergency use of a coronavirus antibody test that is more than 99% accurate, addressing concerns about high false positive rates that have plagued some of the first tests.
The test is made by Roche, a Swiss giant in the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries. Roche said Sunday it will boost its manufacturing to produce "high double-digit millions per month" of the test.
Antibodies are proteins created by the body's immune system to fight invading threats, like viruses or bacteria. Antibody testing is seen by many as a critical step into reopening the economy. Some have floated ideas of using the tests to issue some form of "immunity passports," which could allow people with the antibodies to return to work. 
Roche stated the test has a 100% sensitivity rating and a 99.8% specificity rating, which are significantly higher than some of the first antibody tests that were cleared for use in the US. The results came from using more than 5,000 samples on its test.
It will take about 18 minutes to process a single test, with Roche's devices able to run up to 300 tests per hour in an automated fashion, the company said. 
One recent study found several of these tests are less than 90% accurate. Combined with Roche's ability to mass-manufacture millions of tests, this new test should help address the issue of false positive results, where a test may tell someone they have the antibodies when they actually do not.
Another medical diagnostics giant, Abbott, has been using its antibody test for the past few weeks in the US. Abbot says its test is 99% accurate, based on testing about 1,000 samples.

Even if fully accurate, antibody testing still faces several critical unknowns that may limit the usefulness of these tests.
First, it is not yet known for sure that having antibodies equals protection. For most viruses, having antibodies means being protected from future infections. But studies have yet to be done on the novel coronavirus proving this to be the case, and there have been some reports of potential reinfection.
Even if antibodies give a degree of protection from the virus, researchers do not know how long that protection will last. This could be another critical limitation if antibody protection lasts for months instead of years. 
Finally, it is still unknown what percentage of the US or world population has already been infected with the coronavirus. Reliable and widespread antibody testing can help answer this question.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA grants emergency approval to Swiss firm's coronavirus antibody test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for an antibody coronavirus test developed by Roche Holding AG, the Swiss healthcare company said in a statement Sunday.
The tests are used to determine whether a person has been infected with the novel coronavirus and developed antibodies against it. State and federal officials have touted the tests as a way to help guide decisions about how to safely reopen parts of the U.S.  
Roche Holding AG said that its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, had a 99.8 percent specificity rate and a sensitivity rate of 100 percent based on a sampling of 5,272 people. 
The company said that it would begin ramping up production of the tests to the "high double-digit millions per month" to serve countries accepting them. The firm has already started shipping the tests to some laboratories. 
“Thanks to the enormous efforts of our dedicated colleagues we are now able to deliver a high-quality antibody test in high quantities, so we can support healthcare systems around the world with an important tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis,” Roche Group CEO Severin Schwan said in a statement.
”I am in particular pleased about the high specificity and sensitivity of our test, which is crucial to support health care systems around the world with a reliable tool to better manage the COVID-19 health crisis.”
Multiple companies, including US-based Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Co, and Italy’s DiaSorin, have reportedly received emergency approval from the FDA for their antibody tests.
The rush to develop the tests, however, has produced fears about inaccurate results. The House Oversight and Reform Committee recently released a report that showed the FDA allowed numerous antibody tests on the market without review. The committee said it resulted in hundreds of flawed tests that are still available on the market, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions about whether someone has immunity to COVID-19. 
Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, told The Hill last week that he wants the agency to clear the market of any unauthorized test. 
In its news release, Roche said that its sampling showed no cross-reactivity to the four human coronaviruses causing a common cold, reducing the chance of false positives. The company previously said that its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies, Reuters reported.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Company behind new FDA-approved coronavirus antibody aims to produce millions of kits by June</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Food and Drug Administration continues to expedite its approval time for technology that should help combat the coronavirus pandemic.
This time, the FDA cleared a coronavirus antibody test produced by Swiss diagnostics giant Roche for emergency use, the company said Sunday. The test identifies via blood samples antibodies made by the body to fight off the coronavirus. It could therefore determine whether a person had been infected with the virus in the past, even if the infection subsided.
There are questions about the accuracy of many available commercial antibody tests so far, but they're considered crucial for better understanding both the true extent of the pandemic, as well as possible length of immunity to the virus. Roche, at least, doesn't have those concerns about its product, saying its test has proven 100 percent accurate at detecting antibodies in the blood and 99.8 percent accurate at ruling out the presence of those antibodies. Thom Schinecker, who leads the company's diagnostics business, said they were able to run its test on 6,000 blood samples, which is a much higher number than its smaller competitors.
Additionally, Roche's infrastructure will allow it to increase production of the test quickly, and its kits are also designed to run on Roche automated machines, which are already installed in more than 100 labs throughout the U.S. The company is determined to dispense test kits in the "high double-digit millions" by June, and double that by the end of the year.

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test is designed to determine if a patient has been exposed to the coronavirus and has developed antibodies against it, Roche said on Sunday.
Governments are trying to learn how many people have been exposed to Covid-19 as they reopen economies and end social-distancing measures. The restrictions have resulted in millions of lost jobs, closed schools and businesses and sent the financial markets through the most turbulent period since the 2008 financial crisis.
With no vaccine available yet for the novel coronavirus, more than 100 different programs have been launched to develop and test treatments. These include everything from antiviral drugs and antibody-containing plasma from recovered patients, to traditional Chinese herbal medicine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche gets US FDA emergency use nod for COVID-19 antibody test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roche Holding AG received emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said in a statement on Sunday.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests, to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies.
Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to "high double-digit millions" per month.
The Basel-based company, which also makes separate molecular tests to identify people with active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity rate of about 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%.
These rates help determine if a patient has been exposed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and if the patient has developed antibodies against it.
Other companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories , Becton Dickinson and Co, Italy's DiaSorin have also developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
Diasorin and Abbott recently got U.S. emergency authorization for their tests.
Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand COVID-19, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity.
In developing its test, Roche scrutinized some existing products for reliability before rejecting them, its chief executive, Severin Schwan, had earlier said.
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result.
It declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies.
Roche has said its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the human body, suggesting possible immunity.
As demand escalates for blood antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established competency in medical testing have joined experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
The rush to obtain, advertise and find buyers for test kits follows the FDA's decision to allow any company to sell antibody tests in the country without prior review by the agency.
This comes after the agency faced criticism that it did not act quickly enough with diagnostic tests.
FDA has said the aim of its policy is to provide laboratories and healthcare providers early access to the tests, but that it will adjust the approach as needed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche COVID-19 antibody test gets emergency FDA approval</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roche Holding AG became the latest company to win emergency US approval for a coronavirus antibody test and promised a fast scale-up of the tool that policy makers hope will smooth the reopening of economies.
The Swiss giant expects production of the test to reach the high double-digit millions by June and pass the 100 million monthly threshold later this year. The test looks for antibodies in blood that have been raised to fight off the virus that causes Covid-19.
Roche's version runs on a high-volume instrument that can produce a single result in 18 minutes and as many as 300 results in an hour, the company said in a statement Sunday after receiving emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
"Our people have been working in operations day and night to make sure we have all the products," Thomas Schinecker, head of Roche's diagnostics unit, said in a phone interview.
Antibody testing could help pinpoint which people have already been exposed to the virus, potentially giving them some immunity to it. It could also help determine how widely the disease has spread, since the molecular testing that's been around since January - and used to confirm more than 3 million infections globally - can't show who had the disease weeks or months ago.
While it's still unclear how strong immunity will be for different people - or how long it will last - knowing who has already fought off the virus could nonetheless show how vulnerable regions are to future outbreak waves. The pandemic probably won't be controlled until about two-thirds of the world's population is immune, according to a report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
Roche's antibody test has demonstrated a "specificity" of more than 99.8% and a "sensitivity" of 100% when validated against over 5,000 blood samples taken from people 14 days after their Covid-19 cases were confirmed using molecular testing, Roche said.
If a test can reliably identify positive samples, it's considered highly sensitive. If it can identify negatives, it's called specific. That means it knows the difference between Covid-19 antibodies and others raised by, say, another coronavirus that causes the common cold.

Governments are trying to learn how many people have been exposed to the virus as they wind down social-distancing measures. The restrictions on businesses have cost millions their jobs and the global economy is on course for its deepest dive since the Great Depression.
Countries including the U.K. and parts of the U.S. were so eager for antibody tests early on that they bought versions that didn't work. Most of the earliest versions on the market came from small players, but now bigger companies with strong reputations are bringing out their own versions - including Roche and Abbott Laboratories. The U.S. FDA has granted emergency use approval to about a dozen of these tests.
Roche's test is also cleared for countries accepting Europe's CE marking, the company said.
With no vaccine available yet for the novel coronavirus, there have been proposals that people who have antibodies could be issued an "immunity passport" that would allow them to travel or return to work, on the assumption that they're safe from re-infection. Yet the World Health Organization has cautioned on the level of protection against a second infection that people who have recovered from Covid-19 will have.
In addition to the search for a vaccine, more than 100 different programs have been launched to develop and test treatments. These include everything from antiviral drugs and antibody-containing plasma from recovered patients, to traditional Chinese herbal medicine.
Gilead Sciences Inc.'s antiviral drug remdesivir has been cleared by US regulators for emergency use in Covid-19 patients, becoming the first medication backed by early clinical data to be made available to fight the disease.
Once any resistance to the coronavirus is better understood, Roche's new test could help assess who has built up immunity, Roche said. For now, the tests will probably go first to health-care workers and their families, along with people who have already had the disease and those who think they may have had it, Schinecker said.
"There are people that think they had the flu in February, and now they're not sure - did they have the flu or something else?" Schinecker said. "Most likely these people will be tested, and then over time you can see how this develops - are they immune, or are they not immune?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA Grants Emergency Authorization To Roche Antibody Tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pharmaceutical and diagnostic company Roche said Sunday that its coronavirus antibody test was granted emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, and that it can churn out over 100 million of the kits by the end of this year, as governments search for ways to safely reopen communities and let people go back to work.
An antibody test can detect whether a person has had the coronavirus, according to the Wall Street Journal, which experts hope will mean protection against the virus moving forward.
It’s unclear if⁠—or for how long⁠—antibodies can prevent repeated infections of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the virus is new and scientists are still learning about it, the WSJ reported.
Roche says its test is 100% accurate in detecting the presence of antibodies, and 99.8% effective in ruling out the presence of antibodies, which means very few false positive results.
Roche’s test relies on an intravenous blood draw as opposed to a finger prick, Reuters reported.
According to the WSJ, most commercially-available antibody tests aren’t accurate enough.
Roche has already begun shipping its test to labs around the world, CNBC reported.
“Testing these people….is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity,” Thomas Shinecker, Roche’s head of diagnostics, told Reuters. 
6,000. That’s how many blood samples Roche tested for antibodies, Shinecker told the WSJ. Roche was able to test a significantly higher number of samples compared to its rivals, the WSJ said.
Antibody testing is seen by governments around the world as one key to reopening economies, as the results can provide insight into the spread of coronavirus⁠—especially mild or asymptomatic cases, the WSJ reported. Some governments are looking into whether to issue “immunity passports” to people who have antibodies, which could let those individuals return to work sooner. There is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus (although antiviral remdesivir, also granted emergency FDA authorization over the weekend, appeared to shorten recovery time in a federal trial).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: World lights up to thank 'heroes' working to combat COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Updates in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC/GMT)
05:22 Swiss drugmaker Roche says it has been granted emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its coronavirus antibody test.  Such blood tests have been seen by governments and businesses as a potentially important tool in working out who has contracted the virus, and who may be immune, as countries move towards lifting lockdowns.
The Basel-based company had previously pledged to make the test, called Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, available by early May. It requires an intravenous blood draw, and is designed to determine if a patient has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and if they have developed antibodies against it. Roche said it had already started shipping the tests to laboratories around the world, with plans to "ramp up production capacity to the high double-digit millions per month."
04:49 The coronavirus death toll in Japan has surpassed 500. According to official figures cited by local broadcaster NHK, the number of fatalities now stands at 530, with more than 15,000 confirmed cases.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to decide Monday whether to extend the nationwide state of emergency, which is set to expire on May 6.
While citizens are encouraged to stay home, and many shops and businesses are closed, Japan has resisted imposing the kind of strict lockdown measures seen in some other countries. People have still been allowed to go out to parks and beaches, as well as to crowded places such as games halls.
04:04 The Australian state of Victoria has seen its biggest jump in new cases in several weeks while the country's most populous state, New South Wales, is dealing with a cluster of infections at an old people's care facility.
Thirteen new cases have been registered in Victoria, health officials said, with six of the infections related to a meat processing facility in the state’s capital, Melbourne.
"What I'm worried about is the unknown unknowns," Victoria's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said, pleading for more people to get tested. She added: "We want to make sure that if we have cases that are positive in the community we can identify those individuals... this is how we are going to defeat the virus."
In New South Wales there were four new infections, two of which were reported at the Newmarch aged care facility in Sydney, where more than 60 people have contracted the novel virus, resulting in 14 deaths.
03:57 The number of confirmed cases in Germany has increased by 793 to 162,496, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases has revealed.
This represented a decrease of 152 on the previous day's amount of new infections as the number of daily cases in Germany continues to steadily decline.
The reported death toll rose by 74 bringing the total number of fatalities to 6,649.
02:49 China has reported two new cases in its daily COVID-19 update, up from one the day before, the country's national health authority has revealed.
One case was imported and the other was local, the National Health Commission (NHC) said. The NHC also reported 12 asymptomatic cases for May 2, down from 20 in the previous day's update.
China has recorded 82,877 cases in total since the outbreak first emerged in the city of Wuhan while the country's death toll currently stands at 4,633.
The Chinese government has taken a number of stringent measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including blocking almost all foreigners from entering the country and sharply curtailing the number of international flights.
02:08 German Health Minister Jens Spahn has raised ethical questions over the possibility of issuing so-called "immunity passports" to those who had already been infected with the novel coronavirus.
Spahn expressed his concerns in a letter to the Ethics Council in Germany, according to newspaper Bild am Sonntag. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politician said it is "a matter of concern to him that the ethical aspects" are met while there were still questions over "how and in what context the proof of an immunity should be used."
"Immunity passports" could be a way for key workers to get back to work as they will have developed the antibodies necessary to give them protection from the virus that has infected almost 3.5 million people worldwide.
However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently said it was yet to be convinced on the idea of any such certification being issued.
01:25 The United States has registered 1,435 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 66,364, significantly more any other country in the world.
The Johns Hopkins University has stated that more than 1.1 million infections have occurred in the country, having recorded its first case on January 20.
01:22 Doctors treating British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for coronavirus last month were prepared to announce his death after he was taken into intensive care, he told the Sun on Sunday newspaper.
"It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it," he said. "They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin'-type scenario."
"I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong."
The British PM first announced he had contracted the virus on March 27 but at the time was only displaying mild symptoms.
However, the following week it became apparent that his condition had deteriorated sufficiently for him to be admitted to hospital, where soon after he was moved to intensive care.
Johnson spent three days on "oxygen support," and admitted after his discharge on April 12 that his battle "could have gone either way."
The 55-year-old and his partner Carrie Symonds announced the arrival of their newborn son earlier this week and said the child would bear the names of "the two doctors that saved Boris' life," Symonds said.

01:17 Mexico's health ministry reported 1,349 new cases of the novel coronavirus on May 2, bringing the total number of infections in the country to over 22,000. The country also reported 89 more deaths, which brought the total death toll to over 2,000.
00:48 Panama has recorded 370 new cases, bringing its total to 7,090, and 197 deaths, the health ministry said. The ministry said the increase was partly because of ramping up testing.
In addition, Luis Sucre, Panama's health vice minister, said about a quarter of all tests performed had come back positive.
"This tells us that we're not meeting our required objectives for this phase," said Sucre.
00:02 The Eiffel Tower joined other famous landmarks around the world on Saturday in capping a sparkling tribute to those fighting against COVID-19. The initiative was first launched by the Empire State Building in New York last month.
At 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), the Paris monument lit up in "sparkling white" to hail "the unfailing courage of care workers confronting the coronavirus pandemic," said SETE, the firm that manages the Eiffel Tower.
The nine-day #HeroesShineBright initiative first began on April 24 in New York. Each night a different color is shone into the night sky to express gratitude towards healthcare staff, transit workers, and police or military personnel, SETE said.
Other landmarks that have seen similar acts are the Euromast in Rotterdam, the 360 Observation Deck in Chicago, the UAE'S Burj Khalifa, the CN Tower in Toronto, the Macao tower in China, the Busan Tower in South Korea, the Ostankino TV Tower in Russia, the Tallinn TV Tower in Estonia and the OVNI Tower in Slovakia.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can antibody tests help tackle COVID-19?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The story so far: In the COVID-19 fight, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had advised States to use antibody testing for surveillance and reiterated that the focus has always been on real time RT-PCR (or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests for diagnosis. The rapid testing kits that State governments had been using to detect antibodies to the novel coronavirus were throwing up unreliable results. In Rajasthan for example, rapid testing kits failed to detect antibodies even when the laboratories had confirmed patients to be COVID-19 positive.
There are two ways to detect the presence of a virus, directly or indirectly. Antibody tests, also called serological tests, have usually been the time-tested approach to finding out the presence of a virus in the body. They do so by detecting the presence and quantity of antibodies that are produced by the immune system to battle an infection. It is an indirect test because it cannot find the virus, but it can determine if the immune system has encountered it.
Antibodies can show up between nine to 28 days after an infection has set in; by that time, an infected person, if not isolated, can spread the disease. Sometimes the antibodies may be produced in response to a closely-related pathogen and sometimes they may not be the right kind to counter the infection. These are the factors that can make an antibody test erroneous.
In an RT-PCR test, a nasal or throat swab is taken from a patient suspected of having the disease. The test involves extracting RNA or ribonucleic acid, the genetic material of the virus, and checking if it shares the same genetic sequence as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If it is a match, the sample is deemed positive. The only way such tests turn negative is if the actual sample does not have the virus or the swab was not properly administered and too little of the virus was gleaned.
As the sequencing of genomes is now widespread and the technology well understood by experts in several countries, China, and subsequently others, were quickly able to determine the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and learn what differentiates it from related viruses. This is why it was possible to prepare accurate tests to detect the virus relatively quickly, almost in the middle of a pandemic, and the RT-PCR tests began to be followed as the ‘gold standard’ in detecting the virus. As not enough research hours have been spent studying the antibodies and the profile of recovered patients, the antibody tests we have for COVID-19 are imperfect.
Antibody tests are fast and relatively inexpensive. The current RT-PCR technology requires RNA extracting machines, a specialised laboratory, and trained technicians. And at least a minimum of 30 samples are needed to make the process economically viable. The tests are done in batches and it can take up to four hours to confidently test for the presence of a virus from a batch. If one adds the time taken to isolate the RNA from swabs, this could again take a couple of hours. The scale of logistics involved can mean that it can practically take a day for results from a sample to be known. If one adds the cost of chemicals needed to perform these tests and the vagaries of importing practically every element of the paraphernalia involved, in the midst of a pandemic when demand far exceeds supply, it results in the test not being cheap. It can cost at least ₹4,500 depending on whether one is tested at a public or privately-run facility. Antibody tests are portable, can be administered on-site, conducted en masse and give quick answers. However, these answers are useful in-so-far as those who are using them are asking the right questions.
Given that they are not useful for directly detecting the presence of the virus, antibody tests can be used to gauge the extent of infection in a community or a large group of people who may have had exposure to the virus. Much like pregnancy detection kits, rapid-test kits change colour when particular molecules are detected. Two kinds of antibodies result from an infection: Immunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G (IgM and IgG). In response to an infection, the IgM is first produced within a week of infection. Two weeks later, the levels of IgM reduce and are replaced by IgG. The latter is a longer-lasting antibody and, depending on the infectious agent involved, can offer different durations of immunity. Antibodies to the chickenpox virus last for decades. Those to influenza viruses and even other coronaviruses (that cause the common cold) last no more than a year or two. This is why people need flu shots at regular intervals, and one of the reasons why it is practically pointless to have a vaccine for the common cold. It is too early in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to determine how long immunity lasts. Nevertheless the presence of IgM, IgG can in a sample of the population determine whether the virus is present in certain clusters. Ideally, this can help government authorities decide on what regions in a lockdown can be opened up if the aim is to get regular life back on track as soon as possible.
This is what happened when infections had reached frightening proportions in the United States and Europe. It was apparent that the limitations of the RT-PCR combined with the virus’s ability to spread even through those who were not visibly sick would mean large numbers would be infected without being detected. Rapid antibody tests can also play a role in determining the degree of “herd immunity” in a population. That is, the true number who may have been infected; when a sizeable fraction of the population has been infected, the virus ceases its pace of spread. Current research expects herd immunity to have been achieved when 55% to 80% of the population has been infected — only careful serological surveys can establish that. Studies in India too have shown that for every symptomatic positive, there are two asymptomatic or presymptomatics (those who do not visibly manifest the disease). Thus, antibody tests could also be used for such estimates in India. The ICMR had laid out the strategy to use antibody tests to gauge the degree of COVID-19 presence in the country. The plan involved using a combination of both RT-PCR and antibody tests to establish infection levels.
Two Chinese companies, Wondfo and Livzon, got licences to sell 500,000 rapid antibody kits to the ICMR. Several of these were to be given to States and some were for the ICMR’s own use. A first batch was deployed in some States and soon complaints began pouring in over inaccurate results. The ICMR then asked States to stop using these kits for two days. After two days, the ICMR advised States to stop using the kits altogether. The Health Ministry has cancelled the licences given to the companies that were importing these kits from China. So far, the ICMR has not clarified what was wrong with the kits. The Chinese companies have also claimed that the kits were validated by the ICMR’s expert body, the National Institute of Virology (NIV). However, the NIV only clears batches of kits that are submitted for testing. It is possible that even if a company’s kits get cleared, it ends up supplying kits on the field that are not up to the mark.
Another feature of the kits is their sensitivity (in percentage terms, the times the tests correctly identify people as positive for an infection) and specificity (in percentage terms, the times the test correctly rules out those not carrying the virus). Specificity refers to its ability to accurately distinguish between the target virus and other viruses. It is a well-established feature of tests that in regions of low actual prevalence of a disease, they can, depending on the kit’s specificity and sensitivity, miscategorise vast numbers of those tested. It is not clear if these were factored in in tests using kits blamed as faulty by States. India is not the only place where complaints over Chinese kits have been raised. The United Kingdom and Spain have also raised such issues with these kits. In either event, there is no clarity if the ICMR has ordered more kits. The Health Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, has said that by the end of May, the country will have kits that are made in India for antibody and RT-PCR tests.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The development comes as the US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the use of remdesivir, a drug originally developed to treat Ebola. It will be used on people hospitalised with COVID-19. A recent trial showed that remdesivir helps shorten the recovery time, however, it doesn’t improve survival rates.
US scientists working for the military have designed a COVID-19 test that could potentially identify virus carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, The Guardian reported. Researchers hope that their creation will be able to detect the virus as early as 24 hours after an individual is infected – 4 days earlier than existing tests. Unlike nasal swab tests that hunt for the virus itself, the new test looks at the body’s response to the disease.
The project developed by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was initially designed to quickly detect germ and chemical warfare poisoning, but was repurposed after the coronavirus outbreak. It will be now be evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration and should it be approved it could become the absolute gamechanger, said Dr Brad Ringeisen, head of DARPA’s biological technologies office. "The concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide", said Ringeisen.
The development comes as some countries prepare to ease lockdown measures introduced to curb the spread of the virus. Opponents of lifting restrictions say this may bring a second wave of the outbreak.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan tested for coronavirus and forced to miss Good Morning Britain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan has been forced to pull out of the show on Monday, after being tested for coronavirus.
Piers confirmed on Twitter that in the past 48 hours he has suffered mild symptoms, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, Piers will remain of the show until his test results confirm whether or not he has the virus.
He told his followers: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I’ve had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."
Piers revealed he is still awaiting the test results, which should come in tomorrow.
The host, alongside co-presenter Susanna Reid, has been keeping GMB viewers up to date with all the latest COVID-19 news.
It's not yet confirmed when he will be back on the show.
Piers didn't go into what symptoms he had experienced, but did reveal he was going by medical advice.
His friend Susanna was forced to miss two weeks of GMB at the start of lockdown measures being introduced in March, after her son had a cough.
She soon returned, and Piers upped his episodes to four a week and has been vowing to get the answers the public wants on COVID-19.
After posting the news on Twitter, Piers was met with a huge response from his followers.
One fan tweeted: "I hope you’re well Piers. We need you!"
Another said: "Hope all is well Piers we need you."
Others commented on the fact Piers had been in the GMB studio for weeks, so were concerned over whether he should have been there.
But Piers had only began experiencing "mild symptoms" in the past 48 hours and wasn't on the show on Friday.
It's not currently known who will cover for Piers on Monday morning.
In recent weeks Piers has been praised by viewers amid heated interviews with those in government, amid the ongoing COVID crisis.
Just last week, Piers called out MPs over the testing shortages after Matt Hancock's promise to hit 100,000 tests a day.
As the number strayed from this amount for several days, Piers questioned how they planned to meet their promise.
At the end of the week, it was claimed the government had met this number, but on Sunday the amount dropped again it was reported.
Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Piers Morgan off Good Morning Britain to await test result</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Piers Morgan has said he will temporarily step back from presenting Good Morning Britain after developing a "mild" coronavirus symptom.
The ITV programme will be hosted by Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid, as Mr Morgan awaits test results on Monday, he said.
In a tweet, Mr Morgan said he was acting "on medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution".
Last week, he was cleared of breaching TV watchdog Ofcom's rules after 4,000 complaints about his questioning.
During an animated interview, he asked care minister Helen Whately for the number of health workers and care workers who had died from the illness.
She accused him of "shouting at me and not giving me a chance to answer your questions" and "attempting to score points".
Mr Morgan defended his approach, saying it was not as "uncomfortable" as the conditions for the carers on the front line of the coronavirus crisis.
The presenter has also attracted positive publicity recently, as one of the famous faces taking on the 2.6 challenge, which replaced the London Marathon and raised money for struggling charities.

Good Morning Britain, which Piers hosts alongside Susanna Reid, has been continuing to air every day amid the coronavirus crisis, giving updates and practical advice during the UK lockdown.
Piers has also been a cheerleader for the NHS during their fight against the pandemic, which has seen more than 186,000 cases reported in hospitals.
The reporter has on several occasions clashed with politicians on the show over their handling of the coronavirus spread, their lack of preparation for it, and the lack of PPE equipment.
Thousands of viewers complained after a recent interview involving care minister MP Helen Whately, who appeared to snigger when talking about the possible 4000 coronavirus related care home deaths that had gone unreported.
He was later cleared of being ‘combative’ by Ofcom and the complaints were not followed up.
Another flood of complaints to watchdog Ofcom came after his interview with MP Victoria Atkins, the safeguarding minister. His line of questioning was later backed up by Susanna.
Typically on the show on Mondays to Wednesdays, Piers announced he would also be present every Thursday as coverage of the crisis continued.
At the beginning of April, he revealed his 19-year-old son Albert was believed to have had the virus, losing his sense of taste or smell, but was now OK.
It’s not yet known who will replace Piers on the show.
Metro.co.uk has contacted Good Morning Britain reps for comment.
There are now more than 186,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, with more than 28,000 deaths.
Good Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan tested for coronavirus after developing ‘mild’ symptom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan said he will be temporarily stepping back from the programme after developing a “mild” coronavirus symptom.
The programme will be hosted by ITV presenter Ben Shephard alongside Susanna Reid as Mr Morgan waits for his test results, which are due on Monday.
Mr Morgan said in a tweet: “On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in the past 48 hours, I’ve had a test for Covid-19 and so won’t be working on Good Morning Britain until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow.”
This week, Mr Morgan was cleared of breaching TV watchdog Ofcom’s rules after attracting more than 3,000 complaints over his “combative” questioning of care minister Helen Whately in two interviews.
During an animated interview, he asked Ms Whately for the number of health workers and care workers who had died from the illness.
She accused him of “shouting at me and not giving me a chance to answer your questions” and “attempting to score points”.
Mr Morgan defended his approach, saying it was not as “uncomfortable” as the conditions for the carers on the front line of the coronavirus crisis.
Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock on April 16, who accused him of constantly interrupting him.
Mr Morgan has also attracted positive publicity in recent weeks, as one of the famous faces taking on the 2.6 challenge which replaced the London Marathon, and raised money for struggling charities last Sunday.
A host of huge names, including Sir Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and David Haye went through a workout, led by Piers Morgan, in aid of the Ruth Strauss Foundation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan to miss Good Morning Britain as he waits on coronavirus test results</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan will not appear on the popular show after undergoing testing for Covid-19 on medical advice
The divisive presenter told his 7.4 million Twitter followers he won't be returning to the ITV programme until he has been cleared by doctors.
Piers announced he had taken a test "out of an abundance of caution" but reassured fans that his symptoms were "mild", reports Chronicle Live.
Tonight (May 3), he tweeted: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I’ve had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."
Under new government guidelines, NHS Covid-19 tests are now available to all key workers and those who do work which cannot be done outside the home.
As a broadcaster carrying out public service journalism work, Piers is among those classed as an "essential worker".

Public testing for the deadly virus has become a key issue for the government in recent weeks.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed to have passed the target of 100,000 tests per day, although the figure includes testing kits posted to people's homes, whether or not they have been used yet.
But on Sunday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted fewer people might have died if testing capacity had reached these levels earlier.
More than 28,000 people have now died after testing positive for the virus in the UK - the third highest number in the world.
While in Bristol, 160 have lost their lives after being diagnosed with the illness.
Frequently controversial host Piers has been a vocal critic of both government policy and individuals breaking lockdown rules during the Covid-19 crisis.
He recently divided opinion with a furious tirade at Care Minister, Helen Whately, who he accused of failing to answer important questions on deaths in care homes and of frontline NHS workers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Piers Morgan coronavirus fears: GMB host tweets he is taking time off 'out of an abundance of caution' while he awaits results of a Covid-19 test after feeling unwell</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Piers Morgan will be taking some time off Good Morning Britain while he awaits the results of a coronavirus test.
The presenter, 55, started feeling unwell over the weekend and will stay off the programme 'out of an abundance of caution'.
He had been going into the west London studio every morning, doing his own make-up and sitting two metres away from co-host Susanna Reid.
Mr Morgan tweeted on Sunday night: 'UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won't be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow.' 
It comes after Ms Reid self-isolated at her London home for two weeks in March following a member of her household developing symptoms of the bug.
Mr Morgan, who is usually on the show with Ms Reid from Monday to Wednesday, has been one of the strongest voices holding the government to account during the crisis.
Since the country was put in lockdown on March 23, he has become the interviewer ministers fear most due to his ruthless scrutinising of the facts.
He has spoken truth to power at every turn, including fiercely questioning decisions made by both the UK and US governments.
In an article for MailOnline on Thursday, the columnist branded Prime Minister Boris Johnson's first press briefing back after beating Covid 'complete and utter bullsh*t'.
He said Mr Johnson's speech had made US President Donald Trump seem credible and that his Brexit strategy cannot be used to beat the virus.
Mr Morgan wrote: 'When Boris fans, the vast majority of them with union jack flags and Brexit slogans in their profiles, scream abuse at me all day long on Twitter for challenging their hero's coronavirus strategy, they do so because to them, any criticism of the government over this crisis is a re-run of the viciously toxic and partisan Brexit campaign.'
He added: 'None of Boris Johnson's political skills that won him the Referendum and December's election are working like they did before the virus struck.'
The journalist pointed to a chart that was shown at the end of the briefing on the 'Global Death Comparision'.
He spotted how it showed the UK was trending to be the second worst hit country in the world for Covid-19 deaths.
On Sunday the number of fatalities in Britain rose by 315 to 28,446, putting it on course to become the hardest hit in Europe.
Its toll is now 264 behind Italy - the continent's original epicentre - which it will likely overtake tomorrow to suffer the second highest fatalities in the world after the US.
Mr Johnson was not the only world leader Mr Morgan has targeted, with him going toe-to-toe with President Trump over the US's coronavirus strategy.
The presenter has repeatedly called out Mr Trump's approach to the bug, which has rampaged across the US and killed more than 65,000 people.
This culminating in him saying Mr Trump was 'batsh*t crazy' for his handling of the crisis.
The US President faced widespread ridicule after he suggested tackling coronavirus with the use of 'powerful' UV light or even injecting patients with disinfectant. 
Starting his column by telling Mr Trump to 'shut the f*** up', Mr Morgan admonished the President for using his position to air the 'batsh*t crazy theories'.
The presenter later announced Mr Trump had unfollowed him on Twitter.
Mr Morgan's approach to politicians was vindicated last week when OFCOM  cleared him for his 'combative' style.
The GMB host attracted more than 3,000 complaints from two interviews with care minister Helen Whately on the show last month.
Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview with Health Secretary Matt Hancock on April 16.
But Ofcom said: 'It is clearly in the public interest that broadcasters are able to hold those making political decisions to account.'
Mr Morgan grilled Ms Whately about the number of NHS and care workers who have died from Covid-19 and accused her of 'massively understating' the effects of the virus.
In the interview Mrs Whately claimed 76 NHS and care workers had died from the disease, to which the host replied: 'You see these numbers again, are completely wrong.
'The real figure of all the people who work in the NHS and care homes who have died is actually 111.'
Mr Hancock was challenged by the MailOnline columnist on whether he would volunteer for a salary reduction.
During the exchange on April 16, Morgan was also angered when the politician claimed the Government was prepared for the pandemic, telling him: 'Stop playing that game with me, Mr Hancock. You're buying yourself a bit of time.'
Mr Morgan said he would have 'admired' Mr Hancock more if he would have just admitted that the Department of Health 'had not been prepared' for the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the National Health Service.
He added: 'Your resolute refusal to concede you made any mistakes here grates with me and misjudges the public mood'.
The pair continued to clash as Morgan chastised Mr Hancock, reminding him he runs the show after the politician urged him to 'let him speak', during the interview.
On Good Morning Britain Mr Morgan said of the watchdog investigation: 'They have not held up any of the complaints. I'm glad about that.
'Freedom of speech matters and journalists doing their job matters. Getting the government to think about every decision they are taking matters, holding them to account matters.
'We do our job they do theirs. But we are all on the same side here and we shouldn't mistake challenging government's with wanting government to fail. 
'I want our government to succeed. We do this challenging everyday with ministers to help them make better decisions, so that fewer people die. 
'We are on the same side against the same enemy. It's not a referendum, its not an election, its one virus against the world.'
It is not clear who will step in for Mr Morgan while he is off.

​Since the UK was put on lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak on 23 March, Morgan has been interviewing ministers about the way the authorities were responding to the pandemic. According to the Daily Mail, the host was the interviewer most feared by high-ranking officials because of his careful study of the facts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Murder Hornets vs. Honeybees: A Swarm of Bees Can Cook Invaders Alive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SEATTLE — When a pack of Asian giant hornets targets a hive of honeybees for slaughter, the carnage can be swift.
The so-called murder hornets, which have surfaced for the first time in the United States, have a particular appetite for bees and specialize in group attacks. The slaughter begins when a worker hornet spots a colony, marks it with a pheromone and then brings a backup crew of between two and 50 others. While a honeybee hive can have thousands of residents, hornets can wipe out the whole population in hours.
During one recorded slaughter examined by researchers, each hornet killed one bee every 14 seconds, using powerful mandibles to decapitate its prey.
But some bees have also demonstrated a remarkable survival strategy by working as a team to fight back against individual invaders, researchers have found.
When a hornet enters the hive of Japanese honeybees, researchers have witnessed how hundreds of bees can respond by forming a ball around a hornet. While the bees face an immense disadvantage in both size and strength, the bees working in unison can vibrate to produce heat, raising the temperature in the formation, like a tiny oven, to over 115 degrees. Bees can survive the high temperature, but the hornet cannot, and after up to an hour of cooking, the hornet dies.
European honeybees, which are the most common pollinator in the United States, don’t appear to have the same instinct. They try to defend against a hornet attack by stinging the invaders, but the Asian giant hornet carries a rigid exoskeleton that makes bee stings ineffective, according to researchers.
“The honeybee in Japan has adapted with this predator and learned through generations to protect themselves,” said Ruthie Danielsen, a beekeeper in Birch Bay, Wash., near where two Asian giant hornets were discovered. “Our honeybees, the predator has never been there before, so they have no defense.”
While the Asian giant hornet is a threat to humans, with a potent stinger that kills up to 50 people each year in Japan, its arrival in the United States has brought particular dread to beekeepers. They are working together to post traps to try and catch queens this spring and workers in the upcoming summer. Government biologists are trying to identify where the hornet has settled in Washington State and eradicate it before it establishes a permanent presence.
Ms. Danielsen said the beekeepers were exploring a special trap used in Japan that was placed in front of a beehive, designed to catch an Asian giant hornet before it marks the hive with a pheromone.
Tim Lawrence, a professor of entomology at Washington State University with expertise in honeybees, said that in Japan, however, there were smaller beekeeping operations compared with in the United States. In America, he said, it is not uncommon to find hundreds of bee hives in an apiary.
“We don’t know what’s going to happen if the hornet is established in an apiary of that size,” Mr. Lawrence said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant Asian 'murder hornets' that kill dozens of people a year spread to the West</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Giant Asian 'murder hornets' which kill dozens of people every year are invading western parts of the world.
The large insects, which are native to tropical climates, have been spotted several times in the US.
The sightings started in November 2019 along the west coast, but it is unclear who they got there.
More than double the size of honeybees, Asian giant hornets have a wingspan measuring more than three inches.
They have a large stinger that contains deadly venom neurotoxin, which can cause cardiac arrest and anaphylactic shock.
Conrad Bérubé, a beekeeper and entomologist, was sent to destroy a hive on Vancouver Island, but was stung several times by one.
He told the New York Times : "It was like having red-hot thumbtacks being driven into my flesh." He added he was left bleeding after being stung.
He still managed to destroy the nest, but he said he suffered from leg pains as if he had the flu.
Despite the deadly threat to humans, entomologists are more concerned that the 'murder hornets' will kill bee populations in the US.
Last month, experts warned an invasion of large hornets in the UK, which could cost £7.6m in research alone.
It will cost the country  millions to get rid  of the potentially deadly two-inch insects and have a devastating impact on the already-dwindling bee population.
Asian hornets were accidentally introduced to France from China in 2004 and they have been spreading rapidly throughout Europe ever since.
Experts estimate the Asian hornet colonised most of France at a rate of 60 to 80 kilometres per year.
And the species has swiftly been invading other countries including Spain in 2010, Portugal and Belgium in 2011, Italy in 2012 and Germany in 2014.
The first invasive hornets made it to the UK in 2016.
Now French scientists have evaluated the estimated cost of the invasion to Europe.
Professor Franck Courchamp said: "In 2006, only two years after the hornet was first observed in France, three departments were already invaded and the cost of nest destruction was estimated at 408,000 euros.
"Since then, the estimated yearly costs have been increasing by about 450,000 euros each year, as the hornet keeps spreading and invades new departments.
“Definitely more actions need to be taken in order to handle harmful invasive species - one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."
Nicola Spence, Chief Plant Health Officer, said: “By ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swift and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets.
“While the Asian hornet poses no greater risk to human health than a bee, we recognise the damage they can cause to honey bee colonies and other beneficial insects.
"Please continue to look out for any Asian hornets and if you think you’ve spotted one, report your sighting through the Asian hornet app or online.”
They analysed the negative impact on ecosystems and the global decline in pollination and honey production.
Attempts to control the invasion concentrate on destroying hornet nests and bait trapping.
But experts say these methods are not enough to completely eradicate the species.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Murder hornets' spotted in the US for the first time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A horrifically large species of Asian hornets, dubbed ‘murder hornets,’ are becoming active in the US with the arrival of warmer spring weather after being discovered in the country for the first time.
Scientists say the Asian giant hornets have become active last month after the queens came out of hibernation and began forming colonies. The deadly species was first discovered in Washington state last December, but experts say it is a matter of time before they make their way across the country.
The hornets can grow to be up to two inches long and earned their terrifying nickname because of their powerful venom which can kill a human if stung multiple times. They are also strong enough to penetrate a beekeeper’s suit. The hornets are known to be much more aggressive towards bees than humans, although they kill approximately 50 people a year in Japan.
Scientists are still unsure about how the hornets made it to the US from Asia. They were first discovered in Custer, Washington for the first time after beekeeper Ted McFall found his bees killed and decapitated, according to The New York Times. It was later determined his McFalls’ bees were killed by the massive hornet species.
Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at Washington State University’s Department of Entomology, told WSU Insider the hornets are ‘like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.’
The hornets’ venom has been known to send humans into anaphylactic shock or organ failure. It has also been known to destroy nerve endings and break down flesh. Those who have survived an attack by the hornets have had physical effects last for months, including inflammation of the liver and heart.
Todd Murray, an entomologist and invasive species specialist at Washington State University, called the ‘shockingly large hornet’ a ‘health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honey bees.’
Researchers said the hornets are known to target beehives. They reportedly decapitate and kill the adults while eating the larvae and pupae. Because of their size and strength, a handful of hornets can destroy an entire hive of honey bees in just hours.
Experts urged people to stay away from the hornets and report any sightings.
‘Don’t try to take them out yourself if you see them,’ said Chris Looney, an entomologist at Washington’s agricultural department, told Washington State University.
‘If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know every sighting if we’re going to have any hope of eradication.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">US bracing for invasion of monster hornets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US is facing an invasion of giant Asian hornets that scientists fear could threaten its bee population.
The monster hornets – nicknamed "murder hornets" by researchers in the northwestern state of Washington – were first spotted late last year near Blaine, a town near the Canadian border.
Known as the Vespa Mandarinia, the hornet is two inches long and is capable of stinging several times, which can prove fatal.
It is estimated that they kill around 50 people a year in Japan alone.
The hornets' stingers are so long that they can penetrate beekeepers' protective suits.
Their toxic venom is equivalent to that of a poisonous snake, according to Jun-ichi Takahashi, a researcher at Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan.
In all four hornet colonies were found in Washington and two more were discovered in British Columbia.
The tell-tale sign was piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off.
Just a handful of hornets can destroy a beehive in a matter of hours, according to Washington's department of agriculture.
Having decapitated the bees during what is known as their "slaughter phase" the hornets then take control of the hive.
They then use the bodies of the bees to feed their young.
"It's a shockingly large hornet," said Todd Murray, an entomologist at Washington State University.
"It's a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees," he added.
"They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face," said Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University's Department of Entomology.
The hornets' natural habitat is the forests and mountains of eastern and southeast Asia, where it has already devastated the local population of the European honeybee.
How they arrived in North America remains unclear. One theory is that they might have been inadvertently transported in international cargo.
Washington's department of agriculture has issued a chilling warning to local residents, telling them to use extreme caution should they come across a colony, even though they do not normally attack people or pets unless they feel threatened.
"Anyone who is allergic to bee or wasp stings should never approach an Asian giant hornet," it said.
"Don't try to take them out yourself if you see them," added Chris Looney, another state of Washington entomologist.
"If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we're going to have any hope of eradication."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Killer Asian Giant Hornets Discovered in U.S. for First Time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Asia’s ‘murder hornets’ were spotted in the United States for the first time recently, causing scientists to worry that the insect might be colonizing.
“In Japan, the hornets kill up to 50 people a year. Now, for the first time, they have arrived in the United States,” the New York Times reported Saturday.
The article continued:
The initial sightings occurred in Washington state in December, and scientists have since launched a full-scale hunt for the deadly pest over concerns it might “establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost,” the Times noted.
During the winter, state agriculture biologists and local beekeepers joined forces and set up traps to find and kill the hornets.
“This is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can’t do it in the next couple of years, it probably can’t be done,” said Chris Looney, an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture.
Sunday, ABC 13 shared a photo of an Asian giant hornet on Twitter.
An infestation of the hornets could be devastating for beekeepers who bring their hives to Washington state to pollinate Northwest Pacific crops such as cherries, blueberries, and apples, according to UPI.
“Commercial beekeepers have 300 to 400 hives in the area,” said Timothy Lawrence, director of the Island County extension office at Washington State University. “They may not want to go to certain counties if this infestation takes hold.”
Global economies and travel to and from distant places have caused invasive species to be more common, according to Todd Murray, a Washington State University extension entomologist.
“When we do get establishment of a new invasive species, its’ [sic] a ‘forever change,’ and becomes something we learn to live with,” he explained, adding, “This is definitely a hornet I don’t want to learn to live with.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Asian Giant 'Murder' Hornets Come to America, Threaten Crops and Terrorize People</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Asian Giant Hornet, nicknamed the "murder hornet," is the latest export of Asia to wreak havoc in the U.S. While native to places like South Korea and Japan, the insect was detected in Washington State late last year. While the insect is known to devastate crops, it also poses a threat to human beings in its path. In Japan, up to 50 people are killed by murder hornets every year.
The hornets have yellow-orange heads and prominent eyes. Their abdomens are black and yellow striped, and the insect is usually around 1.5 inches long. The queens can grow to be two inches in length.
The New York Times reports the insect uses mandibles, shaped like shark fins, to wipe out entire honeybee hives in a matter of hours. After decapitating the honeybees, the terrorizing hornets then feed the thoraxes of the honeybees to their young. Humans have likened the hornet's stinger and accompanying venom to the feeling of "hot metal driving into their skin," according to The Times. The bees stinger is even long enough to penetrate a beekeeper's suit. 
In Dec. 2019, Washington State Department of Agriculture confirmed four sightings of the insect in the state. The hornets had been spotted in British Columbia that fall. The hornets are most dangerous at the end of summer into early fall as they ravage through honeybee populations, which are needed to pollinate crops. 
The hornet's sting is not only painful but infects the victim with neurotoxins. Even to someone who is not allergic to bees, a few stings can be enough to kill a person. 
Officials in Washington State are beginning to track the hornets and set up traps in an effort to mitigate the damage caused by the invaders.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everything you need to know about 'murder hornets'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The internet is buzzing about so-called "murder hornets" after the New York Times detailed an invasion of Asian giant hornets in Washington state, adding another threat to worry about to the already calamitous year.
The description of the devastation these insects caused at a local beehive feels like something out of a novel: thousands of bees laying dead with their heads ripped off — a whole colony decimated. It's such a problem that the state of Washington is enlisting people to find, report on, and kill these hornets with a "sometimes lethal" sting. A dead one was first spotted in December on a beekeeper's front porch. More may be seen this spring and into the fall as the queens' hibernations ended in April.
In case you're unfamiliar with these murder hornets, here's exactly what we're dealing with, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Washington State University.
Asian giant hornets are the largest species of hornet in the world. They grow to sizes of 1.5 inches to more than 2 inches, which is about the length of two quarters laying side-by-side. For comparison, the much more common European hornet is about half the size, and yellowjacket wasps are around 0.5 inches to 0.75 inches.
Not only are Asian giant hornet stingers long enough to sting through normal beekeeper suits, getting stung by one of these hornets will cause excruciating pain. YouTuber Coyote Peterson subjected himself to the sting of an Asian giant hornet and described it while yelling and writhing as feeling like "absolute searing pain."
Their stingers deliver seven times the amount of venom as a honey bee. Not only that, but they can sting victims multiple times without a problem. Attacking in groups, they can kill humans, but they're mostly hunting for honeybees.
If people are allergic to the venom of Asian giant hornets or are stung by multiple hornets, it can be fatal. About 50 people are killed by the giant hornets each year in Japan, according to the Times. The hornets are territorial and will be aggressive when something gets close to their nest but are not as aggressive far away from their homes. If you spot a murder hornet in the wild in Washington, state officials ask that you contact them rather than trying to trap the insects yourself.
This is the reason why these insects are referred to as murder hornets. Asian giant hornets feed themselves and their young by killing and eating other insects and regurgitating them back to their young. When Asian giant hornets find a honey bee nest, they can tear apart tens of thousands of them in mere hours with a team of just a few dozen, completely taking out a colony without a problem. This can be devastating to beekeepers and honey producers. To make matters worse, the honeybee population has been declining for years in the U.S. due to habitat loss, disease, and pesticides. 
When scouts head out to find food sources, they secrete a special scent on honeybee hives so that their fellow hornets can find it and team up to attack. They are the only known species of wasp to apply a scent to food targets, according the the entomology journal Psyche. 
Luckily, the Asian giant hornet isn't a threat all year long. They remain relatively dormant through the winter but they do start seeking food starting in April. During the late summer and the fall is when they're at their most aggressive and are most likely to go take on honeybee colonies.
While it's currently unclear how these Asian giant hornets came to North America, the area they've been spotted in makes sense. They prefer to live in low-altitude forests and mountains and build underground nests. You probably won't find these insects in high-altitude areas or open plains.
Asian giant hornets are exceptional fliers. They can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour and can travel several miles in a single day. Luckily they're less aggressive when they're far from home, but if they spot a honeybee colony near you, you could be in danger as they attack that area and defend it from other potential threats.
This kind of goes without saying, but Asian giant hornets are not welcome in North America. Honeybees are vital to many facets of agriculture in North America as they help pollinate a lot of different crops including apples and various kinds of berries. Honeybees have enough trouble as it is with drastically reducing population numbers, the Asian giant hornet could have long-lasting effects if it's not eradicated quickly.
Don't worry, it's possible to get rid of murder hornets. There are numerous methods of getting rid of Asian giant hornets through the use of poison, controlled fires, baited traps, and screens. Not only can humans do a lot to get rid of these pests, sometimes honeybees can outnumber these giant killers. A bunch of honeybees will completely cover the murder hornets and kill them by increasing the heat within the tangle of bodies and exerting carbon dioxide.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant ‘murder hornet’ is in U.S. to stay, will eventually reach East Coast, experts say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s not a matter of if but when the “murder hornet’’ will hit the East Coast, experts warned The Post on Sunday.
The deadly meat-eating Asian giant hornet, which has been known to kill up to 50 people a year in Japan, recently surfaced for the first time in the US in Washington state — and New York City beekeepers say there is no way it won’t make its way here, too.
“I told the NYPD back in 2012 … ‘Your problem is not the bees. This [the murder hornet] is your problem,’” recalled retired Police Department beekeeper Anthony “Tony Bees” Planakis.
“I showed them a picture of it, and they go, ‘What the hell is that?’ ” Planakis said. “I go, ‘That is an Asian hornet. My suit is useless against that thing.’”
Asked if the monstrous insects are dangerous to humans, Planakis added, “Absolutely. Oh, my God.”
“Have you seen the mandibles on these things?”
The hornets, the world’s largest at more than 2 inches long, were first spotted in Washington in December, likely having made their way to the U.S. aboard a ship from China, experts said.
Planakis said he expects them to arrive East at least in the next two to three years.
He said that in terms of eventual local infiltration, city green spaces in the outer boroughs are the most likely places.
“All it takes is a few hornets, and you’ve got a colony,” Planakis said.
Spots such as the Bronx Botanical Gardens are ideal because there’s plenty of open space and lots of food, he said. Parks in general would be attractive to the giant hornets, although you won’t find them in very urban spots such as Manhattan because they tend to nest in the ground or burrow in rotted wood, he said.
Manhattan beekeeper Andrew Cote said it “could be years before they make a foothold [on the East Coast] — or they could end up in the back of somebody’s truck and be here in four days.”
Either way, the carnivorous insect “is here to stay” in the U.S., he said.
“We can expect them to be everywhere on the continent in time. … It’s a done deal,” Cote said. “There’s no way to contain it to the West Coast.”
He said he saw the giant hornets on a trip to China in 2017, where “local beekeepers there used small bats that looked like miniature cricket bats” to hit the hornets mid-air.
“It sounded like someone hitting a rock. The hornets are extraordinarily aggressive,” Cote said.
“The prospect of my semi-defenseless bees having to confront them sends chills up my spine.”
The killer hornet “can decimate a honey-bee colony because it needs to build up protein for its own colony, so it decapitates and consumes part of the honey bee,” Cote said.
Planakis said the hornet’s stinger “is approximately a quarter of an inch,” compared to the one-sixteenth of an inch for a honey bee.
“It’s a little bit bigger than a cicada,” he said of the hornet. “You’ll see the tip of the stinger, but it’s not until it actually extends the stinger out that it goes into your skin. And they’re meat-eaters. … They’ll go after birds, small sparrows if they have to.”
Planakis said that inside their venom “is a pheromone, which is like a magnet to other hornets.”
“So you can get swarmed just from getting stung by one.”
“The worst thing anyone can do with these things is kill them,” he said. “That scent is going to be airborne, and the rest of the hive will come.
“Getting stung is extremely painful, and anyone who is allergic, heaven help them,” he added. “And they don’t sting you one time. They have the ability to sting you multiple times. Honeybees can only sting you once, and then they die.”
Still, “you have to understand, out in the wild, unless you go up to their hive, they’re not going to sit there and just seek you out,” the beekeeper said. “There’s got to be a reason for them to come at you.”
Cote said bees can fight back by swarming a hornet if it gets in their hive and suffocating it.
Meanwhile, beekeepers can make the entrance to their beehives smaller to limit the number of hornets getting in at a time, or place “a roach motel for hornets’’ outside of hives that consists of a cage with meat in it to attract, and then trap, the carnivorous insects, said Cote, author of the upcoming book “Honey and Venom: Confessions of an Urban Beekeeper.”
Planakis said that in China, they have hornet hunters.
“There’s a tracker, and what they do is they set up a water source, and they wait there, like a deer hunter would,” he said.
“As soon as they see the hornet coming to the water source to drink, the guy jumps out with a net, and he grabs it. Then, ever so carefully, he ties a strong on it and lets it go.
“There’s a spotter watching it now with binoculars, and he watches this thing as it flies, because obviously it’s going to fly back to the nest. When they find it, they mark where the nest is.
“And at night they come back and with a flame-thrower, pretty much go at it, just follow them back to their base camp, and when they least expect it, boom, go after them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US is being colonized by 'murder hornets,' a 'shockingly large' insect that can kill humans and behead entire colonies of bees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As if 2020 wasn’t already bad enough, the US now has another problem to deal with: a terrifying monster insect nicknamed the “murder hornet.”
Officially called the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia, the huge insects have been spotted in the US for the first time in recent months, appearing in Washington state, the state’s Department of Agriculture says.
The hornets, which are over two inches long, were first spotted in the state in December last year, and generally become active in the spring, researchers from Washington State University said in a post published in early April.
“They’re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,” Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at WSU’s Department of Entomology.
“It’s a shockingly large hornet,” added Todd Murray, a specialist in invasive species at the university.
While generally not aggressive towards people or pets, the hornets can attack if provoked, officials say, and have killed humans in extreme circumstances.
In 2013, between July and October, the insects killed 41 people and injured 1,600 in Shaanxi province during a particularly bad hornet season, the BBC reported.
Their main target, however, is the hives of honeybees, which they attack and often will destroy, largely by decapitating the bees in the hive, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA).
“Asian giant hornet attacks and destroys honeybee hives. A few hornets can destroy a hive in a matter of hours. The hornets enter a “slaughter phase” where they kill bees by decapitating them,” the department said.
“They then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young. They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire populations of those insects.”
Scientists are keen to make clear that people should be extremely cautious around the insects.
Such is the threat posed by the giant hornets that the WSDA has an entire web page devoted to reporting sightings of the insects and instructions on how to trap them. The site displays a large red banner warning people to be careful near them.
“Don’t try to take them out yourself if you see them,” said entomologist Chris Looney from the WSDA in a blog post on the WSU website.
“If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we’re going to have any hope of eradication.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The murder hornet is the 2020 B-plot you probably didn’t see coming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As The Verge’s weekend editor, I endeavor to find a good mix of stories for our Saturday and Sunday site visitors, balancing news about tech and policy with the latest about the coronavirus and its impact, along with other news of the day. Some days the news is upbeat and interesting and then other days the writers of the script for 2020: The Horror Show throw in a murder hornet plot twist because a pandemic is apparently not terrifying enough without two-inch hornets that rip the heads off of honeybees.
The New York Times has the story of the Asian giant hornet, which has recently arrived in the US, to the dismay of entomologists.
Asian giant hornets can fly at speeds up to 20 miles per hour and their stings are described as feeling like “red hot thumbtacks.” Fun!
For the sake of comparison:
According to the Times, the US arrival of these hornets (scientific name: Vespa mandarina), is particularly troubling not only because their stings hurt like hell and they’re terrifying to look at, but because of their potential impact on the US honeybee population, which already is in decline.
Read all about the murder hornet in the New York Times, but be warned that it will be very hard to eradicate the images from your brain.
Happy Sunday!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant 'Murder Hornets' Threat Looms Over the United States - Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scientists in the United States have embarked on a full-scale hunt for dangerous insects known as Asian giant hornets which have been spotted in the country for the first time and which threaten to decimate local bee populations if left unchecked, The New York Times reports.
According to the newspaper, the insects, simply described as “murder hornets” by some researchers, were apparently spotted in Washington State last fall, and at least one beekeeper there apparently found one of his bee colonies wiped out - "thousands and thousands of bees with their heads torn from their bodies and no sign of a culprit".
With their queens capable of growing up to two inches in size, Asian giant hornets possess sharp mandibles that potentially allow them to "wipe out a honeybee hive in a matter of hours", while their long stinger – which can puncture a beekeeper's suit – and potent venom make them a credible threat to humans as well, as the hornets kill up to 50 people a year in Japan.
Now, researchers are hunting for the hornets before the insects "establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost".
The newspaper adds that Asian giant hornets were also apparently seen in Canada, with one hornet being spotted in British Columbia in November, some 10 miles away from the site of the sightings in Washington State, while a whole hive of hornets was located in Vancouver Island before that.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Asian giant hornets - aka the 'murder hornet' - expected back in B.C.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER -- With a terrifying new moniker, social media is abuzz with tales of the "murder hornet," an flying insect that rips bees apart and "carries a painful, sometimes lethal sting," according to entomologists at Washington State University.
The Asian giant hornet has been spotted for the first time in Washington State, setting off a wave of media coverage that has resonated with the "end times" feeling of the spring of 2020.
But Asian giant hornets have been in British Columbia for some time, with the first hornets spotted near Nanaimo in August 2019. The provincial government has warned that they'll likely return this spring and summer after they wake up from winter nesting.
Two Asian giant hornets were discovered near Blaine, Wash. in December, and one was found in White Rock in November.
"These findings indicate a probability that nesting hornets are overwintering in the area," the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement March 20.
Residents who live along the B.C.-Washington border could be the first to spot the Asian giant hornet this year. The hornet prefers wooded areas, which proliferate along the border, so the Ministry of Agriculture has warned residents who live near Zero Avenue, from Surrey to Aldergrove, to be on the lookout for the hornets and to report any sightings to the Invasive Species Council of BC by calling 1-888-933-3722 or visiting online at https://bcinvasives.ca/report.
The hornets make their nests in the ground and not in trees or buildings. If people stumble upon a nest, officials recommend that they avoid it and leave the area immediately.
A provincial apiculturist also set up traps in the area to catch hornets.
The hornet's stinger can pierce through normal beekeepers' suits, according to Washington State University. In fact, the Washington State Department of Agriculture has ordered special suits from China to help tackle the creatures.
WSU researchers describe their stings as "big and painful, with a potent neurotoxin" and caution they can even be lethal, warning "multiple stings can kill humans, even if they are not allergic." They also warn the public not to attempt to deal with the hornets themselves.
Despite this terrifying description, B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture says the hornets are not usually interested in humans, pets or livestock. Rather, they eat honeybees — a significant concern since pollinating bee populations are already struggling.
But if the hornets' nests are disturbed, "they will attack with painful stings, which can be hazardous to people’s health," according to the ministry.
The B.C. Ministry of Agriculture describes Asian giant hornets as "large compared to other hornets, with noticeably large orange heads and black eyes." Worker hornets are around 3.5 centimetres in length, while queens can be up to four cm to five cm in length, with a wingspan of four cm to seven cm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">"Asian giant hornets" are an invasive and potentially deadly species.
They've now been found in the U.S. for the first time.
Researchers have nicknamed the species "murder hornet."
The "murder hornet" has a venomous sting that can kill a human if they are stung several times.
They're also strong enough to puncture a beekeeper's suit.
The hornets are described as more than two inches long.
They've reportedly been attacking beehives in Washington state.
Scientists do not yet know how they made it to the United States.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Invasive 'murder hornets' have been spotted in the U.S.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just when you thought 2020 could not get any worse. Now we have giant hornets with freakish eyes and a venomous sting to add to this year's list of worries.
For the first time, Asian giant hornets have been spotted in the United States, specifically in Washington state, scientists say. Beekeepers have reported piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off, an alarming sight in a country with a rapidly declining bee population.
At more than two inches long, they're the world's largest hornets with a sting that can kill humans if bitten multiple times, according to experts at the Washington State University. Researches have nicknamed them "murder hornets."
"They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face," Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at the Washington State University's department of entomology, said recently.
Scientists don't know how these giant hornets native to Asia ended up in Washington state.
They're sometimes transported in international cargo -- in some cases deliberately, said Seth Truscott with WSU's college of agricultural, human and natural resource sciences.
The giant hornet was first spotted in the state in December, and scientists believe it started becoming active again last month, when queens emerge from hibernation to build nests and form colonies.
"Hornets are most destructive in the late summer and early fall, when they are on the hunt for sources of protein to raise next year's queens," Truscott said on the WSU's Insider.
"They attack honey bee hives, killing adult bees and devouring bee larvae and pupae, while aggressively defending the occupied colony," he added. "Their stings are big and painful, with a potent neurotoxin. Multiple stings can kill humans, even if they are not allergic."
Washington state agricultural officials are asking beekeepers and residents to report any sightings of the giant hornets. But don't get too close. Its sting can penetrate a regular beekeeper's suit, and state scientists had to order special reinforced suits.
"Don't try to take them out yourself if you see them," said entomologist Chris Looney of the state Department of Agriculture. "If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we're going to have any hope of eradication."
State officials are asking people in Whatcom, Skagit, Island, San Juan, Jefferson and Clallam counties to be especially vigilant.
The giant hornets especially target bees between late summer and the fall.
"The most likely time to catch Asian giant hornets is from July through October -- when colonies are established and workers are out foraging," the Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a statement. "Traps can be hung as early as April if attempting to trap queens, but since there are significantly fewer queens than workers, catching a queen isn't very likely."
State officials set up traps and launched an app to quickly report sightings, saying just a few of the hornets can devastate a hive within hours.
Bees pollinate plants producing fruit, nuts and vegetables, and are crucial to the nation's food industry. Attack by the hornets risks decimating bees, which are already on endangered lists due to their sharply declining numbers.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Asian giant hornets are primarily a threat to honeybees, but may sting humans if they or their ground nests are disturbed or threatened.
BLAINE, Washington -- Officials are warning about the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive species found in Washington state that can pack a powerful sting and be a threat to honeybees.
The Washington State Department of Agriculture said the bug was found in early December in Blaine, near the Canadian border.
The state's agriculture and health officials are now warning people in the area to be on the lookout and avoid the hornets, which are typically 1.5 inches long with large yellow heads.
Researchers simply call it the "murder hornet."
The species is not usually interested in humans or animals but may sting if they or their ground nests are disturbed or threatened.
They are a greater threat to honeybee populations in the United States, scientists say.
The health department says humans should take preventative measures by covering food and garbage and also avoid swatting at the hornets.
Winter is dormant season for the bugs, which are more often seen from July through October.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Murder Hornets' Have Officially Been Spotted in The US. Here's What You Need to Know</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As if 2020 wasn't already bad enough, the US now has another problem to deal with: a terrifying monster insect nicknamed the "murder hornet".
Officially called the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia, the huge insects have been spotted in the US for the first time in recent months, appearing in Washington state, the state's Department of Agriculture says.
The hornets, which are over two inches long, were first spotted in the state in December last year, and generally become active in the spring, researchers from Washington State University said in a post published in early April.
"They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face," Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at WSU's Department of Entomology.
"It's a shockingly large hornet," added Todd Murray, a specialist in invasive species at the university.
While generally not aggressive towards people or pets, the hornets can attack if provoked, officials say, and have killed humans in extreme circumstances.
In 2013, between July and October, the insects killed 41 people and injured 1,600 in Shaanxi province during a particularly bad hornet season, the BBC reported.
Their main target, however, is the hives of honeybees, which they attack and often will destroy, largely by decapitating the bees in the hive, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA).
"Asian giant hornet attacks and destroys honeybee hives. A few hornets can destroy a hive in a matter of hours. The hornets enter a "slaughter phase" where they kill bees by decapitating them," the department said.
"They then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young. They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire populations of those insects."
Scientists are keen to make clear that people should be extremely cautious around the insects.
Such is the threat posed by the giant hornets that the WSDA has an entire web page devoted to reporting sightings of the insects and instructions on how to trap them.
The site displays a large red banner warning people to be careful near them.
"Don't try to take them out yourself if you see them," said entomologist Chris Looney from the WSDA in a blog post on the WSU website.
"If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we're going to have any hope of eradication."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Murder hornets' in Washington state threaten bees and whip up media swarm</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers and citizens in Washington state are on a careful hunt for invasive “murder hornets”, after the insect made its first appearance in the US.
The Asian giant hornet is the world’s largest and can kill humans. But it is most dangerous for the European honeybee, which is defenseless in the face of the hornet’s spiky mandibles, long stinger and potent venom.
Washington state verified four reports of Asian giant hornets in two north-western cities in December. The species becomes more active in April, prompting local officials to invite the public to help beekeepers by creating their own hornet traps.
“It’s a shockingly large hornet,” Todd Murray, Washington State University Extension entomologist and invasive species specialist, said in a statement. “It’s a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees.”
Murray said it was important for people to learn to recognize the insect now, while the population is small and still new to the region.
“We need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small,” he said, “so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.”
The hornets are about the size of an adult thumb, with a yellow and orange head. They are most destructive in the late summer and early fall. One telltale sign they have visited a hive is the remains of decapitated bees.
Some researchers refer to the insect as a “murder hornet”, according to a New York Times story published on Saturday.
In Japan, up to 50 people a year die after being stung, though the hornet is usually only aggressive to humans if it is disturbed.
The Times story prompted a slew of comments on social media, noting the appearance of the hornets in the US in 2020, alongside famine, pestilence and war.
“Whomever had murder by hornet on their apocalypse bingo card, please step forward to collect your winnings,” wrote Kaz Weida, a freelance journalist.
The comedian Patton Oswalt shared the story and wrote “murder hornets. Sure thing, 2020. Give us everything. Hypno-frogs. Fecal blizzards. Toilet tsunamis. A CATS sequel. We can take it.”
The author Rabih Alameddine posted: “I really think that was missing from my life this year was murder hornets.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Asia's 'murder hornet' lands in US for first time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Beekeepers are fretting about a deadly threat from Asia.
Deadly hornets from Asia that measure up to 2 inches long have been found for the first time in the U.S., with researchers worried that the insects are colonizing, the New York Post reported Saturday.
The “murder hornets,” as the aggressive insects are known, can wipe out bee colonies within hours and have stingers long and powerful enough to puncture beekeeping suits, according to the paper.
In Japan, the hornets kill up to 50 people a year, according to The New York Times.
CORONAVIRUS MAKES IT HARDER TO BATTLE SWARMS OF LOCUSTS RAVAGING AFRICA
In the state of Washington, beekeepers have already seen the hornets devastate their hives, according to the paper.
The hornet has a distinctive look, with a cartoonishly fierce face featuring teardrop eyes like Spider-Man, orange and black stripes that extend down its body like a tiger and broad, wispy wings like a small dragonfly, The Times reported.

“This is our window to keep it from establishing,” Washington state entomologist Chris Looney told The Times. “If we can’t do it in the next couple of years, it probably can’t be done.”
The Bellingham Herald in Washington reported Saturday that the State Department received and verified four reports of Asian giant hornets near Blaine and Bellingham in December 2019.
Those were the first sightings of the hornets in Washington state and the U.S.
Members of the Mt. Baker Beekeepers Association have put up traps and are monitoring them as part of the state’s efforts to find and kill the invasive pests, the paper reported.

The hornet dwarfs other winged insects, making the yellow-head bumblebee, bald-faced hornet and western yellowjacket seem small in comparison, and even when compared to the burly bumblebee, according to the Herald.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Asian 'murder hornets' found in US</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A species of Asian "murder hornets" has appeared in the U.S. as researchers search for ways to eradicate the vicious insects before populations grow.
The hornets were discovered near Custer, Wash., last November when beekeeper Ted McFall found carcasses of his bees with decapitated heads, according to an interview with The New York Times.
McFall told the Times that he could not imagine what could have killed his bees, later discovering that it was the result of a murder hornet attack.
The Asian hornets are reportedly enormous, with queens growing as long as two inches.
According to the Times, the hornets utilize their mandibles, which are shaped like spiked shark fins, to decapitate worker bees, clearing hives within hours and feeding honeybee thoraxes to their offspring.
The hornet's venom causes unbearable pain for larger victims who are stung, which reportedly feels like hot metal being driven through one's skin. They also can break through beekeeper suits, presenting a real threat to not only honeybees but also their keepers.
Japan reports around 50 people a year die from deadly hornet attacks, the Times added.
While McFall did not directly witness the attack, researchers have discovered the undesirable insects in northwest Washington, although little information, including population numbers, is known.
Scientists are reportedly seeking to track the invasive species to prevent further bee colonies from being eradicated while attempting to reduce the murder hornet population.
Chris Looney, an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture, told the Times that the hornets must be controlled within a short time frame.
"This is our window to keep it from establishing," he said, according to the Times, adding, "If we can't do it in the next couple of years, it probably can't be done."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant 'murder hornets' that kill up to 50 people a year in Asia have invaded the US: Scientists desperately try to stop spread of predator bugs that decimate bee colonies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Asian giant hornets have been spotted in the United States and Canada for the first time - sparking panic among members of the scientific community . 
The large insects - nicknamed 'murder hornets' - are native to temperate and tropical climates in East Asia, where they kill around 50 people are year. 
But since November 2019, there have been several sightings of the hornets on the west coast of North America. It's unclear how they arrived. 
Asian giant hornets are more than double the size of honeybees, and have a wingspan measuring more than three inches. 
The insects also have a large stinger filled with venom that contains neurotoxin, which is capable of causing both cardiac arrest and anaphylactic shock. 
Beekeeper Conrad Bérubé told The New York Times he was recently attacked by a swarm of  the 'murder hornets' on Vancouver Island.  
'It was like having red-hot thumbtacks being driven into my flesh,' Bérubé stated, adding that he was left bleeding from the attack.  
Bérubé was stung seven times and was lucky to be alive. 
But while the hornets can be deadly to humans, entomologists are more concerned that they could kill of bee populations in North America. 
The insects are ferocious and can decimate entire beehives in just hours.
Last November, a beekeeper in Washington state found 'thousands and thousands' of his honeybees with their heads torn off. 
'I couldn't wrap my head around what could have done that,' the keeper stated.  
Asian giant hornets nest in the ground for most of the year, but are most active between July and November. 
Now, entomologists are 'embarking on a full-scale hunt for the hornets', before they breed and become widely established in North America. 
'This is our window, Chris Looney, an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture, told The Times. 
While he has set out in the woods of Washington to trap the hornets, he says the task will be difficult, given the hornets can fly more than 20 miles an hour. 
'If we can't do it in the next couple of years, it probably can't be done,' he stated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Invasive Asian giant hornet discovered in Washington state</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DENVER, May 2 (UPI) -- Washington agriculture authorities are asking residents to be on the lookout for an invasive giant wasp with an "excruciating" sting that attacks honeybee colonies, leaving thousands of bees without heads.
"The Asian giant hornet been called the most venomous, intimidating insect in the world, and it even scares away other hornets," said Timothy Lawrence, director of the Island County extension office at Washington State University.
Asian giant hornets originating in South Korea were first reported last fall near Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Then, residents in Blaine, Wash., near the Canadian border, used an invasive species app to report wasps that were confirmed to be Asian giant hornets from Japan, the state agriculture department said.
An infestation of the new giant wasps could be devastating for beekeepers who bring their hives to the state to pollinate Northwest Pacific crops like cherries, blueberries and apples.
"Commercial beekeepers have 300 to 400 hives in the area. They may not want to go to certain counties if this infestation takes hold," Lawrence said.
In Europe, the invasive yellow-legged Asian hornets, which also kill honeybees and other pollinators, has caused millions of dollars' worth of damage to crops in France and elsewhere after they gained a foothold.
The Asian giant hornets, also called "yak-killer hornets," measure about 2 inches long and have an orangeish-yellow face with large black eyes.
"They're like something out of a monster cartoon," Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with WSU's Department of Entomology, said in a statement.
The Asian giant hornet's sting is described as excruciating, and they can sting repeatedly. Their quarter-inch stinger can penetrate beekeeping protective clothing, a state agriculture department warning said.
The wasps are dangerous if their underground nests are disturbed, or if a food source is threatened. Their venom, seven-times stronger than that of honeybees, can cause anaphylactic shock, but also can be lethal to people who are not allergic if victims are stung repeatedly.
"They give a warning before they sting. They snap their mandibles and make a clicking sound," Lawrence said. "But if you stick around to notice that, you're probably already in a world of hurt."
The wasps might have hitched a ride to the Pacific Coast in a container ship, but also could have been imported intentionally as an ingredient for a folk recipe for wasp venom in alcohol, made popular by Internet bodybuilders, entomologists think.
The life cycle of the Asian giant hornet begins when a queen emerges from hibernation in April and feeds on plant sap and fruit, looking for a spot to build an underground nest, according to state fact sheets. By summer, queens have created a colony of worker wasps that spread out to seek food.
At the end of the summer, the hornets enter a "high-protein demand" phase when they attack honeybee colonies, killing off the adults to feast on the immature brood of pupa and larva, scientists say.
The hornets will leave piles of dead bees, most of them headless, outside their beehive. A few dozen hornets can kill an entire colony of 30,000 bees in a few hours.
Scientists will be hunting for queens this spring, wearing special reinforced suits from China, said Rian Wojahn, eradication coordinator for the pest program at the Washington State Department of Agriculture.
"The suits are made out of thick foam material with everything -- boots, gloves, hat -- attached," Wojahn said.
Trappers have set out bait bottles, filled with orange juice and rice wine, in coordination with state beekeeper clubs.
The trappers will use heat cameras to find underground nests, Wojahn said. Wasps will be sedated with carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, and pest workers will dig out the nests.
Local entomologists worry about native bees and other pollinators that also might be threatened if the Asian giant hornet gets established, said Todd Murray, a Washington State University extension entomologist.
Global economies and travel between faraway parts of the world are making invasive species more common, Murray said.
"When we do get establishment of a new invasive species, its' a 'forever change,' and becomes something we learn to live with," he said. This is definitely a hornet I don't want to learn to live with."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pope says coronavirus vaccine must be shared worldwide</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on Sunday for international scientific cooperation to discover a vaccine for the coronavirus and said any successful vaccine should be made available around the world.
Francis, who has been delivering his Sunday address from the papal library instead of St. Peter’s Square because of the lockdown in Italy, thanked all those around the world who were providing essential services.
He encouraged international cooperation to deal with the crisis and combat the virus, which has infected nearly 3.5 million people and killed more than 240,000 people worldwide.
“In fact, it is important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way to find vaccines and treatments,” he said.
Francis said it was also important to “guarantee universal access to essential technologies that allow each infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary medical treatment.”
World leaders pledged in April to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, but the United States did not take part in the launch of the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said the WHO was slow to react to the outbreak and was being “China-centric”, and as a consequence has announced a suspension of funding. The WHO has defended its handling of the crisis.
A number of pharmaceutical companies around the world have developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
The Trump administration is planning to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine with the goal of having 100 million doses ready by the end of 2020, according to a senior U.S. administration official.
Most experts have suggested clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months.
On Sunday, the pope also backed a proposal by an inter-religious group known as the Higher Committee on Human Fraternity for an international day of prayer and fasting on May 14 to ask God to help humanity overcome the pandemic.

Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 16:45 IST
 Pope Francis on Sunday called for an international collaboration in the search for a vaccine and treatment for COVID-19.
Speaking from the Apostolic Palace library after delivering his blessing, Francis stressed the importance of guaranteeing “universal access to the essential technologies that allow every infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary health care”.
Some cross-country research is already underway to develop a safe, effective vaccine, and scientists and doctors in various nations have been sharing experiences in using different drugs to treat patients.
The pope also invited faithful of all religions to spiritually unite in prayer, fasting and works of charity on May 14 to “implore God to help humanity to overcome the coronavirus pandemic”.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Muscat: Oman is expected to see the end of the COVID-19 epidemic on 19 June 2020, a new report that predicts when all of the countries around the world will be free of the disease.The report, which has been prepared by Singapore’s Data Driven Innovation Laboratory (DDI), predicts that 99 percent of COVID-19 infections in Oman will be gone by 25 May, 2020, and 100 percent of all infections will be dealt with by the 19th of June.The prediction report was prepared by professor Jianxi Luo of the DDI, which is part of the Singapore University of Technology and Design.“The pandemic life cycle pattern is expected to appear as an S-shape curve when one plots the accumulative count of infection cases over time or equivalently as a ‘bell-shape’ curve of the daily counts over time,” he explained in his paper that accompanied the report. “Note that the bell here is not expected to be symmetrical with no expectation of a normal distribution, but a long tail to the right.
“Such patterns as well as the underlying dynamics have been well studied in various domains including population growth, diffusion of new technologies and infectious diseases, and have theoretically established mathematical models, including the logistic model that describes a general life cycle phenomenon (such as population growth) and the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model that describes the dynamic process of the spread of infectious diseases,” added Luo

    <h5 class="mb-1">Latest Coronavirus Science: Pinning Down the True Fatality Rate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Every day brings new scientific insights into covid-19 and the coronavirus that causes it. Here are some of the latest studies and developments, including research into the virus’s fatality rate and impacts on children.
Most countries have implemented social distancing to keep covid-19 at bay, since there are no currently available vaccines or approved drugs to treat it. And we’re finally starting to learn what it takes for these lockdowns to slow or even halt the spread of the virus.
A new study in Science this week tried to measure how people in two regions of China moved around and interacted with others once the government began to enforce strict restrictions on travel. Researchers surveyed over 1,000 people total in Shanghai and Wuhan – the latter being the first known area in the world to report covid-19 cases – in early February, when the reported outbreak in China was at its peak and the lockdown was just underway.
The respondents in Wuhan said that, in December 2019, they interacted with about 14 people a day on average, while those in Shanghai area said they came into contact with 20 people. But during the shutdown, social contact was reduced dramatically, with people in both cities reporting that they saw only around two people a day on average, who were usually people living in their home.
The researchers found these social changes in both cities led to a drastic decrease in the virus’s ability to create new infections. Though some have criticised the validity of China’s official tally of cases and deaths, the country’s outbreak does seem to have slowed considerably. Other hard-hit countries, such as Italy and Spain, have seen a decline in reported cases following restrictions on social contact.
The U.S., however, continues to experience a plateau, with neither the number of new reported cases nor deaths dropping much during the month of April. So the country’s level of social distancing may only be doing enough to keep the outbreak from spreading exponentially, not driving it down. Despite this, several states are now easing restrictions on travel and in-person businesses.
Last weekend, doctors in Europe began sounding the alarm on a possible unexpected consequence of covid-19 in children. They noticed an uptick of children developing two rare inflammatory conditions that can fatally attack the body: Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Some of these children tested positive for the virus behind covid-19, and others were suspected of having survived an earlier infection.
On Wednesday, the first known U.S. case of Kawasaki disease possibly connected to covid-19 was reported by doctors at Stanford Children’s Hospital in California. The six-month-old girl had been diagnosed with Kawasaki disease soon after a visit to urgent care, with a positive test result for covid-19 coming later. Thankfully, Kawasaki disease can be treated successfully, with no long-term effects, if caught early. The infant was treated and quarantined for 14 days and seems to have recovered fully.
Though Kawasaki disease has been linked to viral infections, including from a human coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, researchers still know very little about exactly why the condition happens (genetics could play a role). Time will have to tell whether the connection between covid-19 and either condition in children is real, but it’s more evidence that younger people aren’t impervious to this pandemic.
A new study published Friday is the latest to suggest that covid-19 is especially bad for the heart.
Researchers looked at mortality data from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, encompassing nearly 9,000 patients with covid-19. They found a consistent pattern: Infected patients with pre-existing heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease or arrhythmia, were more likely to die than those without heart problems.
One theory for why covid-19 is more lethal for people with cardiovascular disease involves the drugs people take to manage their heart issues, particularly angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Both drugs interact with the receptor ACE2, which the coronavirus uses to hijack the cells it infects. Because of this shared link, some doctors have argued that patients may need to discontinue these drugs as a precaution. But organisations such as the American Heart Association have pushed back against the idea, stating that there hasn’t been any conclusive evidence of harm from taking either drug if you contract the virus.
In this study, the researchers found no relationship between using these drugs and a greater risk of death. Given how valuable they are for managing cardiovascular disease, that’s at least a bit of comfort, provided the study’s results hold up.
Lastly, a bit of math.
A loud minority of people continue to downplay the seriousness of covid-19. Many still insist that covid-19, once you take into account unreported cases, is likely to be no deadlier than the flu.
While the true fatality rate of covid-19 will take some time to figure out, though, we can definitely rule out that it’ll match the seasonal flu. A preliminary paper this week did it by simply taking the number of deaths in New York City, Madrid, Spain, and Lombardy, Italy – around 34,000 at the time – and dividing it by the combined 25.1 million residents living in those three areas. That yielded a mortality rate around 0.14 per cent, which is higher than the estimated 0.1 per cent rate associated with the typical flu.
But that number is far too generous, as the paper admits, since it assumes that every single person in Lombardy, New York City, and Madrid has caught the virus and that no further deaths will happen. Early evidence has suggested that perhaps a quarter of New Yorkers have had covid-19, and there continue to be many deaths from covid-19 that have gone unrecorded in New York City and worldwide.
One of the best ways to figure out covid-19’s fatality rate is to measure how many people carry antibodies to the coronavirus in an affected area, which can then be compared to reported deaths. Many of these studies are still underway, and some have been criticised for their methodology. Overall, though, their early findings suggest a fatality rate ranging from 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent. Those are numbers that would make covid-19 several times deadlier than the flu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has dumped his firm’s holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the “world has changed” for the aviation industry in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.
According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker there were 3,428,422 confirmed cases worldwide on Sunday, with 243,831 people losing their lives to the disease. The US continues to be the most affected country, with more than 1.3 million cases and 66,385 deaths.
Fewer than one in five Britons believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed.
Almost half of Britain’s doctors have sourced their own personal protective equipment or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels, according to a survey. The British Medical Association said its latest survey was the biggest of frontline NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.
European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an “international alliance” fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in €7.5bn (£6.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.
The spread of the coronavirus in India’s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, India’s correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors.
Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain’s PM told the Sun on Sunday: “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.” Johnson, 55, said: “The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.”
China’s most populous cities saw a leap in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China’s internet giant Baidu Inc.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Research Warns USA Of Another Corona Peak?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the United States is hoping that it has already reached the Peak of the Coronavirus and is looking forward to flattening the curve, a new study from Minnesota-based Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) has said that COVID-19 virus may well last 18 to 24 months.
The report titled “The future of the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons learned from pandemic influenza”, warns the authorities and the states to plan for the worst-case scenario (which involves a large second peak of cases in the fall of 2020), including no vaccine availability or herd immunity.
The report urged government agencies and healthcare delivery organizations to develop strategies to ensure adequate protection for healthcare workers. This news has come at the time when more than a dozen states in the US eased their Coronavirus Lockdowns.
The United States already registered around 1.2 Million cases with more than 65,000 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The coronavirus pandemic could last up to 2 years, according to US experts. They predict we may see a 2nd, larger wave of infections this fall.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic may last until 2022, according to a report published Thursday.
A group of researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak won’t end until 60% to 70% of the human population is immune to the virus, which may take between 18 and 24 months.
The experts laid out three scenarios for how the coronavirus pandemic will progress. The worst-case scenario among these three projections involves a second, larger wave of infections this fall and winter. The report authors suggest this is the most likely outcome, and states need to prepare for it.
“This thing’s not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70% of people,” Michael Osterholm, report author and the director of CIDRAP, told CNN. “The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.”

Osterholm and his colleagues examined multiple models that predict future coronavirus impacts, research about how well COVID-19 spreads between people, and data from past pandemics to reach their conclusions.
The coronavirus outbreak shares important similarities to a pandemic influenza, like the 1918 Spanish flu (which killed 500 million people worldwide), which makes this type of flu a solid model for comparison.
Both a pandemic influenza and the COVID-19 virus spread via droplets we emit when coughing or sneezing and can pass between infected people showing no symptoms – known as asymptomatic carriers. But even though pandemic influenza may be a good model to try and predict how the COVID-19 will outbreak will play out, experts still aren’t sure what to expect.
That’s because the coronavirus spreads even more easily than the flu does; an average person with the coronavirus infects between 2 and 2.5 new people: a metric known as the virus’ R0 value. Seasonal influenza’s Ro value is about 1.3.
“There is no crystal ball to tell us what the future holds and what the ‘end game’ for controlling this pandemic will be,” the report authors wrote.
That’s why Osterholm’s group came up with three possible scenarios about what might be coming after this first wave of coronavirus infections ends.
In this projection, the first COVID-19 waves is followed by a series of repetitive, smaller waves that occur through the summer. Those waves, which come with a lower number of infections with persist over a one- to two-year period, gradually diminishing sometime in 2021.
The authors noted that where those smaller waves occur could depend on what measures certain geographic areas have in place to “flatten the curve,” including social distancing and non-essential business closures, and how those measures are rolled back.
The worst of the three scenarios, and the most likely, is one in which the first wave is followed by a larger wave in the fall or winter of 2020, and one or more smaller subsequent waves in 2021.
This mirrors what happened during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 flu.
A second wave with more infections would require the US and other countries to reinstitute mitigation measures, like lockdowns, the authors wrote.
“States, territories, and tribal health authorities should plan for the worst-case scenario,” they added.
The final scenario suggests that this first wave of coronavirus infections is the only wave. In the coming months, the COVID-19 pandemic would shift into a “slow burn” of ongoing transmission and new cases.
“While this third pattern was not seen with past influenza pandemics, it remains a possibility for COVID-19,” the experts reported.
This possibility would mean US states likely wouldn’t need to lockdown again, although cases and deaths would continue to occur.
Each of these projections could be influenced by the development of a vaccine.
But any help a vaccine could provide during the pandemic will be a long time coming, the report authors said. The earliest a vaccine is expected is 2021.
“And we don’t know what kinds of challenges could arise during vaccine development that could delay the timeline,” they added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'US was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading; missed chances to contain COVID'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: The US government was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from Europe, which helped drive the acceleration of outbreaks across the nation, a top health official said Friday.
Limited testing and delayed travel alerts for areas outside China contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"We clearly didn't recognize the full importations that were happening," Schuchat told The Associated Press. The coronavirus was first reported late last year in China, the initial epicenter of the global pandemic.
But the U.S. has since become the hardest-hit nation, with about a third of the world's reported cases and more than a quarter of the deaths.
The CDC on Friday published an article, authored by Schuchat, that looked back on the U.S. response, recapping some of the major decisions and events of the last few months.
It suggests the nation's top public health agency missed opportunities to slow the spread.
Some public health experts saw it as important assessment by one of the nation's most respected public health doctors.
The CDC is responsible for the recognition, tracking and prevention of just such a disease.
But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings.
"The degree to which CDC's public presence has been so diminished is one of the most striking and frankly puzzling aspects of the federal government's response," said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on January 31, to stop entry into the U.S. of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days.
That took effect Feb. 2. China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically.
But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travelers arrived in the U.S. from Italy and other European countries during February.
The U.S.government didn't block travel from there until March 11. "The extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread," she told the AP.
"I think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier." She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S.
and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time. The article is carefully worded, but Schwartz saw it as a notable departure from the White House narrative.
"This report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States," he said.
In the article, Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia.
The gatherings spawned many cases, and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds.
Asked about that during the interview, Schuchat said: "I think in retrospect, taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification (of the U.S. outbreak), or delayed the speed of it."
But she also noted there was an evolving public understanding of just how bad things were, as well as a change in what kind of measures "including stay-at-home orders" people were willing to accept.
"I think that people's willingness to accept the mitigation is unfortunately greater once they see the harm the virus can do," she said.
"There will be debates about should we have started much sooner, or did we go too far too fast." Schuchat's article still leaves a lot of questions unanswered, said Dr. Howard Markel, a public health historian at the University of Michigan.
It doesn't reveal what kind of proposals were made, and perhaps ignored, during the critical period before U.S. cases began to take off in late February, he said.
"I want to know the conversations, the memos the presidential edicts," said Markel, who's written history books on past pandemics.
"Because I still believe this did not need to be as bad as it turned out."

    <h5 class="mb-1">CDC official says US reacted too slowly to curb coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US government was slow to react to the looming coronavirus pandemic as it spread from Europe, which led to rocketing rates of infection and death in the country, a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
Anne Schuchat, the second in command at the CDC, said a lack of testing and a delay in travel alerts contributed to the galloping spread of COVID-19 in the US.
‘We clearly didn’t recognize the full importations that were happening,” Schuchat told the Associated Press Friday.
The coronavirus was first detected in China late last year but the US has since become the global epicenter of the virus, with more than one million confirmed cases and over 65,000 deaths.
The CDC published an article written by Schuchat last week re-examining the US government’s response to the coronavirus. She says the country’s top public health agencies missed the opportunity to halt the spread of the disease.
Although President Trump halted travel of any foreign nationals who had been in China on Feb. 2, Schuchat said more than 2 million people arrived from Italy and other European countries in February, fueling the spread of the coronavirus.
“The extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,” she told the AP. ”I think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five ways the coronavirus could change American politics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">How will the coronavirus crisis affect American politics?
The focus, for now, is naturally on the emergency itself. As of Friday evening, more than 1 million people in the U.S. had been infected by the coronavirus and more than 59,000 had died, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
But here are five areas where the crisis could have a political impact over the longer term.
Universal health care
The global nature of the health crisis has been a reminder of the United States’s status as the only first-world nation without universal health care coverage.
Additionally, the underpinnings of the U.S. system — where many people’s health insurance is linked to their employment — is under new scrutiny as enormous job losses scythe across the nation. More than 30 million Americans have filed new unemployment claims in the past six weeks.
There is some evidence that the crisis is shifting public views of health care.
A Morning Consult poll in mid-March, just as the crisis was beginning to hit the U.S. hard, found increasing support for universal, government-provided coverage.
The poll found 26 percent of all adults saying it was “much more likely” they would support such a concept and an additional 15 percent saying it was “somewhat more likely.” 
Fifty-nine percent of Democrats chose one of those options, but so did 25 percent of Republicans. Only 12 percent of adults said the crisis made it less likely they would support universal health care.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a leading proponent of the idea, has asserted that the crisis makes his case. 
In a March op-ed for CNN, written before he suspended his presidential campaign, Sanders asserted that universal health care was vital because people would otherwise be discouraged from seeking medical treatment because of the cost. “When somebody is not treated for the virus, that means the infection can spread to many others, putting whole communities at risk,” he wrote.
Still, there is no guarantee that the coronavirus crisis will move opinions on universal health care in a permanent way. And even if it did so, it is an open question whether legislation to achieve it could be enacted. 
Republicans, including President Trump, are adamantly opposed to such an idea. And even the much more modest Affordable Care Act passed under former President Obama remains divisive. Forty-two percent of voters think it was a good idea, while 35 percent say it was a bad idea, according to a March poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal.
Mail-in voting
The coronavirus crisis may yet herald a change in Americans’ perceptions of voting itself — specifically, the desirability of casting ballots by mail rather than in person.
If the virus were to still be a danger in November, many people would be reluctant to wait in long lines for protracted periods. 
There are already signs that the nation is warming to the idea of voting by mail. 
An AP-NORC poll released last week found almost 40 percent of adults supported holding elections exclusively by mail — an approximate doubling of the popularity of that opinion since 2018. 
In the same poll, an outright majority — 56 percent — said people should be allowed to vote by mail without having to provide a specific reason for doing so. 
Five states currently hold elections entirely by mail, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Several other states permit some elections to be conducted by mail or allow individual counties to decide to hold mail-in elections if they wish.
Trump has been notably skeptical of the idea, asserting at one point simply that “mail ballots, they cheat. ... Mail ballots are very dangerous for this country because of cheaters.” Trump himself, however, voted by mail earlier this year, casting an absentee ballot in Florida.
There are some concerns across the partisan divide that mail-in voting may carry a higher potential for fraud than in-person voting. 
But the states that have adopted it have not incurred wide-scale problems, and the coronavirus crisis could see its acceptability reach critical mass.
Immigration
President Trump announced on Twitter on April 20 that he would move to “temporarily suspend immigration into the United States” in response to the crisis.
He subsequently issued an executive order, but it was not quite so sweeping. It paused green cards from being issued for at least 60 days, but it included a number of exceptions. It did not, for example, affect green card applicants who are already in the United States.
Immigrant advocates blasted the move nonetheless, accusing the president of using the crisis to pursue the kind of hard line on the issue that he has long favored.
Some opinion polls, however, suggest many Americans share Trump’s views — at least for now.
A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted from April 21 to April 26 found 65 percent of adults backing the idea of temporarily blocking “nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak.”
Republicans in that poll supported such a pause overwhelmingly, 83 percent to 17 percent. But Democrats, usually seen as more pro-immigration, were split evenly: 49 percent supporting and 49 percent opposing.
Immigrant groups argue that such results could be a temporary blip in the midst of a crisis and should not distract from the fact that most Americans think immigration is a net benefit to the nation.
But the nature of the crisis — a threat that began in China and went on to cause havoc across the globe — could yet affect views not just of immigration but also of freedom of movement and globalization more generally.
The social safety net
Could the coronavirus crisis — and the sheer scale of the economic devastation it has wreaked — also lead to a reappraisal of the need for a stronger social safety net in general?
The fact that the nation is experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime shock suggests to some people that sizable changes could be made. 
Businessman Andrew Yang held out the idea of a universal basic income during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. In April, Yang tweeted that Spain was adopting universal basic income in response to the coronavirus and that “the US should follow suit.” A Washington Post headline around the same time asserted that “the pandemic strengthens the case for universal basic income.”
Others have asserted that the crisis reinforces the need for paid sick leave — a call that Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made at a March news conference. 
There are also new questions about unemployment benefits and whether some states lack the infrastructure to get such assistance promptly to those who need it.
But many experts are skeptical that even such a major crisis will fundamentally alter how most Americans view the social compact.
Joshua Clinton, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, recently told CNBC, “There might be a slight shift, but I don’t think that you’ll see a grand shift in how people think about the structure of the state and the relationship of the state to their own lives.”
Political campaigning
One of the most obvious political impacts of the coronavirus has been on the nature of campaigning.
With mass rallies out of the question, candidates and campaigns have had to think about other ways to reach voters.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has been largely confined to video messages from his Delaware home and has struggled to remain as central to the national political discussion as might be the case in more normal times. President Trump has been accused by critics of using his press briefings on the crisis as a replacement for the rallies that he can no longer hold.
The Democratic National Convention has already been pushed back from its originally scheduled date in mid-July to a month later. Trump has insisted the equivalent Republican event will go on as planned the following week.
It is clear that the crisis will have a profound effect on this year’s presidential campaign.
But it is harder to imagine other changes — such as a shift to virtual campaigning — sticking for good and becoming the norm in future election cycles.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Report: The COVID-19 pandemic could last up to two years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The pandemic that has brought businesses and lives globally to a standstill is believed to have started sometime around mid-November last year. The South China Morning Post traced the first-known instance of the infection to a 55-year-old man, who may have contracted the disease around November 17.
While tracing back the origin and the beginning of the infections could help scientists find a way to combat the COVID-19 disease, a question on the minds of people affected by the pandemic is 'how long will all of this last?'
A new report by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), Academic Health Center at the University of Minnesota, focuses on answering this very question. Given how different other coronavirus epidemics such as SARS or MERS are in comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers used the influenza pandemics to analyse the possible scenarios that we might see in the future of this pandemic.
Pandemics Since the early 1700s, at least eight global influenza pandemics have occurred, and four of these occurred since 1900: in 1918-19, 1957, 1968, and 2009-10.
The report said, "Even though coronaviruses are very different from influenza viruses, the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic influenza share several important similarities." These similarities, according to the study, are as follows:
1.  SARS-CoV-2 and a pandemic influenza virus are novel viral pathogens to which the global population has little to no pre-existing immunity.
2. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are predominantly spread via the respiratory route by large droplets, but also with a significant component of transmission by smaller aerosols.
3. Asymptomatic transmission occurs with both viruses as well, thereby contributing to the spread of each.
4. Finally, both types of viruses are capable of infecting millions of people and moving rapidly around the globe.
The report also focuses on a few key differences here;  one is that influenza viruses have a shorter incubation period  (1 to 4 days) vs. COVID-19.
The second one is that, based on reports released so far, 25 per cent of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic while the asymptomatic ratio for influenza is considerably lower.
Another key finding of difference is that the viral shedding rate for COVID-19 cases, before symptoms show, is higher than the influenza virus, This difference denotes a much higher rate of transmission in the pre-symptomatic phase amid chances of delayed diagnosis.
The number of people who can be infected by one coronavirus case is around 2 to 3 - in some cases as high as tens of people depending on extent of direct contact, asymptomatic stage of carriers etc. This is also significantly higher than any influenza virus pandemic that the world has seen as of now.
The COVID-19 pandemic could last for up to two years.
Based on the behaviour of virus in the influenza pandemics, and correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 virus markers. the experts concluded three possible scenarios. All three scenarios show one thing in common - the pandemic is not going anywhere soon.
The study said, "The length of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be 18 to 24 months, as herd immunity gradually develops in the human population." The report added that achieving 60 to 70 per cent herd immunity in the population could take time given that the length of such immunity to this virus is not known as of now.
The first scenario that the experts put forward in what the pandemic will look like sees this wave as the biggest infection wave, which could be followed by smaller waves of infection throughout summer. The first scenario assumes a gradual diminishing of the infections by 2021.
The second scenario, if it happens, could mean that the worst is yet to come. The experts expect in this scenario that the infection wave will return stronger in fall (autumn) or winter in 2020, followed by one or more smaller waves in 2021. The researchers add: "This pattern is similar to what was seen with the 1918-19 pandemic."
In this scenario the experts believe it is possible that the first wave of COVID-19 in spring 2020 is followed by a “slow burn” of ongoing transmission and case occurrence, but without a clear wave pattern. This scenario has no precedence in past influenza pandemics, however, could be a possible future for COVID-19 the experts found.
In all three scernarios, the pandemic is expected to last up to two years and well into 2021. The experts concluded, "As the pandemic wanes, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population and will synchronize to a seasonal pattern with diminished severity over time."
Giving more credence to this outlook, Harvard scientists who modeled the pandemic's trajectory told AFP that a one-time lockdown won't halt the novel coronavirus and repeated periods of social distancing may be required into 2022 to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.
The Harvard team's computer simulation, which was published in a paper in the journal Science, assumed that COVID-19 will become seasonal, like closely related coronaviruses that cause the common cold, with higher transmission rates in colder months.
But much remains unknown, including the level of immunity acquired by previous infection and how long it lasts, the authors said.
However, new facts and data are still being collected about the novel coronavirus - no data sheet about this disease is complete.
"This is an excellent study that uses mathematical models to explore the dynamics of COVID-19 over a period of several years, in contrast to previously published studies that have focused on the coming weeks or months," Mark Woolhouse, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh said.
"It is important to recognize that it is a model; it is consistent with current data but is nonetheless based on a series of assumptions - for example about acquired immunity - that are yet to be confirmed."

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Approval Broadens Use of COVID-19 Drug Remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 US states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
US Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA allows emergency use of anti-viral vaccine Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: The US food and drug regulatory body has allowed the emergency use of an investigational anti-viral vaccine to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by an Indian-American physician, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
The FDA authorisation came after researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, reported Remdesivir shortened the recovery times in people who have fallen ill from the new coronavirus.
"I'm pleased to announce that Gilead now has an EUA (emergency use authorisation) from the FDA for Remdesivir," US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Trump said that EUA is an important treatment for hospitalised coronavirus patients.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that this is a significant step forward in battling COVID-19.
The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.
By Friday, over 63,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus and over one million have tested positive with COVID-19.
Trump said that his administration has been doing work with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.
"I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time. For the first case, that was diagnosed in the United States to now, our first step forward with a therapeutic in less than 90 days," said Deborah Birx, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.
In a statement, Gilead said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.
Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.
Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted.
"This EUA opens the way for us to provide emergency use of Remdesivir to more patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19," said Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences.
"We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of Remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug's profile. We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility," he said.
According to Gilead, the EUA is based on available data from two global clinical trials - the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases' placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, including those who were critically ill, and Gilead's global Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of Remdesivir in patients with severe disease.
Multiple additional clinical trials are ongoing to generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine as a treatment for COVID-19, it said.
Indian-American Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, is one of the lead investigators of the study.
Earlier in an interview to Fox news, Subramanian said that "there's a lot more work to be done in terms of exactly who should get this drug, what is the best timing, who is at highest risk for having complications ... And what can we add to this or what can we improve upon this to make outcomes even better."
"This (remdesivir) is a direct-acting antiviral. It has been shown to have great promise in the lab and in animal models and for the first time now in human clinical trials," Subramanian told Fox News.
"We know that so far, it's been very safe and tolerable. We've had good clinical outcomes and yesterday we found that compared to placebo, that is people who are given no medication, people do much better," she said.
FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn said, "today's action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The regulator body can revise the Remdesivir's status from temporary to full approval if Gilead Sciences or other researchers generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for treating coronavirus patients
The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the experimental drug Remdesivir to treat coronavirus patients.
"I'm pleased to announce that Gilead now has a EUA (emergency use authorisation) from the FDA for Remdesivir," US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
The US food and drug regulatory body allowed the drug's authorisation after some studies, including one led by an Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug Remdesivir shortened the recovery time for the hospitalised patients with severe coronavirus infection.
"Based on evaluation of the emergency use authorization criteria and the scientific evidence available, it was determined that it is reasonable to believe that Remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, given there are no adequate, approved or available alternative treatments, the known and potential benefits to treat this serious or life-threatening virus currently outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug's use," FDA said in a statement.
A government-sponsored study earlier showed that the drug Remdesivir helped recover some of the infected coronavirus patients by 31%.

The research-based biopharmaceutical company is working with the US government, USFDA and National Institute of Health on the logistics of distribution for the vaccine to enable its access across the country.
The authorization is temporary, Gilead said and added that Remdesivir remains an investigational drug, which has not been approved by the FDA.
The regulator body can revise the Remdesivir's status from temporary to full approval if Gilead Sciences or other researchers generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for treating coronavirus patients.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Washington approves virus drug as US states ease lockdowns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Washington: American authorities approved an experimental drug for emergency use on coronavirus patients, as more US states eased pandemic lockdowns despite another spike in deaths from the disease.
The approval is the latest step in a global push to find viable treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown, hammered the world economy, and infected more than 3.3 million people.
Remdesivir, an antiviral drug initially developed to treat Ebola, was given the green light on Friday after a major trial found that it boosted recovery in serious COVID-19 patients.
"It's really a very promising situation," President Donald Trump said on Friday at the White House, where he was joined by Daniel O'Day, CEO of Gilead Sciences, which developed Remdesivir.
Remdesivir incorporates itself into the virus's genome, short-circuiting its replication process.
The drug approval came as the US leaders struggled with growing pressure from citizens wearying of stay-at-home orders.
With about 1.1 million confirmed coronavirus cases, nearly 65,000 of them fatal, the United States has the highest tolls of any country, and Trump is keen for a turnaround as the world's largest economy reels with tens of millions left jobless.
"Hopefully, we're going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless," said Trump, after suggesting earlier in the week the country could expect 60,000 or 70,000 fatalities.
Texas became the largest US state yet to ease curbs, while anti-lockdown demonstrations were held in several states - including California, where officials had re-closed beaches beginning Friday to avoid a repeat of last weekend when crowds flocked to the shoreline.
There were protests in 11 cities in California - where more than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported - with people chanting against the lockdown.
In Huntington Beach, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Los Angeles, several thousand people rallied to denounce Governor Gavin Newsom's beach shutdown order.
"It was the straw that broke the camel's back," protester Monica Beilhard fumed.
"It was uncalled for, unnecessary and people out here are making that known," she said. "And we're also very much saying enough is enough, we have the right to work... and it's time for the governor to allow the healthy to be able to get back to business."
Like the United States, governments around the world are struggling to balance the immense political and economic pressure to ease lockdowns with the need for public health measures against the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 236,000 people.
Several European countries, including Austria, have begun to ease restrictions with authorities in some of the hardest-hit parts like Spain reporting signs that the pandemic there was slowing.
Britain announced that it had hit its target of conducting 100,000 coronavirus tests a day, a step toward eventually lifting lockdown rules in the UK - which this week overtook Spain to record the world's third-highest death toll.
Ireland, however, extended its lockdown by two weeks to May 18, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saying the nation will reopen "in a slow, phased, staged way" after that.
Meanwhile in South Asia, India announced that the lockdown on its 1.3 billion people - the world's biggest - would continue for two more weeks from May 4.
The virus restrictions also put a damper on May Day celebrations worldwide on Friday, with many labor unions delaying their rallies and some holding online events, while a determined few hit the streets in face masks in defiance of lockdown orders.
In Cuba's capital, Havana, where around a million workers and their families take part in the annual May Day march, the image of Che Guevara gazed down on an eerily silent Revolution Square.
May Day carried extra significance this year because of the staggering number of people put out of work by the pandemic, with the global economy in a tailspin and facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
Stock markets tumbled again on Friday after President Trump's unproven allegation that the virus may have come from a lab in Wuhan - the central Chinese city where the disease first emerged late last year.
Beijing has rejected the accusation, and scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans.
The White House has accused Chinese authorities of mishandling the outbreak, "slow-walking" coronavirus data and putting US lives at risk.
The disease overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure when it hit the United States, putting immense pressure on doctors, nurses and emergency responders.
Some US medics relied on past experience in other countries to fight the virus.
David Callaway, a doctor and academic who has worked in the past on diseases in conflict-hit nations such as South Sudan and Iraq, said he found overseas epidemics easier to handle in some ways.
"Family and loved ones, you can put them in a box and you use them as a source of motivation and inspiration when things get rough, but you know they are safe," he told AFP.
"A pandemic at home, you know that your family and your loved ones are still at risk, their lives hang on the line."

    <h5 class="mb-1">How an unproven drug became a bellwether for global stocks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As soon as Dr Anthony Fauci uttered the magic words, stock markets surged.
Sitting alongside Donald Trump in the Oval Office, the US government’s top infectious diseases official on Wednesday said a trial of the drug remdesivir had shown a “clear cut significant positive effect” in treating coronavirus. 
It was the first official confirmation that the antiviral treatment made by Californian drugmaker Gilead might be able to help patients recover more quickly from a disease that has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide. 
By the end of Wednesday, the S&P 500 had closed almost 2.7 per cent higher, while Gilead’s shares added roughly 6 per cent. 
The market moves underscored how data from trials of remdesivir have become a proxy for wider investor sentiment. As traders struggle to price assets while huge swaths of the global economy are shut down and unemployment is surging, they have homed in on the prospects for a treatment that might allow the world to reopen more quickly. 
In previous financial crises it would have been unthinkable for preliminary data from a single drug trial to result in a broad-based rise in stock prices. But at a time when investors have few barometers, the success or failure of one medicine has become a bellwether for the overall market.
“It’s wild to think that something like remdesivir could be a binary readout for the entire stock market,” said Brad Loncar, founder of Loncar Investments, which runs two biotech funds. 
The positive data from the remdesivir study run by the US government was accompanied by several caveats. Dr Fauci warned it was not a “knockout” trial and that the drug did not demonstrate a statistically significant impact on survival rates. Researchers say it is impossible to draw firm conclusions without first seeing the full results, which have yet to be published in a medical journal.
The choreography of Dr Fauci’s impromptu announcement this week — which was shoehorned into a scheduled event with the governor of Louisiana — was unusual. Headline results from drug trials tend to be released by the company making the medicine or the group conducting the study before full data is presented at a medical meeting and printed in a peer-reviewed publication. 
Dr Fauci said he had decided to unveil the preliminary results because he was concerned they would leak after the researchers conducting the trial were told they should move patients receiving a placebo on to Gilead’s drug. 
Concerns over the leaking of non-public information — and the potential for market manipulation — have plagued the pharma industry for years. Famously, Martha Stewart, the lifestyle guru, went to jail after being convicted of lying to investigators over the sale of shares in 2001 in ImClone, a biotech company, ahead of an unfavourable ruling by the US Food and Drug Administration. 
Dr Fauci’s announcement capped a frenzied fortnight during which markets gyrated as conflicting, unofficial information about the effectiveness of remdesivir leaked out in dribs and drabs. 
In mid-April, Stat News reported that patients were responding to the drug. The medical news website said it had obtained a copy of a video of a trial investigator at the University of Chicago — who was studying the medicine in just 125 people — saying most of her patients had been discharged. Even in the absence of detailed information or a confirmation from Gilead, the tiny snapshot of success prompted the drugmaker’s shares to rise by as much as 14 per cent while S&P 500 futures gained in after-hours trading. 
Just one week later, the World Health Organisation accidentally published a summary of the results of another trial from China, which showed patients taking the drug had not improved. On the day the Financial Times reported the results, the S&P 500 ended down having been up as much as 1.6 per cent while Gilead fell 4 per cent.
The link between broader stock prices and remdesivir data has raised concerns that investors are putting too much store in incomplete information that they do not fully understand, resulting in hype-fuelled bubbles that could burst and exacerbate market volatility. Even the most experienced biotech fund managers struggle to read complex clinical trial results at speed, and they often disagree on the magnitude of supposedly clear-cut data. 
“I pity the people . . . trying to do this based on their sketchy ability to read good information out of highly technical medical documents,” David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. 
It would not be the first time that generalist investors, known disparagingly as “biotech tourists” by specialist fund managers, have piled in to pharmaceutical stocks only to end up losing money. The sector also attracts a large number of retail traders, who are attracted by the binary nature of trial results that can result in sharp stock price movements: it is the investment equivalent of a gambler at a casino roulette wheel who puts all their chips on black or red. 
“There are moments like this where biotech is front and centre and people who don’t know what they’re doing throw money at the sector,” said Mr Loncar. “If history is any guide, those people often get burnt.” 
ExplainerCoronavirusRemdesivir: Five things to know about the antiviral drug
Gilead, which was chaired by Donald Rumsfeld between 1997 and 2001, when he was appointed as George Bush’s defence secretary, has always been something of a political stock. Even as it has churned out revolutionary treatments that can treat viral diseases and prevent HIV, it has generated negative attention from lawmakers for charging high prices and allegedly profiting from government-funded research. 
However, Geoffrey Porges, a biotech analyst at SVB Leerink, said the current level of scrutiny directed at Gilead is “unprecedented”. He has received a constant string of calls from fund managers trying to interpret the data, in part because they see the pharma sector as a hedge against the wider market: the theory is that the price of biotech stocks with potential drugs and vaccines could still go up even if other sectors decline. 
“The virus is wagging the market back and forth,” said Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton, which manages $580bn of assets. “I understand the move in Gilead. I just don't understand the move in the entire market.”
He added: “Everyone is trying to become an expert on the disease. But the truth is we're not experts on the medical side . . . and that has been part of the problem.”
However, while the release of a successful treatment or vaccine might indeed allow the economy to reopen, leading to an eventual recovery in broad stock prices, pharma companies do not necessarily stand to generate significant revenues from their products — at least, not for now. 
The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.
After years of negative publicity over the price of drugs, most drugmakers have pledged to give treatments and vaccines away for free or sell them at cost price while the crisis is at its most acute. Gilead, for instance, has said it will give away 1.5m doses of remdesivir until the end of May. Given the considerable cost of developing and making a medicine, that means the company will initially lose money on its remdesivir project. 
Just as the markets closed on Friday, President Trump announced that remdesivir had received emergency regulatory approval. The FDA confirmed the news — and issued guidance warning patients that little is known about the side effects of the drug. The stock, which had been down almost 5 per cent on concerns that Gilead will not profit from the drug, climbed in after hours trading, up 1.6 per cent.
Even if Gilead does commercialise the drug, Mr Loncar predicts peak annual revenues in the “low single-digit billions” — a “blockbuster” in pharma parlance, but not a particularly lucrative one. Compare that with the increase in the company’s market capitalisation since February, when investors were first excited by the potential of remdesivir: it has risen by about $25bn.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Washington approves virus drug as US states ease lockdowns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The approval is the latest step in a global push to find viable treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown.Washington, United States - American authorities approved an experimental drug for emergency use on coronavirus patients, as more US states eased pandemic lockdowns despite another spike in deaths from the disease. The approval is the latest step in a global push to find viable treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown, hammered the world economy, and infected more than 3.3 million people. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug initially developed to treat Ebola, was given the green light on Friday after a major trial found that it boosted recovery in serious COVID-19 patients. "It's really a very promising situation," President Donald Trump said on Friday at the White House, where he was joined by Daniel O'Day, CEO of Gilead Sciences, which developed Remdesivir. Remdesivir incorporates itself into the virus's genome, short-circuiting its replication process. The drug approval came as the US leaders struggled with growing pressure from citizens wearying of stay-at-home orders. With about 1.1 million confirmed coronavirus cases, nearly 65,000 of them fatal, the United States has the highest tolls of any country, and Trump is keen for a turnaround as the world's largest economy reels with tens of millions left jobless. "Hopefully, we're going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless," said Trump, after suggesting earlier in the week the country could expect 60,000 or 70,000 fatalities. Texas became the largest US state yet to ease curbs, while anti-lockdown demonstrations were held in several states -- including California, where officials had re-closed beaches beginning Friday to avoid a repeat of last weekend when crowds flocked to the shoreline. There were protests in 11 cities in California -- where more than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported -- with people chanting against the lockdown. In Huntington Beach, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Los Angeles, several thousand people rallied to denounce Governor Gavin Newsom's beach shutdown order. "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," protester Monica Beilhard fumed. "It was uncalled for, unnecessary and people out here are making that known," she said. "And we're also very much saying enough is enough, we have the right to work... and it's time for the governor to allow the healthy to be able to get back to business." - 'Slow, phased' reopening -Like the United States, governments around the world are struggling to balance the immense political and economic pressure to ease lockdowns with the need for public health measures against the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 236,000 people. Several European countries, including Austria, have begun to ease restrictions with authorities in some of the hardest-hit parts like Spain reporting signs that the pandemic there was slowing. Britain announced that it had hit its target of conducting 100,000 coronavirus tests a day, a step toward eventually lifting lockdown rules in the UK -- which this week overtook Spain to record the world's third-highest death toll. Ireland, however, extended its lockdown by two weeks to May 18, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saying the nation will reopen "in a slow, phased, staged way" after that. Meanwhile in South Asia, India announced that the lockdown on its 1.3 billion people -- the world's biggest -- would continue for two more weeks from May 4. The virus restrictions also put a damper on May Day celebrations worldwide on Friday, with many labor unions delaying their rallies and some holding online events, while a determined few hit the streets in face masks in defiance of lockdown orders. In Cuba's capital Havana, where around a million workers and their families take part in the annual May Day march, the image of Che Guevara gazed down on an eerily silent Revolution Square. - Sharp rhetoric - May Day carried extra significance this year because of the staggering number of people put out of work by the pandemic, with the global economy in a tailspin and facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression. Stock markets tumbled again on Friday after President Trump's unproven allegation that the virus may have come from a lab in Wuhan -- the central Chinese city where the disease first emerged late last year. Beijing has rejected the accusation, and scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans. The White House has accused Chinese authorities of mishandling the outbreak, "slow-walking" coronavirus data and putting US lives at risk. The disease overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure when it hit the United States, putting immense pressure on doctors, nurses and emergency responders. Some US medics relied on past experience in other countries to fight the virus. David Callaway, a doctor and academic who has worked in the past on diseases in conflict-hit nations such as South Sudan and Iraq, said he found overseas epidemics easier to handle in some ways. "Family and loved ones, you can put them in a box and you use them as a source of motivation and inspiration when things get rough, but you know they are safe," he told AFP. "A pandemic at home, you know that your family and your loved ones are still at risk, their lives hang on the line."

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA allows emergency use of anti-viral vaccine Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Washington: The US food and drug regulatory body has allowed emergency use of an investigational anti-viral vaccine to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by an Indian-American physician, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of investigational anti-viral Remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
The FDA authorization came after researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, who reported Remdesivir shortened the recovery times in people who have fallen ill from the new coronavirus.
"I'm pleased to announce that Gilead now has a EUA (emergency use authorization) from the FDA for Remdesivir," US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Trump said that EUA is an important treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that this is a significant step forward in battling COVID-19.
The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with a severe condition.
By Friday, over 63,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus and over one million have tested positive with COVID-19.
Trump said that his administration has been doing work with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.
"I think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time. For the first case, that was diagnosed in the United States to now, our first step forward with a therapeutic in less than 90 days," said Deborah Birx, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.
In a statement, Gilead said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.
Remdesivir is authorized for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.
Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of the disease.
The authorization is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review, and approval process, Gilead noted.
"This EUA opens the way for us to provide emergency use of Remdesivir to more patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19," said Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences.
"We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of Remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug's profile. We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility," he said.
According to Gilead, the EUA is based on available data from two global clinical trials  the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases' placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, including those who were critically ill, and Gilead's global Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of Remdesivir in patients with severe disease.
Multiple additional clinical trials are ongoing to generate more data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine as a treatment for COVID-19, it said.
Indian-American Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, is one of the lead investigators of the study.
Earlier in an interview to Fox News, Subramanian said that "there's a lot more work to be done in terms of exactly who should get this drug, what is the best timing, who is at highest risk for having complications. And what can we add to this or what can we improve upon this to make outcomes even better."
"This (remdesivir) is a direct-acting antiviral. It has been shown to have great promise in the lab and in animal models and for the first time now in human clinical trials," Subramanian told Fox News.
"We know that so far, it's been very safe and tolerable. We've had good clinical outcomes and yesterday we found that compared to placebo, that is people who are given no medication, people do much better," she said.
FDA Commissioner Stephen M.Hahn said, "today's action is an important step in our efforts to collaborate with innovators and researchers to provide sick patients timely access to new therapies where appropriate, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether they are safe and effective."

    <h5 class="mb-1">US allows use of 1st drug shown to help virus recovery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.
The Food and Drug Administration cleared Gilead Science’s intravenous drug for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.
“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”
The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
Dr. Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug's benefit.
“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”
The FDA said preliminary results from the government study warranted Friday's decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”
The drug's side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.
The National Institutes of Health’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.
The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs, tests and other medical products during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment's potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Gilead has said it will donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the U.S. government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to parts of the country that need it most.
No drugs are currently FDA-approved for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”
The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.
The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects. The agency made the announcements after receiving new reports of injury and death with the medication, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about hydroxychloroquine. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given the pill-based drug were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Authorises Ebola Drug For Coronavirus Treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised emergency use of the Ebola drug remdesivir for treating the coronavirus.The authorisation means the anti-viral drug can now be used on people who are hospitalised with severe Covid-19.A recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten the recovery time for people who were seriously ill.However, it did not significantly improve survival rates.Experts have warned the drug - which was originally developed to treat Ebola, and is produced by Gilead pharmaceutical company in California - should not be seen as a "magic bullet" for coronavirus.The drug interferes with the virus's genome, disrupting its ability to replicate.During a meeting with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said the FDA authorisation was an important first step.The company would donate 1.5 million vials of the drug, he said.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn also said at the meeting: "It's the first authorised therapy for Covid-19, so we're really proud to be part of it."Emergency FDA authorisation is not the same as formal approval, which requires a higher level of review.What do we know about remdesivir?The drug did not cure Ebola, and Gilead says on its website: "Remdesivir is an experimental medicine that does not have established safety or efficacy for the treatment of any condition." Gilead also warns of possible serious side-effects.However, President Trump has been a vocal supporter of remdesivir as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.In its clinical trial, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11.The trials involved 1,063 people at hospitals around the world - including the US, France, Italy, the UK, China and South Korea. Some patients were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment.Dr Anthony Fauci who runs NIAID, said that remdesivir had "a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery".However, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - the trials did not give any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus.As much remains uncertain about the treatment regime, Gilead suggests a 10-day dosing duration for patients on ventilators and five days for patients who are not.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Washington approves virus drug as US states ease lockdowns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American authorities approved an experimental drug for emergency use on coronavirus patients, as more US states eased pandemic lockdowns despite another spike in deaths from the disease.
American authorities approved an experimental drug for emergency use on coronavirus patients, as more US states eased pandemic lockdowns despite another spike in deaths from the disease.
The approval is the latest step in a global push to find viable treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown, hammered the world economy, and infected more than 3.3 million people.
Remdesivir, an antiviral drug initially developed to treat Ebola, was given the green light on Friday after a major trial found that it boosted recovery in serious COVID-19 patients.
 
"It's really a very promising situation," President Donald Trump said on Friday at the White House, where he was joined by Daniel O'Day, CEO of Gilead Sciences, which developed Remdesivir.

Remdesivir incorporates itself into the virus's genome, short-circuiting its replication process.
 
The drug approval came as the US leaders struggled with growing pressure from citizens wearying of stay-at-home orders.
 
With about 1.1 million confirmed coronavirus cases, nearly 65,000 of them fatal, the United States has the highest tolls of any country, and Trump is keen for a turnaround as the world's largest economy reels with tens of millions left jobless.
 
"Hopefully, we're going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless," said Trump, after suggesting earlier in the week the country could expect 60,000 or 70,000 fatalities.
 
Texas became the largest US state yet to ease curbs, while anti-lockdown demonstrations were held in several states -- including California, where officials had re-closed beaches beginning Friday to avoid a repeat of last weekend when crowds flocked to the shoreline.
 
There were protests in 11 cities in California -- where more than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported -- with people chanting against the lockdown.
 
In Huntington Beach, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Los Angeles, several thousand people rallied to denounce Governor Gavin Newsom's beach shutdown order.
 
"It was the straw that broke the camel's back," protester Monica Beilhard fumed.
 
"It was uncalled for, unnecessary and people out here are making that known," she said. "And we're also very much saying enough is enough, we have the right to work... and it's time for the governor to allow the healthy to be able to get back to business."
 
'Slow, phased' reopening
 
Like the United States, governments around the world are struggling to balance the immense political and economic pressure to ease lockdowns with the need for public health measures against the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 236,000 people.
 
Several European countries, including Austria, have begun to ease restrictions with authorities in some of the hardest-hit parts like Spain reporting signs that the pandemic there was slowing.
 
Britain announced that it had hit its target of conducting 100,000 coronavirus tests a day, a step toward eventually lifting lockdown rules in the UK -- which this week overtook Spain to record the world's third-highest death toll.
 
Ireland, however, extended its lockdown by two weeks to May 18, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saying the nation will reopen "in a slow, phased, staged way" after that.
 
Meanwhile in South Asia, India announced that the lockdown on its 1.3 billion people -- the world's biggest -- would continue for two more weeks from May 4.
 
The virus restrictions also put a damper on May Day celebrations worldwide on Friday, with many labor unions delaying their rallies and some holding online events, while a determined few hit the streets in face masks in defiance of lockdown orders.
 
In Cuba's capital Havana, where around a million workers and their families take part in the annual May Day march, the image of Che Guevara gazed down on an eerily silent Revolution Square.
 
Sharp rhetoric
 
May Day carried extra significance this year because of the staggering number of people put out of work by the pandemic, with the global economy in a tailspin and facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
 
Stock markets tumbled again on Friday after President Trump's unproven allegation that the virus may have come from a lab in Wuhan -- the central Chinese city where the disease first emerged late last year.
 
Beijing has rejected the accusation, and scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans.
 
The White House has accused Chinese authorities of mishandling the outbreak, "slow-walking" coronavirus data and putting US lives at risk.
 
The disease overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure when it hit the United States, putting immense pressure on doctors, nurses and emergency responders.
 
Some US medics relied on past experience in other countries to fight the virus.
 
David Callaway, a doctor and academic who has worked in the past on diseases in conflict-hit nations such as South Sudan and Iraq, said he found overseas epidemics easier to handle in some ways.
 
"Family and loved ones, you can put them in a box and you use them as a source of motivation and inspiration when things get rough, but you know they are safe," he told AFP.
 
"A pandemic at home, you know that your family and your loved ones are still at risk, their lives hang on the line."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Iran coronavirus deaths rise by 65 to 6,156 as contamination slows</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s death toll from new coronavirus increased by 65 over the previous 24 hours to reach 6,156 on Saturday, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV.
The total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the pandemic, has reached 96,448, up by 802 in the past 24 hours, the lowest daily increase rate in weeks, he said, adding that 2,787 were in critical condition.
A total of 77,350, or 80% of those infected, had so far recovered, he said.
Iranian health officials have been warning of a new wave of the disease if health regulations are not strictly followed.
“If people do not observe health protocols, the disease will certainly return,” said Mohammad Mehdi Gouya, director of the Health Ministry’s communicable diseases department.
Only 10% of the inhabitants of the most affected cities had been infected with coronavirus, Gouya told the semi-official ISNA news agency.
“This means that 90% have not yet been infected with the virus. Therefore, we must not think it’s over and leave home and make social visits as we please ... There is no other option but to observe proper social distancing,” he said.
Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said a decision would be made on Sunday on the reopening of schools and Shi’ite holy sites.
Iran, which has been struggling to curb the spread of the disease, is concerned that measures to limit public activities could wreck an economy which has already been battered by U.S. sanctions that were reimposed in 2018. Iranian authorities blame the sanctions for hampering their efforts to combat the disease.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Iran reports lowest virus infections since March 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Iran said Saturday there was a "clear drop" in the number of new coronavirus infections as it reported 802 fresh cases, the lowest daily count since March 10.
The new cases brought to 96,448 the number recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.
"This shows a clear drop in the number of new infections compared to recent weeks, despite our active testing," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.
He added that 77,350 of those hospitalised have since been discharged, claiming it is a "one of the highest recovery percentages in the world."
New deaths from COVID-19 rose slightly to 65 in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 6,156, Jahanpour said.
Doubts have been cast over Iran's coronavirus figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.
Iran's deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi warned that the fall in the number of infections could quickly reverse.
"I emphasise that this steady decline is fragile," said Harirchi, who has himself recovered from COVID-19.
"Carelessness in gatherings, reopening (businesses) and observing health protocols can make the country face serious problems again."
He also called on the government to increase health sector spending, which he said had been hit by fiscal pressures resulting from sweeping US sanctions and the global economic contraction sparked by the coronavirus.
Iran has tried to contain the spread of the virus by shutting schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces since March.
But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, and authorities are now mulling allowing sports, cultural and religious centres too.
Tehran authorities, who have kept public transportation running despite warnings from health experts, made it mandatory for passengers to wear masks as of Saturday.
The virus has not spared public figures, with at least 12 current or former government officials or lawmakers dead and more infected.
One of the most senior -- parliament speaker Ali Larijani -- made his first public appearance in a month on Saturday, donning a protetive mask to attend a televised meeting alongside the president and the head of the judiciary.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA grants Gilead’s remdesivir emergency authorization for COVID-19 treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Food and Drug Administration on Friday granted an emergency use authorization to Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir, a decade-old experimental therapy first tested on Ebola disease patients, as a COVID-19 treatment.
President Donald Trump announced the news just as the markets closed Friday afternoon at the White House. The authorization means that the drug can be used by hospitalized patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside of clinical trials or on a compassionate use basis.
Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day on Thursday night told investors during an earnings call that talks with the FDA about an emergency use authorization, or EUA, or other formal approval had intensified in the last 48 hours. “There’s a big sense of urgency,” he said, according to a FactSet transcript of the call. “We think the FDA will move quite quickly.”
Shares of Gilead GILD, -4.82% moved 1.9% higher in after-hours trading Friday immediately after the announcement. Year-to-date, the company’s stock has gained 23%, hitting a low of $62.23 on Jan. 21 before soaring to a $85.97 high for the year on March 19. It closed Friday at $79.95.
The antiviral drug has been widely considered a front-runner in the rush to find viable treatments for a disease that has sickened more than three million people worldwide and killed at least 220,000, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. It is the first new drug to get an EUA, a type of authorization that the FDA is using during the pandemic. The regulator in March authorized chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to be repurposed for some COVID-19 patients though both drugs have previously been approved to treat other diseases, like malaria.
Investors and clinicians have been paying close attention to the snippets of study data about the antiviral drugs, sending the company’s shares up or down depending on the day.
Though experts have had mixed responses to the clinical findings so far, it’s clear that demand is high. There are no proven treatments for infections caused by the coronavirus, making it difficult for the nation’s health-care workers to care for the patients who end up in their emergency rooms and intensive care unit beds.
There’s also an economic angle. The market has been swinging in response to remdesivir data, driven by the investor stance that a proven treatment, even more so than vaccine, would support the prospect of an economic rebound for the U.S., which is thought to be headed for a recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gilead began developing remdesivir in 2009. It was later tested as a treatment for Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), among other diseases. The company said it began providing doses of remdesivir to the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention & Prevention in January when the coronavirus outbreak there began to worsen. By February, the investigational therapy had been moved into a number of clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad, including one conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
That trial has been the one to watch, primarily because it had a placebo arm and two of the Gilead-sponsored trials do not. A preliminary data analysis released this week by the federal research agency found that the drug improved recovery times in COVID-19 patients — the median time to recover in that group of patients was 11 days — compared with 15 days in those patients taking placebo.
Though government officials including President Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the NIAID director, have talked up the results, with Fauci saying remdesivir would become the standard of care in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, other medical experts have been more measured in their responses to the clinical-trial data.
“Remdesivir is an efficacious drug beyond recovery time (but not a miracle, or extremely potent one),” Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, tweeted this week
Half a dozen clinical trials testing remdesivir in COVID-19 patients have been launched since Chinese authorities first identified the virus late last year, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. However, two clinical trials in China have since been halted, and a medical study, published Wednesday in The Lancet, found that one of them, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site trial, didn’t report “statistically significant clinical benefits” in patients taking remdesivir. One positive finding was that remedesivir patients did have faster recoveries, though researchers urged confirmation studies.
During Gilead’s Thursday earnings call, which was monopolized by remdesivir questions, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson said the company may spend up to $1 billion in 2020 developing the drug.
“Under the emergency-use authorization, one could charge for the product,” CEO O’Day told investors on the earnings call. “We made a decision, as you know, to donate 1.5 million vials, which is the entirety of our supply through the early summer.” The vials encompass 140,000 10-day treatment courses. O’Day later said during the call that donating the investigational therapy “is the right thing to do at this time.”
Analysts later stressed their concerns about the company’s lack of clarity about revenue generation for a drug brought to market under emergency powers during a global pandemic with huge public health implications.
Raymond James’ Steven Seedhouse, one of at least three analysts to downgrade Gilead stock after the earnings call, cited the drug’s minimal impact on COVID-19 patients and the company’s unclear path to profitability for the drug. “It’s not clear to us if remdesivir will be used much in COVID beyond the initial 1.5M donated doses or beyond this near-term panic phase of the public health crisis,” he wrote.
“Remdesivir has been a big sentiment boost for GILD (if not the entire market) and the company should be commended for its efforts in so quickly addressing this public health emergency, but we still feel it’s unlikely to result in tangible long-term cash flows,” J.P. Morgan analysts told investors when they downgraded the stock.
SVP Leerink’s Geoffrey Porges, however, expects that Gilead will establish a business model for remdesivir. “The allocation process is likely to be challenging, controversial and ultimately highly political,” he wrote, “and once Gilead starts charging for the product we expect calls for the exercise of march-in rights and compulsory or no-cost licensing to become louder.”
Some lawmakers, including Reps. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, and Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, have already raised questions about taxpayer investment in remdesivir. “The public deserves an accounting of what taxpayer investment enabled this hopeful COVID-19 treatment,” they wrote in an April 30 letter.
The S&P 500 SPX, -2.80% is down 9.8% since the start of the year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BBC Panorama has been allowed inside a UK coronavirus drugs trial for the first time.
The SNG-001 drug, being developed by Synairgen, prepares the body for a viral attack by stimulating the immune response in the lungs of asthma and chronic lung disease patients.
It is hoped the treatment will help coronavirus patients and prevent the most severe cases from requiring intensive care and ventilators.
Panorama has spoken to those involved in a trial at University Hospital Southampton.
Richard Marsden, the CEO of Synairgen, said: "Our drug is a special formulation of interferon beta that we deliver directly to the airways when the virus is there.
"What we've shown in our research is that older people, and people with some chronic conditions, have a poor interferon beta response when there's a virus present. Coronavirus does the same thing."
SNG-001 uses interferon beta - a protein produced by the body to tackle viruses.
Southampton University's Professor Tom Wilkinson, who is leading the trial, said: "In an ideal world we would see a significant improvement in the health of the patients receiving the drug, a reduction in those requiring intensive care and ventilation.
"But it is early days to understand that and we will know more when we have the results."
The results of the trial are expected by the end of June.
Synairgen is already talking to suppliers about producing the drug as soon as the trial has finished.
It is aiming to distribute it later this year if the tests prove it is beneficial.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">FDA approves emergency use of remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment
The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the emergency use of the antiviral remdesivir on COVID-19 patients. Gilead Sciences revealed promising study results involving remdesivir on Wednesday, and the Trump administration announced the authorization, which sidesteps the usual testing required to approve a drug's usage, during a Friday Oval Office meeting between President Trump, Health and Human Services Secretary Alexander Azar, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, and Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O'Day. In Gilead's trial, at least 50 percent of patients treated with remdesivir improved, though the study wasn't evaluated against a control group, and it's unclear if those recoveries were natural. As clinical trials continue, doctors can use remdesivir on some patients. O'Day said Gilead is working to rapidly increase its supply. [NBC News]
Fauci blocked from testifying before House committee
The White House confirmed Friday it is blocking Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has taken on a prominent role in the Trump administration's coronavirus response, from testifying before the Democrat-led House Appropriations Committee about the pandemic next week. White House spokesman Judd Deere said "it is counterproductive" to have someone like Fauci, who is heavily involved in the government's efforts to re-open the American economy and expedite a coronavirus vaccine, step away from those tasks and testify. Deere did say the White House would work with Congress to find a more "appropriate time" for Fauci to testify. Fauci, who at times has dissented from President Trump on certain coronavirus-related matters, will reportedly appear before the Republican-led Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee the following week.

Biden denies Tara Reade's sexual assault allegation
Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday addressed for the first time former staffer Tara Reade's allegation that he sexually assaulted her in 1993. "I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago," Biden said in a statement. "They aren't true. This never happened." Biden said Reade's story "has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways," and he said he is asking the National Archives to identify a record of a complaint Reade says she filed in the Senate and release it to the press "if there was ever any such complaint." Biden had been facing calls to personally address Reade's allegation after his campaign previously denied it. [The Washington Post, The New York Times]
European countries begin to ease some coronavirus restrictions
Coronavirus restrictions continued to ease Saturday in some European countries, including Spain, one of the world's hardest-hit nations. Adults were allowed outside to exercise for the first time in seven weeks, prompting runners and cyclists to hit the pavement, though social distancing guidelines remain in place. In Madrid, a field hospital set up by the military at a convention center was closed, as was a makeshift morgue established at an ice rink. Spain has more than 213,000 cases of COVID-19 with 24,543 deaths. Elsewhere, museums, zoos, and playgrounds were permitted to open for the first time in several weeks in Germany. Italy will begin loosening some restrictions Monday. [The Associated Press, BBC]
North Korean state media: Kim Jong Un makes first public appearance in 20 days
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first public appearance in 20 days on Friday, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reports, citing state media. Kim reportedly made his appearance for the completion of a fertilizer plant north of Pyongyang. Kim was out of the public eye for weeks, sparking rumors he was in ill health or even dead. CNN reported in April that the U.S. was monitoring intelligence that Kim was "in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery," though South Korean officials disputed that report, saying he was "alive and well" and likely simply mildly sick or "being isolated because of coronavirus concerns." While North Korean state media reported Kim's appearance, few details were verifiable regarding his presence or his health. [Yonhap News Agency, The Associated Press]
Newsom says California could ease restrictions in a matter of days
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered at Hunting Beach, south of Los Angeles, on Friday to protest California Gov. Newsom's (D) decision to close beaches throughout the state as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, claiming the measure was a breach of individual liberties. Many of the protesters were reportedly not wearing masks. But during his Friday press conference, Newsom said he is hopefully just "days" away from lifting some restrictions in California's stay-at-home order, which is one of the strictest in the country. The governor hinted that restaurants may soon be able to re-open for table service with some safety measures, but people will need to continue to shelter at home in the meantime before any changes come to fruition.

Canada bans all assault-style weapons
Canada on Friday banned the use and sale of all assault-style weapons, effective immediately, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced. The ban comes after a deadly shooting in Nova Scotia in April that ended with 22 people dead. The Associated Press writes the ban affects "over 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, including two weapons used by the [Nova Scotia] gunman as well as the AR-15." Trudeau said the weapons are unnecessary for hunting, and said "There is no use — and no place — for such weapons in Canada." It is "no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade, assault weapons in this country," said Trudeau, but it is not illegal to own the weapons. [The Associated Press]
Bezos called to testify on Amazon's possibly 'perjurious' statements
House Judiciary Committee members on Friday asked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to testify before Congress and clarify statements from the company they say may be "criminally false." The Wall Street Journal reported last week that although Amazon says it does not use data from third-party sellers to develop competing products, interviews with more than 20 former employees "reveal that employees did just that." Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton told Congress last year "we don't use individual seller data directly to compete" with third-party sellers. Seven lawmakers asked Bezos to testify. "If the reporting in the Wall Street Journal article is accurate, then statements Amazon made to the committee about the company's business practices appear to be misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious," the letter says.

Judge sides with U.S. Soccer in USWNT's pay discrimination case
A federal judge issued a ruling late Friday hampering the United States women's national soccer team's lawsuit which claims the U.S. Soccer Federation violated the Equal Pay Act by paying them less then the men's national team. Judge R. Gary Klausner ruled the plaintiffs were not able to demonstrate they were paid less than their male counterparts between 2015 and 2019, siding with U.S. Soccer which has said the USWNT was paid more overall during that time frame. The women said that was only because they played more games than the men, but Klausner's ruling cited as undisputed fact that the USWNT averaged more per game, as well. The judge also sided in part with U.S. Soccer in response to the plaintiffs' claim they were discriminated against by being subjected to playing on inferior surfaces. [The Wall Street Journal, ESPN]
Scrubs actor Sam Lloyd dies at 56
Sam Lloyd, the actor best known for his role as Sacred Heart's lawyer Ted Buckland on the television comedy Scrubs, died, his agent confirmed Friday. He was 56. Lloyd's agent did not provide details on the cause, but the actor was diagnosed with a brain tumor and cancer last year that had spread to his lungs and spine. Lloyd, who was also a talented musician, additionally appeared in shows like Seinfeld, Modern Family, and The West Wing. Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence and Lloyd's co-star on the show Zach Braff offered tributes to the actor on Twitter, with Braff noting Lloyd never failed to make him laugh and break character when they shared a scene.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia joins international bid to use stem cells against COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new stem cell treatment for coronavirus patients is set to be trialled by Sydney’s Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.
Executive director Professor Jason Kovacic says the institute will work on a local clinical trial of the treatment also being explored by US researchers.
Nine out of 12 patients in the US administered with stem cells were able to come off a ventilator in just 10 days, he noted.
“These stem cells were trialled extensively for patients with cardiac diseases and the beauty of them is it is an off-the-shelf therapy,”  Prof Kovacic told the Sunday Telegraph.
“The stem cells can be administered to any patient and have substantial effects on changing the course of inflammation and the immune response.”
The institute is looking to start trials with local patients in coming months.
Prof Kovacic says the treatment could help avert higher mortality among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular illness.
As part of the international effort, the Australian program will expandpromising trials already underway at New York’s Mt Sinai Hospital, in Texas and in California.
Coronavirus victims find their lungs fill with fluid and cannot supply oxygen to the body, explained University of Texas researcher Dr. Charles Cox.
“We wouldn’t anticipate seeing a substantial turn around in terms of lung function for at least 72, 96 hours.
“A good rule of thumb is you are probably not going to better quicker than you got sick.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Japan health ministry expediting remdesivir for COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The health ministry is moving to approve the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat domestic coronavirus patients.
The move on Satuday followed U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement the previous day that the Food and Drug Administration had authorized the emergency use of the drug for COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was originally developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. as an Ebola remedy but failed.
If given the go-ahead, remdesivir would become Japan's first recognized remedy for the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
To greenlight remdesivir, the health ministry will apply a special approval system that allows screening to be substantially shortened on condition that the drug in question has been approved overseas.
On Saturday afternoon, the government, at a round-robin-style Cabinet meeting, revised a related ordinance in such a way to make it possible to apply the special approval system to remdesivir.
"I heard that the company will file an application for approval in a few days," health minister Katsunobu Kato said. "I've instructed officials to be prepared to be able to grant an approval in about a week once the application is made."
Japan's approval process usually takes about a year based on domestic clinical trials. Expectations are especially high that remdesivir will help severely ill patients.
In late April, the government said remdesivir needs to be introduced for emergency use and that fast-track procedures to greenlight domestic sales were being prepared under the pharmaceuticals and medical devices law.
After receiving the application from Gilead Sciences, the health ministry will collect opinions on safety and other aspects of the drug at a meeting of its Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a Ebola treatment, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the coronavirus, copy themselves to overwhelm the host's immune system.
According to a recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, the drug was effective in nearly 70 percent of 53 coronavirus patients with severe symptoms, but caused serious side effects, including deterioration of kidney and liver functions, in a quarter of them.
The government, however, has not applied the special approval system to the flu drug Avigan, because its sales prospects overseas are unclear. Instead, the government is proceeding with clinical trials.
Avigan is widely viewed as a potential treatment for COVID-19. It was developed by Tokyo-based Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co., an affiliate of Fujifilm Holdings Corp.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. emergency approval broadens use of Gilead's COVID-19 drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 U.S. states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UAE stem cell therapy: Revolutionary treatment helps cure COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DUBAI: Adult stem cell therapy is dubbed as the new healing force of the 21st century, much as the internet revolutionised the past century.
Now, UAE researchers have demonstrated they're in the leading edge of this breakthrough in medicine. Abu Dhabi-based doctors have announced pioneering work in stem cell therapy to repair lung damage caused by coronavirus infection. One simple yet fascinating aspect of this new therapy: it's administered through inhalation.
It's a potential "wow" moment for immunotherapy and regenerative medicine — the Abu Dhabi team sucessfully treated 73 COVID-19 patients, who were cured of COVID-19 before hospital discharge.
Numerous vaccine trials are undeway for COVID-19, but a safe and effective jab that can be used on a massive scale on healthy patients is at least a year away.
Speaking at a press conference on coronavirus updates on Saturday night, Dr. Fatima Al Kaabi, Head Hematology and ncology Department at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi, explained the results of the stem cell therapy.
“At the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center, we are proud to work on developing a supportive treatment for COVID-19 patients which is undergoing clinical trials for the first time in the UAE. This is a national achievement,” Dr. Fatima Al Kaabi, who is part of the stem cell research team against COVID-19.
The announced treatment is supportive and not curative, she explained, and helps alleviate COVID-19 symptoms rather than eradicating the virus itself.
Treatment was administered on 73 confirmed positive COVID-19 patients, and was considered a success, after they were cured of the virus by inhaling the treatment into their lungs after it has been "nebulised into a fine mist".
The pioneering treatment is hypothesised to have its therapeutic effect by regenerating lung cells and modulating the immune response to keep it from overreacting to the COVID-19 infection and causing further damage to healthy cells.
COVID-19 patients in the UAE who have all been successfully treated -- and cured -- of the virus by inhaling the treatment into their lungs after it has been nebulised into a fine mist.
The treatment was developed by a team of doctors and researchers at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center (ADSCC).
A patent has been granted by the UAE Ministry of Economy for the development of an innovative and promising treatment for COVID-19 infections using stem cells.
It involves extracting stem cells from the patient’s own blood and reintroducing them after "activating" them.
The treatment has successfully undergone the initial phase of clinical trials, demonstrating its safety.
IMMUNOTHERAPY: WHAT IS IT?"THERAPY": Treatment intended to relieve or heal a disorder (from Latin therapia and Greek therapeia, meaning "curing, healing, service done to the sick).IMMUNOTHERAPY OR BIOLOGICAL THERAPY: The treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system. Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as "activation immunotherapies". immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as "suppression immunotherapies".
None of the patients who had received the treatment reported adverse effects, according to the Abu Dhabi research team.
More importantly, there have been no interactions found with the conventional treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients.
ROLE OF STEM CELLS IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINERegenerative medicine aims at repair, replacement of cells or organs to recover the impaired function. It helps the body to form new functional tissue. It includes cell therapies, tissue engineering, gene therapy and biomedical engineering techniques.So, cell therapy and tissue engineering are parts of the field of regenerative medicine, whose aim is production of safe and effective therapies. Stem cells present in almost every type of tissues and represent an endogenous system of regeneration and repair. Therefore, stem cells represent great hope for the future of translational medicine.[International Journal of Stem Cells: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4961101/]
A stem cell is a cell with the unique ability to develop into specialised cell types in the body. It's the basic building block of life.
In the future, they may be used to replace cells and tissues that have been damaged or lost due to disease.
They can become cells of the blood, heart, lungs or other body parts. Stem cells also have a strong secretory function, promoting the formation of new blood vessels, cell proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting inflammatory response, experts say.
TWO MAIN CATEGORIES OF STEM CELLSIn humans, stem cells can be subdivided into two main categories: intrinsic and extrinsic stem cells.A large variety of cell types has been used for regenerative medicine, including adult cells, resident tissue specific stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, Umbilical cord blood stem cells, embryonic stem cells and the recent breakthrough discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells from mature/adult cells (iPS) (called reprogramming, induced a pluripotent state in a previously differentiated cell type). [Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376801]
Stem cells can self-renew or multiply while maintaining the potential to develop into other types of cells.
For example, right now, your body's stem cells are working hard replacing your skin every two weeks, creating new red and white blood cells.
Yes. At least two studies had demonstrated this.
First, in 2016, a team of Egyptian experts showed that stem cells help in lung regeneration, according to a study published in the International Journal of Stem Cells.
The airway epithelium is exposed to inhaled particles and pathogens that may lead to the development of a many infectious and inflammatory respiratory diseases. The study investigated promising stem cell therapy to treat lung and tracheal tissue damage.
The second recent study we found, published on Nature Communications on February 28, 2020, shows that an inhalation treatment of secretome and exosome exhibited therapeutic potential for lung regeneration.
These were based on two experimental models of pulmonary fibrosis (lung disease in which persistent injury results in scar tissue formation — as fibrosis thickens, the lung tissue loses the ability to facilitate gas exchange and provide cells with needed oxygen).
SARS-CoV-2 is a newly-discovered pathogen that primarily attacks the lungs (and airway epithelium). This leads to the development of an infectious and inflammatory respiratory disease, called COVID-19, partly as a result of the over-reaction of the human immune system which then leads to acute pneumonia — and can be deadly. 
SECRETOME AND EXOSOMEExosome: They are cell-derived vesicles encompassing lipids, DNA, proteins coding genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). They are present in diverse body fluids. They offer novel biomarker and drug therapy potential for diverse diseases, including cancer.Secretome: The stem cell secretome produce tiny “communication vesicles” (paracrine soluble factors) that interact with surrounding (stem) cells. Healthy Mesenchymal Stem Cells do this intensively with signals that have almost exclusively “positive” effects on surrounding cells and hence change not only the local tissue environment but also the whole immune system. The properties of the secreted factors are anti-inflammatory, neuro- and angio-trophic, immune modulatory, anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective and anti-oxidatory.[Sources: https://bit.ly/2YnEBqp; https://bit.ly/2WnyfEI]
In March, Chinese researchers announced they were studying the use of stem cell technology in the treatment of people critically ill with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Xinhuanet reported then.
Four COVID-19 patients who received stem cell treatment while in a serious condition have been reportedly discharged from hospital following recovery. The Chinese researchers said they will expand the clinical trial of the therapy.
Yes. Stem cell therapy has been used in the treatment of some infectious diseases and complications. For instance, it has been tried in treating H7N9 avian flu and showed good results.
According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a new stem cell drug, CAStem, which has shown promising results in animal experiments.
The research team has applied for urgent assessment by the National Medical Products Administration. Approvals by the ethics committee, and clinical observation and evaluation are in progress.
More trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment are ongoing and are expected to be completed "in a couple of weeks".
The treatment has been given to patients along with the conventional medical intervention and will continue to be applied as an adjunct to established treatment protocols rather than as a replacement.
A UAE patent was granted for the innovative method in which the stem cells are collected, or "harvested".
The innovation represents a pay-off from numerous scientific research work being conducted in the UAE and laws enacted to attract talent from different parts of the world. It also promises to potentially turn the tide in the global effort to fight SARS-CoV-2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US allows emergency use of the drug remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US regulators said Friday that they have authorized the emergency use of the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir for treating coronavirus patients, saying that clinical trials have showed "promising results."
"While there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19, the investigational drug was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some patients," the US Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.
The move, which will enable the drug to be used for those hospitalized with severe illness caused by the new coronavirus, is a "significant step" forward in battling the pandemic, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a statement.
The company said it aims to produce at least 500,000 treatment courses by October, 1 million treatment courses by December and millions more in 2021, if required.
Remdesivir was developed by US biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences as a possible treatment for Ebola, but it has not been licensed or approved anywhere globally.
Clinical trials have been under way to confirm the effectiveness and safety of its use for coronavirus patients around the world, including Japan.
The Japanese government is looking to fast-track its approval. The drug is expected to be available in Japan as early as this month, a government official said.
Under the emergency use authorization, remdesivir will be distributed in the United States and administered intravenously by health care providers for patients with low blood oxygen levels as well as those needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator.
More than 1 million people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus, with the country's death toll exceeding 64,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
Globally, there have been more than 3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, and more than 230,000 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US emergency approval broadens use of Gilead's Covid-19 drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 on Friday, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.
During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.
The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.
Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.
With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead’s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for Covid-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.
“It’s the first authorised therapy for Covid-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.
Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.
Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead’s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 US states, have been administering the drug.
The FDA authorization applies to patients hospitalized with severe Covid-19 who require oxygen supplementation.
US Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.
Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by Covid-19. Citing the drug’s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.
There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.
The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.
The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.
A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against Covid-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.
Shares of Gilead, which have gained 26% so far this year, were up 2.7% at $82.10 in after hours trading.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US gives emergency-use authorization to Covid-19 treatment drug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US drug regulator on Friday granted emergency use authorization for doctors to prescribe remdesivir, an antiviral medicine made by American pharmaceutical major Gilead Sciences Inc, for the treatment currently of hospitalized adults and children with severe coronavirus infection.
The Food and Drug Administration, the regulator, said that though there is limited information available about the safety and effectiveness of the drug, it has been seen to shorten the recovery time in some patients.
President Donald Trump announced with the emergency use authorization with a full-court briefing at the White House Friday accompanied by top officials of his coronavirus task force and the Gilead CEO Dan O’Day.
The president called the drug the “hot thing” and “an important treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients” and a “promising situation”.

The US drug regulator has said the emergency use authorization allows for remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease, which it defined as patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator.
The emergency use authorization was a much anticipated development after the president and the top US government epidemiologist declared positive outcome earlier in the week about form the clinical trial underway.

“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist and member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task-force told reporters, prefacing the announcement as “quite good news”.
The trial, which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that Fauci leads, showed “a drug can block the virus”, Fauci added and described it as “a new standard of care” for treating Covid-19.
He had gone on to compare development to the trial 36 years ago in 1986 that led to the HIV antiviral AZT, a drug that had then shown only “modest” efficacy but became the base for better and more improved treatments over the years.
Remdesivir is not a vaccine and cannot prevent Covid-19. It can treat Covid-19 better than any other drug around now

    <h5 class="mb-1">New blood plasma Covid-19 treatment set to be trialled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A potential treatment for Covid-19 using plasma from recovered patients is to be trialled by doctors at London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital.
The first donations of the plasma have been collected and transfusions will begin in “the coming weeks”, the hospital’s Biomedical Research Centre said in a statement.
It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.
The hospital says if the trials prove the treatment to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.
“As a new disease, there are no proven drugs to treat critically ill patients with Covid-19. Providing critically ill patients with plasma from patients who have recovered… could improve their chances of recovery,” said Dr Shankar-Hari.
Health and Social Care secretary Matt Hancock said: “This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it.
“The UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.
“Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future.”
The BBC reported there was currently enough plasma to transfuse to 143 patients.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A top British hospital will use blood plasma treatment for COVID-19 patients as part of a trial that transfuses plasma from recovered people into sick people to give their immune systems a boost to fight the virus.
Since the novel coronavirus emerged in China late last year, it has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide and drug companies are racing to produce a vaccine though there is not yet any specific treatment.
London's Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said helped save his life after he fell gravely ill with COVID-19, is to test the so called "convalescent plasma" treatment as part of an international trial.
Blood plasma donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19 is transfused into sick patients whose bodies are not producing enough of their own antibodies against the virus.
"At the moment, there is no proven treatment for COVID-19," said Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’.
"Convalescent plasma is a promising treatment that could help patients whose bodies aren’t producing enough antibodies to curb the disease," he said. "This trial will help us understand whether the treatment should be used more widely to treat COVID-19."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: A top British hospital will use blood plasma treatment for Covid-19 patients as part of a trial that transfuses plasma from recovered people into sick people to give their immune systems a boost to fight the virus.
Since the novel coronavirus emerged in China late last year, it has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide and drug companies are racing to produce a vaccine though there is not yet any specific treatment.
London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said helped save his life after he fell gravely ill with Covid-19, is to test the so-called “convalescent plasma” treatment as part of an international trial.
Blood plasma donations from people who have recovered from Covid-19 is transfused into sick patients whose bodies are not producing enough of their own antibodies against the virus.
“At the moment, there is no proven treatment for Covid-19,” said Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’.
“Convalescent plasma is a promising treatment that could help patients whose bodies aren’t producing enough antibodies to curb the disease,” he said. “This trial will help us understand whether the treatment should be used more widely to treat Covid-19.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nearly half of doctors forced to find their own protective equipment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost half of doctors had to source their own personal protective equipment or relied on donations during the pandemic, according to a survey.
The British Medical Association said, while PPE supplies have improved, their data from more than 16,000 doctors shows there is room for improvement in protecting healthcare workers on the frontline.
The organisation said its latest survey is the biggest one of frontline NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.
It said almost a third (30%) of doctors in England who were questioned said they had not reported or spoken out about issues relating to PPE, staff shortages, testing or drug shortages because they did not think anything would be done about it if they did.
When asked how safely protected from coronavirus they felt at work, just under two thirds (65%) said they felt only partly or not at all protected.
Overall, 48% of doctors reported having bought PPE directly for themselves or their department, or had a donation from a charity or local firm.

The problem appeared to be higher among GPs, with 55% of them saying they had to do so, compared to 38% of hospital doctors.
More than a quarter (28%) of doctors said they were suffering depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, emotional distress or other mental health conditions related to or made worse by work during this time.
BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the survey response on PPE is ‘a damning indictment of the Government’s abject failure to make sure healthcare workers across the country are being supplied with the life-saving kit they should be’.
He said: ‘The survey shows that overall, there has been an improvement in the provision of PPE, but if almost half of all doctors report that they had to resort to purchasing PPE themselves or rely on donations, then there is still a lot for the Government to do to protect its frontline.’
Doctors responding to the survey were also given space to leave a comment.
One said the situation with PPE had been ‘an outrage for all staff’, another admitted to feeling ‘very unprotected’, and another said they were ‘coping’ but added ‘it’s a worrying time on the frontline, no NHS eye protection and only flimsy aprons and cheap surgical masks’.
Dr Nagpaul said: ‘The Government has five tests it has said must be met to ease lockdown, the first of which is ‘making sure the NHS can cope’.
‘Six weeks into this crisis, how can the Government be confident that this condition is anywhere near being met, or that the pandemic is under control, when the very people on the frontline are not being made safe?’
Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Thursday Boris Johnson acknowledged the difficulties in getting sufficient PPE, but he said those responsible for tackling the problems were ‘throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day, to get it right’.
The BMA said 16,343 doctors in England responded to the survey between April 28 and 30.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Social distancing to remain until coronavirus vaccine developed, says Gove</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It comes as the number of tests carried out in the last 24 hours fell to 76,496.
Some social distancing measures will remain in place until a coronavirus vaccine has been developed but ministers will seek to restore people’s lives to “as close to normal as possible”, Michael Gove has said.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster warned that people would have to live with “some degree of constraint” until they can be immunised against the deadly disease – suggesting Britons would have to accept a “new normal”.
A total of 28,446 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday.
Mr Gove revealed that the number of daily coronavirus tests in the last 24 hours had fallen to 76,496 – below the Government’s 100,000 daily testing target – which was blamed on lower uptake over the weekend.
The Cabinet minister told the daily Downing Street press conference: “Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine then I suspect that we are going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.
“But we obviously want to, wherever possible, and consistent with the measures on public health, restore people’s lives to as close to normal as possible.”
He said the Government will pursue a “phased approach” to removing lockdown restrictions rather than a sudden return to “the old normal” – and that the easing had to be done in a “cautious fashion”.
NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said it was “really difficult” to know how the virus would play out in the months and years ahead.
He said there was “hope” that a solution – either a vaccine or drugs – would be found sooner than might have been hoped 10 or 20 years ago, though it is “impossible to say when that will be”.
“But it’s certainly true to say that we will need to adapt to a new normal until we get to that point.”
Human trials of a vaccine developed by Oxford University began last month, with scientists aiming to have a million doses ready by September if efficacy tests go well.
Mr Gove said Boris Johnson would set out on Thursday how the country can get back to work, get the economy moving, return children to school and travel to work more safely.
“We’re consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the Prime Minister will be saying more later this week,” he explained.
Earlier on Sunday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned life would not return to “business as usual” when the Prime Minister sets out his exit strategy.
And he admitted that fewer Britons would have died from coronavirus if more tests had been available earlier.
Mr Shapps said “many things” could have been different if the UK’s testing capacity was above 100,000 before Covid-19 spread in the country.
He also confirmed the NHSX contact tracing app – which he said would need 50%-60% of people to use for it to be successful – will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out later this month.
Meanwhile:
– A former Government chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, has assembled a group of experts to look at how the UK could work its way out of the lockdown in response to concerns over the “lack of transparency” coming from the Sage group of advisers.
– Conservative peer and former minister Baroness Ros Altmann said a requirement for older people to remain in lockdown longer as restrictions are lifted for the rest of the country would be “age discrimination”.
– Prof Powis said Government advisers now believe the R value – the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to, on average – to be “around 0.7”.
– Former head of the army General Lord Dannatt and ex-chief of the defence staff General Lord Richards backed calls for health workers to be given daily allowances like those given to soldiers in war zones.
– Professor Sir Ian Diamond, UK national statistician, cautioned against international comparisons of death figures and warned that a “lengthy and deep recession” could lead to increased deaths.
In an interview with BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Shapps was asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner.
He replied: “Yes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively, I’m sure many things could be different.
“The fact of the matter is this is not a country that had – although we’re very big in pharmaceuticals as a country – we’re not a country that had very large test capacity.”
He also revealed that he was “actively looking at” quarantining people travelling to Britain from abroad to keep coronavirus infection rates under control.
It comes as Mr Johnson revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he battled coronavirus in hospital last month.
The Prime Minister spent three nights in intensive care at St Thomas’ in London with the disease, where he said medics gave him “litres and litres of oxygen”.
He described it as a “tough old moment”, telling the Sun On Sunday: “They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario.
“I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place.
“The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
European leaders aim to raise more than £6bn to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an international alliance combating the disease, which they said had “caused devastation and pain in all corners of the world”.
A senior British government medical adviser said officials “don’t have enough information yet” to know whether people can catch coronavirus more than once, a day after the UK’s testing coordinator said it was encouraging that evidence from South Korea suggested people were developing immunity.
Those entering France after the end of lockdown on 11 May could be subjected to a minimum of a fortnight in quarantine as part of a new proposed law which would extend the state of “health emergency” for weeks further.
About 43 Rohingya have landed on the coast of Bangladesh after weeks at sea due to coronavirus restrictions, with some reportedly sent to Bhasan Char, a remote island. Hundreds are believed to remain stranded on at least two trawlers between the south Asian country and Malaysia after attempting to flee.
In what marked a deepening of state support for the embattled aviation sector, Germany, Italy and Spain joined a call by 12 EU governments for the bloc’s executive body to suspend rules forcing airlines to offer full cash refunds for cancelled flights.
Fears of an outbreak are growing in the war-ravaged Gulf country after two new cases were confirmed in Aden and one in Taiz province, which is now set to seal its borders. This raises the number of diagnosed infections in the country to 10, following two deaths this week.
Families in a city just outside Mexico’s capital demanded news about their relatives who have coronavirus, and urged for the return of the bodies of the dead, after videos showed corpses inside the Las Americas general hospital in Ecatepec, which is among the Mexican municipalities worst-affected by the the virus.
The conspiracy theorist and former footballer, 68, had his account closed for violating the video-sharing site’s policies on sharing information about coronavirus after making controversial unproven claims, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nigeria Infectious Disease Bill Seen Risking Abuse in Crackdowns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sign up to our Next Africa newsletter and follow Bloomberg Africa on Twitter
Nigeria’s parliament is debating a law on preventing the spread of infectious diseases that critics fear could be open to abuses by officials.
If signed into law, the health minister will have the right to convert any building into an isolation area, while the police would be able to arrest any individual suffering from an infectious disease without a warrant. Africa’s most populous country was the first in sub-Saharan Africa to confirm a case of coronavirus in February, and has now more than 2,000 positive tests.
“A new law is needed but the powers are too sweeping,” Clement Nwankwo, director of the Abuja-based Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre, said. “There’s a lot of powers in the bill which could be used for political purposes.”
If the House of Representatives, the country’s lower chamber, votes for the bill next week, it will be sent to the Senate.
Chikwe Ihekweazu, the director general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, has said he hasn’t been involved in drafting the legislation and it requires further consultation. The bill would also give him the power to close down premises deemed to be too overcrowded in a country where millions live in cramped conditions, and those authorized by him to detain individuals without a warrant.
“I’m personally not in favor of drafting a bill in the middle of a crisis,” Ihekweazu said.

Officials with a court order would be able to destroy any building where an infectious disease -- including cholera, typhoid and dengue fever -- has occurred.
Other countries that have introduced emergency public health legislation have “in-built institutions for checks and balances,” said Orji Uka, a Lagos-based lawyer and legal analyst. “I cannot feel confident that I trust the Nigerian judiciary to stand up to the application of such a law by the government.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">People in the UK may have to cut down their social groups by 90% to stop coronavirus from spreading, scientists warn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The UK's social distancing measures may need to be in place for years, according to two new studies from scientists.
Social contact in the UK may need to be dramatically reduced on a long-term basis, according to scientists who warned that the UK's scope for lifting the lockdown is extremely limited until the discovery of a vaccine.
Two new studies found that Boris Johnson's government risks pushing the rate of transmission too high if social interaction is not severely limited for the foreseeable future.
The studies, published by British academics, explored what would happen to the so-called R rate if the current social distancing measures, which the government introduced in March, were lifted.
The R rate tracks how many people are infected, on average, for every one person who has the disease and keeping it below one is key to preventing a second peak of infections later this summer, scientists say.
A new study by scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and reported by the Telegraph newspaper, found that even in an "optimistic" scenario, social contact would have to be limited to around 5 to 10 people outside the home, workplace, and school.
A second study reported by scientists at the University of Dundee concluded that people resuming more than 10% of their previous social activity would risk a second peak of the virus, the Telegraph reported.
"Lockdown… can barely contain the disease's spread," the authors of the University of Dundee's study wrote.
"Our data is more consistent with a need to adopting a 'new normal' that can provide the optimal balance between allowing economic activity while ensuring very substantial reductions in prior social contacts - 90 per cent reductions according to our best estimates."
It came as Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, warned on Sunday that Britain would not return to "business as usual this month.
He told Sky News: "I don't think we should expect us to go from this situation that we have at the moment of social distancing back to where we were in February - that's clearly not going to happen and I don't think anyone imagines that for one moment.
"The most important thing is that the absolute focus of what the Prime Minister will be announcing later in the week is that what we do going forward doesn't undo the brilliant work people have been doing to get that R number below 1 - the all-critical reproduction rate doesn't come back up because that's when we'd see a second spike.
"So no I'm afraid it is definitely not going to be business as usual but we do want to make sure that people understand where the route map lies."
Shapps confirmed that the government would be piloting a contact-tracing smartphone app this month, which is designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.
The app will alert people if they have potentially interacted with people infected with the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gilead has yet to set a price for the coronavirus treatment remdesivir, but an influential drug pricing watchdog says it could be worth up to $4,500 per patient</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the big biotech Gilead Sciences has yet to outline its sales plan for the first effective coronavirus treatment, an influential drug pricing group has calculated the drug is worth up to $4,500 per patient.
The experimental antiviral called remdesivir was authorized for emergency use in the US on Friday, after a trial showed patients on the drug recovered 31% faster than those on a placebo. That translates to shaving four days off the typical hospital stay among these patients. It is the first drug to show a clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients in a high-quality randomized study.
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is a Boston-based nonprofit that analyzes drug pricing. The pharma industry regularly clashes with ICER, criticizing its models for being too rigid. The group often finds drugs to be overpriced compared to their value in the healthcare system. 
But in the case of remdesivir, ICER said Friday a price of up to $4,500 per treatment course is justified for remdesivir. The organization cautioned its findings are based on preliminary data that may change over time. 
ICER's analysis is focused on list prices for drug, which do not take into account rebates or discounts offered by drug companies.
"We are releasing these estimates now, despite the fact that the evidence is highly uncertain and evolving, because now is the time when the public and policymakers should be actively debating how to link pricing to an overall platform to develop treatments for COVID-19," said Steven Pearson, ICER's president, in a statement. "The consequential discussion about the tradeoffs and priorities involved with different pricing approaches cannot wait."
But the California biotech has called it too early to set a long-term pricing strategy. So far, the company pledged to donate its current supply of remdesivir, which amounts to 140,000 treatment courses. The pricing question has become a top uncertainty among many investors and Wall Street analysts. 
"The fact that ICER is typically conservative in all their analyses, and yet they can justify up to $4,500, seems pretty interesting," Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee wrote in a Sunday note to investors.

Using a placeholder of a $1,000 price, Yee estimated Gilead could make $1 billion on remdesivir by the end of 2020 if it sells 1 million treatment courses in the US and internationally. A $1,000 pricetag is "pretty reasonable" in the context of modern drug pricing, the analyst said.
Gilead has pledged it will donate its current supply of remdesivir, which amounts to about 140,000 treatment courses. CEO Daniel O'Day said Sunday the drug should start reaching patients within the next few days. 
Remdesivir is given as a 10-day IV infusion and has only been tested in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company is also researching ways to administer the drug subcutaneously or through inhalation but has not provided any timetables on those efforts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gilead has yet to set a price for the coronavirus treatment remdesivir, but an influential drug pricing watchdog says it could be worth up to $4,500 per patient</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While the big biotech Gilead Sciences has yet to outline its sales plan for the first effective coronavirus treatment, an influential drug pricing group has calculated the drug is worth up to $4,500 per patient.
The experimental antiviral called remdesivir was authorized for emergency use in the US on Friday, after a trial showed patients on the drug recovered 31% faster than those on a placebo. That translates to shaving four days off the typical hospital stay among these patients. It is the first drug to show a clinical benefit for COVID-19 patients in a high-quality randomized study.
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is a Boston-based nonprofit that analyzes drug pricing. The pharma industry regularly clashes with ICER, criticizing its models for being too rigid. The group often finds drugs to be overpriced compared to their value in the healthcare system.
But in the case of remdesivir, ICER said Friday a price of up to $4,500 per treatment course is justified for remdesivir. The organization cautioned its findings are based on preliminary data that may change over time.
ICER’s analysis is focused on list prices for drug, which do not take into account rebates or discounts offered by drug companies.
“We are releasing these estimates now, despite the fact that the evidence is highly uncertain and evolving, because now is the time when the public and policymakers should be actively debating how to link pricing to an overall platform to develop treatments for COVID-19,” said Steven Pearson, ICER’s president, in a statement. “The consequential discussion about the tradeoffs and priorities involved with different pricing approaches cannot wait.”
But the California biotech has called it too early to set a long-term pricing strategy. So far, the company pledged to donate its current supply of remdesivir, which amounts to 140,000 treatment courses. The pricing question has become a top uncertainty among many investors and Wall Street analysts.
“The fact that ICER is typically conservative in all their analyses, and yet they can justify up to $4,500, seems pretty interesting,” Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee wrote in a Sunday note to investors.

Using a placeholder of a $1,000 price, Yee estimated Gilead could make $1 billion on remdesivir by the end of 2020 if it sells 1 million treatment courses in the US and internationally. A $1,000 pricetag is “pretty reasonable” in the context of modern drug pricing, the analyst said.
Gilead has pledged it will donate its current supply of remdesivir, which amounts to about 140,000 treatment courses. CEO Daniel O’Day said Sunday the drug should start reaching patients within the next few days.
Remdesivir is given as a 10-day IV infusion and has only been tested in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company is also researching ways to administer the drug subcutaneously or through inhalation but has not provided any timetables on those efforts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Japan aims to fast-track review of anti-viral drug remdesivir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TOKYO: Japan will fast-track a review of Gilead Sciences Inc's antiviral drug remdesivir so that it can hopefully be approved for domestic COVID-19 patients a week after the US firm's filing for such approval, the health minister said on Saturday (May 2).
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato's comment comes after remdesivir was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 on Friday.
"I've heard that Gilead Sciences will file for approval (in Japan) within days," Kato told reporters. "I issued an instruction so that we will be ready to approve it within a week or so."
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he was leaning towards extending Japan's state of emergency, due to expire on May 6, for a month as experts said coronavirus restrictions should remain in place until the number of cases falls further.
Japan has confirmed nearly 15,000 cases and 517 deaths from COVID-19, according to an NHK tally.
Tokyo, the capital, saw a decline in daily reported cases since hitting a peak of 201 on Apr 17, with further falls into double digits this week, but the numbers jumped back far above 100 on Friday and Saturday.
The Nikkei business daily has said although Gilead planned to distribute enough doses to cover 140,000 patients worldwide, Japan would not receive enough for all its patients in need.
No one was immediately available for comment at Gilead's Japanese unit.
Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host's immune system.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Lauren Nichols felt a dry, burning sensation in her throat, her first instinct was to laugh it off.
"I joked at the start that I was a baby dragon in the making and I was going to be on 'Games of Thrones,'" she said. 
A few hours later, she developed diarrhea. The next day, she had a low-grade fever, accompanied by body aches and pounding headaches. A week and a half later, Nichols started feeling short of breath. Just climbing a step ladder made her winded. 
"I usually walk about 5 to 6 miles a day and I'm very active, very healthy," she said. "That was sort of my wake up call that this isn't normal. There's something going on."
Nichols, who is 32 years old, got tested for the coronavirus on March 17 in Boston, Massachusetts, where she lives. Her test was positive, but her symptoms still haven't gone away: Friday was day 51 of her illness.
Nichols is still recovering at home. Not a day has passed in which she didn't have diarrhea. Her appetite has disappeared, she sweats and shivers through the night, and there's a rattling in her chest. Her second coronavirus test came back positive again on April 20.
She is one of a growing number of young coronavirus patients with mild or moderate cases who have reported being sick for more than a month.
Three other patients under 40 gave Business Insider similar accounts of their illnesses. That contradicts guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has suggested that mild coronavirus symptoms typically last for 14 days. For severe or critical patients, the World Health Organization reports, recovery can last up to six weeks. 
But the limited nature of data about patients in recovery so far means we don't have much information about how long symptoms typically last. In scientific studies, patients who are considered "recovered" are usually those who have been discharged from the hospital. Since mild cases are encouraged to stay home, they're less likely to be reflected in that research. 
"We're definitely seeing people whose symptoms last longer than two weeks," Dr. Nate Favini, the medical lead at Forward, a primary-care practice that's collecting data on coronavirus patients around the country, told Business Insider. Favini treats coronavirus patients in San Francisco.
He said the CDC has been "very slow to update their guidance on symptoms."
"It's hard to say what percent of people have symptoms that last beyond two weeks, but we're definitely observing that as a not-uncommon phenomenon," he said. "The virus causes all kinds of inflammation and dysregulation in your body and it can take even longer, after you've cleared the virus, for all of those things to go back to normal."
Nichols said her symptoms reached their peak intensity about a week into her illness. 
"I had moments of absolute terror," she said. "I was waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air. I had to prop my head up on four pillows just to get myself to be able to breathe."
She debated going to the emergency room, but said the idea wracked her with guilt.
"It was this internal struggle of, 'I feel like I need to go to the hospital, but I don't want to take a hospital bed because I can still breathe, but I also don't want to die at home,'" she said.
Throughout her illness, Nichols has been working from home, managing an international program for the Department of Transportation. 
She tries to maintain a cheery disposition when on the phone, but her days are often interrupted by the need to sit on the toilet for several hours. Friends and family have a hard time believing she's still sick, she said. 
"People just don't understand when they're not a patient how long symptoms can last," she said. "Everyone, my coworkers included, are trying to rush the recovery when I don't need that pressure."
Caroline, a 27-year-old resident of Houston, Texas, has had symptoms for 48 days, and told Business Insider she's also trying to work through the discomfort. (Her last name has been omitted to protect her privacy.) Caroline said she still suffers from fatigue and feels an urge to sleep 18 hours a day. But her work as a corporate attorney makes that impossible.
"I'm just chugging energy drinks to try and stay awake, which is absolutely not what I should not be doing," she said. "It's just kind of awkward to have to tell work, 'Hey, I know I got sick five weeks ago, but I'm still feeling bad.'"
Caroline's symptoms started March 15, when she got a fever after attending a bachelorette party in Charleston, South Carolina. The attendees included four women from Manhattan, which has become an epicenter of the US's coronavirus epidemic. During the celebratory weekend, the bride-to-be learned that her grandmother had died of COVID-19. 
Caroline tested positive for the virus eight days after returning home. She had a cough, felt short of breath, and lost her sense of smell. 
Caroline said she recently told a partner at her firm that she might be slow to respond to email because of her illness. He suggested she might just be run-down from a couple years of working long hours. 
"People don't really believe me," she said. 
For many coronavirus patients — both those with long-lasting and shorter-lived cases — the severity of symptoms can vary from day to day. 
"Some days I'll have a spell where I kind of feel fine and then I literally won't be able to come out of the room for two days," Caroline said. 
Kelsey Meeks, a 36-year-old attorney who lives outside New Orleans, Louisiana, said that during her worst bout of symptoms, things seemed to change minute by minute.
"Every day I would be like, 'I can breathe right now, but in five minutes am I going to be okay?'" she told Business Insider. "It was really scary — just that anticipation of not knowing which way the coin was going to flip."
Meeks has felt sick since March 30. Friday marked day 32 of her illness. Her main symptoms now include body aches, headaches, and nasal congestion. She previously lost her sense of taste and smell for about two weeks, and also experienced a pressure in her chest, as if "wearing a dress that is too tight." She had dreams that she was underwater, then woke up gasping for air. 
"I haven't had a day where I woke up and I thought, 'Oh, I'm over this,'" she told Business Insider. "I can have a better day and then the next day I can't walk and talk at the same time."
Meeks said five of her family members tested positive for COVID-19, but on the whole their symptoms have been milder and resolved quickly. 
"It was hard to understand why I wasn't getting better as fast as they did," she said. "There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason."
Meeks, too, is still trying to work from home.
"Once or twice a day, I'll hit what I call a fatigue wall, which is where I can't do anything. I have to go to sleep immediately," she said. "It's like the tired where you just don't care about anything else."
She's concerned about her job performance. 
"I do struggle with the guilt about it and feeling like a failure," she said. "I'm getting to the point where my brain's functioning enough that I'm realizing, wow, I really have lost a lot of time over the last three-and-a-half weeks."
Favini said it's too early to predict how long symptoms will last for typical patients.
Among patients who've suffered from severe coronavirus complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or strokes, the virus could produce lasting organ damage. The coronavirus can also result in blood clots in the lungs that don't show up on a regular CT scan. Favini said that could cause ongoing shortness of breath.
Lately, he added, he has seen coronavirus patients with persistent coughs and diarrhea.
"There's also people who describe not feeling right for a long time — just feeling 'off' in some way," he said.
Symptoms beyond two weeks could be the result of an ongoing viral infection, Favini added, but they may also be caused by secondary effects of the virus, like persistent inflammation. That may explain why a person can still show symptoms after testing negative.
That's what happened to Dio Cruz, who tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31. He'd been caring for his mother, who developed symptoms a week and a half earlier, at his home in Colorado Springs.
"I had this eye pain that was in both eyes, but it was more pronounced in my right eye," Cruz said. "It was so bad that I would typically have to shut down around noon, go upstairs, hide in one of my rooms and just turn off all the lights and sit there in the dark."
Cruz has congestive heart failure, so he's normally short of breath, but he also developed diarrhea, loss of taste and smell, and a fever that lasted one night. Before getting sick, Cruz had been waiting for a heart transplant. To get back on the list, he had to prove that he no longer had an active infection. His second test came back negative on April 15. But four days after that, he started having eye pain and diarrhea again. 
"If you haven't gone through it yourself, you might find it hard to believe," Meeks said. "How are you OK this day, but the next day you can't complete a sentence without having to gasp for air? Why are your lungs burning, but your X-rays are clear? In normal times you would think, 'Is this person a hypochondriac?'"
All four patients told Business Insider that they'd expected their symptoms to last for 14 days. 
"The way that I understood this and the way that it was sold — I think a lot of people misinterpreted — but it was like, 'Oh, this is two weeks and you're done. And if you've made it to day number eight or nine and you are not hospitalized,  you're probably out of the woods.' And that's bullshit," Cruz said. 
Nichols said even doctors and nurses have been confused by her lingering symptoms.
"It was a very lonely experience for me," she said. "I felt kind of ignored by medical professionals because I think everyone had assumed you reach 14 days, then you're fine, you're recovered." 
Cruz said he doesn't consider himself recovered.
"How can I be recovered when I'm still having some symptoms?" he said, adding, "There's no closure. I've kind of made peace with that." 
Favini said there are two milestones for patients — clearing the virus and getting rid of symptoms — but both lack a concrete timeline. 
"Recovery really has to depend on a person feeling back to normal," he said. "For some of these folks with strokes, that damage is permanent and they may not have full recovery."
Cruz and the other patients worry that the virus has done lasting damage to their health. Meeks isn't sure whether she'll ever fully regain her sense of taste and smell. Nichols is worried about permanent lung injury. They're all trying to temper expectations to mitigate frustration and disappointment in the absence of concrete medical guidance.
"It's just hard to plan your life at all when you are still feeling under the weather and you just don't know how long that's going to last," Caroline said. "I'm not trying to get my hopes up that this will be over at any point."
All four patients said they hope the public comes to better understand that cases can last for a while.
"I have never been sick this long in my life," Meeks said. "The whole world is going to have to be patient with those of us who've had this while we navigate what is still happening inside our bodies."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: ‘False Dawn’ recovery haunts virus survivors who fall sick again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It had been over a month since Mirabai Nicholson-McKellar was infected with the coronavirus, and the 35-year-old filmmaker thought she was on her way to recovery. Then the shortness of breath came back, followed by chest pains.
A visit to the emergency room and a second test for Covid-19 gave another positive result. Just three days earlier, she’d been cleared by health authorities in Australia’s New South Wales state, and was allowed to end her home quarantine after going 72 hours without symptoms.
“When is this going to end? I think about that constantly,” she said of the twists and turns in her health. “Am I still contagious? How do I know if I’m not contagious?”
Her experience adds to a growing number of reports of patients appearing to have a reactivation of symptoms, testing positive again, or even potentially being reinfected. Such incidents don’t align with the generally accepted understanding of how virus infections work and spread.
False Dawn
This so-called false-dawn phenomenon is puzzling health experts as they try to come to grips with the mysterious pathogen that emerged only five months ago. Solving the puzzle will inform a broad range of challenges, from the development of an effective vaccine to how soon governments may be able to safely end lockdowns and allow normal life to resume.
More immediately, the situation is taking a personal toll, making the journey of recovery a complex and frustrating ordeal for some of the more than 1 million survivors of the pandemic.
So far, there hasn’t been enough research to conclude why symptoms seem to re-emerge in some people, and whether they experience reinfection or if the virus persists for weeks. One possibility is that Covid-19 causes blood clots that may cause potentially dangerous complications unless treated with anticoagulant medications, said Edwin J.R. van Beek, chair of clinical radiology at the University of Edinburgh’s Queens Medical Research Institute.
Dead Virus
South Korean researchers also offered some clues this week when they reported that so-called nucleic acid tests might be positive based on the detection of dead viral particles that could give the false impression that a patient is still infectious when they’re not.
“Everyone’s trying to figure this out,” said Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious diseases professor at Stanford Medical School. “What happens when people have been sick and infected -- are we going to consider them immune and, therefore, not susceptible at all? Or are they immune and serve as potential points of infection for other people?”
Officials in countries that managed to suppress an initial wave of the pandemic are dreading the possibility that the virus may have a seasonal pattern and could return in the fall and repeat the nightmare scenario.
Strained Hospitals
Hospitals already strained beyond their limits could see further demand if patients return. It also poses long-term implications for social safety nets and insurers as some struggle with the lingering effects of the coronavirus on their day-to-day life and health. Severe cases that require ventilators and ICU stays would need continued follow-up care as they recover from the ordeal, further pressuring health-care systems.
There can also be a growing psychological cost. Governments may try to isolate survivors for longer in fear that they are still infectious, adding more anxiety to patients already suffering from the uncertainty of when they will be deemed healthy again.
“A lot of patients will suffer mental health issues,” said Michelle Biehl, a critical-care pulmonary doctor at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. “They’ll have anxiety, depression, PTSD.”
As the number of recovered patients expand, the burden will begin to shift down the medical practice chain, Biehl said. More primary care doctors, mental health specialists and physical therapists will be seeing survivors.
“You send them home and what happens then?” asked Maldonado. “From the outpatient side, we’re just starting to get to that point where we’re seeing people in the longer term.”
Herd Immunity
There’s consensus that so-called herd immunity is key to ending the pandemic, but with a vaccine unlikely to be widely available this year, it will depend on factors such as how long people who’ve recovered have immunity and what percentage of people must be immune to protect the “herd.”
Catching Covid-19 May Not Protect You Against New Infection
There’s “a lot of unknowns and uncertainty in the development of individual immunity,” said Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious diseases at Japan’s Kobe University. “Development of antibody inside the body is not necessarily development of immunity against this disease.”
The unknowns concerning infectiousness, immunity and lingering symptoms create frustrating dilemmas for patients like Daniela Alves. The London resident paid 200 pounds ($251) for a private test that told her she was positive. Like Nicholson-McKellar, she was never hospitalized but had coughs, shortness of breath and aches that came and went for weeks, never in a straight path toward recuperating, leaving her uncertain of the state of her health.
“I don’t know when I’m going to be negative so I can go outside,” she said. “Do I have to pay another 200 pounds so I know I’m safe to others?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">For a growing number of COVID-19 patients, symptoms last more than a month. Four young patients who've been sick 30-plus days say they're 'terrified.', Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Lauren Nichols felt a dry, burning sensation in her throat, her first instinct was to laugh it off.
“I joked at the start that I was a baby dragon in the making and I was going to be on ‘Games of Thrones,'” she said.
A few hours later, she developed diarrhea. The next day, she had a low-grade fever, accompanied by body aches and pounding headaches. A week and a half later, Nichols started feeling short of breath. Just climbing a step ladder made her winded.
“I usually walk about 5 to 6 miles a day and I’m very active, very healthy,” she said. “That was sort of my wake up call that this isn’t normal. There’s something going on.”
Nichols, who is 32 years old, got tested for the coronavirus on March 17 in Boston, Massachusetts, where she lives. Her test was positive, but her symptoms still haven’t gone away: Friday was day 51 of her illness.
Nichols is still recovering at home. Not a day has passed in which she didn’t have diarrhea. Her appetite has disappeared, she sweats and shivers through the night, and there’s a rattling in her chest. Her second coronavirus test came back positive again on April 20.

“I had this eye pain that was in both eyes, but it was more pronounced in my right eye,” Cruz said. “It was so bad that I would typically have to shut down around noon, go upstairs, hide in one of my rooms and just turn off all the lights and sit there in the dark.”
Cruz has congestive heart failure, so he’s normally short of breath, but he also developed diarrhea, loss of taste and smell, and a fever that lasted one night. Before getting sick, Cruz had been waiting for a heart transplant. To get back on the list, he had to prove that he no longer had an active infection. His second test came back negative on April 15. But four days after that, he started having eye pain and diarrhea again.
“If you haven’t gone through it yourself, you might find it hard to believe,” Meeks said. “How are you OK this day, but the next day you can’t complete a sentence without having to gasp for air? Why are your lungs burning, but your X-rays are clear? In normal times you would think, ‘Is this person a hypochondriac?'”
All four patients told Business Insider that they’d expected their symptoms to last for 14 days.
“The way that I understood this and the way that it was sold – I think a lot of people misinterpreted – but it was like, ‘Oh, this is two weeks and you’re done. And if you’ve made it to day number eight or nine and you are not hospitalized, you’re probably out of the woods.’ And that’s bullshit,” Cruz said.
Nichols said even doctors and nurses have been confused by her lingering symptoms.
“It was a very lonely experience for me,” she said. “I felt kind of ignored by medical professionals because I think everyone had assumed you reach 14 days, then you’re fine, you’re recovered.”
Cruz said he doesn’t consider himself recovered.
“How can I be recovered when I’m still having some symptoms?” he said, adding, “There’s no closure. I’ve kind of made peace with that.”
Favini said there are two milestones for patients – clearing the virus and getting rid of symptoms – but both lack a concrete timeline.
“Recovery really has to depend on a person feeling back to normal,” he said. “For some of these folks with strokes, that damage is permanent and they may not have full recovery.”
Cruz and the other patients worry that the virus has done lasting damage to their health. Meeks isn’t sure whether she’ll ever fully regain her sense of taste and smell. Nichols is worried about permanent lung injury. They’re all trying to temper expectations to mitigate frustration and disappointment in the absence of concrete medical guidance.
“It’s just hard to plan your life at all when you are still feeling under the weather and you just don’t know how long that’s going to last,” Caroline said. “I’m not trying to get my hopes up that this will be over at any point.”
All four patients said they hope the public comes to better understand that cases can last for a while.
“I have never been sick this long in my life,” Meeks said. “The whole world is going to have to be patient with those of us who’ve had this while we navigate what is still happening inside our bodies.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madonna says she has coronavirus antibodies, and will ‘breathe in the COVID-19 air’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Singer Madonna says she plans to “breathe in the COVID-19 air” after testing positive for antibodies.
The 61year-old took to Instagram on Thursday to post a video that she called Quarantine Diaries No. 14, reports people.com.
“I took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies,” Madonna said in the clip, in which she uses a typewriter.
She added that she plans to spend some time out of her house.
“So tomorrow I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car, I’m going to roll down the window and I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining,” she said in the video.
She concluded by saying: “Here’s the good news: tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”
Madonna also shared a few photos on her Instagram Story, with “#staysafe” and “#staysane” written on them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">For a growing number of COVID-19 patients, symptoms last more than a month. Four young patients who’ve been sick 30-plus days say they’re ‘terrified.’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Lauren Nichols felt a dry, burning sensation in her throat, her first instinct was to laugh it off.
“I joked at the start that I was a baby dragon in the making and I was going to be on ‘Games of Thrones,'” she said.
A few hours later, she developed diarrhea. The next day, she had a low-grade fever, accompanied by body aches and pounding headaches. A week and a half later, Nichols started feeling short of breath. Just climbing a step ladder made her winded.
“I usually walk about 5 to 6 miles a day and I’m very active, very healthy,” she said. “That was sort of my wake up call that this isn’t normal. There’s something going on.”
Nichols, who is 32 years old, got tested for the coronavirus on March 17 in Boston, Massachusetts, where she lives. Her test was positive, but her symptoms still haven’t gone away: Friday was day 51 of her illness.
Nichols is still recovering at home. Not a day has passed in which she didn’t have diarrhea. Her appetite has disappeared, she sweats and shivers through the night, and there’s a rattling in her chest. Her second coronavirus test came back positive again on April 20.
She is one of a growing number of young coronavirus patients with mild or moderate cases who have reported being sick for more than a month.
Three other patients under 40 gave Business Insider similar accounts of their illnesses. That contradicts guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has suggested that mild coronavirus symptoms typically last for 14 days. For severe or critical patients, the World Health Organization reports, recovery can last up to six weeks.
But the limited nature of data about patients in recovery so far means we don’t have much information about how long symptoms typically last. In scientific studies, patients who are considered “recovered” are usually those who have been discharged from the hospital. Since mild cases are encouraged to stay home, they’re less likely to be reflected in that research.
“We’re definitely seeing people whose symptoms last longer than two weeks,” Dr. Nate Favini, the medical lead at Forward, a primary-care practice that’s collecting data on coronavirus patients around the country, told Business Insider. Favini treats coronavirus patients in San Francisco.
He said the CDC has been “very slow to update their guidance on symptoms.”
“It’s hard to say what percent of people have symptoms that last beyond two weeks, but we’re definitely observing that as a not-uncommon phenomenon,” he said. “The virus causes all kinds of inflammation and dysregulation in your body and it can take even longer, after you’ve cleared the virus, for all of those things to go back to normal.”
Nichols said her symptoms reached their peak intensity about a week into her illness.
“I had moments of absolute terror,” she said. “I was waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air. I had to prop my head up on four pillows just to get myself to be able to breathe.”
She debated going to the emergency room, but said the idea wracked her with guilt.
“It was this internal struggle of, ‘I feel like I need to go to the hospital, but I don’t want to take a hospital bed because I can still breathe, but I also don’t want to die at home,'” she said.
Throughout her illness, Nichols has been working from home, managing an international program for the Department of Transportation.
She tries to maintain a cheery disposition when on the phone, but her days are often interrupted by the need to sit on the toilet for several hours. Friends and family have a hard time believing she’s still sick, she said.
“People just don’t understand when they’re not a patient how long symptoms can last,” she said. “Everyone, my coworkers included, are trying to rush the recovery when I don’t need that pressure.”
Caroline, a 27-year-old resident of Houston, Texas, has had symptoms for 48 days, and told Business Insider she’s also trying to work through the discomfort. (Her last name has been omitted to protect her privacy.) Caroline said she still suffers from fatigue and feels an urge to sleep 18 hours a day. But her work as a corporate attorney makes that impossible.
“I’m just chugging energy drinks to try and stay awake, which is absolutely not what I should not be doing,” she said. “It’s just kind of awkward to have to tell work, ‘Hey, I know I got sick five weeks ago, but I’m still feeling bad.'”
Caroline’s symptoms started March 15, when she got a fever after attending a bachelorette party in Charleston, South Carolina. The attendees included four women from Manhattan, which has become an epicenter of the US’s coronavirus epidemic. During the celebratory weekend, the bride-to-be learned that her grandmother had died of COVID-19.
Caroline tested positive for the virus eight days after returning home. She had a cough, felt short of breath, and lost her sense of smell.
Caroline said she recently told a partner at her firm that she might be slow to respond to email because of her illness. He suggested she might just be run-down from a couple years of working long hours.
“People don’t really believe me,” she said.
For many coronavirus patients – both those with long-lasting and shorter-lived cases – the severity of symptoms can vary from day to day.
“Some days I’ll have a spell where I kind of feel fine and then I literally won’t be able to come out of the room for two days,” Caroline said.
Kelsey Meeks, a 36-year-old attorney who lives outside New Orleans, Louisiana, said that during her worst bout of symptoms, things seemed to change minute by minute.
“Every day I would be like, ‘I can breathe right now, but in five minutes am I going to be okay?'” she told Business Insider. “It was really scary – just that anticipation of not knowing which way the coin was going to flip.”
Meeks has felt sick since March 30. Friday marked day 32 of her illness. Her main symptoms now include body aches, headaches, and nasal congestion. She previously lost her sense of taste and smell for about two weeks, and also experienced a pressure in her chest, as if “wearing a dress that is too tight.” She had dreams that she was underwater, then woke up gasping for air.
“I haven’t had a day where I woke up and I thought, ‘Oh, I’m over this,'” she told Business Insider. “I can have a better day and then the next day I can’t walk and talk at the same time.”
Meeks said five of her family members tested positive for COVID-19, but on the whole their symptoms have been milder and resolved quickly.
“It was hard to understand why I wasn’t getting better as fast as they did,” she said. “There doesn’t seem to be a rhyme or reason.”
Meeks, too, is still trying to work from home.
“Once or twice a day, I’ll hit what I call a fatigue wall, which is where I can’t do anything. I have to go to sleep immediately,” she said. “It’s like the tired where you just don’t care about anything else.”
She’s concerned about her job performance.
“I do struggle with the guilt about it and feeling like a failure,” she said. “I’m getting to the point where my brain’s functioning enough that I’m realizing, wow, I really have lost a lot of time over the last three-and-a-half weeks.”
Favini said it’s too early to predict how long symptoms will last for typical patients.
Among patients who’ve suffered from severe coronavirus complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or strokes, the virus could produce lasting organ damage. The coronavirus can also result in blood clots in the lungs that don’t show up on a regular CT scan. Favini said that could cause ongoing shortness of breath.
Lately, he added, he has seen coronavirus patients with persistent coughs and diarrhea.
“There’s also people who describe not feeling right for a long time – just feeling ‘off’ in some way,” he said.
Symptoms beyond two weeks could be the result of an ongoing viral infection, Favini added, but they may also be caused by secondary effects of the virus, like persistent inflammation. That may explain why a person can still show symptoms after testing negative.
That’s what happened to Dio Cruz, who tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31. He’d been caring for his mother, who developed symptoms a week and a half earlier, at his home in Colorado Springs.
“I had this eye pain that was in both eyes, but it was more pronounced in my right eye,” Cruz said. “It was so bad that I would typically have to shut down around noon, go upstairs, hide in one of my rooms and just turn off all the lights and sit there in the dark.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madonna tests positive for coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pop diva Madonna has revealed that she has tested positive for the COVID-19 anitbodies.
The singer shared the news in the 14th edition of her “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram TV.
“Took a test the other day and I found out that I have the antibodies. So tomorrow I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car, and I’m gonna roll down the window and I’m gonna breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining,” Madonna said.
According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US, antibody tests are used to determine whether or not a person has been exposed to COVID-19 by finding proteins the body produces to fight the virus. However, the CDC has yet to confirm if the possession of antibodies is equal to immunity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘False dawn’ recovery haunts coronavirus survivors who fall sick again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It had been over a month since Mirabai Nicholson-McKellar was infected with the coronavirus, and the 35-year-old filmmaker thought she was on her way to recovery. Then the shortness of breath came back, followed by chest pains.
A visit to the emergency room and a second test for COVID-19 gave another positive result. Just three days earlier, she’d been cleared by health authorities in Australia’s New South Wales state, and was allowed to end her home quarantine after going 72 hours without symptoms.
“When is this going to end? I think about that constantly,” she said of the twists and turns in her health. “Am I still contagious? How do I know if I’m not contagious?”
Her experience adds to a growing number of reports of patients appearing to have a reactivation of symptoms, testing positive again, or even potentially being reinfected. Such incidents don’t align with the generally accepted understanding of how virus infections work and spread.
This so-called false-dawn phenomenon is puzzling health experts as they try to come to grips with the mysterious pathogen that emerged only five months ago. Solving the puzzle will inform a broad range of challenges, from the development of an effective vaccine to how soon governments may be able to safely end lockdowns and allow normal life to resume.
More immediately, the situation is taking a personal toll, making the journey of recovery a complex and frustrating ordeal for some of the more than 1 million survivors of the pandemic.
So far, there hasn’t been enough research to conclude why symptoms seem to re-emerge in some people, and whether they experience reinfection or if the virus persists for weeks. One possibility is that COVID-19 causes blood clots that may cause potentially dangerous complications unless treated with anticoagulant medications, said Edwin J.R. van Beek, chair of clinical radiology at the University of Edinburgh’s Queens Medical Research Institute.
South Korean researchers also offered some clues this week when they reported that so-called nucleic acid tests might be positive based on the detection of dead viral particles that could give the false impression that a patient is still infectious when they’re not.
“Everyone’s trying to figure this out,” said Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious diseases professor at Stanford Medical School. “What happens when people have been sick and infected — are we going to consider them immune and, therefore, not susceptible at all? Or are they immune and serve as potential points of infection for other people?”
Officials in countries that managed to suppress an initial wave of the pandemic are dreading the possibility that the virus may have a seasonal pattern and could return in the fall and repeat the nightmare scenario.
Hospitals already strained beyond their limits could see further demand if patients return. It also poses long-term implications for social safety nets and insurers as some struggle with the lingering effects of the coronavirus on their day-to-day life and health. Severe cases that require ventilators and ICU stays would need continued follow-up care as they recover from the ordeal, further pressuring health care systems.
There can also be a growing psychological cost. Governments may try to isolate survivors for longer in fear that they are still infectious, adding more anxiety to patients already suffering from the uncertainty of when they will be deemed healthy again.
“A lot of patients will suffer mental health issues,” said Michelle Biehl, a critical-care pulmonary doctor at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. “They’ll have anxiety, depression, PTSD.”
As the number of recovered patients expand, the burden will begin to shift down the medical practice chain, Biehl said. More primary care doctors, mental health specialists and physical therapists will be seeing survivors.
“You send them home and what happens then?” asked Maldonado. “From the outpatient side, we’re just starting to get to that point where we’re seeing people in the longer term.”
There’s consensus that so-called herd immunity is key to ending the pandemic, but with a vaccine unlikely to be widely available this year, it will depend on factors such as how long people who’ve recovered have immunity and what percentage of people must be immune to protect the “herd.”
There’s “a lot of unknowns and uncertainty in the development of individual immunity,” said Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious diseases at Japan’s Kobe University. “Development of antibody inside the body is not necessarily development of immunity against this disease.”
The unknowns concerning infectiousness, immunity and lingering symptoms create frustrating dilemmas for patients like Daniela Alves. The London resident paid £200 ($251) for a private test that told her she was positive. Like Nicholson-McKellar, she was never hospitalized but had coughs, shortness of breath and aches that came and went for weeks, never in a straight path toward recuperating, leaving her uncertain of the state of her health.
“I don’t know when I’m going to be negative so I can go outside,” she said. “Do I have to pay another £200 so I know I’m safe to others?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake O'Kane: My mother had a quick and painless death at a great age but it could have been so different</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AS SOON as I noticed two messages last Thursday on my phone from my brothers, within minutes of each other, I knew what had happened, and I was right. My mother had just died. Death in a time of pandemic adds a level of surrealism to the experience of grief.
I take comfort from the fact that my mother died of natural causes. At 89 years old, her heart simply gave out; sitting at her kitchen table, she never got to finish her cup of coffee. My Aunt Monica put it best when she stated, "Sure, didn’t she get away nicely?"
And in the middle of this coronavirus pandemic, a quick and painless death at a great age is indeed an example of ‘getting away nicely’, for it could have been so different. My mother could have been one of the thousands of elderly in our nursing homes, trapped in their rooms, as Covid-19 stalks the corridors, as all the while brave and tenacious staff put their own health at risk to care for their charges with lamentably little personal protection equipment available to them.
My mother, on a few occasions, spent weeks in such homes, convalescing after visits to hospital, but she was adamant she would return to her own home, and what Mother wanted, Mother got. This was only possible due to the indefatigable efforts of a small but attentive army of NHS and private carers, and family members, organised by my brother Conor.
I’ve written in the past about how I believe the Irish way of death, rooted in the fabric of our culture, is of great psychological benefit in the grieving process. The Irish wake, an ancient rite of passage where the living comfort each other, while parting with the deceased, is sadly no longer possible.
Due to the essential social distancing presently needed, only immediate family were in attendance at the wake house. Cruellest of all was the fact my brother Damien – Mother’s youngest child and always her favourite – was unable to attend her funeral. Finding himself trapped on the wrong side of the Irish Sea in Edinburgh, he at least was able to watch the funeral service streamed live on the internet.
With only a dozen in attendance, the service could have been cold and impersonal but for the sensitivity of Fr Peter Madden, who ensured a warm and nurturing celebration of my mother’s life.
The drive from Draperstown to her burial in Dungiven took us through Moneyneena and on through the Sperrins on what had to be one of the most glorious days of the year. With hillsides ablaze with flowering gorse, at the end of lanes and in front of houses, family after family stood and blessed themselves as the cortege passed. Forced into isolation, yet unbowed by the virus, friends and neighbours had found a way to show their respects.
And this is what I will remember, not the limitations imposed by the pandemic but how everyone we met – from undertaker to local doctor to priests – ensured the Irish way of death was not only maintained but that we, as a family, were supported in every way possible.
Who my mother was is captured in this story. Not long after they became available, my father invested in a new colour television for the bar he and my mother ran in north Belfast. Frequented mainly by dockers and labourers, the bar was small but had a loyal clientele.
Not long after buying his new television, a stranger walked into the bar. The story goes the man was a giant – but considering the average height of men in north Belfast in the 60s, a giant would have been 5ft 10.
The stranger plonked himself at the end of the bar and proceeded to morosely consume a bottle of whisky. On draining his last glass, he calmly, and without warning, turned and launched it into the screen of the new colour television.
Locals dived for cover as it exploded, showering them with glass. The culprit arrogantly stepped off his bar stool and glared around, daring anyone to admonish him. His gaze finally settling on my father behind the bar.
All eyes turned to my father, expectantly awaiting his reaction. Father calmly, and with no embarrassment, turned to my mother and said, "Josie, put him out."
And that’s exactly what happened. Josie reached up, grabbed the malcontent by his collar and marched him out like a lamb.
Josie, b1931, d 2020. RIP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Long Beach street art emerges amid COVID-19 pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONG BEACH, Calif. (KABC) -- "Right now is the time that we can thrive as artists to help people," said Jamuna Priti, owner of vegan nail bar Kleur.Priti decided to board up her shop in Alamitos Beach as an extra precaution toward the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, but she said it wasn't an easy decision.The business owner said the boarded-up storefronts reminded her of the Los Angeles riots"To me, it's so threatening," Priti said. "I just can't wrap my head around seeing a bunch of boarded up windows."That's when Priti had an idea."I love to paint," she said. "I came up with all of these different messages that I've seen and kind of tapped into how I was feeling."She painted the boards that covered her store's window bright purple, and added messages of positivity and hope.Her storefront now showcases these messages, "I don't have to be productive to be worthy," "My feelings are real," "I am loved by others," among others.Pritti's idea of converting boarded-up storefronts into works of art made its way to the Arts Council for Long Beach."For any business out there who might feel alone, they should know that there is a community behind them trying to beautify their storefronts and protect them duringthese times," said Griselda Suarez, Executive Director of the Arts Council for Long BeachThe Arts Council is now commissioning local artist to create pieces for Long Beach businesses."We want to create messages of hope and, at the same time, we want to get artists paid," Suarez said.Los Angeles-based artist Corie Mattie has placed dozens of her bright yellow pieces across the region. She made her mark in Long Beach at Sweetwater Saloon and painted an ice cream truck.Mattie's signature is the LA Hope Dealer. Her work has been distributed to cities across the country."We're all in the same boat right now, but we're facing different storms," Mattie said. "I want people to be able to see the Hope Dealer and be like, 'Alright, that is so motivating to me and inspiring me to keep going.'"Mattie hopes the bright light that artists are creating in this dark time will shine on once that pandemic comes to an end."History always repeats itself," Mattie said. "After the plague came the Renaissance."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweden's gamble on coronavirus herd immunity couldn't work in the US — and it may not work in Sweden</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In Sweden, bars and restaurants are open to the public, you can go get a haircut, and primary school is in session.
The coronavirus has arrived, but life goes on.
The country has taken a lighter-than-most approach to social distancing for COVID-19, relying on people to monitor themselves for symptoms, stay home when ill, practice good handwashing, and avoid crowds.
You see very few masks on people's faces in current photos from Stockholm and other Swedish cities. 
It's a strategy that hasn't been employed in neighboring Finland or Norway, and it's one that some Swedish parents (keeping their kids out of school) as well as doctors and scientists (writing open letters of protest to the government) do not agree with at all. 
The ruling concept relies on a bedrock of trust between the government and its people, an expectation of willing obedience and a mindset of safety first, coupled with a desire to keep people healthy, both physically, and mentally. 
"What every country is trying to do is to keep people apart, using the measures we have and the traditions we have to implement those measures," the Swedish public health agency's chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, recently told Nature. "The citizen has the responsibility not to spread a disease." 
If anyone can have success with such a low-enforcement disease-fighting strategy, it may be Sweden. A sparsely-populated country of people who generally agree to follow the rules is certainly a better candidate than most others for this public health experiment. 
But even in Sweden, the reality is that COVID-19 is a tough disease to corral, and the relaxed disease-fighting plan doesn't seem to be going as well as some officials there might've hoped.
Sweden is a country of willfully compliant citizens, home of a so-called "consensus culture." It's a place that's birthed some of the world's safest cars, and most inoffensive furniture. Nearly everyone pays their taxes without prodding, despite the record high rates. 
"People trust the government," American archaeologist and Scandinavian art history professor Nancy Wicker, who's traveled frequently back and forth between Sweden and the US for nearly four decades, told Business Insider. "It's definitely part of the culture to follow the rules, or guidelines, and to not be too pushy about it."
The Swedish prerogative asks citizens to act like adults, and then trusts that, left to their own devices, people will. The Swedish even have a word for this, folkvett. It translates, roughly, to "good manners," but really means much more, expecting that Swedish people will act appropriately and do the right thing, without being told, or if not, face severe public shame and moral judgement.
In the US, the land of "liberty or death!" and vociferous coronavirus protests, where individualism and independence are prized above all else, it's hard to imagine the same we're-a-collective disease-fighting strategy working as well.
The Swedish coronavirus strategy is rooted in a practical, grown-up sense of being in this fight together, and for the long haul. 
"People want to get along, and not draw attention to themselves, which is really different than most Americans," Wicker said.
Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård once described the mindset at work here, Jantelagen, as "don't think you're special," and it applies to all Swedes (even movie stars and kings).
Indeed, Swedish King Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus said as much in a recent, rare national address.
"We must act responsibly and selflessly," he said. "Everyone in our country has this obligation. Each and every one of us. There is still a great deal of uncertainty. But one thing is certain: we will remember these times and look back on them. Did I think about other people? Or did I put myself first? We will have to live with the choices we make today, for a long time to come."
Sweden places a high importance on the rights of the child, stressing that children need time, space, and friends to play with, and that adults, similarly need go to work, not just to make ends meet and keep the economy chugging along, but to feel a part of the fabric of their society. 
The Swedes are also seriously weighing concerns that have been taken as inevitable, if unfortunate, collateral damage in other countries, such as the mental health risks of being stuck inside, rising rates of abuse, and substance use disorders.
"It's good for people to be outdoors," Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde recently told Politico. "If you're locked inside there's risk of depression, domestic violence, alcohol abuse."
Other countries, including the UK and the Netherlands, originally toyed with the idea that a tight lockdown would lead to unrest, and that it would be more realistic to go for a looser approach, and to aim for herd immunity. 
Both were accused of heartlessness: sacrificing the old and vulnerable to avoid anger over pubs closing. They backpedaled, and issued lockdowns. But Sweden has persevered.
This doesn't mean that the country is simply comfortable throwing away its elders, or that anything you might've seen in a horror flick like Midsommar about old people jumping off cliffs to get rid of themselves, is rooted in reality or history. ("Definitely not, definitely not," Wicker said.)
Rather, the comparatively lax strategy is about trying to create a sustainable set up that Swedes will respect long-term, leaning on a culture of asking and not telling.
"The health agency in Sweden, we have to remember this, their job is not just simply to deal with contagious diseases, they are concerned with the health of the population as a whole," Swedish historian Lars Trägårdh told Business Insider. "Whereas in Norway, Finland, Denmark, the politicians have the last word."
Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister, Isabella Lovin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday "it's a great myth that Sweden hasn't really taken very serious steps" to limit the spread of the virus.
"Every country needs to take its own measures according to its traditions and its systems of governance," Lovin said, a nod to the fact that Sweden's public health agency runs independently, so politicians never get to make decisions about Swedish health.
"It's a real fear that if you have too harsh measures, then they can't be sustained over time, and you can get a counter-reaction, and people would not respect the voluntary recommendations that will need to be respected for a very long time." 
Living in Sweden right now does not mean you can do whatever you want. People are advised to stay home when they feel sick, and then continue to isolate until they've been symptom-free for two days. And, for the most part, they do.
LoadingSomething is loading.
There are already promising signs that the ask-not-order strategy is working somewhat well in Sweden, as it has before. 
With universal healthcare, Sweden simply "offers" it's children shots, and upholds a 97% vaccination rate. 
With the coronavirus, too, it seems, Swedes are taking their own health seriously, and trying to keep density at the nation's hospitals (where there aren't a lot of beds, anyway) low, while at the same time upping their own home hygiene.
"We have data showing that the flu epidemic and the winter norovirus dropped consistently this year, meaning that our social distancing and hand washing is working," Tegnell said. 
Sweden's COVID-19 game plan is not without it's issues, though. It's proving tough to control a raging new virus that is highly contagious, sometimes tricky to spot, and for which there is no population immunity.
Some Swedes have gotten quite sick. More than 2,650 have died. The country's COVID-19 death rate is 12.3%, roughly triple that of Sweden's Nordic neighbors, Finland and Norway. The Swedish case-fatality rate also surpasses some of the hardest-hit countries: Spain (11.5%), and the US (5.9%). 
Swedish nursing homes, in a country which generally gets good marks for its elder care, have been especially hard-hit during this pandemic, accounting for more than half of the country's deaths, according to Tegnell. Arguably, some of those infections, and deaths, could have been easily prevented. 
"Where I'm working we don't have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people," one Swedish home care worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, recently told the Guardian. "Everybody's concerned about it. We are all worried."
Furloughed airline employees are even being retrained to step in and work at the country's hospitals and nursing homes.
"We underestimated the issues at care homes," Tegnell said. "We should have controlled this more thoroughly."
Trägårdh said that the issue is made even more difficult because most elders in Sweden live at home, meaning nursing homes are reserved for the very oldest, and most fragile patients, already at greatest risk. 
"You only really get into these institutions if you are really old and unwell," he said. "There's been an underinvestment in elderly care, and that's a long-term problem." 
The economy has also taken a hit. The Swedish Public Employment Service said on April 20 that 8% of the country is now unemployed, a figure that's projected to continue to rise, possibly hitting 10% by this summer.
"This is not a strategy that has come without any impact on our economy, or on people's freedom," Lovin told the BBC. "We have more than 90,000 people who have been unemployed during these four or five weeks."
The Public Health Agency of Sweden is now cautiously applauding its approach, suggesting the worst of the virus' infectious spread may have already occured in the country's densest, most populous city.
So far, laboratories have counted 8,200 COVID-19 infections in Stockholm, an infection rate of less than 1%. 
But because Swedish health authorities suspect there are approximately 75 unconfirmed COVID-19 cases for each lab-confirmed case, they predict, using mathematical models, that 26% of people, or about 1 in 4 living in Stockholm county, "has or will have had COVID-19" by May, and that, as such, they are not as susceptible to the disease.
That's still quite a way away from any kind of herd immunity, when enough people are immune to a disease that it cannot make in-roads in the community.
"It's going to take 60% to 70% of the population to be infected and develop immunity, or be vaccinated to slow down transmission in any meaningful way," Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told Business Insider.
Trägårdh said that while herd immunity is not "an explicit policy goal" for Sweden, "you know, it's there in the mix."
However, the World Health Organization warns that there's "not enough evidence" yet to guarantee people who get COVID-19 will be immune from re-infection, stressing that "no study" has yet evaluated the question.
"We expect people that are infected with COVID-19 to develop a response that has some level of protection," the WHO's head of emerging diseases Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters at a press conference on Monday. "What we don't know right now is how strong that protection is, and if that's seen in everybody that is infected, and for how long that lasts."
With spring temperatures warming, and the sun shining for more than 15 hours every day in the Swedish capital, there are worrisome signs that go against the government's rosy projections. Independent estimates show that infection rates are still on the rise, not the decline. It may be time for some more draconian stay-at-home measures right now, even in Sweden, a move officials there say they may consider. 
After all, other countries with stricter lockdowns are successfully preventing hundreds of thousands of infections. 
While Sweden may provide some inspiration for how to reopen other places with diligence and calm, the country's high death count shows that it isn't a perfect coronavirus-fighting model, especially for other countries where fewer people live on their own, citizens are less-than-obedient, and far more crowded public spaces make it difficult to consistently keep a safe distance from others. 
"We've got to dance with the virus," George Fu Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said during a National Academy of Sciences conference last weekend.
"We have to come back, resume the business, resume the social activities."
In order to be successful at this novel kind of dance, countries need to continue to protect their people from infection, largely by keeping them apart from the sick, until there's either a treatment, a vaccine, or ideally, both. Complicating matters further, if this coronavirus proves to be anything like the influenza pandemics we've seen in the past, we can expect that it's going to hit hard again, in a devastating second wave of illnesses, perhaps as early as this fall. 
"Can we stay locked up for 18 or 20 months?" Osterholm asked, pointing out that even that timeline is highly optimistic for a vaccine.
"We need to have some very painful population discussions about how do we try to get to what might one day be a vaccine, minimizing the number of cases, and particularly seriously ill cases, and those that die, compared to, you know, sustaining our society. I categorically reject the idea that it's money versus deaths, that's not what this is about." 
Sweden is already having some of those tough, society-wide discussions, but the US isn't, largely expecting that more widespread testing and tracing of cases will solve the problem on its own, even as armed protesters rush toward politicians in anger. 
"People keep talking about testing their way back into everyday life," Osterholm said. "That is a part of it, but it's not the magic bullet people think."
Ultimately, he says the better question for countries like the US is whether they can achieve a new, well-thought-out, safer way to interact while out and about during the outbreak, with minimum harm, and maximum personal responsibility.
The idea sounds very Swedish, and not very American.
However, there is an opportunity here for other countries to take some inspiration from Sweden's gamble, while learning from some of the biggest mistakes thus far, by giving more forethought to how to protect some of the most vulnerable populations among us, as we venture back out into the open. 
"I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model," WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies Mike Ryan said during a press conference on Wednesday. "If we wish to get back to a society in which we don't have lockdowns, then society may need to adapt for a medium or potentially a longer period of time in which our physical and social relationships with each other will have to be modulated by the presence of the virus." 
How to emerge from lockdown, without letting cases explode?
There could be conversations about relaxing restrictions for younger people to get back to work and school first, or having sparsely populated areas open up for activities like manufacturing and construction, all the while monitoring those populations for outbreaks of new cases.
The important thing is to talk about all the ways re-opening could look, rather than seeing it as a binary: open, or closed?
"Do we try to bubble-protect the people who have highest risk of serious disease? This is a conversation we need to have right now, and we're not having it," Osterholm said.
"It's almost like we have a light switch, on and off. Either we've released society, or we haven't."

“It’s going to take 60% to 70% of the population to be infected and develop immunity, or be vaccinated to slow down transmission in any meaningful way,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told Business Insider.
Trägårdh said that while herd immunity is not “an explicit policy goal” for Sweden, “you know, it’s there in the mix.”
However, the World Health Organization warns that there’s “not enough evidence” yet to guarantee people who get COVID-19 will be immune from re-infection, stressing that “no study” has yet evaluated the question.
“We expect people that are infected with COVID-19 to develop a response that has some level of protection,” the WHO’s head of emerging diseases Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters at a press conference on Monday. “What we don’t know right now is how strong that protection is, and if that’s seen in everybody that is infected, and for how long that lasts.”
With spring temperatures warming, and the sun shining for more than 15 hours every day in the Swedish capital, there are worrisome signs that go against the government’s rosy projections. Independent estimates show that infection rates are still on the rise, not the decline. It may be time for some more draconian stay-at-home measures right now, even in Sweden, a move officials there say they may consider.
After all, other countries with stricter lockdowns are successfully preventing hundreds of thousands of infections.
While Sweden may provide some inspiration for how to reopen other places with diligence and calm, the country’s high death count shows that it isn’t a perfect coronavirus-fighting model, especially for other countries where fewer people live on their own, citizens are less-than-obedient, and far more crowded public spaces make it difficult to consistently keep a safe distance from others.
“We’ve got to dance with the virus,” George Fu Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said during a National Academy of Sciences conference last weekend.
“We have to come back, resume the business, resume the social activities.”
In order to be successful at this novel kind of dance, countries need to continue to protect their people from infection, largely by keeping them apart from the sick, until there’s either a treatment, a vaccine, or ideally, both. Complicating matters further, if this coronavirus proves to be anything like the influenza pandemics we’ve seen in the past, we can expect that it’s going to hit hard again, in a devastating second wave of illnesses, perhaps as early as this fall.
“Can we stay locked up for 18 or 20 months?” Osterholm asked, pointing out that even that timeline is highly optimistic for a vaccine.
“We need to have some very painful population discussions about how do we try to get to what might one day be a vaccine, minimizing the number of cases, and particularly seriously ill cases, and those that die, compared to, you know, sustaining our society. I categorically reject the idea that it’s money versus deaths, that’s not what this is about.”
Sweden is already having some of those tough, society-wide discussions, but the US isn’t, largely expecting that more widespread testing and tracing of cases will solve the problem on its own, even as armed protesters rush toward politicians in anger.
“People keep talking about testing their way back into everyday life,” Osterholm said. “That is a part of it, but it’s not the magic bullet people think.”
Ultimately, he says the better question for countries like the US is whether they can achieve a new, well-thought-out, safer way to interact while out and about during the outbreak, with minimum harm, and maximum personal responsibility.
The idea sounds very Swedish, and not very American.
However, there is an opportunity here for other countries to take some inspiration from Sweden’s gamble, while learning from some of the biggest mistakes thus far, by giving more forethought to how to protect some of the most vulnerable populations among us, as we venture back out into the open.
“I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model,” WHO Executive Director of Health Emergencies Mike Ryan said during a press conference on Wednesday. “If we wish to get back to a society in which we don’t have lockdowns, then society may need to adapt for a medium or potentially a longer period of time in which our physical and social relationships with each other will have to be modulated by the presence of the virus.”
How to emerge from lockdown, without letting cases explode?
There could be conversations about relaxing restrictions for younger people to get back to work and school first, or having sparsely populated areas open up for activities like manufacturing and construction, all the while monitoring those populations for outbreaks of new cases.
The important thing is to talk about all the ways re-opening could look, rather than seeing it as a binary: open, or closed?
“Do we try to bubble-protect the people who have highest risk of serious disease? This is a conversation we need to have right now, and we’re not having it,” Osterholm said.
“It’s almost like we have a light switch, on and off. Either we’ve released society, or we haven’t.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweden's gamble on coronavirus herd immunity couldn't work in the US — and it may not work in Sweden</h5>

In Sweden, bars and restaurants are open to the public, you can go get a haircut, and primary school is in session.
The coronavirus has arrived, but life goes on.
The country has taken a lighter-than-most approach to social distancing for COVID-19, relying on people to monitor themselves for symptoms, stay home when ill, practice good handwashing, and avoid crowds.
You see very few masks on people's faces in current photos from Stockholm and other Swedish cities.

It's a strategy that hasn't been employed in neighboring Finland or Norway, and it's one that some Swedish parents (keeping their kids out of school) as well as doctors and scientists (writing open letters of protest to the government) do not agree with at all.
The ruling concept relies on a bedrock of trust between the government and its people, an expectation of willing obedience and a mindset of safety first, coupled with a desire to keep people healthy, both physically, and mentally. 
"What every country is trying to do is to keep people apart, using the measures we have and the traditions we have to implement those measures," the Swedish public health agency's chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, recently told Nature. "The citizen has the responsibility not to spread a disease."
If anyone can have success with such a low-enforcement disease-fighting strategy, it may be Sweden. A sparsely-populated country of people who generally agree to follow the rules is certainly a better candidate than most others for this public health experiment. 
But even in Sweden, the reality is that COVID-19 is a tough disease to corral, and the relaxed disease-fighting plan doesn't seem to be going as well as some officials there might've hoped.
Sweden is a country of willfully compliant citizens, home of a so-called "consensus culture." It's a place that's birthed some of the world's safest cars, and most inoffensive furniture. Nearly everyone pays their taxes without prodding, despite the record high rates.
"People trust the government," American archaeologist and Scandinavian art history professor Nancy Wicker, who's traveled frequently back and forth between Sweden and the US for nearly four decades, told Business Insider. "It's definitely part of the culture to follow the rules, or guidelines, and to not be too pushy about it."
The Swedish prerogative asks citizens to act like adults, and then trusts that, left to their own devices, people will. The Swedish even have a word for this, folkvett. It translates, roughly, to "good manners," but really means much more, expecting that Swedish people will act appropriately and do the right thing, without being told, or if not, face severe public shame and moral judgement.
In the US, the land of "liberty or death!" and vociferous coronavirus protests, where individualism and independence are prized above all else, it's hard to imagine the same we're-a-collective disease-fighting strategy working as well.

The Swedish coronavirus strategy is rooted in a practical, grown-up sense of being in this fight together, and for the long haul. 
"People want to get along, and not draw attention to themselves, which is really different than most Americans," Wicker said.
Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård once described the mindset at work here, Jantelagen, as "don't think you're special," and it applies to all Swedes (even movie stars and kings).
Indeed, Swedish King Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus said as much in a recent, rare national address.
"We must act responsibly and selflessly," he said. "Everyone in our country has this obligation. Each and every one of us. There is still a great deal of uncertainty. But one thing is certain: we will remember these times and look back on them. Did I think about other people? Or did I put myself first? We will have to live with the choices we make today, for a long time to come."

Sweden places a high importance on the rights of the child, stressing that children need time, space, and friends to play with, and that adults, similarly need go to work, not just to make ends meet and keep the economy chugging along, but to feel a part of the fabric of their society.
The Swedes are also seriously weighing concerns that have been taken as inevitable, if unfortunate, collateral damage in other countries, such as the mental health risks of being stuck inside, rising rates of abuse, and substance use disorders.
"It's good for people to be outdoors," Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde recently told Politico. "If you're locked inside there's risk of depression, domestic violence, alcohol abuse."

Other countries, including the UK and the Netherlands, originally toyed with the idea that a tight lockdown would lead to unrest, and that it would be more realistic to go for a looser approach, and to aim for herd immunity. 
Both were accused of heartlessness: sacrificing the old and vulnerable to avoid anger over pubs closing. They backpedaled, and issued lockdowns. But Sweden has persevered.
This doesn't mean that the country is simply comfortable throwing away its elders, or that anything you might've seen in a horror flick like Midsommar about old people jumping off cliffs to get rid of themselves, is rooted in reality or history. ("Definitely not, definitely not," Wicker said.)
Rather, the comparatively lax strategy is about trying to create a sustainable set up that Swedes will respect long-term, leaning on a culture of asking and not telling.
"The health agency in Sweden, we have to remember this, their job is not just simply to deal with contagious diseases, they are concerned with the health of the population as a whole," Swedish historian Lars Trägårdh told Business Insider. "Whereas in Norway, Finland, Denmark, the politicians have the last word."
Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister, Isabella Lovin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday "it's a great myth that Sweden hasn't really taken very serious steps" to limit the spread of the virus.
"Every country needs to take its own measures according to its traditions and its systems of governance," Lovin said, a nod to the fact that Sweden's public health agency runs independently, so politicians never get to make decisions about Swedish health.
"It's a real fear that if you have too harsh measures, then they can't be sustained over time, and you can get a counter-reaction, and people would not respect the voluntary recommendations that will need to be respected for a very long time."

Living in Sweden right now does not mean you can do whatever you want. People are advised to stay home when they feel sick, and then continue to isolate until they've been symptom-free for two days. And, for the most part, they do.
There are already promising signs that the ask-not-order strategy is working somewhat well in Sweden, as it has before. 
With universal healthcare, Sweden simply "offers" it's children shots, and upholds a 97% vaccination rate.
With the coronavirus, too, it seems, Swedes are taking their own health seriously, and trying to keep density at the nation's hospitals (where there aren't a lot of beds, anyway) low, while at the same time upping their own home hygiene.
"We have data showing that the flu epidemic and the winter norovirus dropped consistently this year, meaning that our social distancing and hand washing is working," Tegnell said.

Sweden's COVID-19 game plan is not without it's issues, though. It's proving tough to control a raging new virus that is highly contagious, sometimes tricky to spot, and for which there is no population immunity.
Some Swedes have gotten quite sick. More than 2,650 have died. The country's COVID-19 death rate is 12.3%, roughly triple that of Sweden's Nordic neighbors, Finland and Norway. The Swedish case-fatality rate also surpasses some of the hardest-hit countries: Spain (11.5%), and the US (5.9%).
Swedish nursing homes, in a country which generally gets good marks for its elder care, have been especially hard-hit during this pandemic, accounting for more than half of the country's deaths, according to Tegnell. Arguably, some of those infections, and deaths, could have been easily prevented.
"Where I'm working we don't have face masks at all, and we are working with the most vulnerable people," one Swedish home care worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, recently told the Guardian. "Everybody's concerned about it. We are all worried."
Furloughed airline employees are even being retrained to step in and work at the country's hospitals and nursing homes.
"We underestimated the issues at care homes," Tegnell said. "We should have controlled this more thoroughly."
Trägårdh said that the issue is made even more difficult because most elders in Sweden live at home, meaning nursing homes are reserved for the very oldest, and most fragile patients, already at greatest risk. 
"You only really get into these institutions if you are really old and unwell," he said. "There's been an underinvestment in elderly care, and that's a long-term problem." 
The economy has also taken a hit. The Swedish Public Employment Service said on April 20 that 8% of the country is now unemployed, a figure that's projected to continue to rise, possibly hitting 10% by this summer.
"This is not a strategy that has come without any impact on our economy, or on people's freedom," Lovin told the BBC. "We have more than 90,000 people who have been unemployed during these four or five weeks."
The Public Health Agency of Sweden is now cautiously applauding its approach, suggesting the worst of the virus' infectious spread may have already occured in the country's densest, most populous city.
So far, laboratories have counted 8,200 COVID-19 infections in Stockholm, an infection rate of less than 1%.
But because Swedish health authorities suspect there are approximately 75 unconfirmed COVID-19 cases for each lab-confirmed case, they predict, using mathematical models, that 26% of people, or about 1 in 4 living in Stockholm county, "has or will have had COVID-19" by May, and that, as such, they are not as susceptible to the disease.
That's still quite a way away from any kind of herd immunity, when enough people are immune to a disease that it cannot make in-roads in the community.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Younger adults are getting seriously sick and ending up in the hospital because of the coronavirus, and it's alarming doctors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Dr. Anar Yukhayev's patient told him she'd developed a fever after a recent trip to Italy, he ran out of the room and grabbed a mask for each of them.
By that point, the 31-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist had been face-to-face with her for 20 minutes.
It was the first week of March, when reports of the novel coronavirus were starting to emerge in the New York City area. Westchester County, north of the city, was already seeing a cluster of cases.
Yukhayev works at Katz Women's Hospital at Long Island Jewish Medical Center on the border of Queens and Nassau County in New York.
The following week, he started to feel off, with back and muscle aches. Then, he spiked a fever.
He got tested March 13, two days after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic. The state by that point had hundreds of confirmed cases. By the following week, he was so sick that his colleagues were thinking about putting him on a ventilator.
Yukhayev's experience of getting severely ill is common in hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Patients ages 30 to 59 made up roughly a third of hospital admissions evaluated by Northwell Health, the health system Yukhayev's is a part of, according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The shock of finding otherwise healthy people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s in the hospital severely ill with COVID-19 has been a common refrain in Business Insider's conversations with doctors on the front lines. Other viral outbreaks, especially the flu, tend to hit the youngest and oldest Americans the hardest.
Yukhayev told Business Insider he was so short of breath he could get only a few words out.
"I heard a gurgle, a crackle of water in my lungs every time I took a breath," Yukhayev said.
He said he couldn't get out of bed, didn't have an appetite, and had a fever.
He was admitted to the hospital and given azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and an oxygen mask to help him breathe.
Six days after he was tested, shortly after his doctors had entered him into a clinical trial for a Regeneron drug, Yukhayev was still getting worse. His doctors told him his next step would be to be put on a ventilator.
"That was my worst fear," Yukhayev said.
He spent the next day in the intensive-care unit, where the doctors continued to monitor him.
Then, he started to get better.
LoadingSomething is loading.
On March 26, he was discharged, after spending nine days in the hospital.
Stories of young people getting sick and even dying from the novel coronavirus are becoming common.
A 38-year-old Ironman athlete in Minnesota nearly died from COVID-19 and as of mid-April still needed oxygen to help him breathe.
David Lat, a 44-year-old marathon runner, was hospitalized in Manhattan for 17 days, six of which he spent on ventilator support to help him breathe.
The virus almost killed a 47-year-old New Jersey doctor, who was running 16 to 20 miles a week before getting sick.
As of April 12, adults ages 18 to 44 accounted for roughly 11% of all New York hospital admissions, while those ages 45 to 64 accounted for 27%.
To be sure, a look at hospitalization rates from March shows that rates of hospitalization per 100,000 people were highest among older Americans, especially those 75 and up.
But in a hospital on Long Island, the ICU has patients in their 20s, Dr. Dixie Harris, an ICU doctor who flew out from Utah to help with the crisis, said. It's somewhat unusual to care for so many young people, and doctors feel extra pressure to find ways to help them recover, she said.
"For someone in their 40s, 50s, you want to try everything you can to get them to survive," Harris said.
In Newark, New Jersey, an intensive-care doctor told Business Insider in March that in the ICU of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center he had young patients in their 20s and 30s on ventilators.
One day in March, an emergency-room nurse at New York University said she had to intubate two patients in their 30s.
"We've started to see a little more infection in really sick presentations in younger patients than we would've thought," Dr. Thomas Maddox, who serves as the chair of the science and quality committee of the American College of Cardiology, told Business Insider.
Younger patients are often outfitted with a non-rebreather mask in the ER, and given "just oxygen and oxygen and oxygen," Dr. Cleavon Gilman, an ER physician, told Business Insider's Hilary Brueck.
A week after being discharged, Yukhayev was back in the hospital — this time to care for a patient who had tested positive for the coronavirus and was about to have her baby via cesarean section.
Yukhayev performed the procedure, which took about an hour, and it was uneventful, he said. After, however, he was still short of breath, a problem made worse by the need to wear extra protective gear in the operating room.
Returning to the hospital where just a week ago he was a patient was surreal, Yukhayev said.
In the hallways, he said, he ran into healthcare workers who had taken care of him who were happy to see him better. Knowing he wasn't fully recovered, Yukhayev took a few more days off before returning to work on April 13, a month after initially being tested.
"I'm better than I was before I got sick," Yukhayev said. "After that you get a new experience of not taking life for granted."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Younger adults are getting seriously sick and ending up in the hospital because of the coronavirus, and it’s alarming doctors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Dr. Anar Yukhayev’s patient told him she’d developed a fever after a recent trip to Italy, he ran out of the room and grabbed a mask for each of them.
By that point, the 31-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist had been face-to-face with her for 20 minutes.
It was the first week of March, when reports of the novel coronavirus were starting to emerge in the New York City area. Westchester county, north of the city, was already seeing a cluster of cases.
Yukhayev works at Katz Women’s Hospital at Long Island Jewish Medical Center on the border of Queens and Nassau County in New York.
The following week, he started to feel off, with back and muscle aches. Then, he spiked a fever.
He got tested on March 13, two days after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic. The state by that point had hundreds of confirmed cases. By the following week, he was so sick that his colleagues were thinking about putting him on a ventilator.
Yukhayev’s experience of getting severely ill is common in hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Patients between 30 and 59 made up roughly a third of hospital admissions evaluated by Northwell Health, the health system Yukhayev’s a part of, according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The shock of finding otherwise healthy people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, in the hospital severely ill with COVID-19 has been a common refrain in Business Insider’s conversations with doctors on the front lines. Other viral outbreaks, especially the flu, tend to hit the youngest and oldest Americans the hardest.
Yukhayev told BI he was so short of breath he could only get a few words out.
“I heard a gurgle, a crackle of water in my lungs every time I took a breath,” Yukhayev said.
He said he couldn’t get out of bed, didn’t have an appetite, and had a fever.
He was admitted to the hospital and given azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and an oxygen mask to help him breathe.
Six days after he was tested, shortly after his doctors had entered him into a clinical trial for a Regeneron drug, Yukhayev was still getting worse. His doctors told him his next step would be to be put on a ventilator.
“That was my worst fear,” Yukhayev said.
He spent the next day in the intensive care unit, where the doctors continued to monitor him.
Then, he started to get better.
On March 26, he was discharged, after spending 9 days in the hospital.
Stories of young people getting sick and even dying from the coronavirus are becoming commonplace.
A 38-year-old Ironman athlete in Minnesota nearly died from COVID-19 and as of mid-April still needed oxygen to help him breathe.
David Lat, a 44-year-old marathon runner was hospitalized in Manhattan for 17 days, six of which he spent on ventilator support to help him breathe.
The virus almost killed a 47-year-old New Jersey doctor, who was running 16-20 miles a week before getting sick.
As of April 12, adults between 18 and 44 accounted for roughly 11% of all New York hospital admissions, while those between 45 and 64 accounted for 27%..
To be sure, a look at hospitalization rates from March showed that rates of hospitalization per 100,000 people were highest among older Americans, especially those 75 and up.
In a hospital on Long Island, the ICU has patients in their 20s, Dr. Dixie Harris, an ICU doctor who flew out from Utah to help with the crisis, said. It’s somewhat unusual to care for so many young people, and doctors feel extra pressure to find ways to help them recover, she said.
“For someone in their 40s, 50s, you want to try every thing you can to get them to survive,” Harris said.
In Newark, New Jersey, an intensive-care doctor told Business Insider in March that in the ICU of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center he had young patients in their 20s and 30s on ventilators.
One day in March, an ER nurse at NYU said she had to intubate two patients in their 30s.
“We’ve started to see a little more infection in really sick presentations in younger patients than we would’ve thought,” Dr. Thomas Maddox, who serves as chair of the science and quality committee of the American College of Cardiology, told Business Insider.
Younger patients are often outfitted with a non-rebreather mask in the ER, and given “just oxygen and oxygen and oxygen,” emergency room physician Dr. Cleavon Gilman told Business Insider’s Hilary Brueck.
A week after being discharged, Yukhayev was back in the hospital – this time to care for a patient who had tested positive for the coronavirus and was about to have her baby via a C-section.
Yukhayev performed the procedure, which took about an hour, and it was uneventful, he said. After, however, he was still short of breath, a problem made worse by the need to wear extra protective gear in the operating room.
Returning to the hospital where he was a week ago a patient was a surreal experience, Yukhayev said.
In the hallways, he ran into healthcare workers who had taken care of him who were happy to see him better. Knowing he wasn’t fully recovered, Yukhayev took a few more days off before returning to work on April 13, a month after initially being tested.
“I’m better than I was before I got sick,” Yukhayev said. “After that you get a new experience of not taking life for granted.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mysterious strokes among young COVID-19 patients may reveal how 'a virus can cause strokes in ways we never knew before,' a doctor says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Four people in their 30s and 40s were recently admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City with life-threatening strokes. Their cases were united by a common theme: All of them had COVID-19.
"Large-vessel strokes in young patients are exceedingly rare," Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai who published a new report about the cases, told Business Insider. "They'd need a past history concerning strokes. But these patients had minimal past medical histories and all came in within two weeks."
The patients, four men and one woman, were hospitalized between March 23 and April 7. In Oxley's paper, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, he and his colleagues wrote that "every two weeks over the previous 12 months, our service has treated, on average, 0.73 patients younger than 50 years of age with large-vessel stroke."
So the recent handful of stroke cases stood out.
"What if we're now learning that a virus can cause strokes in ways we never knew before?" Oxley said.
Large-vessel strokes are caused by a blood clot that travels from the body into an artery in the brain.
The new report describes how this happened in each of the five recent New York cases. The only woman in the study, a 33-year-old, had no prior medical history, the paper says. She experienced a COVID-19-related cough, headache, and chills in the week prior to her stroke. Then, over a period of 28 hours, her speech became slow and slurred as her jaw muscles shut down. Her left arm and leg became weak and numb.
At Mount Sinai, Oxley and his colleagues found a blood clot in her brain's carotid artery. They used a "clot-busting" drug to break it up over the next 10 days.
The four male patients, meanwhile, had similar stories. All of them experienced numbness, slowed speech, and temporary paralysis before they went to the hospital, where doctors removed the life-threatening clots. The men ranged in age from 37 to 49; two had mild coronavirus symptoms while the other two reported none at all.
Only one had suffered a stroke before.
Oxley said that since first speaking out about these stroke cases, he's been flooded with emails from other coronavirus patients describing minor strokes.
A 31-year-old man messaged him on Sunday, describing a sudden onset of speech disturbance and numbness, Oxley said. The patient went to the hospital, and an MRI revealed he'd had a stroke in his thalamus.
"I was just dumbfounded by this story of a patient who had never had a past history of stroke," Oxley said. 
He added that strokes have also been observed in older COVID-19 patients, but the new trend is reason for additional concern because it involves people in their 30s and 40s without severe symptoms. (Overall, nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65.)
Oxley and J. Mocco, another Mount Sinai neurosurgeon, think the link between COVID-19 and the increase in strokes they're seeing has to do with blood clots.
Experts have reported blood clots appearing in various parts of coronavirus patients' bodies, including the lungs. Broadway actor Nick Cordero, who was diagnosed with coronavirus, had to have his right leg amputated after clots formed. 
"It's very striking how much this disease causes clots to form," Mocco told Reuters.
Coronaviruses in general have also been known to cause neurological issues like strokes, according to a February study. Roughly 2% of patients in Singapore who contracted SARS (also a coronavirus) had strokes.
A study on COVID-19 patients at three hospitals in Wuhan, China — which is not yet peer-reviewed — found that of 214 patients, 36% had neurological symptoms. That included impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular diseases like strokes.
Scientists aren't yet sure why COVID-19 causes clots, but Oxley said they might be the result of blood vessels' reaction to being invaded by the virus.
The new coronavirus attacks via a specific cell receptor called ACE2, which can be found throughout the body, including in our guts, lungs, hearts, and even noses. 
According to Oxley, the virus can also bind to ACE2 receptors in the walls of our blood vessels. That leads the vessels to become inflamed, which can cause clotting. Then once a clot has formed, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke. 
Not everyone's blood-vessel walls have the same level of ACE2 receptors, though. That characteristic is linked to a patient's genetics, rather than their age, Oxley said. That might explain why blood clots appear in patients across age brackets.
Oxley said COVID-19 is teaching his colleagues about a previously unexplored link between viruses, inflammation, and strokes.
"There are other viruses we're going to learn about in the future that may be connected to strokes in the same way," he said.

He added that strokes have also been observed in older COVID-19 patients, but the new trend is reason for additional concern because it involves people in their 30s and 40s without severe symptoms. (Overall, nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in people over the age of 65.)
Oxley and J. Mocco, another Mount Sinai neurosurgeon, think the link between COVID-19 and the increase in strokes they’re seeing has to do with blood clots.
Experts have reported blood clots appearing in various parts of coronavirus patients’ bodies, including the lungs. Broadway actor Nick Cordero, who was diagnosed with coronavirus, had to have his right leg amputated after clots formed.
“It’s very striking how much this disease causes clots to form,” Mocco told Reuters.
Coronaviruses in general have also been known to cause neurological issues like strokes, according to a February study. Roughly 2% of patients in Singapore who contracted SARS (also a coronavirus) had strokes.
A study on COVID-19 patients at three hospitals in Wuhan, China – which is not yet peer-reviewed – found that of 214 patients, 36% had neurological symptoms. That included impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular diseases like strokes.
Scientists aren’t yet sure why COVID-19 causes clots, but Oxley said they might be the result of blood vessels’ reaction to being invaded by the virus.
The new coronavirus attacks via a specific cell receptor called ACE2, which can be found throughout the body, including in our guts, lungs, hearts, and even noses.
According to Oxley, the virus can also bind to ACE2 receptors in the walls of our blood vessels. That leads the vessels to become inflamed, which can cause clotting. Then once a clot has formed, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.
Not everyone’s blood-vessel walls have the same level of ACE2 receptors, though. That characteristic is linked to a patient’s genetics, rather than their age, Oxley said. That might explain why blood clots appear in patients across age brackets.
Oxley said COVID-19 is teaching his colleagues about a previously unexplored link between viruses, inflammation, and strokes.
“There are other viruses we’re going to learn about in the future that may be connected to strokes in the same way,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gay and bisexual men excluded from coronavirus blood plasma trial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gay and bisexual men have been told they cannot take part in a blood trial which experts hope could serve as a potential coronavirus treatment.
People who have recovered from Covid-19 have been encouraged to donate their blood plasmas, which will then be transfused to infected patients at London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital.
It is hoped the process, called convalescent plasma, will help patients whose immune systems are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the novel virus.
But any man who has had sex with another man in the last three months is excluded from the trial, which echoes current guidance on giving blood.
Critical care manager Andy Roberts, who had tested positive for Covid-19, said he was told he could not take part as he is in a same-sex relationship.
After a 20 minute call with an operator, Mr Roberts said he was quizzed on his sexuality before being turned down.

His long-term partner, Keith Ward, said the rules were discriminatory against the LGBT+ community and that the situation made him ‘feel very angry’.
He told ITV News: ‘We have been together in a monogamous relationship for more than 30 years and I previously didn’t know of this outrageous three-month rule.
‘It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer according to [the rules].’
Current guidelines set by the NHS Blood and Transplant service says ‘men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of acquiring certain infections through sex’ and they still apply to those who have used protection.
The official Give blood website states: ‘Gay and bisexual men are not automatically prevented from giving blood.
‘However, all men must wait 3 months after having oral or anal sex with another man before donating.
‘This rule applies to every man, regardless of their sexual orientation, whether they’re in a stable relationship or whether they use protection such as condoms or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)’.
So far, more than 6,500 people have signed up to donate to the plasma trial. Although it is not yet known how many antibodies build up in people who have beaten Covid-19, there have been some promising signs of immunity with patients who have retained antibodies long after recovering.
If the treatment proves to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.
But Director of Policy at Stonewall, Laura Russell, told ITV the donor guidelines were ‘really upsetting’ for gay and bi men who want to help in finding a Covid-19 treatment.
She insisted the decision on who can donate blood or a plasma ‘should be based on individual risk assessments, not on people’s sexual orientation’.
A spokesperson for the NHS Blood and Transplant service said the trial will initially be run using the current donor selection guidelines but will ‘keep this under review’.
It acknowledged ‘this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives’ but said the three-month guidelines are in place to ‘protect the health of the donor and the recipient’.
The spokesperson added: ‘Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gay and bisexual men are BANNED from Covid blood plasma trials: Volunteer who was turned down despite being in monogamous relationship for 30 years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gay and bisexual men are not being allowed to take part in a blood plasma trial to help in the battle against coronavirus.
The NHS is looking for plasma donors from recovered patients to used in the trial by doctors at London's Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.
Earlier today it was reported that 6,500 people have already registered interest in taking part.
But under rules that enraged potential donors, gay and bisexual men will be barred from donating unless they had already abstained from sex for three months. 
Critical care manager Andy Roberts told ITV News that although he had tested positive for coronavirus and has since recovered, he was turned down for the trial.
During a phone call with someone working on the trial, the married NHS worker was asked about his sexuality before being told he was not allowed.  
Keith Ward, his partner of more than three decades, said Mr Roberts being barred from the trial just because he is a gay man made him 'angry'.
'We have been together in a monogamous relationship for more than 30 years and I previously didn’t know of this outrageous three month rule,' he said.
'It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer according to the rules.'
General blood donation guidelines stipulate gay and bisexual men are not permitted to donate blood unless they have abstained from oral or anal sex with another man for three months.
The time limit was reduced from 12 months in 2017. There is no exception given to married gay men or those in monogamous relationships.  
The NHS Blood and Transplant service told MailOnline that the decision to use current donor selection guidelines are to 'protect donors and recipients'.
The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) makes recommendations to the Department of Health which decides on guidelines which NHSBT follow.
So the guidelines mentioned are Department of Health guidelines which we implement. Any reporting needs to be clear on this please.
An NHS Blood and Transplant spokesperson said: 'We will initially be using the current donor selection guidelines although we will keep this under review.
'The guidelines are there to protect the health of the donor and the recipient. Under the current guidelines, men must wait three months after having oral or anal sex with another man.
'We appreciate this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives.
'Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.'
For those who are permitted to take part in the trial, the donations have been collected and transfusions will begin in 'the coming weeks', the hospital's Biomedical Research Centre said.
It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.
The hospital says if the trials prove the treatment to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gay and bisexual men have been told they cannot donate their plasma to a trial hoping to provide a treatment for Covid-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This cookbook made me a big believer in meal prep — and it's getting my family of four through the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a full-time freelancer for nearly 15 years and a mom to 4-year-old twins, I've become a master at multitasking, mostly out of necessity. At any given time, I'm juggling around six to eight clients and roughly the same amount of requests for snacks and cuddles — often simultaneously these days, thanks to the 24/7 togetherness of the COVID-19 crisis.
With this in mind, meal prepping always seemed like a logical solution, with its promise of efficiency and potential time and cost savings. But in reality, time (to grocery shop and cook a large portion of food) and desire has always eluded me. Plus, variety is the spice of life, and eating the same thing all week felt a little too "Groundhog Day" for my greedy palate.
Enter the 2020 quarantine, when suddenly I was spending more time in the kitchen than ever before. Maximizing our grocery haul and saving money became a priority. The crisis forced me to finally give meal prepping a try, and when a friend in my "moms of multiples" group suggested the "Cook Once, Eat All Week" cookbook by Cassy Joy Garcia, I was all-in.
Unlike other meal prep methods, Garcia streamlines and simplifies the process by using one "main" set of ingredients that can be used in up to five different meals throughout the week. There's also a good range of cuisines represented, from Asian, Italian, Mexican, to Greek.
Each week calls for a different trifecta of main ingredients, like shredded pork-kale-plantains or ground beef-broccoli-potatoes combinations. According to Garcia, the three-ingredient lineups are intentionally chosen to include one protein, one veggie, and one starch; additionally, many of the same staples are used week to week, such as chicken or beef broth, extra-virgin olive oil, and various vinegars and spices.
This is when all ingredients are prepped and stored, but the actual meals are made gradually throughout the week utilizing the ready-to-use ingredients. These prep-and-cook sessions are short, sweet, and super easy to accomplish after a long workday.
This produced three meals: sweet-and-sour chicken chow mein, chicken souvlaki bowls, and chicken Tettrazini. Each week's set of recipes also includes two "bonus dinners," so I could have stretched this to five meals, but I figured it was best to start small.
All things considered, I spent about three hours prepping in the kitchen that Sunday morning, fueled by Diet Coke and a steady soundtrack of Prince and Michael Jackson. As the week progressed, my husband and I were happy to discover that each recipe tasted distinct and not similar to each other (and chicken tettrazini was our clear favorite!).
Even my 4-year-old son — whose diet mostly consists of chicken nuggets and sweet potato dinosaurs — has been getting in on the action and loving it. My daughter, however, remains committed to her regimen of string cheese and Cutie oranges.
We were also relieved to discover more recipes that meet our individual dietary needs — my husband is full keto and low-carb, while I have celiac disease and eat strictly gluten-free.
All of Garcia's recipes are gluten free, and she includes substitutions throughout the book for Paleo, grain-free, dairy-free, egg-free, and nut-free eating. Vegetarians and vegans won't find much to enjoy here, though, as all 26 weeks call for meat as a main component.
I can see this good habit actually continuing long past the pandemic. Though it's been hard to note any sort of savings on groceries just yet (we leave hefty tips on Instacart and are stocking up on kitchen pantry items) — I can easily see how this approach will eventually save not only time, but also money.
And that's music to this multitasking mom's ears.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This cookbook made me a big believer in meal prep — and it's getting my family of four through the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As a full-time freelancer for nearly 15 years and a mom to 4-year-old twins, I’ve become a master at multitasking, mostly out of necessity. At any given time, I’m juggling around six to eight clients and roughly the same amount of requests for snacks and cuddles – often simultaneously these days, thanks to the 24/7 togetherness of the COVID-19 crisis.
With this in mind, meal prepping always seemed like a logical solution, with its promise of efficiency and potential time and cost savings. But in reality, time (to grocery shop and cook a large portion of food) and desire has always eluded me. Plus, variety is the spice of life, and eating the same thing all week felt a little too “Groundhog Day” for my greedy palate.
Enter the 2020 quarantine, when suddenly I was spending more time in the kitchen than ever before. Maximizing our grocery haul and saving money became a priority. The crisis forced me to finally give meal prepping a try, and when a friend in my “moms of multiples” group suggested the “Cook Once, Eat All Week” cookbook by Cassy Joy Garcia, I was all-in.
Unlike other meal prep methods, Garcia streamlines and simplifies the process by using one “main” set of ingredients that can be used in up to five different meals throughout the week. There’s also a good range of cuisines represented, from Asian, Italian, Mexican, to Greek.
Each week calls for a different trifecta of main ingredients, like shredded pork-kale-plantains or ground beef-broccoli-potatoes combinations. According to Garcia, the three-ingredient lineups are intentionally chosen to include one protein, one veggie, and one starch; additionally, many of the same staples are used week to week, such as chicken or beef broth, extra-virgin olive oil, and various vinegars and spices.
This is when all ingredients are prepped and stored, but the actual meals are made gradually throughout the week utilizing the ready-to-use ingredients. These prep-and-cook sessions are short, sweet, and super easy to accomplish after a long workday.
This produced three meals: sweet-and-sour chicken chow mein, chicken souvlaki bowls, and chicken Tettrazini. Each week’s set of recipes also includes two “bonus dinners,” so I could have stretched this to five meals, but I figured it was best to start small.
All things considered, I spent about three hours prepping in the kitchen that Sunday morning, fueled by Diet Coke and a steady soundtrack of Prince and Michael Jackson. As the week progressed, my husband and I were happy to discover that each recipe tasted distinct and not similar to each other (and chicken tettrazini was our clear favorite!).
Even my 4-year-old son – whose diet mostly consists of chicken nuggets and sweet potato dinosaurs – has been getting in on the action and loving it. My daughter, however, remains committed to her regimen of string cheese and Cutie oranges.
We were also relieved to discover more recipes that meet our individual dietary needs – my husband is full keto and low-carb, while I have celiac disease and eat strictly gluten-free.
All of Garcia’s recipes are gluten free, and she includes substitutions throughout the book for Paleo, grain-free, dairy-free, egg-free, and nut-free eating. Vegetarians and vegans won’t find much to enjoy here, though, as all 26 weeks call for meat as a main component.
I can see this good habit actually continuing long past the pandemic. Though it’s been hard to note any sort of savings on groceries just yet (we leave hefty tips on Instacart and are stocking up on kitchen pantry items) – I can easily see how this approach will eventually save not only time, but also money.
And that’s music to this multitasking mom’s ears.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Researchers studying power of prayer in coronavirus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Can you pray the coronavirus away?
A new scientific study is examining the power of prayer in those fighting for their lives from COVID-19 — testing for “true supernatural intervention,” according to a report.
The Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute is testing 1,000 patients in intensive care with the contagion — with half getting a “universal” prayer offered in five denominational forms.
The four-month study will then compare death rates as well as time in ICU and on ventilators.
“We all believe in science, and we also believe in faith,” the study’s lead investigator, cardiologist Dr. Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy, told NPR.
“If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question.”
He stressed, “It has to be a true supernatural intervention.”
Lakkireddy admitted that even his own wife, a fellow physician, is “skeptical.”
“But it’s not like we’re putting anyone at risk,” he told NPR. “A miracle could happen. There’s always hope, right?”
The study is formally investigating “the role of remote intercessory multi-denominational prayer on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients,” according to its listing on the National Institutes of Health. The prayer is offered in variations for Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism.
“I believe in the power of all religions,” Lakkireddy told NPR.
“I think if we believe in the wonders of God and the universal good of any religion, then we’ve got to combine hands and join the forces of each of these faiths together for the single cause of saving humanity from this pandemic.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian-American physician launches study to find if prayers could heal Covid patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kansas City: An Indian-American physician in Kansas City has begun a study to find if something called remote intercessory prayer might initiate God to heal those infected with the coronavirus.
Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy launched the four-month prayer study on Friday, which involves 1,000 coronavirus patients who are in intensive care.
 
In the study, none of the patients' prescribed standard care will be changed. They will be divided in two groups of 500 each and prayers will be offered for one of the groups.
Also, neither group will be informed about the prayers.
The four-month study will investigate "the role of remote intercessory multi-denominational prayer on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients," according to a description provided to the National Institutes of Health.
Half of the patients, randomly chosen, will receive a "universal" prayer offered in five denominational forms -- Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism -- while the other patients will constitute the control group.
All the patients will receive the standard of care prescribed by their medical providers and Lakkireddy has assembled a steering committee of medical professionals to oversee the study.
"We all believe in science, and we also believe in faith," Lakkireddy said.
"If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question," he said.
The investigators will assess how long the patients remain on ventilators, how many suffer from organ failure, how quickly they are released from intensive care and how many die, Lakkireddy said.
He describes himself as "born into Hinduism," but said he also attended a Catholic school and had spent time in synagogues, Buddhist monasteries, and mosques.
The physician said he cannot explain how people praying remotely for someone they don't know (or a group of people,) could actually make a difference in their health outcomes, and acknowledged that some of his medical colleagues have had "a mixed reaction" to his study proposal.
Lakkireddy said he has no idea what he will find, "but it's not like we're putting anyone at risk. A miracle could happen. There's always hope, right?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can You Pray Coronavirus Away? A New Clinical Study Is Underway</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As researchers race to find an effective treatment or vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus, a new study is underway to determine if the power of prayer helps heal ICU patients sickened with the virus.
Cardiologist Dr. Dhanunjaya “DJ” Lakkireddy, Medical Director of the Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute, recently announced a Covid Prayer Study, described as “the first global, multinational, multilingual double blinded randomized control study” to find out if remote intercessory prayer improves patient outcomes.
The four-month study, launched on May 1, will enroll 1,000 COVID-19 ICU patients with half receiving a daily “universal” prayer from five different religions: Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. The standard of medical care will remain the same for both groups.
Participating institutions can enroll virus-sickened adults from all over the world. To protect patient privacy, each participant is identified by a unique COVID PRAYER STUDY identification (CPS-ID).
Assessments will be performed daily on each participant to assess organ health and need for ventilators. The study will continue until the patient is transferred out of ICU or dies.
This isn’t the first time the power of prayer has been studied in relationship to patient healing. Dr. Lakkireddy’s study information references cite previous limited clinical trials focusing on prayer. While some of those recorded minimal improvement, other past studies revealed “no scientifically discernable effects” for intercessory prayer for healing.
In a recent interview, Dr. Lakkireddy said he understands some people will respond to the study with skepticism, but added “It’s not like we are putting anyone at risk. A miracle could happen. There’s always hope, right?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nurse closing in on retirement dies with coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A nurse has died with coronavirus after spending nearly 40 years in the job.
Philomina Cherian, 63, died on April 30 at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where she also worked as a staff nurse.
Ms Cherian was married and had three children and, according to her family, she was planning to retire in a couple of years’ time.
“She was a great human being, a caring mother and wife,” her husband Joseph Varkey said.
“She was a dedicated nurse. For her, nursing was not just a profession but it was her passion.
“She would have lived for so many years and enjoyed her well-deserved retired life if she was not affected by Covid.”
A statement from Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) said of Ms Cherian: “She was a popular and hugely valued member of our OUH nursing family who will be sorely missed by her colleagues as well as by her family and friends.”
Sam Foster, chief nursing officer, said: “I wanted to express that at this very sad time our thoughts are with the family of Philomina, as well as with her friends and colleagues throughout the Trust.
“She was an incredibly caring friend and colleague who will be terribly missed by us all.
“Many of you will have known her and worked closely with her and I ask you to remember how she wonderfully cared for her patients and her colleagues, acting as an exemplar nurse to all who met her.
“Philomina was cared for with the utmost love, care and attention and we would like to thank all staff who were involved in her care.”
A fundraising page has been set up to help cover the costs of Ms Cherian’s memorial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Family files complaint after 81-year-old dies at Minn. care facility overwhelmed by coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO/CNN) - The family of an 81-year-old Minnesota man, who died after testing positive for coronavirus, has filed a complaint against his long-term care facility, where roughly half of residents have been infected with COVID-19.
Michelle Krone never thought she would say goodbye to her 81-year-old father, Robert Krone, while draped in personal protective equipment, but she received a call April 23 from St. Therese of New Hope, the long-term care facility where he lived, telling her he was terminal.
When Michelle Krone and her mother, Margaret Krone, went to the care facility, it was the first time they had seen her father in weeks. It took him about 35 minutes to recognize them, but once he did, Michelle Krone says they “started feeding him and just held his hands.”
Robert Krone died eight days after his family found out he had COVID-19.
“We were able to hold his hand and tell him how much we loved him and appreciated the sacrifices and how he was a good father,” Michelle Krone said.
St. Therese announced Wednesday that roughly half the residents at the facility had been infected with COVID-19. A day later, it announced 47 residents had died.
The Krone family says they have filed a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Health against the facility, citing lack of communication with families and concerns over lack of PPE and proper staffing.
On March 12, more than a month before Robert Krone’s diagnosis, the care facility stopped allowing in-person visits. Michelle Krone says the next facility-wide update came April 23, telling families that COVID-19 was making its way through the center.
“We wanted to know – and this was before his diagnosis – how bad was it: do we need to take him out of the facility and bring him home?” she said.
The facility says they never violated the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though MDH did not find problems during an April 1 survey, they have said they will investigate complaints.
Margaret Krone is now showing symptoms and waiting for COVID-19 test results. Michelle Krone was tested, too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Filipino expat in Dubai survives after 16 days on a ventilator</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Rhea Almazan Pangilinan, 37, couldn’t hold back the tears rolling down her cheeks. Despite trying hard, she broke down several times opening up about the poignant experience of her family fighting COVID-19. From what looked like a mild infection, her husband went into ICU, had to be intubated and fought for his life on the ventilator for nearly 16 days.
She and her husband, Angelito B Pangilinan Jr., 38, had tested positive for COVID-19 in early April, while their seven-year-old daughter stayed separate at home with the nanny. The Pangilinans have been Dubai residents for 13-years and this was a true trial by fire for the family.
Theirs was a classic case of community transmission of the virus as couple has no clue how they contracted the virus. Ever since the outbreak, they had exercised extra caution and never ventured out except for work. “Angelito never even took public transport. He used to drive to work. It was I who used to take the metro,” Rhea told Gulf News.
By the third week of March, it was Angelito who began to look indisposed. “It all started with my husband who showed signs of illness at first. He had a sore throat. But was hesitant to go to a hospital. In a few days, he manifested more symptoms. I asked him to consult a doctor then.”
Pangilan Jr went to VPS Medeor Hospital on March 30, a week after he had started showing symptoms. His tests were carried out and his results came positive on April 4. However doctors saw he displayed all symtoms of pneumonia, fever, shortness of breath and started his treatment even before the results came in. Rhea said: “On the day of admission, his condition had worsened, he had difficulty in breathing so had to be given oxygen support.”
Rhea could not be in hospital with her husband as she was isolated at home. Within a day of admission, Angelito’s condition rapidly worsened. “The next day, I got a call from the hospital that they are intubating him. I was scared. I spoke to the doctor who informed that Angelito’s lungs had been severely infected. Both his lungs were affected by pneumonia,” said Rhea, who monitored the progress of her husband in the ICU, speaking to doctors. “It was the toughest challenge we faced, with no idea what was going to happen. I felt very vulnerable,“ recounted Rhea.
“I knew Angelito was on ventilator support. But I always texted him to be strong and brave. I couldn’t do anything else. But I was astonished to see how brave my child was,” she added.
In the meantime, Rhea was sure she would test positive too, although she had no symptoms, but prayed to God to spare her daughter. “I was informed that the chances for us to get infected were high. The results came after a few days. As I had prayed, only I was tested positive. During the period, I was very cautious and never touched my child. I also reconfirmed the test of my child by giving her samples for the second time,” said Rhea who was in home isolation as she suffered no major symptoms. The couple had followed smart precautions from March itself when Angelito had fallen ill and practised isolation.
Just seven-years-old, Ayah Pauline Pangilinan has shown immense courage and behaved with maturity. “She never cried knowing papa and mama were ill. She understood that I couldn’t touch her. So, she would come near me and act like hugging me. I would also do the same. She also wrote notes asking me to stay strong and eat healthy food. She prayed in the morning and night kneeling on her bed.”
Rhea recollected a shocking experience when Ayah asked her whether Angelito would die. “She asked this straight to my face. But then she told me why I am worried when there is God to protect us. I was overwhelmed with joy,” she said.
In the meantime doctors continued to treat Panigilinan Jr, even as he was on ventilator following the international protocol of administering anti-virals and antibiotics for over a fortnight. Eventually on day 16 they were able to wean him off the ventilator and he continued to fight for life until he gained strength and showed signs of recovery. On day 16 Angelito was shifted to the room. However Rhea recalls a frightening realisation. “I was extremely happy. But he behaved as if he had a memory loss. It was frightening. He asked me why I am sending messages while at work. It took him about five days to get back to him normal sense. The doctor said it was normal as he had spent a long time on the ventilator,” she added.
On April 29, when his final swab for the virus came negative, he was discharged and was reunited with his family. He continues his 14 day isolation at home taking care to not touch his family.
Discharged from the hospital, Angelito told Gulf News he was very happy and thanked doctors and nurses at VPS Medeor Hospital for taking care of him. “I am extremely grateful to them for saving my life,” he added.
The little one, Ayah is also happy as papa and mama have become negative. “All in our family have tested negative, so we are all healthy!” she happily exclaimed.
Rhea thanked doctors and nurses for their selfless care and support. “I knew how hard it would have been managing Angelito during those days. Even in my case, they were very supportive. They used to call me every day to check my well-being while in isolation. Their support has been tremendous and invaluable,” she said adding that she would also like to thank to our family, friends and colleagues for their support. Rhea and Angelito are now helping others in their community and friend circles to cope up with stress of COVID-19 and educating them about how to stay safe.
“Family and friends are really precious in one’s life. During these times, it would not have been possible for us to tide over the crisis without the unconditional support from her close circle,” said Angelito. “In hospital I often thought, what if I die of this illness. My close ones will not even be able to see me. I truly treasure my family and friends more than ever now,” he added.
Dr Saheer Sainalabdeen
Dr Saheer Sainalabdeen, specialist respiratory medicine at VPS Medeor Hospital, told Gulf News that he and his collegaues Dr Vishnu Chaitanya Swaroop Sura and Dr Abdul Aneez were extremely relieved that they Angelito had shown an amazing reversal in 16 days and finally tested negative. Explaining the treatment protocol followed, he said, “Initially the patient was put on oxygen support, but when his oxygen requirement increased and he could hardly breathe independently, we moved him to a ventilator. Ths was followed with a lung-protective ventilation strategy. He was administered Hydroxychloroquinine, antibiotics, antivirals as per the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) treatment protocol, along with supportive care and we are so happy to see him back with his family.
Dr Sainalabdeen added: “I will cherish the recovery of Angelito for my lifetime. Through Angelito’s recovery, we would like to stress that there is no need to panic. Even critical cases like that of Angelito’s can be cured following the DHA treatment protocol.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sad story of nurse who died of coronavirus, 2 years before retirement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A mother-of-three nurse has died of coronavirus just two years before retirement after spending nearly 40 years in the job.
Indian-born Philomina Cherian, 63, died at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on Thursday, where she also worked as a nurse, Daily Mail reports.
Ms Cherian was married and had three children. According to her family, she was planning to retire in a couple of years.
Her husband Joseph Varkey called her a ‘great human being, a caring mother and wife’, adding: ‘Nursing was not just a profession but it was her passion.’
A statement from Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) said of Ms Cherian: ‘She was a popular and hugely valued member of our OUH nursing family who will be sorely missed by her colleagues as well as by her family and friends.’
Sam Foster, chief nursing officer, called her ‘an incredibly caring friend and colleague who will be terrible missed by us all’. He said: ‘I wanted to express that at this very sad time our thoughts are with the family of Philomina, as well as with her friends and colleagues throughout the Trust. 
‘Many of you will have known her and worked closely with her and I ask you to remember how she wonderfully cared for her patients and her colleagues, acting as an exemplar nurse to all who met her. Philomina was cared for with the utmost love, care and attention’.
Her death has been announced after the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that another 621 Covid-associated deaths have been recorded.
Officials also recorded another 4,806 cases, with more than 180,000 Britons having now been infected since the crisis hit the UK in February. A lack of testing means potentially millions of cases have been missed
Daily surveillance figures released each day by DHSC are deaths across the UK where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. The deaths do not account for deaths outside of hospitals, and are not officially registered.
All figures are provided daily to NHS England by individual hospitals. The data are only published once the confirmed families have been notified of the deaths.
Weekly figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are Covid-registered deaths across England and Wales. They include any place of death.
Data comprise deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate. They may include cases where doctors completing a certificate diagnosed coronavirus in a patient based on relevant symptoms, but where no test occurred.
The figures include cases where a death certificate lists coronavirus (Covid-19) – either tested or suspected – as well as ‘Influenza and Pneumonia’.  Where both are present, Covid-19 is listed as the presumed or probable cause of death.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What we can all learn from the 100-year-old super survivors who caught coronavirus - and lived</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The odds were stacked against 100-year-old Elsie Kelsall. Three weeks ago, the great-great-grandmother from Staffordshire was taken to hospital with a high temperature and mild cough – both symptoms of Covid-19. 
Two days later, her family's worst fears were confirmed when tests came back positive.
Her fate, they thought, was sealed. About 90 per cent of those who die from this disease are over 65. But, amazingly, after just 12 days of treatment, Elsie was discharged.
Even more remarkably, her condition remained stable throughout and there was no need for significant medical intervention, let alone a stint in intensive care.
As Elsie left Haywood Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent in a wheelchair and with a blanket around her knees, dozens of NHS staff formed a guard of honour to clap and cheer as she passed by. 
Now, living at home with the support of carers, Elsie is tired but well on the road to recovery.
'My mother is a survivor,' says her 76-year-old son, Malcolm Kelsall, who runs an engineering business. 'It seems as if she has flown through the illness. She had a high temperature and a little bit of a cough, but nothing severe. It's amazing really – with some people it knocks them for six.'
The lockdown isn’t all bad news – more than half of Britons have noticed the air outside is cleaner as a result
Amid a barrage of bad news and gloomy headlines, more heart-warming stories have emerged of centenarians who have defied the odds. 
At 106, Connie Titchen, from Birmingham, is the oldest known person in Britain to have survived Covid-19.
The great-grandmother-of-eight, who has lived through both world wars and the Spanish flu pandemic which killed millions, was admitted to hospital with suspected pneumonia in mid-March. 
She tested positive for Covid-19, but after just three weeks she had made a full recovery.
Keith Watson, 101, from Worcestershire, also overcame the illness after a fall at his care home landed him in hospital. And, in the Netherlands, 107-year-old Cornelia Ras is believed to be the oldest in the world to have survived the virus. She suffered only very minor symptoms.
It's certainly a curious pattern. All the evidence suggests the biggest risk factor for death by Covid-19 is age.
Yet some emerge perfectly healthy. So just how has this select group – dubbed the super-survivors – pulled through?
'It's wonderful that some people have beaten the odds of their age group,' says Sarah Harper, professor of gerontology at Oxford University. 'But it was not unexpected that we would have survivors of every age. Some people in their 80s, 90s and 100s have a physical or psychological advantage over the majority of those their age.
'This can be due to genetics, their environment, lifestyle – or sometimes just luck.'
The answer – among those aged beyond 100, at least – may lie in having a genetically superior immune system. 'We can speculate that these special older, and very old people, have a particular genetic make-up that contributes to a healthy immune system,' says Prof Harper.
'It's feasible that the way their immune system is responding to Covid-19 is much more similar to that of a younger person.'
According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, more than a third of Covid-19 deaths have occurred in people over the age of 85.
'In general, our immune systems become slower and less effective at fighting off infections as we age,' says Professor Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology. 'This applies to viruses our body has seen before, like chickenpox, and newer ones, such as the coronavirus.'
In younger people, when new pathogens or viruses enter the body, the immune system releases white blood cells to find and destroy them. But in older people, the immune system is less able to recognise threats. Even if it does respond, the white blood cells are less effective at stopping the disease from taking hold.
Another reason why older people bear the brunt of coronavirus is that they are much more likely to have underlying health conditions. Diabetes and heart disease, for instance, make patients far more vulnerable to severe illness caused by Covid-19.
Why do some people bounce back so quickly after the illness, while others spend weeks bed-bound? The answer could lie in the amount of virus an individual is exposed to.
‘People who get a small amount of virus – from a handshake, or something like that – may get sick for a while and then recover,’ Professor Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology, explains. ‘So in the case of hospital workers, who are continuously exposed to a large amount of virus, it’s likely their recovery period will be longer.’
Many patients will suffer fatigue in the weeks after their illness – this is because the immune system’s extreme response will have depleted energy levels.
As Covid-19 is a respiratory illness, the lungs in particular may take some time before they are back to full health. ‘If you listen to people who’ve had the infection, they may sound as if they are breathing very heavily, even after the virus has left the body,’ says Prof Akbar.
‘The damage has already been done – there may even be scarring in the lungs as a result of the infection.
‘It will take some people a long time to recover from that. It’s not clear yet whether you could in fact be left with these difficulties for the rest of your life.’
But having healthy lungs beforehand is likely to limit the damage – and speed up the recovery time.
Evidence suggests that smokers are less able to fight the infection and will therefore face a longer recovery period.
Even so, some older people have proved exceptions to the rule. Early in the outbreak, Health Minister Nadine Dorries contracted Covid-19 and passed it on to her 84-year-old mother, who suffers a heart condition. Both recovered, but it was Nadine, despite being more than 20 years younger, who suffered most.
As Prof Akbar explains that when it comes to ageing, everyone is different. 'Some older people are still out there cycling, jogging and running, whereas others who are younger, in their 50s even, are almost bed-ridden,' he says.
'Not everyone ages at the same rate – and there is not a fixed point where you start going downhill. Some people start that process earlier and some people later.'
However, when it comes to the very elderly, it's much more likely that the secret to surviving Covid-19 lies with their genetics. 'There's something in their genes that makes them more resilient than other people,' says Prof Akbar. 'It means they are more likely to be able to fight off an infection such as this.'
According to the latest estimates, there are about 13,000 centenarians in the UK, of whom 800 are aged over 105.
'The over-105-year-olds tend to be much, much healthier – not only than their own cohort, but than people who are ten or even 20 years younger,' says Prof Harper. 
'They seem to have very little cancer, very little cardiac disease, very low levels of diabetes, and we think they may have better physical and cognitive function generally too.' 
Dozens of studies support this. One published in the Journal Of Gerontology in 2017 compared the final six years of life in people over the age of 100 with others who died in their 80s or 90s. 
The German researchers found that, on average, the centenarians suffered from fewer diseases throughout life than their younger counterparts.
The increase in the number of conditions normally experienced in the last few years of life was also less marked in centenarians.
Coronavirus survivor Elsie Kelsall is one such example, having lived for most of her 100 years without any underlying health problems. 'Her short-term memory is not what it used to be, but she remembers things from 50, 60, 70 years ago no problem,' says her son Malcolm.
Separate research in Okinawa, Japan – a country that's known for the longevity of its inhabitants – examined the health of 12 people aged 110 or over.
The researchers found they had little history of cardiovascular disease and no cancer or diabetes. The onset of chronic diseases and disabilities was also significantly delayed, often to beyond their 100th birthday.
Experts believe this evidence supports the idea that some people have a so-called 'healthy ageing phenotype' – a set of special genetic and lifestyle characteristics which helps them evade illness and disease, even in old age. But, as yet, scientists don't fully understand it or why it occurs in the people it does.
And they are yet to isolate a specific gene responsible for these extraordinary traits.
Yet some suggest that the 'healthy ageing phenotype' could help support an unusually robust immune system.
Ground-vibration sensors in UK cities have recorded falls in human-generated noise of up to half since the lockdown began.
'We now understand that just as our immune system fights infectious diseases, it is also involved in fighting chronic diseases such as cancer,' says Prof Harper.
'It may be that the immune systems of these very special older adults are also able to fight off an acute infection like Covid-19.'
However, genetics do not explain the whole picture.
Last month, Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation's regional director for Europe, stressed the importance of baseline fitness for overcoming the virus for all ages.
'It is becoming clearer that the healthier you were before the pandemic plays a crucial role,' Dr Kluge said. 'People who age healthily are less at risk.'
It is an idea echoed by Sir Muir Gray, professor of primary healthcare at Oxford University and director of the Optimal Ageing Programme.
'People who are 90 or 100 vary in more ways than they are similar,' he says. 'So you have always got to be cautious when looking at chronological age alone.
'There are four main factors which affect our health as we live longer – and each of these could have a part to play, whether we are dealing with cancer, heart disease or Covid-19.'
The first, he says, is the normal, biological process of ageing, which is influenced by genetics. The second is loss of fitness.
'In studies of people over the age of 100, physical activity is one of the main things that seems to mark them out from the rest,' he says.
A study of more than 300 Dutch centenarians, published in the European Journal Of Epidemiology, found that almost half needed just a minimum amount of help with daily tasks, while a third were fully independent. Elsie has always been active, working in a factory well into her 60s, according to her son.
'She's a bit frail now, but up until her 90s I used to walk with her to fetch a newspaper,' he says.
'In the past three or four years she's got a bit unsteady on her feet, but she still walks up and down the house.'
The third factor is illnesses such as lung and heart disease – often caused by lifestyle factors such as smoking and poor diet, which may be preventable.
The fourth, Sir Muir says, is belief and attitudes, with research suggesting that maintaining a sense of purpose in later life could help people resist disease and recover. He adds: 'The biological process of ageing appears to be relatively less important than fitness, acquired disease and mental attitude.'
And with millions of older people stuck at home as a result of the pandemic, there has never been a more pressing time to be active. Failing to do so could increase the risk of frailty, and make individuals more vulnerable to illnesses, including Covid-19.
Keeping moving, Sir Muir says, is key.
'Try 15 minutes walking on the spot every day,' he suggests. 'Hold on to the back of a chair if you feel a bit unsteady. I'm 75 and I've just bought a home bicycle – I'm cycling 20 minutes a day. Stairs are also very good.'
But most importantly, he adds, remember that 'you are never too old. In fact, the older you are, the more important this becomes'.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 104-year-old Brooklyn woman who lived through the Spanish flu and once had stage 4 melanoma just recovered from the coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 104-year-old woman in New York is recovering from COVID-19, and her nursing home is calling it a “miracle.”
Ida Acconciamessa, who lives at the Sheepshead Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre in Brooklyn, tested positive for COVID-19 on April 4. She was given oxygen, was very weak, and wasn’t eating, according to CBS News. And now, nearly a month later, she’s talking, eating, and recovering from the virus.
Her daughter, Barbara Senese, said her mother isn’t a stranger to health hardships. She said Acconciamessa lived through the Spanish flu, has had two broken hips, survived stage 4 melanoma, and now, COVID-19.
“She always used to say, ‘I was born under a lucky star.’ That was her mantra in life. And you know what? To be able to get through this virus, those words often come to my mind,” Senese told CBS News.
Senese said that she and her sister, Johann Giordano, used to visit their mother almost every day, but the coronavirus pandemic changed how they visited. They couldn’t go inside her nursing home, so they would meet their mother by her first-floor window, wearing masks and gloves. They last saw her at the window on March 26 and were concerned with her health.
“They brought her to us in a wheelchair by the window. The window was open just a tiny bit so she could hear our voices,” Senese said. “She didn’t move a muscle and she stared at us. Just a stare. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that – ever. We were begging her for 10 to 15 minutes to say something. She said nothing. When we walked away, I said to my sister, ‘She’s sick. She has the virus.'”
The family feared she wouldn’t recover from COVID-19 because she was already recovering from a fractured hip and c. difficile, another infection, but now nursing home staff say she’s on the up and up.
Staff at Sheepshead Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre called Acconciamessa on April 24 to say she was recovering from the virus.
“At 104 years, I think it’s a miracle to survive through COVID,” said Marco Perrone, the Nursing Administration Supervisor at the facility told CBS News. “We have people 40, 50 years old, passing due to COVID. So, 104 years old it’s amazing she was able to survive through this.“

Ida Acconciamessa, who lives at the Sheepshead Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Brooklyn, tested positive for COVID-19 on April 4. She was given oxygen, was very weak, and wasn’t eating, according to CBS News. And now, nearly a month later, she’s talking, eating, and recovering from the virus.
Her daughter, Barbara Senese, said her mother isn’t a stranger to health hardships. She said Acconciamessa lived through the Spanish flu, has had two broken hips, survived stage 4 melanoma, and now, COVID-19.
“She always used to say, ‘I was born under a lucky star.’ That was her mantra in life. And you know what? To be able to get through this virus, those words often come to my mind,” Senese told CBS News.
Senese said that she and her sister, Johann Giordano, used to visit their mother almost every day, but the coronavirus pandemic changed how they visited. They couldn’t go inside her nursing home, so they would meet their mother by her first-floor window, wearing masks and gloves. They last saw her at the window on March 26 and were concerned with her health.
“They brought her to us in a wheelchair by the window. The window was open just a tiny bit so she could hear our voices,” Senese said. “She didn’t move a muscle and she stared at us. Just a stare. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that – ever. We were begging her for 10 to 15 minutes to say something. She said nothing. When we walked away, I said to my sister, ‘She’s sick. She has the virus.'”
The family feared she wouldn’t recover from COVID-19 because she was already recovering from a fractured hip and c. difficile, another infection, but now nursing home staff say she’s on the up and up.
Staff at Sheepshead Nursing and Rehabilitation Center called Acconciamessa on April 24 to say she was recovering from the virus.
“At 104 years, I think it’s a miracle to survive through COVID,” said Marco Perrone, the Nursing Administration Supervisor at the facility told CBS News. “We have people 40, 50 years old, passing due to COVID. So, 104 years old it’s amazing she was able to survive through this.“

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nurse closing in on retirement dies with coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Philomina Cherian died on April 30.
A nurse has died with coronavirus after spending nearly 40 years in the job.
Philomina Cherian, 63, died on April 30 at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where she also worked as a staff nurse.
Ms Cherian was married and had three children and, according to her family, she was planning to retire in a couple of years’ time.
“She was a great human being, a caring mother and wife,” her husband Joseph Varkey said.
“She was a dedicated nurse. For her, nursing was not just a profession but it was her passion.
“She would have lived for so many years and enjoyed her well-deserved retired life if she was not affected by Covid.”
Ms Cherian, originally from Kerala in India, worked as a nurse in Saudi Arabia before moving to the UK.
A statement from Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) said of Ms Cherian: “She was a popular and hugely valued member of our OUH nursing family who will be sorely missed by her colleagues as well as by her family and friends.”
Sam Foster, chief nursing officer, said: “I wanted to express that at this very sad time our thoughts are with the family of Philomina, as well as with her friends and colleagues throughout the Trust.
“She was an incredibly caring friend and colleague who will be terribly missed by us all.
“Many of you will have known her and worked closely with her and I ask you to remember how she wonderfully cared for her patients and her colleagues, acting as an exemplar nurse to all who met her.
“Philomina was cared for with the utmost love, care and attention and we would like to thank all staff who were involved in her care.”
A fundraising page has been set up to help cover the costs of Ms Cherian’s memorial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NYC’s only public school nurse killed by coronavirus caught it at work, brother says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the coronavirus spread in early March, Marilyn Howard worked side-by-side at Spring Street Community School in Brooklyn with a fellow nurse who came in with a fever and bad cough because she had run out of paid sick days.
Howard, 53, started feeling sick that weekend, when Mayor de Blasio finally decided to close schools for students. She tested positive for COVID-19, and collapsed on April 4 at the peak of the pandemic.
“My sister didn’t have to die, her brother, Haslyn Howard, told The Post. “It was completely preventable.”
Howard is apparently the only school nurse killed by COVID-19, but the city Department of Education has never counted her among its dead.
The DOE said it has lost 68 employees as of April 24 due to the coronavirus. While assigned to the East New York middle-high school, Howard was paid by the city Health Department.
“She loved being a school nurse,” Haslyn said. “She got to help kids day in and day out, and she was good at it.”
Howard was also a doting aunt to eight nieces and nephews. “She was at everyone’s graduation, everyone’s birthday. Every significant moment she would turn up,” her brother said.
She emigrated from Guyana with her parents in 1981 at age 14 and helped care for four younger brothers. She first went to college at age 35, earned a Master’s degree, and recently enrolled in Long Island University to become a nurse practitioner.
Howard started feeling sick on March 14, a day after classes ended. On March 15, de Blasio announced he would close schools. It was too late for Howard.
Because Howard was a nurse, she was tested for COVID-19 on March 16. It took 10 days to receive the dreaded results. By then, however, she felt better and seemed to be recovering, Haslyn said.
But the following week, she worsened. On April 4, she woke up in her Queens apartment with tightness on her chest and “couldn’t catch her breath,” Haslyn said.
Her brother Nigel, who was caring for Howard, called 911. But the ambulance response was so slow, due to overwhelming demand, he decided to drive his sister to Northwell Hospital in Valley Stream, six miles away.
She passed out 30 seconds before arriving at the hospital, where she was given CPR, to no avail.
The school nurse who worked with Howard was out sick for several weeks. An aide in the office was hospitalized, her brother said.
“I’m angry that the system failed my sister and potentially many others because the schools remained open despite the imminent threat,” Haslyn said. “We are fairly confident she got this as a result of being at school without protection.”
Howard’s family gathered to mourn Howard via Zoom. More than 250 friends and relatives logged in to honor her memory. They are now raising a memorial fund to support health-care workers fighting COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche wins U.S. nod for COVID-19 antibody test, aims to boost output</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Roche (ROG.S) has won emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to determine whether people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said on Sunday.
Thomas Schinecker, Roche’s head of diagnostics, said the company aims to more than double production of tests from about 50 million a month to significantly more than 100 million a month by the end of the year.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests to learn who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to help end national lockdowns.
Basel-based Roche, which also makes molecular tests to identify active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test has a specificity rate exceeding 99.8% and sensitivity of 100%, meaning tests would show very few false positives and no false negatives.
A false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity. Roche said its test relies on intravenous blood draws, with higher accuracy than finger-prick tests.
“If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve ... when you take blood from the vein,” Schinecker said.
“You have to have very, very high specificity. Even 0.1% or 0.2% makes a difference.”
Similar antibody tests have also been developed by companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Becton Dickinson (BDX.N) and Italy’s DiaSorin (DIAS.MI).
Abbott has said the specificity and sensitivity of its test are 99.5% and 100% respectively. Diasorin has said its Liason XL test has 97.4% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity.
As demand escalates for antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established testing competency have also joined the experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
Roche did not disclose a price for its test but said that it would be identical worldwide.
Schinecker foresees a high need for testing healthcare workers and their families for exposure, and those who showed signs and symptoms, to see if they have antibodies.
While antibodies typically confer some immunity, Schinecker acknowledged that much remains to be learned about the novel coronavirus before drawing definitive conclusions.
“Since this virus is not well known, one can hypothesise, but the proof will take longer,” he said. “Testing these people ... is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roche Holding AG received emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20200503:nGNE71pdqt on Sunday.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests, to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies.
Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to “high double-digit millions” per month.
The Basel-based company, which also makes separate molecular tests to identify people with active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity rate of about 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%.
These rates help determine if a patient has been exposed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and if the patient has developed antibodies against it.
Other companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories , Becton Dickinson and Co, Italy’s DiaSorin have also developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
Diasorin and Abbott recently got U.S. emergency authorization for their tests.
Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand COVID-19, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity.
In developing its test, Roche scrutinized some existing products for reliability before rejecting them, its chief executive, Severin Schwan, had earlier said.
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result.
It declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies.
Roche has said its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the human body, suggesting possible immunity.
As demand escalates for blood antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established competency in medical testing have joined experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
The rush to obtain, advertise and find buyers for test kits follows the FDA’s decision to allow any company to sell antibody tests in the country without prior review by the agency.
This comes after the agency faced criticism that it did not act quickly enough with diagnostic tests.
FDA has said the aim of its policy is to provide laboratories and healthcare providers early access to the tests, but that it will adjust the approach as needed. (Reporting by Aakriti Bhalla in Bengaluru and John Miller in Zurich; Editing by Himani Sarkar)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roche gets FDA emergency use nod for COVID-19 antibody test</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Aakriti Bhalla and John Miller
(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG (S:ROG) received emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= on Sunday.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests, to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies.
Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to "high double-digit millions" per month.
The Basel-based company, which also makes separate molecular tests to identify people with active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity rate of about 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%.
These rates help determine if a patient has been exposed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and if the patient has developed antibodies against it.
Other companies including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories (N:ABT), Becton Dickinson and Co (N:BDX), Italy's DiaSorin (MI:DIAS) have also developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
Diasorin and Abbott recently got U.S. emergency authorization for their tests.
Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand COVID-19, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity.
In developing its test, Roche scrutinized some existing products for reliability before rejecting them, its chief executive, Severin Schwan, had earlier said.
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result.
It declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies.
Roche has said its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the human body, suggesting possible immunity.
As demand escalates for blood antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established competency in medical testing have joined experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
The rush to obtain, advertise and find buyers for test kits follows the FDA's decision to allow any company to sell antibody tests in the country without prior review by the agency.
This comes after the agency faced criticism that it did not act quickly enough with diagnostic tests.
FDA has said the aim of its policy is to provide laboratories and healthcare providers early access to the tests, but that it will adjust the approach as needed.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar described the results as ‘concerning’.
A third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan’s capital came back positive, health officials have said, raising fears of widespread undetected infections.
The results of the random tests in the Afghan capital of Kabul are “concerning”, Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar said.
Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far – close to 12,000, with more than 2,700 confirmed infections in a nation of 36.6 million.
As more testing becomes available, the country’s confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, Mr Mayar said, who  urged residents to stay at home.
Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread.
The death toll – officially at 85 – could also be much higher.
More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined.
Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of Covid-19.
Testing in Afghanistan has been sporadic and some of those infected have been hiding their symptoms, in part because of local stigma.
The Government has faced criticism for responding too slowly to the crisis.
Only recently, the Government started testing in western Herat province, where the hundreds of thousands of people have returned from Iran.

More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.
At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim.
The country’s health care system, devastated by four decades of war, is woefully unprepared for a major outbreak. It has only 400 ventilators.
The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.
Testing in Afghanistan has been sporadic and some of those infected have been hiding their symptoms, in part because of local stigma. In parts of the country, there have been reports of Covid-19 patients being shunned by their neighbours and even refused food from the local markets.

Afghanistan has two presidents, both of whom claim to have won last year’s election. American efforts to find a compromise have failed, causing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to threaten to cut $1 billion in aid.
The bickering has also delayed implementation of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed in February to allow Washington to end its longest military engagement, end Afghanistan’s decades of war and bring more than 12,000 U.S. soldiers home.
In Iran, authorities said Sunday that 47 people had died in the preceding 24-hour period, the lowest daily toll in two months. Still, Iran remains the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, with more than 97,000 cases and more than 6,200 deaths.
President Hassan Rouhani announced Sunday that schools and mosques would reopen in some low-risk locations. Schools and universities have been shut down since late February.
Also Sunday, the U.N. children’s agency urged six countries in the Middle East to green-light special polio and measles vaccination campaigns that were put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Currently, nearly 10.5 million children under the age of five are at risk of missing their polio vaccination, UNICEF said. Nearly 4.5 million children under the age of 15 could miss their measles vaccinations.
Routine vaccinations for other diseases such as rubella and diphtheria are continuing, but special campaigns for polio and measles were put on hold in some countries because health systems were overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic or governments wanted to avoid crowding at clinics.
The polio campaigns are on hold in Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq, while measles vaccinations are suspended in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Djibouti, the agency said.
In Israel, the city of Tel Aviv announced it is postponing its annual gay pride parade, along with those in the cities of Haifa, Jerusalem and Beersheba. The annual event in Tel Aviv, which was scheduled for early June, drew over 250,000 people in 2019, making it one of the largest in the Mideast.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Afghan Authorities Extend Isolation Regime in Large Cities for Another 20 Days, Reports Say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The Afghan authorities have extended the isolation regime in large cities, including in the capital of Kabul, for 20 days, until the end of the month of Ramadan amid the pandemic, the TOLOnews broadcaster reported on Saturday, citing the presidential administration.
According to the media outlet, universities will remain closed, and the domestic flights will remain suspended.
Meanwhile, Health Ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar said that doctors conducted express tests in 500 randomly selected people in Kabul. As a result, 260 of them tested positive and repeated testing showed that 60 percent of those were actually infected.
The Taliban* announced on 30 April the release of 20 Afghan soldiers in the northern province of Kunduz. The militant group said that they hoped to speed up the ongoing exchange of prisoners due to the coronavirus disease pandemic.
On Wednesday, the Afghan parliament suspended its operations for two weeks due to the ongoing health crisis.
So far, Afghanistan has registered 2,496 COVID-19 cases, 72 fatalities and 331 recoveries.
*The Taliban is a terrorist organisation outlawed in Russia and many other countries.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Looser COVID-19 rules mean more activity, but there may be some confusion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WINNIPEG -- People in some provinces will enjoy more freedom Monday as restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are loosened. But the change appears set to leave some workers looking for child care, some employers looking for workers, and many people trying to figure out a new regimen for going about their daily routine.
Manitoba is allowing many non-essential businesses, restaurant patios, museums, campgrounds and other facilities to reopen in one of the more aggressive restart-the-economy plans. At all venues, there will be rules in place to limit crowd gatherings and keep things sanitary in order to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Businesses that had been forced to close because of the pandemic learned last Wednesday, with just a few days notice, that they will be allowed to open at reduced capacity and with strict requirements for physical distancing between customers, hand sanitizer dispensers and more.
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said some of its members are worried their employees may not come back right away for a variety of reasons, such as fear of catching COVID-19 or because they cannot find child care with Manitoba's schools still closed.
"There's definitely going to be quite a few staff that are staying home and employers that are going to be having staff shortages," Jonathan Alward, the federation's director in Manitoba, said.
Some hair salons have said they will not open immediately because they need time to acquire enough hand sanitizer, masks and other gear. A small clothing boutique posted on social media that it was scrambling to find a way to ensure customer and worker safety in the narrow floor space.
There are also new rules at Manitoba campgrounds opening this week. One is that campers can use washrooms and outhouses, but they'll have to bring their own toilet paper from home.
Manitoba's conservation and climate minister, Sarah Guillemard, said there will be signage at park entrances to remind people of the rules, which also include 10-person limits on gatherings and a requirement to fill up at gas stations close to home instead of near the camp site.
"Social media will also be updated to help remind people, before they leave their home community, what they would do to prepare to go and enjoy the great outdoors," Guillemard said Friday.
Alberta started allowing golf courses to reopen on the weekend, and has told dentists, physiotherapists and other medical professionals they can start operating again Monday. Non-essential retail stores will begin to open May 14.
The Saskatchewan government is allowing dentists, optometrists and other medical providers to restart Monday, and is also opening fishing shoreline areas and boat launches.
Quebec is letting retail stores outside the Montreal area reopen Monday. Those in the Montreal area will have the right to operate a week later.
Ontario announced Friday that it would allow some largely outdoor-based businesses and workplaces to open up starting Monday, though with certain restrictions in place.
The province's reopening list includes garden centres for curbside pickup, lawn care and landscaping companies, auto dealerships by appointment, automatic and self-serve car washes, and a broad list of essential construction projects. Golf courses and marinas will be allowed to start to prep for the season, but not yet open to the public.
Back in Manitoba, restaurant patios will also be allowed to operate as of Monday, although at reduced capacity.
The province's chief public health officer said the aim of the province's reopening plan is not just about the economy -- it's also about letting people resume parts of their normal lives and connect with others while still protecting them from the spread of COVID-19.
"We need to still be cautious about this virus, but at the same time, we realize we have to start reopening things," Dr. Brent Roussin said at his daily briefing Friday.
"This virus isn't the only thing that affects people's health."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Temperatures to tumble dramatically in Northeast during first full week of May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After the first weekend of May provided a quick break from chilly air dominating the Northeast, the start of the workweek will send temperatures tumbling once again.
While April left much to be desired for warm weather fans across the region, temperatures rebounded on Saturday. Afternoon highs topped out from the upper 50s in northern Maine, to the lower 70s in southern Pennsylvania and Maryland.
"After ending the month of April an average of 3.5 degrees cooler than normal, Boston soared to 70 on Saturday, which is actually 8 degrees above normal for early May," AccuWeather Meteorologist Mary Gilbert said.
Sunday will feature temperatures 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit higher on average than the previous day in some locations across the Northeast.
As some residents look to take advantage of another pleasant day outdoors, others will have to find time between bouts of wet weather.
A storm system that brought showers and thunderstorms to the region on Saturday night will persist over New England and creep into the mid-Atlantic.
As the storm continues to move away from the northeastern United States on Monday, winds will turn out of the northwest and a cooler air mass will move in.
Warm weather forecast to finish out the weekend will be replaced by afternoon temperatures 10-20 degrees lower to start the workweek.
On Monday, high temperatures along coastal areas will linger in the 60s, but interior locations will struggle to climb out of the 50s.
By Tuesday, most locations can expect temperatures in the 50s. However, temperatures from southern Pennsylvania to Connecticut, will once again climb into the low 60s.
High elevations in New England will be limited to the 40s each day.
Residents from Boston to New York City, Philadelphia and Detroit looking for a quick return to warmth will be disappointed.
The dip in the jet stream will remain over the northeastern U.S. This will keep chilly conditions over the region and the storm track over the Southeast and mid-Atlantic.
Even colder air will settle over the Northeast into the end of the week, dropping temperatures to around 10-15 degrees below normal for the beginning of May.
Average temperatures at the beginning of May range from the upper 50s in northern New England to the lower 70s around D.C.
"Those in the Northeast feeling a bit stir-crazy under COVID-19 stay-at-home orders will want to grab a jacket if heading outside, while following proper social distancing protocols," Gilbert said.
AccuWeather's long-range team expects several more bouts of cooler-than-average air to sweep into the Northeast every few days into the middle of May. Those hoping for hot weather may have to wait until the calendar is fully into the summer months.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Temperatures fall 7 to 10 degrees below average in parts of Queensland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The cold snap affecting much of Queensland is expected to hang around for another morning or two, with the mercury predicted to sink close to or even below freezing in some parts on Monday.
The Sunshine Coast was seven degrees below the May average overnight while the Wide Bay region experienced conditions from 7 to 10 degrees below average.
Thangool on the Capricornia coast, about 120 kilometres south of Rockhampton, was the coolest spot in the state overnight, at just 3.6 degrees.
On Saturday morning, the temperature in Oakey, west of Toowoomba, had fallen to minus 0.4 degrees and Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, broke the freezing barrier with minus 0.1.
Weather bureau senior meteorologist Gabriel Branescu said the weather should warm up from Tuesday and Wednesday in coastal areas.
He said inland parts should get relief from Thursday to Saturday but not before a return to possible freezing temperatures near Stanthorpe and the Darling Downs on Monday.
"We have a slow-moving high-pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directing the really dry and cool air mass directly across the state," he said.
“Temperatures will start to moderate from Tuesday and Wednesday next week as the winds will tend more easterly and bring in more moisture from the ocean.
"We’re expecting the minimum temperatures to stay about 13 or 14 degrees in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, around 11 or 12 degrees in the Gold Coast area.
"Cool temperatures will remain inland for another two or three mornings until the warmer and more moist air mass will make its way to the Northern Territory border later next week."
During the early hours of Sunday, Kingaroy, in the Wide Bay and Burnett region, hit a low of 4 degrees while Gayndah and Maryborough reached 5.6.
In the south-eastern corner, Greenbank in Logan recorded just 5.9 degrees overnight, Beaudesert experienced 6.8 and the Sunshine Coast Airport dropped to 7.
In the Darling Downs and Granite Belt, Applethorpe recorded 7.7 degrees, Dalby hit 6, Miles got to 7.3 and Oakey reached 6.9.
Across the state's centre, Roma, Charleville and Rolleston Airport had a low of 5.2 degrees, Blackall experienced 5.7, Hughenden dropped to 6.6 and Richmond recorded 6.9.
Meanwhile, Woolshed in north Queensland recorded 8.3 degrees and the Mackay Racecourse on the central Queensland coast dropped to 8.2 overnight.
Mr Branescu said Monday would bring another chilly start to the day.
"Cooler temperatures are here to stay for a few more nights, especially on Monday morning, we expect temperatures to drop even below zero around the Stanthorpe and Darling Downs area … where the minimum temperatures can drop to minus one", he said.
"Roma may also see temperatures dropping to near zero. So large areas of frost in the Darling Downs, Maranoa and Warrego for another morning or two."

    <h5 class="mb-1">In a world sitting on edge, a yellow house sits on ice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little did Emilia Memory know what was to come when she placed a yellow house on the edge of an iceberg.
How her final year of secondary school would turn out. That her resulting artwork would end up being shown by Brisbane's Gallery of Modern Art. And that the piece would be shown virtually, as the world was plunged into a new unknown - brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ms Memory became one of 33 Queensland senior high school recipients of the annual Creative Generation Excellence Awards in visual art.
The Lourdes Hill College graduate said she had no intention of her artwork going “anywhere” until her teacher nominated the piece.
“I drew my first sketch based on where my headspace was at, at the time,” she said.
“It's so surreal. I never would've thought I'd be someone to get into GOMA.”
Ms Memory took the sketch-turned-installation a step further and photographed the work.
She drew inspiration from artist James Casebere and architect Ricardo Bofill as well as National Geographic photographs.
“At some point in a person’s life, they will confront places, people, things or situations that are foreign to them,” she said.
“It could be moving to a new house, starting a new job or changing schools.”
Ms Memory said uncertainty and fear crept in at the time of creation because she was beginning her first term in her final year of schooling.
“It’s crazy that we’re talking about the theme of the unknown, where we are now, living during the pandemic,” she said.
“What I learnt in my final year was that everything will work itself out.”
Ms Memory is now studying a nursing diploma but continues to create art during her spare time.
“I really want to get into fashion someday and somehow,” she said.
“I honestly feel blessed and this exhibition is such a great opportunity that I hope it can open new avenues for me as well.”
View the exhibition here until July 26.

“I honestly feel blessed and this exhibition is such a great opportunity that I hope it can open new avenues for me as well.”
View the exhibition here until July 26.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Most Australians think the COVID-19 situation will last for less than 12 months but a substantial number are plagued by a paralysing uncertainty, new research shows.
West Australian researchers from Edith Cowan University are conducting a major ongoing survey evaluating the impact of the pandemic situation on the Australian public.
Preliminary results reveal 68 per cent of respondents think the situation will last 12 months or less, with about six months being a frequent estimate.
Comparatively few respondents thought it would last for 1½ years (9 per cent), two years (3 per cent), or more than two years (2 per cent).
A substantial proportion, however, are reluctant to hazard even a guess, saying they are “very uncertain” (17 per cent).
Psychological wellbeing expert Shane Rogers, who is collaborating with health researcher Travis Cruickshank on the study, said this seemed to reflect a general level of optimism.
“In psychology it is well known that most people possess a general 'optimism bias'. This is not a bad thing. Rather, it is adaptive for us as it helps us get on with our lives,” he said.
“By making predictions about how long it will last, this helps people to set a marker for how long they have to endure things, and this can help people to cope, and provide them a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to. For example, thoughts such as 'OK, I only need to put up with this for 12 months or so, I can do that'.
“I don't want to give off the impression that people who think it will be over in 12 months are wrong or naive ... it very well could be that is the case ... nobody really knows as the situation is dynamic.”
But the high levels of uncertainty were causing many people stress, suggested responses, including the open-ended comments respondents provided when invited at the end of the 10-minute survey.
The survey has been running over the past few weeks, while Australia has been experiencing the strictest social distancing restrictions.
Now the restrictions are being eased somewhat, the researchers are keen to see whether this will be associated with an increase in optimism, and will monitor to see if there is a shift in sentiment on survey responses.
The survey is open to all Australians over 18. You can complete it here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From fish to rat: how early humans' tastes changed on long trip to Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When early humans arrived in south-east Asia tens of thousands of years ago, they were mostly eating fish. Research has found they quickly learned to love rat.
Australian researchers working in the Indonesian region have discovered that ancient humans were mostly eating fish and other marine-based food as they travelled through the region more than 45,000 years ago.
Griffith University Associate Professor Julien Louys said by about 20,000 years ago, many of the humans who had settled into the region had transitioned to a mostly land-based diet.
“It indicates that humans are incredibly flexible, ecologically, that’s one of the defining traits of humanity,” the palaeontologist said.
“That allowed these people to move very rapidly through these islands on their way to Australia, basically, but also they were able to subsist on these islands once they became established.”
It has been previously revealed ancient humans living on islands in the Indonesian archipelago, including Flores, Timor and Alor, hunted local game, including giant rats and a miniature species of the elephant-like stegodon.
Professor Louys said her team used carbon-dating analysis to discover people only started to eat those animals in large numbers from 20,000 years ago onwards.
“This is the first direct evidence we have of what they were doing,” he said.
“The chemicals in their teeth show us that when they first got there, they were using marine resources, and it was only later that they started to diversify into other resources available on the islands.”
Such evidence shows how adaptable early humans were, as many of the islands in the region have been surrounded by water for the past 2 million years, and have always required water crossing for humans to reach them.
Professor Louys said the fact Homo sapiens adapted to different climates and resources while others did not, showed why humans spread so quickly across the globe.
“The results of this study support the idea that a distinguishing characteristic of Homo sapiens is high ecological flexibility, compared to other hominins from the same region,” he said.
“Compare that to things like the “hobbit” [Homo floresiensis] or Homo luzonensis, these small-body hominins that are found only on some of these islands.
“They didn’t seem to be able to get as far as humans did, and the data seems to suggest the reason for that is they couldn’t exploit marine resources like modern humans could.”
The work being done by Professor Louys and the team, which also includes researchers from the Max Planck Institute and Indonesia’s Universitas Gadjah Mada, is part of a major push by palaeontologists around the world to investigate the south-east Asia and Oceania regions, which are only now being explored extensively by scientists.
“There’s still so much to be discovered. Within these island chains there’s something like 17,000 different islands, and we've got archaeological records for around 10 of them,” he said.
“This region is completely unknown, so every time we put a hole in the ground we’re finding new stuff. So these discoveries will continue to be made.”
The latest findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tunisia: Robot Helps Medics Avoid Infection From Virus Patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Medics have deployed a robot in a Tunisian hospital caring for patients who contracted the novel coronavirus to limit contact between staff and infected patients, in a first for the North African country.
The tall, single-limbed machine is mounted on wheels and is capable of taking pulses and checking temperatures and blood oxygen levels.
It enables nurses, doctors and patients' relatives to make virtual bedside visits.
The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse
"It allows a reduction in contact with the sick and therefore the risk of contaminating personnel," said Nawel Besbes Chaouch, a doctor leading the pulmonary department at the Abderrahmane Memmi hospital in Ariana, near the capital Tunis, AFP reported.
A screen mounted at the top of the robot enables audiovisual communication with patients, who in turn can see and recognise the faces of those caring for them -- an impossibility when medics otherwise have to use full protective gear.
Also, a website allows families to reserve a time slot for a virtual visit, where the robot is remote-controlled into the patient's room to allow a video conversation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant panda gives birth at Dutch zoo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A giant panda loaned by China to a Dutch zoo as part of a breeding pair has given birth to a cub.
Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub “are staying in the maternity den and are doing well”.
The zoo said following Friday’s birth that it is “delighted and proud to contribute to the protection of this endangered species in a natural way”.
The new cub’s gender will not be known until it leaves the maternity den, likely in a few months’ time, with its mother.
Wu Wen and male panda Xing Ya arrived in the Netherlands from Sichuan province in 2017, as part of a loan programme. The zoo said the new cub also belongs to China and can remain in the Netherlands for four years before going to China to join the breeding programme there.
Around 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, the majority within China, while an estimated 1,864 live in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">First giant panda born in Netherlands</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">THE HAGUE: Wu Wen, a giant panda loaned to a Dutch zoo by China, has given birth in a first for the Netherlands, Ouwehands animal park announced Saturday (May 2).
Mating took place in January and the cub, which belongs to Beijing just like the mother and father Xing Ya, was born on May 1.
"The mother and her cub are staying in the maternity den and are doing well," the zoo in the central city of Rhenen said in a statement said.
"This cub was born and conceived naturally," said Ouwehands owner Marcel Boekhoorn.
"Male or female? The cub's gender will remain a surprise for the time being," he added.
"The keepers are leaving Wu Wen and her cub alone. When the cub leaves the maternity den after a few months, we will be able to see what the gender is.
"When that happens, the little giant panda will be named," Boekhoorn said. The cub will go to China after four years to join the breeding programme.
The mother and father were loaned to the Netherlands in 2017 for 15 years.
Giant pandas are found only in the wild in China where their habitat is shrinking.
However since 2016, they are no longer considered in danger of extinction but remain "vulnerable".

    <h5 class="mb-1">How free taxi rides in Spain helped healthcare workers battle COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MADRID: In Madrid's deserted streets with paying customers scarce, taxi drivers running doctors from house-to-house or taking the sick to hospital have become an essential service, their free rides helping frontline medics fight the virus.
Although their role has been largely anonymous, healthcare staff say it has been essential as Spain has battled the worst of an epidemic that has killed close to 25,000 people.
In Madrid, by far the worst-hit area, more than 500 taxi drivers signed up to volunteer through the PideTaxi app, and they have run more than 100,000 free trips.
"I work on the days when I can, then if they need any help and I'm the closest, the app pings and off I go," says Gaby Saez, 45, who has spent the past six weeks behind the wheel since Spain imposed a strict national lockdown on Mar 14.
Despite the risks, he says he's not afraid, just ultra-careful, wearing a mask and gloves and scrupulously disinfecting his taxi after every single trip.
"At times like these, we all have to do our bit, even if what we can do is very limited."
ANONYMOUS BUT IMPORTANT ROLE
With taxi services made freely available to staff at 266 medical centres across the region, medics have been able to visit patients at home, easing pressure on primary healthcare services.
"Health centres request a taxi so they can make home visits to the elderly, to those needing treatment or people with COVID," says PideTaxi president Andres Veiga.
The idea was to reduce the number of people going to health centres to stop them picking up the virus or passing on the infection to medical staff.
"A taxi might do 10 or 20 visits a day with healthcare staff. Instead of patients going into the health centres, the doctors or nurses go to see them," he told AFP.
"Being able to take a taxi has made a big difference in stopping the spread of the virus, helping contain it and preventing medical staff from becoming infected."
EU health chiefs at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control say measures to prevent transmission in healthcare facilities "are an immediate priority".
This is particularly true in Spain which has suffered more than 215,000 cases, around 19 per cent involving healthcare workers, one of the highest reported percentages in the world.
"ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL"
Although epidemic peaked earlier this month, medics say the free taxis have made a huge difference.
"For me, it's been absolutely essential," says Sara del Carmen Vicente, a 23-year-old nurse at Madrid's October 12 hospital.
"They take you to people's homes, they wait outside then they take you to the next place. They're 100 per cent available, they're always there with a smile and they never give you any grief," she told AFP.
"They're always asking how we're doing, how we're coping emotionally, if things are improving and how the patients are doing.
"It's as if they were part of your family."
Footage of doctors and nurses hailing the taxis for their work have been widely shared on social media, one showing a driver in tears when staff began clapping as he entered a health centre.
For Saez, whose wife is also a taxi driver, seeing medical staff break down was tough.
"For me, these doctors and nurses are pretty much heroes so you try and calm them and offer some sort of shoulder to cry on," he says.
Voluntary work aside, few of Spain's 100,000 drivers are managing to actually work with movement severely restricted and and regional authorities capping the number of taxis out every day.
"Billing is down between 80 and 90 per cent," says Tito Alvarez of Elite Taxi Barcelona.
"When you do get the chance to work, you work well because there are hardly any taxis. But you don't cover you costs because you're only working five days a month."
Though money is tight, Saez says the worst thing is knowing that five colleagues have died of the virus.
"That really touches a nerve," he admits.
"But I feel very calm and I wouldn't even consider stopping volunteering or doing things like delivering masks or ventilator valves. Just seeing how grateful these people are is the greatest reward."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweden is a model for the new coronavirus normal: WHO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS — The World Health Organisation praised Sweden as “a future model” in the next phase of fighting the outbreak because it has trusted people to observe social distancing rules.
Uniquely in Europe, Sweden chose not to tackle the pandemic with an enforced lockdown even though the policy has led to a higher death toll than in Denmark and Norway.
Dr Mike Ryan, of the WHO emergencies team, said it was wrong to believe that Sweden had “just let the infection spread”, adding: “Nothing can be further from the truth. Sweden has set a very strong policy on public health, it is about physical distancing and how to protect the elderly in various nursing homes and much more.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brutal Choices: Anders Tegnell And Sweden’s Herd Immunity Goal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If the title of epidemiological czar were to be created, its first occupant would have to be Sweden’s Anders Tegnell. He has held sway in the face of sceptics and concern that his “herd immunity” approach to COVID-19 is a dangerous, and breathtakingly cavalier approach, to public health. Tegnell T-shirts featuring him as a medieval liberator are available for purchase; fan pages can be found on Facebook abuzz with encouragement. Tegnell’s point, throughout, is that his approach is less than radical given the global lockdown formula that has perpetrated, almost overnight, the worst economic crisis in generations.
This is not to say that such herd immunity is being encouraged by a lax approach to public health regulations. As the World Health Organisation’s Mike Ryan has noted, a false narrative had been perpetrated about an absence of control measures in Sweden to halt the transmission of COVID-19. The focus in Sweden, rather, is on sensible, voluntary restraint, making sure that large gatherings are avoided, and, where people do gather (those of less than 50 are permitted), physical distancing is observed. But such a gamble is dependent on developing a critical, resistant core against re-infection, thereby protecting the vulnerable population. Viral transmission, it follows, will eventually be halted if a majority – say 60 percent of the population – have contracted it while the vulnerable are sheltered.
Karin Ulrika Olofsdotter, the country’s ambassador to the United Nations, has been tasked with promoting the Tegnell model to the world. On National Public Radio, her words had the authority of a proclamation. “About 30 percent of people in Stockholm have reached a level of immunity.” Daringly, she suggested that, “We could reach herd immunity in the capital as early as next month.”
The merits of such a position soon became matters of culture and ideology. The science becomes part of the context within which it is pursued – Sweden as unique; Sweden as peerless – or at least just that bit more peerless than its Nordic neighbours. Within the country, trust for the myndigheterna (the agencies) is unflappable, and if herd immunity be the policy, then so be it.
Attempts to deprive Tegnell of primacy and his sheen of confidence have not succeeded. In March, 2,300 academics signed an open letter to the Swedish government calling for stricter measures to contain the pandemic. As one of the signatories, Cecelia Söderberg-Nauclér of the Karolinska Institute wondered, “No one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?”
An attempted scientific putsch by 22 researchers in April, launched in Dagens Nyheter, failed. In the open letter, the group took issue with the Public Health Agency’s approach, urging government intervention with “swift and radical measures” along the lines undertaken by the country’s neighbours. “In Sweden, there are now ten times more people dying than in neighbouring Finland where coffee shops and restaurants are closed.” Other comparisons were also cited, with a focus on the last three days before the Easter vacation. Between April 7-9, “10.2 people per million inhabitants died of COVID-19 each day in Sweden.” For the same number in Italy, it was 9.7; in Denmark, 2.9; Norway, 2.0 and Finland 0.9.
The authors also threw in a quote from an interview in the same newspaper with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö. It was a pointed remark on the failed credo of voluntary restraint. “You cannot ask people not to go out if the restaurants are allowed to stay open.”
Tegnell’s response was curt, claiming that the figures cited by his critics were marred by “a number of fundamental errors”. As is his wont, he drew upon technical qualifications to debunk the data, noting the line that country comparisons were always risky and deceptive propositions. “The death figures they quote are incorrect, they do not match the Swedish death figures.” Italy’s figures, for instance, only covered deaths in hospitals.
There is a certain brutal emphasis in the Swedish approach, an acceptance that a degree of suffering must be endured to reach sustainable levels of safety. The Swedish death toll from COVID-19 stands at over 2,600. Sweden’s National Board of Health and Welfare has also published its own set of figures suggesting that those of the PHA might be 10 percent lower than they should be.
All methods employed so far have been devastating to limb, life and economy; what makes Tegnell’s different here is the long run, one which will keep the financiers and market watchers happy. Finland’s Osmo Soininvaara, a former minister and member of the Helsinki City Council, sees more merit in it than his current colleagues. In his view, “once the coronavirus crisis is over, the number of deaths in Sweden and Finland is the same. The difference is that in Sweden the death toll has been reached faster. And our economy is in ruins, but the Swedish one will be the strongest in Europe”.
Praise and support for Tegnell can also be found among the Scandinavian neighbours. In Norway, epidemiologist Eiliv Lund has accused his counterparts of simply “pushing the problem out in front of us”. The Swedish approach had the merits of ensuring a higher infection rate “and thus a higher immunity.” Danish epidemiologist Christian Wejse lauds Tegnell’s infection formula, suggesting that the number of immune Swedes might be triple those of Danes. This would mean that Sweden “will be in a better situation if there’s a new wave.”
The Swedish model is being saluted from the stands of the corporate friendly New York Times, with the consistently shallow Thomas L. Friedman touting its virtues. He does, however, concede that responding to pandemics presents us with only “different hellish ways”.
Whatever Tegnell and his trusted underlings in the Swedish Public Health Agency claim, the herd immunity presumption has its fair share of dangers. Questioning the relative figures of other countries and their various measures has intellectual merit; embracing the herd immunity model, however, may not. As the authors of an article recently published by The Lancetwarn, “There is no certainty as to the immunological correlates of antiviral protection or the proportion of the population who must attain them, making it impossible to identify a point when this level of immunity has been reached.”
There is also uncertainty over whether, on being cleared of the virus, reinfection can take place. Last month, over 260 COVID-19 patients in South Korea were reported to have tested positive, suggesting that grim possibility. The explanation offered since is that the method of detecting the coronavirus – polymerase chain reaction (PCR) – fails to distinguish between genetic material (RNA or DNA) from the infectious virus proper and lingering fragments present in the body after recovery. The herd immunity advocates, it seems, still have stilts to stand on, even if they find support among a good number of corpses.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No, Sweden isn’t a miracle coronavirus model</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Health Organisation has been generous with its praise throughout this pandemic. China, Singapore and Ireland have all received plaudits for their handling of the coronavirus crisis. Now that a new turning point is in sight, with the infection’s spread slowing and draconian lockdown measures being gradually lifted, the WHO is promoting the Swedish way of doing things. “Sweden represents a future model” If we wish to get back to a society in which we don’t have lockdowns,” the WHO’s Mike Ryan said, praising the way Swedes are trusted to “self-regulate.”
Sweden’s hands-off approach to lockdown has certainly been different to that of other countries, from France and Italy to the US and China. Large public gatherings are banned but restaurants, bars and schools have stayed open, and social distancing is encouraged rather than enforced by police. Trust in the public is high, and so is the public’s trust in the strategy. Swedes seem happy with the global attention. “Many countries are starting to come around to the Swedish way,” Anders Tegnell, the country’s chief epidemiologist, told USA Today.
But like so many stories of national exceptionalism in this crisis — the UK at one point was convinced it could avoid strict closures, painting them as unscientific, before eventually doing a U-turn — this one is debatable and premature.
US President Donald Trump, no doubt annoyed at stories in the American media heaping praise on the Swedes, tweeted one obvious riposte this week, noting the high price that Swedes have had to pay in terms of Covid-19 fatalities. Sweden’s 2,586 deaths compare poorly with Denmark’s 452, and Norway’s 207. Taking population into account, Sweden has suffered more deaths per million people than the US (although deaths aren’t always counted in the same way).
When looking at all-cause mortality — which is probably a better gauge of the real level of coronavirus deaths — Sweden has been hit with “very high” excess deaths since the start of the year, according to the European body monitoring these statistics. In Denmark, they’ve been “low.”
The counterargument is that Sweden has accepted more deaths in exchange for trying to achieve group immunity more quickly and protecting its economy from lasting collapse. Several big countries in Europe with stricter lockdowns have suffered more excess deaths and greater economic damage than Sweden while being more aggressive about halting infections. But they felt they had no other way to relieve their overrun hospitals, a problem that Sweden doesn’t have.
We don’t know what other nations might have gone through if they’d followed the Swedish model — France estimates its own lockdown saved 60,000 lives. We also don’t know how much immunity has been acquired by the Swedes. An official report estimating that a third of Stockholm’s population would develop antibodies to the virus by May 1 was withdrawn after an error.
We do know that Sweden’s Covid-19 journey hasn’t been exceptional. Like other countries, it has experienced a surge in deaths in care homes, where about one in three virus deaths are estimated to have taken place. Visiting relatives and staff are expected to “self-regulate” but, according to reports, they don’t always do so. The Swedes have also had a lack of systematic testing and equipment shortages.
Things might have been even worse without the Swedes’ demographic and cultural defences. This is a population that does social distancing already in many ways. More than half of the country lives in single-person households, working from home is common and access to fast broadband is everywhere. But Swedes are becoming increasingly unconcerned about keeping their distance as time goes on, as images of packed restaurants indicate. Public-health officials have warned about their behaviour. In Stockholm they’ve threatened to shut bars and restaurants.
At the same time, migrant workers in the country are being infected disproportionately, according to a recent national survey. The hyper-individualist expectation to “self-regulate” looks too complacent for immigrant communities who lack access to information.
Sweden may very well turn out to be a relative winner of sorts, especially economically. It will probably experience a shorter and less severe slowdown than its European neighbours, says Torbjorn Isaksson, an analyst at Nordea Bank. That will cheer the lockdown critics such as Swedish industrialist Jacob Wallenberg, who in March warned of the long-term damage of putting economies in deep freeze. Whether that’s much of a win for an economy where trade accounts for 89 per cent of GDP is doubtful. Leapfrogging European Union trading partners in a single market that’s been paralysed by the virus scare can’t be that meaningful. And it probably won’t be fondly remembered.
Given that we haven’t reached the end of this pandemic, more circumspection might be in order. Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once said: “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” As we approach a turning point in the crisis, it’s tempting to look back and single out winners as the model to follow. But we don’t know what’s going to happen next. None of us has lived through it yet. And that includes Sweden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madagascar ships anti-virus herbal tea to Guinea-Bissau</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bissau, Guinea-Bissau | AFP |  Madagascar on Saturday delivered to Guinea-Bissau a shipment of a herbal tea that President Andry Rajoelina has touted as a powerful remedy against the novel coronavirus and hopes to distribute across West Africa and beyond.
Baptised Covid-Organics, the drink is derived from artemisia — a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment — and other indigenous herbs.
Guinea-Bissau’s self-proclaimed President Umaro Sissoco Embalo was at the airport to oversee reception of the cargo donated by Madagascar, AFP correspondents said.
After Equatorial Guinea on Thursday, Guinea-Bissau is the second country to take delivery of the potion that Madagascar claims cures COVID-19 patients within 10 days.
The World Health Organization has said that the herbal tea’s effects had not been tested, and there are no published scientific studies of the potion.
Embalo’s chief of staff Califa Soares Cassama told reporters that part of Saturday’s shipment was to be passed along to the other 14 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
Rajoelina had on Friday thanked Embalo for taking charge of the distribution in West Africa.
There was no indication of how Guinea-Bissau, poor even by African standards and chronically unstable politically, would handle the required logistics.
The country of 1.8 million has reported 200 coronavirus cases, including Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam and four other cabinet members, and one virus death.
Embalo has said that he will test the potion from Madagascar on leading government members, including the premier.
Equatorial Guinea meanwhile announced that it will distribute the potion to infected people in hospitals during two weeks and, in its preventative version, to everybody else.
Back in Madagascar, unarmed soldiers have been going door to door in the capital Antananarivo handing out Covid-Organics.
When launching the distribution last month, Rajoelina said two people had already been cured thanks to the potion, and added: “We can change the history of the entire world.”
There is currently no scientifically proven cure for coronavirus, which has killed more than 240,000 people worldwide according to official figures compiled by AFP.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AFP) — Madagascar yesterday delivered to Guinea-Bissau a shipment of a herbal tea that President Andry Rajoelina has touted as a powerful remedy against the novel coronavirus and which he hopes to distribute across West Africa and beyond.
Baptised Covid-Organics, the drink is derived from artemisia — a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment — and other indigenous herbs.
Guinea-Bissau's self-proclaimed President Umaro Sissoco Embalo was at the airport to oversee reception of the cargo donated by Madagascar, AFPcorrespondents said.
After Equatorial Guinea on Thursday, Guinea-Bissau is the second country to take delivery of the potion that Madagascar claims cures COVID-19 patients within 10 days.
The World Health Organization has said that the herbal tea's effects had not been tested, and there are no published scientific studies of the potion.
Embalo's Chief of Staff Califa Soares Cassama told reporters that part of yesterday's shipment was to be passed along to the other 14 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
Rajoelina had on Friday thanked Embalo for taking charge of the distribution in West Africa.
There was no indication of how Guinea-Bissau, poor even by African standards and chronically unstable politically, would handle the required logistics.
The country of 1.8 million has reported 200 COVID-19 cases, including Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam and four other Cabinet members, and one virus death.
Embalo has said that he will test the potion from Madagascar on leading government members, including the premier.
Equatorial Guinea, meanwhile, announced that it will distribute the potion to infected people in hospitals during two weeks and, in its preventative version, to everybody else.
Back in Madagascar, unarmed soldiers have been going door to door in the capital Antananarivo handing out Covid-Organics.
When launching the distribution last month, Rajoelina said two people had already been cured thanks to the potion, and added: “We can change the history of the entire world.”
There is currently no scientifically proven cure for the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 240,000 people worldwide according to official figures compiled by AFP.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid exit strategy depends on getting vaccine to whole world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coming up with a vaccine to halt Covid-19 in a matter of months isn’t the only colossal challenge. The next big test: getting billions of doses to every corner of the world at a time when countries increasingly are putting their own interests first.
A variety of financing tools are under consideration to spur production of large quantities of potential vaccines and ensure they’re distributed equitably. In one arrangement, developers would agree to provide shots at affordable prices in return for funding commitments from governments or other donors.

The stakes are immense with the coronavirus sickening more than 3 million people, even as billions hide from the pathogen indoors. Health advocates are concerned about richer countries monopolizing the global supply of Covid-19 vaccines if companies succeed, a scenario that played out during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Distributing shots widely, they say, isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s also crucial in curbing the spread of the contagion.
“There’s a lot of awareness of the potential injustice and inequity ahead,” said Gavin Yamey, director of Duke University’s Center for Policy Impact in Global Health. “There’s been less awareness of the critical notion that you actually need to allocate the vaccine in a way that makes public-health sense.”
Lack of access to vital drugs and vaccines is a perennial issue for the world’s poor. More than two decades ago, the high price of HIV drugs sparked an outcry as millions in Africa and other regions who couldn’t afford them died, leading much later to programs to help those populations.
With Covid-19, the worry is that wealthy countries will put their own interests ahead of global unity. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week joined the World Health Organization in calling for fair distribution of vaccines.
“It has the potential to get very ugly,” said Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis. “There’s going to be a lag between when we have a vaccine and when we have the ability to protect 7 billion people.”

Still, he said, “there are ways of heading it off,” such as creating manufacturing facilities all around the world. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an Oslo-based group that’s funding a number of experimental coronavirus vaccines, has said that’s the goal.
The coalition sees promise in so-called advance market commitments, according to Chief Executive Officer Richard Hatchett. In that type of program, donors promise funds to guarantee the price of vaccines once they have been developed. CEPI is talking with other organizations including the World Bank, which is exploring how to set up such agreements, he said.
“The virus does not respect borders and it cuts across all classes of society, and all age groups,” Hatchett said. “There really does seem to be a rapidly evolving consensus around the importance of delivering a vaccine globally to all countries as quickly as it can become available.”
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a group that works to prevent disease in poor countries, established a similar arrangement to tackle Ebola in Africa. The nonprofit signed an advance purchase commitment with Merck & Co., creating a stockpile of doses used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Merck initially agreed to provide 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for use in expanded clinical trials or on an emergency basis while development continued.
In an agreement with Gavi a decade ago, Pfizer Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc slashed the price of their pneumonia vaccines by up to 90% in developing nations, each committing to supply 30 million doses a year over a decade.
Manufacturing and supplying vaccines to meet global demand is expected to be an unprecedented mobilization, according to Joe Cerrell, managing director of global policy and advocacy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The cost to secure the doses needed could be as much as $25 billion, he estimated.
“Time is not on our side,” he said by phone. “We don’t have a year or so to figure this out.”
The International Finance Facility for Immunization, which raises money to purchase and deliver vaccines by selling bonds, is another option that could work with Covid-19, Cerrell said. The group funds programs through Gavi.
Those kinds of tools are “innovative mechanisms for taking long-term pledges and turning them into front-loaded cash,” Duke’s Yamey said. “We’re going to need large amounts of money now.”
Dozens of companies, including Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc., are in the race to come up with a vaccine, along with researchers at institutions ranging from the University of Oxford to the University of Queensland in Australia.
One of the biggest companies in the hunt, London-based Glaxo, is talking with governments on the issue of supply, according to Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley.
“We do think this needs to be a global approach,” she told reporters. “We’re expecting those conversations to go on in parallel and ahead of data concluding, and we’re looking forward to collaborating with governments to be part of the solution.”
While a vaccine is a crucial part of the exit strategy, the world lacks a global system for managing distribution in a crisis, said Gayle Smith, who leads the ONE Campaign, an advocacy group. During the flu pandemic more than a decade ago, wealthy nations secured the bulk of the supply before later moving to try to allocate shots to the rest of the world, she told reporters this week.
It’s important a vaccine is “available equitably and equally everywhere,” she said. “We can’t think of this pandemic as something that exists simply within our own borders.”

CEPI is talking with other organizations including the World Bank, which is exploring how to set up such agreements, he said.
“The virus does not respect borders and it cuts across all classes of society, and all age groups,” Hatchett said. “There really does seem to be a rapidly evolving consensus around the importance of delivering a vaccine globally to all countries as quickly as it can become available.”
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a group that works to prevent disease in poor countries, established a similar arrangement to tackle Ebola in Africa. The nonprofit signed an advance purchase commitment with Merck & Co., creating a stockpile of doses used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Merck initially agreed to provide 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for use in expanded clinical trials or on an emergency basis while development continued.
In an agreement with Gavi a decade ago, Pfizer Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline Plc slashed the price of their pneumonia vaccines by up to 90% in developing nations, each committing to supply 30 million doses a year over a decade.
Manufacturing and supplying vaccines to meet global demand is expected to be an unprecedented mobilization, according to Joe Cerrell, managing director of global policy and advocacy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The cost to secure the doses needed could be as much as $25 billion, he estimated.
“Time is not on our side,” he said by phone. “We don’t have a year or so to figure this out.”
The International Finance Facility for Immunization, which raises money to purchase and deliver vaccines by selling bonds, is another option that could work with Covid-19, Cerrell said. The group funds programs through Gavi.
Those kinds of tools are “innovative mechanisms for taking long-term pledges and turning them into front-loaded cash,” Duke’s Yamey said. “We’re going to need large amounts of money now.”
Dozens of companies, including Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc., are in the race to come up with a vaccine, along with researchers at institutions ranging from the University of Oxford to the University of Queensland in Australia.
One of the biggest companies in the hunt, London-based Glaxo, is talking with governments on the issue of supply, according to Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley.
“We do think this needs to be a global approach,” she told reporters. “We’re expecting those conversations to go on in parallel and ahead of data concluding, and we’re looking forward to collaborating with governments to be part of the solution.”
While a vaccine is a crucial part of the exit strategy, the world lacks a global system for managing distribution in a crisis, said Gayle Smith, who leads the ONE Campaign, an advocacy group. During the flu pandemic more than a decade ago, wealthy nations secured the bulk of the supply before later moving to try to allocate shots to the rest of the world, she told reporters this week.
It’s important a vaccine is “available equitably and equally everywhere,” she said. “We can’t think of this pandemic as something that exists simply within our own borders.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Defeating Covid doesn’t just need a vaccine, but also rich countries to not monopolise it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London: Coming up with a vaccine to halt Covid-19 in a matter of months isn’t the only colossal challenge. The next big test: getting billions of doses to every corner of the world at a time when countries increasingly are putting their own interests first.
A variety of financing tools are under consideration to spur production of large quantities of potential vaccines and ensure they’re distributed equitably. In one arrangement, developers would agree to provide shots at affordable prices in return for funding commitments from governments or other donors.
The stakes are immense with the coronavirus sickening more than 3 million people, even as billions hide from the pathogen indoors. Health advocates are concerned about richer countries monopolizing the global supply of Covid-19 vaccines if companies succeed, a scenario that played out during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Distributing shots widely, they say, isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s also crucial in curbing the spread of the contagion.
“There’s a lot of awareness of the potential injustice and inequity ahead,” said Gavin Yamey, director of Duke University’s Center for Policy Impact in Global Health. “There’s been less awareness of the critical notion that you actually need to allocate the vaccine in a way that makes public-health sense.”
Lack of access to vital drugs and vaccines is a perennial issue for the world’s poor. More than two decades ago, the high price of HIV drugs sparked an outcry as millions in Africa and other regions who couldn’t afford them died, leading much later to programs to help those populations.

With Covid-19, the worry is that wealthy countries will put their own interests ahead of global unity. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week joined the World Health Organization in calling for fair distribution of vaccines.
“It has the potential to get very ugly,” said Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis. “There’s going to be a lag between when we have a vaccine and when we have the ability to protect 7 billion people.”
Still, he said, “there are ways of heading it off,” such as creating manufacturing facilities all around the world. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an Oslo-based group that’s funding a number of experimental coronavirus vaccines, has said that’s the goal.
The coalition sees promise in so-called advance market commitments, according to Chief Executive Officer Richard Hatchett. In that type of program, donors promise funds to guarantee the price of vaccines once they have been developed. CEPI is talking with other organizations including the World Bank, which is exploring how to set up such agreements, he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blood pressure medicines don't raise COVID-19 risk, says research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON DC, USA – Commonly used blood pressure medicines do not heighten susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, or increase the risk of becoming seriously ill with the disease, three major studies said Friday, positive news for the millions of people who take them.
The research primarily concerned angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), which are also given to diabetes patients to help protect their kidneys.
ACE inhibitors include the likes of ramipril, lisinopril and other drugs ending in -pril; while ARBs include valsartan and losartan, and generally end in -sartan.
There had been concern arising from animal studies that these medicines might increase the body's levels of a protein called ACE2, which the coronavirus latches on to when it invades human cells, thus increasing people's vulnerability to the disease.
Confusing matters further, there were also contradictory animal studies that showed having more ACE2 proteins might lessen an inflammatory reaction in lungs to COVID-19, a beneficial effect.
The 3 new studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).
Each involved reviewing the records of thousands of people either on or not on the medicines and seeing if they got infected and how the disease progressed.
They then used statistical methods to control for other factors like underlying health conditions that might make people more susceptible to infection and to serious COVID-19.
"We saw no difference in the likelihood of a positive test with ACE inhibitors and with angiotensin receptor blockers," Harmony Reynolds of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who led one of the studies that involved about 12,600 people, told AFP.
The studies were "observational," meaning the researchers observed the effect of a risk factor.
This type of investigation is always considered weaker than "experimental" where an intervention is introduced along with a control, which leaves less to chance.
The authors of an accompanying editorial in the NEJM acknowledged this inherent limitation, but added: "We find it reassuring that 3 studies in different populations and with different designs arrive at the consistent message."
Reynolds said the findings were relieving, because she had been getting questions from worried patients who had read press reports and were asking if they should stop their medicines.
"I'm very happy to be able to tell patients that they should continue their blood pressure medications," she said.
This is especially important given that lockdown life itself appears to be causing high blood pressure, "maybe from stress or less exercise or eating differently," she added.
Mandeep Mehra, the medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Heart and Vascular Center who led another of the studies, said another fundamental question had been answered.
Early on in the pandemic, when it became clear that people with cardiovascular conditions were more likely to get severe COVID-19, scientists wondered: Was it heart disease that was the risk factor, or the medicine used to control it?
The new research settles the debate firmly in favor of the former, he said.
"It tells you beyond a shadow of a doubt that COVID-19 somehow interacts with the cardiovascular system in a pretty negative way," said Mehra.
Potential benefit?
Mehra's study, which looked at almost 9,000 patients across 11 countries, also tied the use of blood pressure medicines to a lower risk of death from COVID-19 – a finding not shared by the other two studies.
"The same drugs that appear to have life saving benefits in patients with cardiovascular illness also appear to show us a signal of benefit in patients who are in the throes of COVID-19," he said.
He added it was unclear why this was the case – whether it was because the medicines were helping the heart which in turn made it more resilient to the effects of the virus, or whether they were doing something else.
"What we can tell you is that, if you're on a statin or an ACE inhibitor, by golly, please continue it," added Mehra.
Nearly half of adults in the United States, or 108 million people, have hypertension, according to official figures. – Rappler.com

Mehra’s study, which looked at almost 9,000 patients across 11 countries, also tied the use of blood pressure medicines to a lower risk of death from COVID-19 — a finding not shared by the other two studies.
“The same drugs that appear to have life-saving benefits in patients with cardiovascular illness also appear to show us a signal of benefit in patients who are in the throes of COVID-19,” he said.
He added it was unclear why this was the case — whether it was because the medicines were helping the heart which in turn made it more resilient to the effects of the virus, or whether they were doing something else.
“What we can tell you is that, if you’re on a statin or an ACE inhibitor, by golly, please continue it,” added Mehra.
Nearly half of adults in the United States, or 108 million people, have hypertension, according to official figures.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blood pressure medicines don't raise Covid-19 risk, says research</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON, May 2 ― Commonly used blood pressure medicines do not heighten susceptibility to Covid-19 infection, or increase the risk of becoming seriously ill with the disease, three major studies said yesterday, positive news for the millions of people who take them.
The research primarily concerned angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), which are also given to diabetes patients to help protect their kidneys.
ACE inhibitors include the likes of ramipril, lisinopril and other drugs ending in -pril; while ARBs include valsartan and losartan, and generally end in -sartan.
There had been concern arising from animal studies that these medicines might increase the body's levels of a protein called ACE2, which the coronavirus latches on to when it invades human cells, thus increasing people's vulnerability to the disease.
Confusing matters further, there were also contradictory animal studies that showed having more ACE2 proteins might lessen an inflammatory reaction in lungs to Covid-19, a beneficial effect.
The three new studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).
Each involved reviewing the records of thousands of people either on or not on the medicines and seeing if they got infected and how the disease progressed.
They then used statistical methods to control for other factors like underlying health conditions that might make people more susceptible to infection and to serious Covid-19.
“We saw no difference in the likelihood of a positive test with ACE inhibitors and with angiotensin receptor blockers,” Harmony Reynolds of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who led one of the studies that involved about 12,600 people, told AFP.
The studies were “observational,” meaning the researchers observed the effect of a risk factor.
This type of investigation is always considered weaker than “experimental” where an intervention is introduced along with a control, which leaves less to chance.
The authors of an accompanying editorial in the NEJM acknowledged this inherent limitation, but added: “We find it reassuring that three studies in different populations and with different designs arrive at the consistent message.”
Reynolds said the findings were relieving, because she had been getting questions from worried patients who had read press reports and were asking if they should stop their medicines.
“I'm very happy to be able to tell patients that they should continue their blood pressure medications,” she said.
This is especially important given that lockdown life itself appears to be causing high blood pressure, “maybe from stress or less exercise or eating differently,” she added.
Mandeep Mehra, the medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Heart and Vascular Center who led another of the studies, said another fundamental question had been answered.
Early on in the pandemic, when it became clear that people with cardiovascular conditions were more likely to get severe Covid-19, scientists wondered: Was it heart disease that was the risk factor, or the medicine used to control it?
The new research settles the debate firmly in favor of the former, he said.
“It tells you beyond a shadow of a doubt that Covid-19 somehow interacts with the cardiovascular system in a pretty negative way,” said Mehra.
Potential benefit?
Mehra's study, which looked at almost 9,000 patients across 11 countries, also tied the use of blood pressure medicines to a lower risk of death from Covid-19 ― a finding not shared by the other two studies.
“The same drugs that appear to have life saving benefits in patients with cardiovascular illness also appear to show us a signal of benefit in patients who are in the throes of Covid-19,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chiefs concerned about toll COVID-19 will take on mental health in First Nations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA -- A few months before the novel coronavirus arrived in Canada, the Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation at Loon Lake, Sask. was already raising the alarm over suicides in the community, about 360 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon.
The First Nation declared a state of crisis in mid-November 2019 after three deaths by suicide occurred over three weeks, including a 10-year-old girl. In the weeks that followed, band leaders say eight people, mainly youths, also tried to take their lives.
Chief Ronald Mitsuing says a deep sense of grief remains within the community of just over 1,000 people, especially after a 31-year-old man in the community died by suicide two weeks ago.
Now, Mitsuing says he fears the stress and worry about a possible outbreak of COVID-19 could trigger further mental health suffering among some of his residents.
"Losing the youth really took a big toll out of our community. And I know it's ongoing -- people thinking about it all the time, can't get past it," he said.
"We're not in that comfortable stage yet where we know it's going to be all right."
He is not alone. As the number of COVID-19 cases begins to climb in Indigenous communities across Canada, First Nations and Inuit chiefs say they are deeply concerned about how the pandemic is affecting the mental health of their residents.
The Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation did receive help from the province and federal government to deal with the immediate aftermath of the suicide crisis, but Mitsuing says they need more permanent resources. He wants funding to train locals as trauma counsellors, rather than relying on outside help or having to send youth away for treatment.
This is especially needed during the pandemic, as the First Nation remains locked down to outsiders, Mitsuing said.
Chief Eugene Hart of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation in central Labrador shares the same concerns for his community, which also declared a crisis in the months before the pandemic following 10 suicide attempts in less than a week in October 2019.
The community of roughly 1,300 people had also been struggling with more than a dozen other deaths from natural causes before that -- a toll that was hardest felt by young people with few supports in place to help them address their grief, Hart said.
"I'm worried about everything in general now, because we don't know what people are thinking, where we have the lockdown in the community as well. We don't know what kind of stress people are going through daily because we can't interact with them."
He echoed Mitsuing's concerns about not having adequate supports that are permanent. He would like to see full-time crisis counsellors and staff and mental health crisis lines staffed by people in the community. However, he says his First Nation has not received the support from Ottawa or from the province necessary to make this happen.
"Everything is totally different now, and it's going to be like this awhile and a lot of people are still scared," he said.
Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller says he knows COVID-19 is affecting the mental health of Indigenous communities, particularly among those who are at a high risk from the illness -- or have families who are.
He says the federal government is increasing the number of crisis intervention counsellors on shift at the Hope for Wellness helpline, which provides telephone and online support for First Nations, Inuit and Metis in English, French, Cree, Ojibway and Inuktitut.
More than 100 calls and chats every week are linked to COVID-19, according to assistant deputy minister Valerie Gideon, which represents an increase to previous volumes.
"The apprehension and fear that exists within the communities is real and has an impact on mental health. As part of Indigenous Services Canada a large amount of the support we provide turns in and around supports around mental health," Miller said, adding the department is ready to do more as it assesses the impact of the pandemic.
Grand Chief Garrison Settee of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents northern First Nations in the province, says concern about inadequate personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies in remote, fly-in communities is further adding to the strain.
"It's in our psyche, it's in our conscience. Every waking moment, I'm thinking about what's going to happen from day to day. Do we have enough resources to be able to address (COVID-19) if it does hit?" Settee said.
Elia Nicholson-Nave, executive director of the Kuu-Us Crisis Line Society, which runs an Indigenous-specific crisis line in British Columbia, says March brought a noticeable spike in calls, which has continued, due to pandemic-related issues.
"Many people are fearful of what is yet to come and often the unknown causes additional anxiety, depression and mental health distress," she said, adding they have received no extra funding.
Back in Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation, Chief Mitsuing says COVID-19 restrictions have put on hold any opportunity for healing as community members and elders remain shut in their houses.
When COVID-19 is over, the chief says he wants to organize sharing circles to help people deal with their anxiety and ongoing grief.
He also wants to teach the youth about their cultural identity as a way to help them heal. He said that is what one of the youths wrote in a letter before dying by suicide.
"That's what they were asking for. They didn't know who they were ... that they didn't have an identity, so we're going to try to teach them their culture, the way we were brought up."

Chief Eugene Hart of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation in central Labrador shares the same concerns for his community, which also declared a crisis in the months before the pandemic following 10 suicide attempts in less than a week in October 2019.
The community of roughly 1,300 people had also been struggling with more than a dozen other deaths from natural causes before that — a toll that was hardest felt by young people with few supports in place to help them address their grief, Hart said.
“I’m worried about everything in general now, because we don’t know what people are thinking, where we have the lockdown in the community as well. We don’t know what kind of stress people are going through daily because we can’t interact with them.”
He echoed Mitsuing’s concerns about not having adequate supports that are permanent. He would like to see full-time crisis counsellors and staff and mental health crisis lines staffed by people in the community. However, he says his First Nation has not received the support from Ottawa or from the province necessary to make this happen.
“Everything is totally different now, and it’s going to be like this awhile and a lot of people are still scared,” he said.
Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller says he knows COVID-19 is affecting the mental health of Indigenous communities, particularly among those who are at a high risk from the illness — or have families who are.
He says the federal government is increasing the number of crisis intervention counsellors on shift at the Hope for Wellness helpline, which provides telephone and online support for First Nations, Inuit and Metis in English, French, Cree, Ojibway and Inuktitut.
More than 100 calls and chats every week are linked to COVID-19, according to assistant deputy minister Valerie Gideon, which represents an increase to previous volumes.
“The apprehension and fear that exists within the communities is real and has an impact on mental health. As part of Indigenous Services Canada a large amount of the support we provide turns in and around supports around mental health,” Miller said, adding the department is ready to do more as it assesses the impact of the pandemic.
Grand Chief Garrison Settee of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, which represents northern First Nations in the province, says concern about inadequate personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies in remote, fly-in communities is further adding to the strain.
“It’s in our psyche, it’s in our conscience. Every waking moment, I’m thinking about what’s going to happen from day to day. Do we have enough resources to be able to address (COVID-19) if it does hit?” Settee said.
Elia Nicholson-Nave, executive director of the Kuu-Us Crisis Line Society, which runs an Indigenous-specific crisis line in British Columbia, says March brought a noticeable spike in calls, which has continued, due to pandemic-related issues.
“Many people are fearful of what is yet to come and often the unknown causes additional anxiety, depression and mental health distress,” she said, adding they have received no extra funding.
Back in Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation, Chief Mitsuing says COVID-19 restrictions have put on hold any opportunity for healing as community members and elders remain shut in their houses.
When COVID-19 is over, the chief says he wants to organize sharing circles to help people deal with their anxiety and ongoing grief.
He also wants to teach the youth about their cultural identity as a way to help them heal. He said that is what one of the youths wrote in a letter before dying by suicide.
“That’s what they were asking for. They didn’t know who they were … that they didn’t have an identity, so we’re going to try to teach them their culture, the way we were brought up.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indian officials capture rare snow leopard, send it to zoo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SHIMLA, INDIA -- A rare snow leopard captured as it savaged livestock in a remote village in the Indian Himalaya will be sent to a zoo instead of being released, officials said Sunday, triggering outrage from activists.
The endangered creature was found on Saturday after it became trapped inside a pen containing sheep and goats in Giu village near the Tibetan border in India's Himachal Pradesh state.
"The big cat was unable to escape from the enclosure after killing a few livestock," wildlife official Hardev Negi, who led the team that caught the snow leopard, told AFP.
"The shepherd contacted us and we captured the animal in a cage."
The state's chief wildlife official Savita Sharma told AFP the snow leopard was not being released since the incident involved "wild animal-human conflict," adding it would be transferred to a zoo in the foothills outside the state capital Shimla.
Officials estimated that the juvenile animal killed 43 sheep and goats in the pen over four days.
There are only 44 snow leopards living in the high passes and rugged valleys of Himachal Pradesh, according to Sharma.
Rajeshwar Negi, the National Convener of Nature Watch India said the decision was condemning the creature to a life without freedom.
"Don't they know how stressful it will be for the animal to be transported on a bumpy 350-kilometre long road," he told AFP.
"Does it mean the snow leopard will spend the rest of its life in a zoo instead of the Himalayan wilds?"
He added that the animal would also suffer in the higher temperatures at the zoo in Shimla, which is significantly warmer than its natural habitat.
As few as 4,000 of the mysterious animals could be left in the high mountains of central Asia -- their sole habitat -- according to the World Wildlife Fund.
Negi said snow leopards were being forced to move to lower altitudes and prey on domestic animals as the populations of their natural prey -- the ibex and blue sheep -- have been decimated by hunting.
Global warming is also threatening the survival of the big cat, with warmer temperatures pushing the tree line higher and prompting farmers to move further up the mountains to plant crops and graze livestock, encroaching on the snow leopards' territory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tunisian doctors deploy robots to reduce contact with COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Health workers have deployed a robot in a Tunisian hospital caring for coronavirus victims to limit contact between staff and infected patients, in a first for the North African country.
The tall, single-limbed machine is mounted on wheels and is capable of taking pulses and checking temperatures and blood oxygen levels.
It enables nurses, doctors, and patients’ relatives to make virtual bedside visits.
“It allows a reduction in contact with the sick and therefore the risk of contaminating personnel,” said Nawel Besbes Chaouch, a doctor leading the pulmonary department at the Abderrahmane Memmi hospital in Ariana, near the capital Tunis.
A screen mounted at the top of the robot enables audiovisual communication with patients, who in turn can see and recognise the faces of those caring for them – an impossibility when medics otherwise have to use full protective gear.
A website allows families to reserve a time slot for a virtual visit, where the robot is remote-controlled into the patient’s room to allow a video conversation.
The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Robot helps Tunisia medics avoid infection from coronavirus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Medics have deployed a robot in a Tunisia’s hospital caring for coronavirus victims to limit contact between staff and infected patients, in a first for the North African country.
The tall, single-limbed machine is mounted on wheels and is capable of taking pulses and checking temperatures and blood oxygen levels.
It enables nurses, doctors and patients’ relatives to make virtual bedside visits.
“It allows a reduction in contact with the sick and therefore the risk of contaminating personnel,” said Nawel Besbes Chaouch, a doctor leading the pulmonary department at the Abderrahmane Memmi hospital in Ariana, near the capital Tunis.
A screen mounted at the top of the robot enables audiovisual communication with patients, who in turn can see and recognise the faces of those caring for them — an impossibility when medics otherwise have to use full protective gear.
A website allows families to reserve a time slot for a virtual visit, where the robot is remote-controlled into the patient’s room to allow a video conversation.
The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse.

Medics in a Tunisian hospital have deployed a robot to care for coronavirus patients. The aim is to limit contact between staff and infected patients in the North African country.
According to The Guardian report, the tall, single-limbed machine which is mounted on wheels has the capability to take pulses, check temperatures and blood oxygen levels.
Nurses, doctors and relatives of patients can make virtual bedside visits, reducing the risk of infection.
A screen mounted at the top of the robot enables audiovisual communication with patients. Patients can see and recognise the faces of those caring for them.

Family members can also have a video conversation with the patient. The robot is remote-controlled into the patient’s room to allow for this. This is made possible by a website which allows families to reserve a time slot for a virtual visit.
“It allows a reduction in contact with the sick and therefore the risk of contaminating personnel,” Nawel Besbes Chaouch, a doctor leading the pulmonary department at the Abderrahmane Memmi hospital in Ariana, near the capital Tunis said.
The robot was designed and made in Tunisia, by Enova, a start-up based in Sousse.
Legit.ng had shared the report of another hospital in Singapore which devised a means to reduce exposure of healthcare practitioners to coronavirus.
Alexandra Hospital in Singapore was reported to be making plans of using a robot to distribute meals and medication to some patients suspected or confirmed to have coronavirus. The hospital will also task another robot with the responsibility of cleaning and chatting with patients in four languages including Singlish.

As the coronavirus pandemic bites harder, countries all over the world are finding ways of curbing its spread and also a cure for it.
The COVID-19 which has no known cure has claimed the lives of thousands of people. Over three million have been infected across the world.
One of the countries doing their own bit is Madagascar. The country is said to be using its own medicine to treat the virus. President Andry Rajoelina launched the herbal tea, named COVID-Organics, on Monday, April 20.
The African nation has recorded 128 coronavirus cases, and 92 out of that number have recovered, leaving 36 active cases. Also, no death has been recorded in the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wuhan lab 'deletes pictures of scientists handling bat samples'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Deleted photographs from the website of a lab in Wuhan are fuelling conspiracy theories over the source of the coronavirus pandemic.
It is believed the outbreak happened at a wet market in the Chinese city, but Wuhan also houses one of the world’s leading virology laboratories leading some, notably the US president Donald Trump, to suggest otherwise.
These pictures, appearing to show low safety standards among staff at the laboratory, will do little to dissuade that view.
In the past month, according to MailOnline, the Wuhan’s Institute of Virology has taken down pictures of people working in its laboratories and removed references to US diplomatic visitors who questioned its work on bats.
Edited pages showed staff wearing minimal protective equipment entering caves to take swabs from bats – what is believed to be the source of coronavirus that would become Covid-19 in humans.
References to a visit by US diplomat in Beijing, Rick Switzer, in March 2018 also appear to have been removed.

Mr Switzer sent official warnings back to Washington about inadequate safety levels and the risky coronavirus studies it was undertaking two years before the pandemic broke.
The Washington Post reported that in January 2018 the US Embassy in Beijing repeatedly sent science officers to the lab, which had become China’s first site to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety.
A press release about the visits was published in March that year only for them to be erased in April this year, although they do remain archived on the internet.
One cable from Mr Switzer to the US State Department read: ‘During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they [the diplomats] noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.’
The latest images to surface come after pictures, taken from inside the institute, showed a broken seal on a freezer used to house up to 1,500 different virus strains.
The US’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement saying: ‘The intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Photos of unprotected Wuhan scientists taking bat swabs mysteriously vanish</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Photos showing seemingly lax safety standards at the laboratory at the centre of international coronavirus suspicion have been deleted from its official website.
A photograph of scientists entering a cave to take swabs of bats potentially carrying the coronavirus while wearing no protective gear has been removed from the Institute of Virology's website.
The Wuhan based lab has also deleted reference to a visit science and technology expert Rick Switzer made from the US embassy in Beijing back in 2018.
Those trips led him to warn the US State Department that the lab had a shortage of trained technicians "needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory", the Mail on Sunday reported.
We have launched a unique nationwide survey to find out what lockdown is like for people across the country. Click here to take part.
The Institute of Virology has fallen under the international spotlight in the past week.
On Thursday US President Donald Trump suggested that the coronavirus outbreak may have originated from the facility.
“We’re going to see where it comes from,” Trump said during a White House press conference.
“We have people looking at it very, very strongly. Scientific people, intelligence people, and others.
"We’re going to put it all together. I think we will have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us.”
Pressed to explain what evidence he had seen that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, Trump responded, “I can’t tell you that. I’m not allowed to tell you that.”
Vice President Mike Pence then claimed that the US had demanded access to the facility, only for its director to rule out any possibility that the virus originated there.
Access was not granted.
On Friday leaked security documents emerged claiming that China deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence about the coronavirus outbreak and hampered efforts to develop a vaccine.
They also showed that two scientists who worked at the lab were being scrutinised by western spies.
Zhou Peng, head of Wuhan's Bat Virus Infection and Immunity Project, was part of a study which involved transporting bats from Queensland to the lab in Geelong, Victoria.
There they were dissected and their bodies studied for viruses, using funds from the Australian and Chinese governments.
The other scientists whose work was being looked into is Shi Zhengli, who studies bat faeces in caves.
The two researchers wrote a paper together in January suggested the virus probably originated in bats.
In March Zhengli told Scientific America during an interview that she wondered: "Could they (coronavirus) come from out lab?"
Both the US and the Australian governments have called for an investigation into the origins of the disease.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was "seriously concerned and firmly opposed" to the idea of such an enquiry.
In the two weeks after China notified the World Health Organisation of the coronavirus outbreak, it had claimed that exposure to the disease originated from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.
Descriptions of the first cases recorded by a large group of Chinese researchers in The Lancet on January 24 questioned these claims.
They found that only 13 of the first 41 patients had contact with the market.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shocking pics of Wuhan scientists handling bat samples deleted from website of institute blamed for coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WORRYING photographs of scientists handling bat samples have been deleted from the website of the institute blamed for the coronavirus pandemic.
The images - which reveal a shocking lack of safety - were taken down by the Wuhan Institute of Virology after diplomats and scientists raised the alarm about its work.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates on Covid-19
And it appears to have also removed all reference to a visit in March 2018 by Rick Switzer, a science and technology expert from the US embassy in Beijing who then raised the alert.
As a result of his visit, cables were sent to the US State Department from the embassy warning about the risks of  experiments on bats.
One read: "During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory."
US and British intelligence officials suspect bungling scientists at the science hub spread the killer disease during risky coronavirus tests on bats.
And President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he had seen intelligence that gave him a "high degree of confidence'" that the global crisis had its origins in the institute.
It was claimed that Covid-19 was "developed in the Wuhan lab as China hoped to prove it's greater than the US at battling deadly diseases".
The Sun has already revealed a page of the Wuhan institute’s website - deleted suddenly last month - showed no safety precautions were employed.
One worker admitted being sprayed with bat blood or urine as images showed staff brazenly collecting samples with no face masks or protective suits.
Incredibly some scientists didn’t even wear gloves as they entered caves to collect fecal bat swab samples, beaming for the camera and oblivious to the dangers.
The damning photos tell a different story to an official 2017 journal, when the institute insisted: "Bat samplings were conducted ten times from April 2011 to October 2015 at different seasons in their natural habitat at a single location (cave) in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China.
“All members of field teams wore appropriate personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, tear-resistant gloves, disposable outerwear, and safety glasses.
“Bats were trapped and fecal swab samples were collected as described previously.”
One of the party even gave an interview to state-run news agency Xinhua, admitting he forgot his protective gear and was sprayed with bat urine or blood.
Intelligence sources in the US and UK were “monitoring the deleted photos with great interest”, The Sun was told.
Matthew Henderson, director of the Asia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, and a former British diplomat in China, told The Sun: "China has still not clearly explained how the outbreak started, without it we are obliged to draw our own conclusions.
“There is ample evidence of such a cavalier approach to biosecurity by Chinese scientists based in Wuhan laboratories that it is no surprise that western Governments are now seriously considering whether COVID-19 could have escaped from one."
Earlier this month photos from the same Wuhan lab showed a broken seal on a store containing 1,500 virus strains - including the bat coronavirus linked to the devastating pandemic.
The images were published by the state-owned China Daily before they too were swiftly deleted.
A picture of the fridge-freezer revealed a flimsy loose seal on the door, as a lab worker pulled out a chilled box containing deadly samples while wearing gloves and a mask.
Several insiders claimed the deadly bug wasn't manufactured as a bioweapon but to prove China was on par with - or superior to - the US, in its ability to fight infections.
“Patient zero" was a laboratory worker at the Wuhan lab who spread the virus into the community, sources said.
When President Trump was asked about the extraordinary claims, he said: "More and more we’re hearing the story.
"And we'll see. We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened."
Blaming the Wuhan meat market - where bats are not sold - was reportedly an effort to deflect blame from the communist government when the lab's containment efforts failed.
US officials warned two years ago that safety lapses during the study of bats could lead to a coronavirus outbreak.
Secret cables from American embassy officials were obtained following their 2018 visits to the Wuhan lab now at the centre of a global focus.
The missives revealed fears of inadequate safety precautions by those conducting the bat studies could result in a deadly new strain of coronavirus.
One US official said: “The cable was a warning shot. They were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.”
The cables reveal that the US Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
In 2015, the lab had become China’s first to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety.
But the cables argued that the US should give the Wuhan lab further support – because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but dangerous.
In 2017 the institute published research showing that horseshoe bats they collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same population that spawned the 2003 SARS virus.
The Chinese government has put a total lockdown on information related to the virus origins.
Beijing has yet to provide samples of the coronavirus collected from the earliest cases.
Officials at the Wuhan lab have dismissed allegations coronavirus came from their facility, branding them ‘baseless conspiracy theories’.
But genetic evidence indicates the virus was not artificially engineered and likely originated in bats.
The genetic data cannot yet indicate exactly where and how the virus first crossed to humans.
China President Xi Jinping warned the public about the virus on January 20 - when more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence.
During the six days the world was unaware of the virus, the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the global outbreak - hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people, and millions began to travel through for Lunar New Year celebrations.
On March 11, the virus was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.
Other reports have also emerged alleging China attempted to cover up its role in the extent of the pandemic by silencing whistleblowers and muzzling scientists, while concerned doctors have ominously disappeared.

Downing Street did not take issue with President Trump’s remarks. ‘There are clearly questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus,’ a spokesman for Boris Johnson said.
The edited material includes a page of the institute’s website showing pictures of staff entering caves to take swabs from bats carrying coronaviruses – with the scientists wearing minimal protective equipment.

In theory, any intersection on the map between viral and human proteins is a place where drugs could fight the coronavirus. But instead of trying to develop new drugs to work on these points of interaction, we turned to the more than 2,000 unique drugs already approved by the FDA for human use. We believed that somewhere on this long list would be a few drugs or compounds that interact with the very same human proteins as the coronavirus.
We were right.
Our multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, called the QCRG, identified 69 existing drugs and compounds with potential to treat COVID-19. A month ago, we began shipping boxes of these drugs off to Institut Pasteur in Paris and Mount Sinai in New York to see if they do in fact fight the coronavirus.
In the last 4 weeks, we have tested 47 of these drugs and compounds in the lab against live coronavirus. I’m happy to report we’ve identified some strong treatment leads and identified two separate mechanisms for how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings were published on April 30 in the journal Nature.

The testing process
The map we developed and the FDA drug catalog we screened it against showed that there were potential interactions between the virus, human cells and existing drugs or compounds. But we didn’t know whether the drugs we identified would make a person more resistant to the virus, more susceptible or do anything at all.
To find those answers we needed three things: the drugs, live virus and cells in which to test them. It would be optimal to test the drugs in infected human cells. However, scientists don’t yet know which human cells work best for studying the coronavirus in the laboratory. Instead we used African green monkey cells, which are frequently used in place of human cells to test antiviral drugs. They can be readily infected with the coronavirus and respond to drugs very closely to the way human cells do.
After infecting these monkey cells with live virus, our partners in Paris and New York added the drugs we identified to half and kept the other half as controls. They then measured the amount of virus in the samples and the number of cells that were alive. If the samples with drugs had a lower virus count and more cells alive compared to the control, that would suggest the drugs disrupt viral replication. The teams were also looking to see how toxic the drugs were to the cells.
After sorting through the results of hundreds of experiments using 47 of the predicted drugs, it seems our interaction predictions were correct. Some of the drugs do in fact work to fight the coronavirus, while others make cells more susceptible to infection.
It is incredibly important to remember that these are preliminary findings and have not been tested in people. No one should go out and buy these drugs.
But the results are interesting for two reasons. Not only did we find individual drugs that look promising to fight the coronavirus or may make people more susceptible to it; we know, at a cellular level, why this is happening.
We identified two groups of drugs that affect the virus and they do it two different ways, one of which has never been described.
Disrupting translation
At a basic level, viruses spread by entering a cell, hijacking some the cell’s machinery and using it to make more copies of the virus. These new viruses then go on to infect other cells. One step of this process involves the cell making new viral proteins out of viral RNA. This is called translation.
When going through the map, we noticed that several viral proteins interacted with human proteins involved in translation and a number of drugs interacted with these proteins. After testing them, we found two compounds that disrupt the translation of the virus.
The two compounds are called ternatin-4 and zotatifin. Both of these are currently used to treat multiple myeloma and seem to fight COVID-19 by binding to and inhibiting proteins in the cell that are needed for translation.
Plitidepsin is a similar molecule to ternatin-4 and is currently undergoing a clinical trial to treat COVID-19. The second drug, zotatifin, hits a different protein involved in translation. We are working with the CEO of the company that produces it to get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.

Sigma receptors
The second group of drugs we identified work in an entirely different way.
Cell receptors are found both inside of and on the surface of all cells. They act like specialized switches. When a specific molecule binds to a specific receptor, this tells a cell to do a specific task. Viruses often use receptors to infect cells.
Our original map identified two promising MV cell receptors for drug treatments, SigmaR1 and SigmaR2. Testing confirmed our suspicions.
We identified seven drugs or molecules that interact with these receptors. Two antipsychotics, haloperidol and melperone, which are used to treat schizophrenia, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two potent antihistamines, clemastine and cloperastine, also displayed antiviral activity, as did the compound PB28 and the female hormone progesterone.
Remember, all these interactions have so far only been observed in monkey cells in petri dishes.
At this time we do not know exactly how the viral proteins manipulate the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. We think the virus uses these receptors to help make copies of itself, so decreasing their activity likely inhibits replication and reduces infection.
Interestingly, a seventh compound – an ingredient commonly found in cough suppressants, called dextromethorphan – does the opposite: Its presence helps the virus. When our partners tested infected cells with this compound, the virus was able to replicate more easily, and more cells died.

This is potentially a very important finding, but, and I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.
All these findings, while exciting, need to undergo clinical trials before the FDA or anyone else should conclude whether to take or stop taking any of these drugs in response to COVID-19. Neither people nor policymakers nor media outlets should panic and jump to conclusions.
Another interesting thing to note is that hydroxychloroquine – the controversial drug that has shown mixed results in treating COVID-19 – also binds to the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. But based on our experiments in both labs, we do not think hydroxychloroquine binds to them efficiently.
Researchers have long known that hydroxychloroquine easily binds to receptors in the heart and can cause damage. Because of these differences in binding tendencies, we don’t think hydroxychloroquine is a reliable treatment. Ongoing clinical trials should soon clarify these unknowns.
Treatment sooner rather than later
Our idea was that by better understanding how the coronavirus and human bodies interact, we could find treatments among the thousands of drugs and compounds that already exist.
Our idea worked. We not only found multiple drugs that might fight SARS-CoV-2, we learned how and why.
But that is not the only thing to be excited about. These same proteins that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect and replicate in human cells and that are targeted by these drugs are also hijacked by related coronaviruses SARS-1 and MERS. So if any of these drugs do work, they will likely be effective against COVID-22, COVID-24 or any future iterations of COVID that may emerge.
Are these promising leads going to have any effect?
The next step is to test these drugs in human trials. We have already started this process and through these trials researchers will examine important factors such as dosage, toxicity and potential beneficial or harmful interactions within the context of COVID-19. – The Conversation | Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: What coronavirus ‘copy machine’ looks like</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 invades a human cell, the crucial next stage is replication, when it creates copies after copies of itself. For this, the virus uses its “copy machine”, which is an enzyme with this function. Trials with various drugs are targeting various stages of virus activity, and some of them, notably remdesivir, seek to inhibit specifically the enzyme that multiplies the genetic material of the virus.
Now, researchers have reported that they have determined the 3D structure of this “copy machine”. This makes it possible to investigate how drugs such as remdesivir work, they note.
How it works
The first stage of infection is the virus entering the human cell. On the surface of the virus is a spike-shaped protein, the so-called “corona”, which binds itself to a human cell enzyme, ACE2. The virus then acidifies compartments on the cell surface, enters, and then begins to replicate using the body’s own mechanism.
SARS-CoV2 is made of a single strand of RNA, which is what is copied and recopied. Enzymes that enable the creation of RNA (or DNA) are called polymerases; in the case of SARS-CoV2, the polymerase is called RdRp, also named nsp12. It is the polymerase whose structure researchers have now described.
What is new
The 3D structure has been determined by researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, led by director Patrick Cramer, the institute said in a statement.
They reconstituted the polymerase from three purified proteins. Once it was functional in the test tube, they examined the samples under an electron microscope, magnified more than 100,000 times. “One sample looked different, somehow strange. Our first thought was to discard it. Fortunately, we did not: This sample, over all, provided us with the high-quality data we needed,” researcher Dimitry Tegunov said in the statement.
The team reported that in overall architecture, the SARS-CoV2 “copy machine” is similar to that of SARS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for SARS. However, they also noted distinguishing features. One of these is an additional element in the SARS-CoV2 polymerase, with which it binds the RNA until it has copied the genetic material.
“We were surprised to find that the structure of the coronavirus polymerase is special — it differs from other structures that we have been investigating so far,” researcher Hauke Hillen said.
Why it matters
The researchers repeatedly referred to remdesivir, which work by blocking the polymerase. Their description of the 3D structure comes amid mixed signals from studies on remdesivir. While some trials have found the results encouraging, a study published in The Lancet this week has reported that the clinical benefits from administering remdesivir were not found to be statistically significant.
Knowledge of the architecture of the polymerase on an atomic scale is important, nevertheless, as it opens up new avenues to understand and combat the virus. The team plans to investigate how antiviral substances block the proliferation of coronaviruses.
“With the structure at hand it might be possible to optimize existing substances such as remdesivir and to improve their effect. But we also want to search for new substances that are able to stop the virus polymerase,” said Cramer, the Max Planck director.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant dinosaur delights neighbours during coronavirus lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A giant inflatable dinosaur has been spotted “waddling” the streets of Watford by delighted neighbours isolating in their homes.
Georgina Cooper, a 35-year-old mum, has been using her daily walk to entertain her community as their friendly local Tyrannosaurus-Rex.
Mrs Cooper, who has two sons aged one and five, said she bought the dinosaur costume from eBay “for fun” but after its popularity “spiralled out of control” she began collecting money for PPE in care homes during the coronavirus crisis.
She said she lost her severely disabled cousin Miriam, who the family only want known by her first name, after care home workers unwittingly brought the virus into her accommodation and she died after testing positive.
Mrs Cooper is unsure whether care home workers who provided 24 hour care for her cousin were equipped with PPE, although she noted the care homes where she has delivered donations have had “varied” levels of PPE.
“We would never point fingers at the carers or anything like that, they do an amazing job looking after our relatives. It’s just unfortunate,” she said.
“The dinosaur is filled with air so it’s got a little fan inside to keep it big,” she said.
“When it’s windy, it takes the head with it so you can’t see where you’re going and the head is flying around. You have to hold on to it.
“Also the legs are quite big so you can’t walk normally, I have to walk with my legs quite wide apart. It’s a little bit awkward.
“When I walk it has a big kind of waddle and the bottom sways and everyone laughs.
“They say the best bit is seeing it walk off because you can see it waddling down the road.”
“So many people come out on their doorstep, waiting and waving. It’s not just kids, it’s people of all ages who come out to see the dinosaur,” she said.
“It’s been really well received.
“There was one particular cul-de-sac that I went down which has lots of bungalows, and people were in wheelchairs and things like that outside their houses.
“It was so nice because they might not have seen anyone pass their house.
“It was really nice to have that sort of impact without even collecting any money for the PPE that I’ve been buying, just for people to be smiling and have something to brighten their day is really nice.”

Mrs Cooper, now also known as Georgina the Woodside Dinosaur, has been using her daily walk to cheer up neighbours and collect donations to ensure carers are better protected from catching and spreading the virus.
“The dinosaur is filled with air so it’s got a little fan inside to keep it big,” she said.

Since popularity for the Woodside Dinosaur has snowballed, Mrs Cooper made a Facebook page called ‘Have You Seen The Woodside Dinosaur’ with her daily routes for her fans.
“So many people come out on their doorstep, waiting and waving. It’s not just kids, it’s people of all ages who come out to see the dinosaur,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant dinosaur delights neighbours during coronavirus lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A giant inflatable dinosaur has been spotted “waddling” the streets of Watford by delighted neighbours isolating in their homes.
Georgina Cooper, a 35-year-old mum, has been using her daily walk to entertain her community as their friendly local Tyrannosaurus-Rex.
Mrs Cooper, who has two sons aged one and five, said she bought the dinosaur costume from eBay “for fun” but after its popularity “spiralled out of control” she began collecting money for PPE in care homes during the coronavirus crisis.
She said she lost her severely disabled cousin Miriam, who the family only want known by her first name, after care home workers unwittingly brought the virus into her accommodation and she died after testing positive.
Mrs Cooper is unsure whether care home workers who provided 24 hour care for her cousin were equipped with PPE, although she noted the care homes where she has delivered donations have had “varied” levels of PPE.
“We would never point fingers at the carers or anything like that, they do an amazing job looking after our relatives. It’s just unfortunate,” she said.
Mrs Cooper, now also known as Georgina the Woodside Dinosaur, has been using her daily walk to cheer up neighbours and collect donations to ensure carers are better protected from catching and spreading the virus.
“The dinosaur is filled with air so it’s got a little fan inside to keep it big,” she said.
“When it’s windy, it takes the head with it so you can’t see where you’re going and the head is flying around. You have to hold on to it.
“Also the legs are quite big so you can’t walk normally, I have to walk with my legs quite wide apart. It’s a little bit awkward.
“When I walk it has a big kind of waddle and the bottom sways and everyone laughs.
“They say the best bit is seeing it walk off because you can see it waddling down the road.”
Since popularity for the Woodside Dinosaur has snowballed, Mrs Cooper made a Facebook page called ‘Have You Seen The Woodside Dinosaur’ with her daily routes for her fans.
“So many people come out on their doorstep, waiting and waving. It’s not just kids, it’s people of all ages who come out to see the dinosaur,” she said.
“It’s been really well received.
“There was one particular cul-de-sac that I went down which has lots of bungalows, and people were in wheelchairs and things like that outside their houses.
“It was so nice because they might not have seen anyone pass their house.
“It was really nice to have that sort of impact without even collecting any money for the PPE that I’ve been buying, just for people to be smiling and have something to brighten their day is really nice.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Most states fall short of coronavirus testing thresholds | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATLANTA >> As more states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, most are falling short of the minimum levels of testing suggested by the federal government and recommended by a variety of public health researchers, an Associated Press analysis has found.
Three months into an unprecedented public health emergency, the White House has largely resisted calls for a coordinated plan to conduct the millions of tests experts say are needed to contain the virus. What federal officials outlined recently isn’t even an official benchmark, and AP’s analysis found that a majority of states are not yet meeting it.
With no specific guidelines, states are left to figure out what a successful testing program should be while they simultaneously try to reopen their shattered economies. If states don’t have robust testing, public health experts say they will be unable to detect outbreaks quickly enough to contain them, which could lead to more shutdowns.
“It’s dangerous and irresponsible,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown University.
In many states, testing has been limited to hospitalized patients, high-risk individuals and front-line workers. But most public health experts agree that containing the virus will require a massive expansion of testing that eventually includes millions of patients without symptoms, which is not happening now.
A testing blueprint released Monday by the Trump administration lacked any metrics state officials could use to make informed decisions. Instead, the document made clear that states are responsible for testing, saying the federal government is the “supplier of last resort.”
The closest the White House has come to issuing a benchmark does not actually appear in the document. At a recent briefing, senior administration officials said the government would provide each state with enough tests, swabs and related materials to screen at least 2.6% of their populations in May and June. Those hit harder by the outbreak would be eligible for additional assistance.
It was unclear how the 2.6% figure was reached. When asked about it, officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services described it as 2% of state populations per month without explaining the discrepancy. Officials also did not respond to questions about whether the administration has a target for how many daily tests should be done nationwide or when it would issue more details.
Only about 40% of states currently meet even the 2% testing threshold, according to AP’s analysis. The percentage is expected to rise as states increase their testing capabilities. The AP based the monthly testing rate for each state on the average number of new daily tests over the most recent 7 days. The data is from the COVID Tracking Project and includes counts up to April 30th.
A White House spokesman said Friday that the administration’s testing threshold is only a suggestion and that states are ultimately responsible for deciding how to reopen in a “safe and responsible manner.” The administration says it is working to expand testing and has been highlighting plans first announced in March for additional testing sites at retail pharmacy chains.
States that do not meet the administration’s testing guidance, based on their current screening rates, include some that have been moving into the early stages of reopening, such as Colorado, South Carolina and Texas. Georgia, which has moved aggressively to ease restrictions and lift its stay-at-home order, is just under the 2% threshold.
Louisiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers have been putting pressure on Democratic governors to reopen, are falling short, according to the AP analysis. In Kansas, the governor and top health administrator expect to reach the 2% mark this month.
Florida, which announced its first phase of reopening will start next week, also falls short but has said it will be able to test 30,000 to 40,000 people a day if needed. Michigan, where the Republican-led legislature has sued the Democratic governor over the state’s stay-at-home order, is on track to test 2.2% of its population.
Former health officials and experts were critical of the testing blueprint and said the 2.6% or 2% population metric was too vague and didn’t take into account guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control on who should be tested.
“Why don’t they say, ‘We’ll test everybody with any symptoms of coronavirus and all their contacts?’” said Dr. James Curran, a former assistant U.S. surgeon general who worked at CDC for 25 years. “If that amounts to 2% that’s fine, but the guidelines are not to test 2%. The guidelines are to test who needs it.”
Many experts already say the national testing rate falls short of what is needed to safely ease social distancing guidelines.
Researchers at Harvard have calculated that the U.S. needs to be testing roughly 500,000 people per day before considering easing restrictions this month. That’s a nearly 150% increase from the recent daily tally of approximately 200,000 tests.
“I’ve described it and I still describe it as an absolute bare minimum,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
More than half of states are not testing their populations at the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues. The Harvard team developed their statistics in mid-April and noted that projections for U.S. cases have increased since then.
Many states hardest hit by the crisis failed to reach the team’s testing recommendations, even if they were already testing more than 2% of their populations, according to an AP analysis using state-by-state figures provided by Harvard. States falling short of the Harvard numbers include many of the epicenters of the outbreak, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Jha and his colleagues based their testing targets, in part, on the number of tests needed to screen enough people to push positive results below 10%, the level that the World Health Organization considers sufficient to contain the outbreak. More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.
Former CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.
Officials in at least 20 states have indicated their testing capacity is not adequate and said they are taking steps to address this, according to a review by the AP. But there is little consensus among states on how many people should be tested or whether that should include those with no symptoms.
Georgia, where in-person dining at restaurants is now permitted with restrictions, has not said how many people it would like to test but recently touted its ability to test over 20,000 people on a single day and has encouraged more people to get tested. New Jersey, which has a slightly smaller population and a higher number of COVID-19 cases, has said it would need to conduct 20,000 to 30,000 tests a day to reopen.
Ohio wants to increase testing from 7,200 per day to 22,000 by May 27. Washington state, which has seen one of the largest U.S. outbreaks, has reported averaging 4,650 tests a day and wants to do more than 22,000 but lacks the necessary supplies.
Most states have convened advisory panels to help in setting guidelines, but they run the gamut in terms of expertise and will result in a patchwork of policies that experts say may be ineffective in containing a virus that doesn’t respect state borders.
“Treading water on testing is not going to get us out of this,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Analysis: Most states fall short of coronavirus testing thresholds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ATLANTA — As more states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, most are falling short of the minimum levels of testing suggested by the federal government and recommended by a variety of public health researchers, an Associated Press analysis has found.
Three months into an unprecedented public health emergency, the White House has largely resisted calls for a coordinated plan to conduct the millions of tests experts say are needed to contain the virus. What federal officials outlined recently isn’t even an official benchmark, and AP’s analysis found that a majority of states are not yet meeting it.
With no specific guidelines, states are left to figure out what a successful testing program should be while they simultaneously try to reopen their shattered economies. If states don’t have robust testing, public health experts say they will be unable to detect outbreaks quickly enough to contain them, which could lead to more shutdowns.
“It’s dangerous and irresponsible,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown University.
In many states, testing has been limited to hospitalized patients, high-risk individuals and front-line workers. But most public health experts agree that containing the virus will require a massive expansion of testing that eventually includes millions of patients without symptoms, which is not happening now.
A testing blueprint released Monday by the Trump administration lacked any metrics state officials could use to make informed decisions. Instead, the document made clear that states are responsible for testing, saying the federal government is the “supplier of last resort.”
The closest the White House has come to issuing a benchmark does not actually appear in the document. At a recent briefing, senior administration officials said the government would provide each state with enough tests, swabs and related materials to screen at least 2.6% of their populations in May and June. Those hit harder by the outbreak would be eligible for additional assistance.
It was unclear how the 2.6% figure was reached. When asked about it, officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services described it as 2% of state populations per month without explaining the discrepancy. Officials also did not respond to questions about whether the administration has a target for how many daily tests should be done nationwide or when it would issue more details.
Only about 40% of states currently meet even the 2% testing threshold, according to AP’s analysis. The percentage is expected to rise as states increase their testing capabilities. The AP based the monthly testing rate for each state on the average number of new daily tests over the most recent 7 days. The data is from the COVID Tracking Project and includes counts up to April 30th.
A White House spokesman said Friday that the administration’s testing threshold is only a suggestion and that states are ultimately responsible for deciding how to reopen in a “safe and responsible manner.” The administration says it is working to expand testing and has been highlighting plans first announced in March for additional testing sites at retail pharmacy chains.
States that do not meet the administration’s testing guidance, based on their current screening rates, include some that have been moving into the early stages of reopening, such as Colorado, South Carolina and Texas. Georgia, which has moved aggressively to ease restrictions and lift its stay-at-home order, is just under the 2% threshold.
Louisiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers have been putting pressure on Democratic governors to reopen, are falling short, according to the AP analysis. In Kansas, the governor and top health administrator expect to reach the 2% mark this month.
Florida, which announced its first phase of reopening will start next week, also falls short but has said it will be able to test 30,000 to 40,000 people a day if needed. Michigan, where the Republican-led legislature has sued the Democratic governor over the state’s stay-at-home order, is on track to test 2.2% of its population.
Former health officials and experts were critical of the testing blueprint and said the 2.6% or 2% population metric was too vague and didn’t take into account guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control on who should be tested.
“Why don’t they say, ‘We’ll test everybody with any symptoms of coronavirus and all their contacts?’” said Dr. James Curran, a former assistant U.S. surgeon general who worked at CDC for 25 years. “If that amounts to 2% that’s fine, but the guidelines are not to test 2%. The guidelines are to test who needs it.”
Many experts already say the national testing rate falls short of what is needed to safely ease social distancing guidelines.
Researchers at Harvard have calculated that the U.S. needs to be testing roughly 500,000 people per day before considering easing restrictions this month. That’s a nearly 150% increase from the recent daily tally of approximately 200,000 tests.
“I’ve described it and I still describe it as an absolute bare minimum,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
More than half of states are not testing their populations at the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues. The Harvard team developed their statistics in mid-April and noted that projections for U.S. cases have increased since then.
Many states hardest hit by the crisis failed to reach the team’s testing recommendations, even if they were already testing more than 2% of their populations, according to an AP analysis using state-by-state figures provided by Harvard. States falling short of the Harvard numbers include many of the epicenters of the outbreak, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Jha and his colleagues based their testing targets, in part, on the number of tests needed to screen enough people to push positive results below 10%, the level that the World Health Organization considers sufficient to contain the outbreak. More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.
Former CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.
Officials in at least 20 states have indicated their testing capacity is not adequate and said they are taking steps to address this, according to a review by the AP. But there is little consensus among states on how many people should be tested or whether that should include those with no symptoms.
Georgia, where in-person dining at restaurants is now permitted with restrictions, has not said how many people it would like to test but recently touted its ability to test over 20,000 people on a single day and has encouraged more people to get tested. New Jersey, which has a slightly smaller population and a higher number of COVID-19 cases, has said it would need to conduct 20,000 to 30,000 tests a day to reopen.
Ohio wants to increase testing from 7,200 per day to 22,000 by May 27. Washington state, which has seen one of the largest U.S. outbreaks, has reported averaging 4,650 tests a day and wants to do more than 22,000 but lacks the necessary supplies.
Most states have convened advisory panels to help in setting guidelines, but they run the gamut in terms of expertise and will result in a patchwork of policies that experts say may be ineffective in containing a virus that doesn’t respect state borders.
“Treading water on testing is not going to get us out of this,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A potential treatment for Covid-19 using plasma from recovered patients is to be trialled by doctors at London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital.
The first donations of the plasma have been collected and transfusions will begin in “the coming weeks”, the hospital’s Biomedical Research Centre said in a statement.
It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.
The hospital says if the trials prove the treatment to be effective, NHS Blood and Transplant will begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma per week to the NHS, enough to treat 5,000 patients each week.
The trial is co-led by Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, a consultant in intensive care medicine at the hospital, along with experts from NHS Blood and Transplant and the University of Cambridge.
“As a new disease, there are no proven drugs to treat critically ill patients with Covid-19. Providing critically ill patients with plasma from patients who have recovered… could improve their chances of recovery,” said Dr Shankar-Hari.
Health and Social Care secretary Matt Hancock said: “This global pandemic is the biggest public health emergency this generation has faced and we are doing absolutely everything we can to beat it.
“The UK has world-leading life sciences and research sectors and I have every hope this treatment will be a major milestone in our fight against this disease.
“Hundreds of people are participating in national trials already for potential treatments and the scaling up of convalescent plasma collection means thousands could potentially benefit from it in the future.”
The BBC reported there was currently enough plasma to transfuse to 143 patients.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID -19: No approved drug, vaccine yet — NAFDAC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) says it has not approved any drug or vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19.
The Director General of the agency, Mojisola Adeyeye, said in a statement on Saturday that NAFDAC had not granted approval for any vaccine for the treatment and cure of COVID-19.
“To put the record straight, no drugs or vaccines have been given approval in the country for cure of COVID-19,” Mrs Adeyeye, a professor, said.
“While the medical researchers globally, the Federal Government of Nigeria and the World Health Organisation (WHO), are working tirelessly on the discovery of vaccines and drugs to cure COVID-19, the agency urges the public to desist from making unsubstantial claims.
“NAFDAC is the only authority in the country to grant approval to such drugs and vaccines.”
The NAFDAC boss’ statement came as the US Food and Drug Administration announced the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir on hospitalised coronavirus patients.
Last week, the World Health Organisation warned against the use of a herbal cure for coronavirus after Madagascar’s president launched a plant-based tonic named Covid-Organics.
Mrs Adeyeye said that NAFDAC would continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to safeguard the health of Nigerians and that in the event of any approved drug or vaccine for the cure of COVID-19, the agency would not hesitate to inform the public.
Mrs Adeyeye, however, advised Nigerians to comply strictly with measures issued by NCDC to prevent the spread of COVID-19, adding that these include the use of face covering masks, social distancing, washing of hands and use of alcohol based sanitisers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus 'more likely' to claim lives of people with vitamin D deficiency</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">People with vitamin D deficiency could be more likely to die from coronavirus, a study has suggested.
As the UK continues following strict lockdown measures – which include restrictions on time outdoors – research has shown that a vitamin usually procured from natural sunlight could help boost Covid-19 survival rates.
In the study, scientists from Queen Elizabeth Hospital Foundation Trust and the University of East Anglia write: “We believe, that we can advise Vitamin D supplementation to protect against SARS-CoV2 infection.”
The paper, published on Research Square, states that vitamin D levels are found to be severely low in the ageing population, especially in Spain, Italy and Switzerland.
This is also the group most vulnerable for Covid-19.
It reads: "Severe deficiency is defined as a serum 25(OH)D lower than 30nmol/L. In Switzerland, mean vitamin D levels are 23(nmol/L) in nursing homes and in Italy 76% of women over 70 years of age have been found to have circulating levels below 30nmol/L.
"These are countries with high number of cases of COVID–19 and the aging people is the group with the highest risk for morbidity and mortality with SARS-Cov2.
"The research has not yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists and only offers up tentative evidence at this point."
The authors of the paper also acknowledge: “The number of cases/country is affected by the number of tests performed.”
Currently the NHS website recommends people consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day.
It adds: “This is because you may not be getting enough vitamin D from sunlight if you’re indoors most of the day.”
But while the NHS acknowledges emerging reports of vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus, it states that currently there is no evidence that this is the case.
It also warns people to refrain from buying more vitamin D than they need.
Last week, Dr Rachel Neale said that 10 minutes of sunshine a day could trigger the production of Vitamin D and potentially help reduce the risk of coronavirus, as she has found it does with other respiratory infections.
Dr Neale, a researcher at Brisbane’s QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, says it would "make sense" if having low levels of vitamin D left people more vulnerable to worse symptoms of coronavirus.
However, she added that research was needed to confirm whether or not this is the case.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cancer patients may face high risk of death from COVID-19: Study</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cancer patients with COVID-19 are much more likely to die due to novel coronavirus infection than those without the malignant disease, according to a study led by an Indian-origin researcher who says the findings may help protect this vulnerable section of the global population.
The study, published in the journal Cancer Discovery, is the largest so far to assess outcomes for patients with cancer who have also been infected with COVID-19, according to the researchers.
“Our findings emphasise the need to prevent cancer patients from contracting COVID-19 and — if they do — to identify and closely monitor these individuals for dangerous symptoms,” said Vikas Mehta, a co-lead author of the study from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the US.
“We hope that our findings can inform states and communities that have not yet been so severely struck by this pandemic about the unique vulnerability cancer patients face,” Mehta added.
In the study, the scientists assessed 218 cancer patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 18 to April 8 at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, US — one of the worst hit regions by the pandemic in the country.
They found that a total of 61 cancer patients died from COVID-19 — a dramatically high case-fatality rate of 28 per cent.
In comparison, they said, the mortality rate for COVID-19 in the US is 5.8 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
“A key element is that mortality appears to be more closely related to frailty, age, and co-morbidities than to active therapy for cancer,” said co-senior author Balazs Halmos from Einstein College of Medicine.
“Our data suggest that we should not stop lifesaving cancer therapies, but rather develop strategies to minimise potential COVID-19 exposures and re-evaluate therapies for our most vulnerable cancer populations,” explained Amit Verma, co-senior author of the study.
According to the researchers, the time period during which these patients were treated was earlier in the epidemic when testing was almost exclusively done in sicker, symptomatic patients who required hospitalization.
They said this may partially explain the high fatality rate within the study’s cancer population.
However, even when compared to mortality rates in non-cancer patients at Montefiore and across New York City during the same time period, the study noted that cancer patients demonstrated a significantly higher risk of dying from COVID-19.
As a group, COVID-19 patients with hematologic (blood) cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, had the highest mortality rate of 37 per cent (20 of 54 patients), the scientists said.
And for patients with solid malignancies, they said the mortality rate was 25 per cent (41 of 164).
The researchers reported some striking differences among specific solid cancers in the study.
They said the mortality rate for patients with lung cancer was 55 per cent, and for those with colorectal cancer, it was 38 per cent, compared with mortality rates of 14 per cent for breast cancer, and 20 per cent for prostate cancer.
According to the study, certain underlying conditions such as older age, hypertension, heart disease, and chronic lung disease were significantly associated with increased mortality among cancer patients with COVID-19.
More than half of those with cancer who died due to COVID-19 (37 out of 61 patients) had been in places with a higher risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus, such as nursing homes, hospitals, or emergency departments within the 30 days before being diagnosed with the highly contagious disease.
The scientists said this period was before widespread social distancing had been implemented.
Citing the limitations of the study, the researchers said they could not fully account for all of the patients’ pre-existing health conditions prior to COVID-19 infection.
Differential treatments paradigms for COVID-19 infection were also not controlled for in the study, the scientists said.
“We also acknowledge that the mortality rate is highly dependent on the breadth of testing, and therefore understand that more widespread detection of viral infection would likely alter the results,” they wrote in the study.
The researchers believe that further studies assessing a larger population of cancer patients with more rigorous control for other factors may help validate the findings.
“These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population,” they concluded in the study.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The labourers, who belong to eastern UP's Basti district, about 260 km from the state capital Lucknow, have been quarantined at a college. The quarantine centre is being sanitised
Seven daily-wage labourers from Uttar Pradesh who returned from Maharashtra have tested positive for the coronavirus. Earlier this week, the central government allowed stranded migrants, tourists and students to return to their homes amid a nationwide lockdown announced due to coronavirus.
The labourers, who belong to eastern UP's Basti district, about 260 km from the state capital Lucknow, have been quarantined at a college. The quarantine centre is being sanitised, according to a report in NDTV.
The administration is tracing and isolating those who came in contact with these labourers.
All those who came in contact with these patients are being traced and isolated, according to the officials concerned.
It is reportedly the largest group of migrants who have been tested positive for coronavirus since returning to Uttar Pradesh.
Lakhs of migrant labourers were stuck at their workplaces across the country after PM Narendra Modi announced a lockdown on March 25 to check the spread of coronavirus.
Coronavirus impact: No dearness allowance hike for govt employees
With no transport facility available, daily wage labourers - who were left without work set for the journey to their hometowns on foot.
Nearly 2,300 people have tested positive for coronavirus and at least 42 have died in Uttar Pradesh which was the first state to allow special buses to bring back migrants.
The central government on Wednesday allowed movement of stranded labourers, students and tourists five weeks after the nationwide shutdown.
Many states, including Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Telangana, have requested special trains to ferry migrant workers back home.

The first special train ferrying over 1,200 stranded migrant labourers from Telangana to Jharkhand reached its destination Hatia Friday night, from where the state government would take them to their respective districts in sanitised buses, following COVID-19 protocols.
The train starting from Lingampally in Telangana to Hatia is the first one run by the railways since its services were suspended due to the nationwide lockdown.
For social-distancing measures, only 54 passengers are allowed per coach, which has a capacity of 72. In coupes, six passengers have been allowed in, instead of eight, the spokesperson said.
The other five "Shramik Special" trains announced by the railways are -- Nasik to Lucknow (9:30 pm), Aluva to Bhubaneswar (6 pm), Nasik to Bhopal (8 pm), Jaipur to Patna (10 pm) and Kota to Hatia (9 pm).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 hinterland digest: Exodus from Rajasthan; Bhopal struggling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus has been extended for two more weeks, but businesses will be allowed some relaxation in zones declared free of the diseas. Metro cities will remain under lockdown, . Around 1,230 people have died in India due to the virus.
Business Standard takes a look at regional editions of Hindi newspapers to provide you with a picture of the Covid-19 situation in the hinterland.
The march to home: Over a million stranded register to go home
By Friday evening, around 1.15 million people had registered on the Rajasthan government's website in hopes of returning home. These include students, travellers, and migrant workers, reported Dainik Bhaskar. A train on Friday left for Ranchi from Kota carrying over 1,200 students. Likewise, another train left for Bihar carrying migrant workers. The government told that five trains will run on a regular basis from Saturday, Authorities informed that Rajasthan has sent back 38,000 labourers and workers to different states will now using various means of transportation. 7,000 workers will return to Uttar Pradesh soon. Similar is the case with states like Haryana, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand. The government of Rajashthan has ensured that these workers and labourers will be provided with food and stay till they can be sent back.
Bhopal still struggling: 75% wards in red zone
Bhopal is seeing a rise in the number of coronavirus patients and also a rise in infected areas. Within a week, eight zones have entered the red category from orange, reports Dainik Bhaskar. Also, five wards that were in the green zone are now in the red zone. Till now, 64 wards in Bhopal have been declared as red zones. This is an addition of 12 zones from April 25. The silver lining, however, is that 12 orange zone wards have moved to green zones. This has led to the end of the orange zone in the city.
UP Bar Associaton to provide financial help to 3,961 lawyers
The High Court Bar Association in Prayagraj has prepared a list of 3,961 lawyers who qualify for some financial help in wake of coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown enforced across the nation, reports Dainik Jagran. The association said that it would provide an assistance of Rs 2,000 each to these lawyers. This would incur an expenditure of Rs 79.22 lakh on the association. It says that the money would reach the accounts of these lawyers by Saturday. The association head JB Sigh said that they had approached the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for help but it was denied. He said if the demand for help comes up again then a decision would be taken accordingly. Meanwhile, the head office of UP Bar Council in Prayagraj has been shut until further orders.
Liquor fiasco grips Chhattisgarh
Liquor smuggling is increasing by the day in Chhattisgarh, reports Patrika. Illicit selling of liquor has created a huge problem for the administration. Despite the increasing number of cases, arrests of culprits are not taking place. This goes on to show the involvement of the local leaders and ministers. Police is not taking action due to the involvement of the leaders in power, said the newspaper. The police is only ceasing the liquor but not taking action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Screened, certified, home on their mind, 1,140 leave Kerala for Odisha</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first batch of 1,140 migrant workers from Odisha, who were living and working in Ernakulam district of Kerala, boarded a special train arranged by the Railways to take them home. The non-stop train destined for Bhubaneswar left from Aluva railway station at 10 pm on Friday.
V S Sunil Kumar, minister in-charge of the district, said that Railways informed them about the plan to run the train. A helpdesk jointly run by police, revenue and health departments began registration of the migrants at several camps early Friday.
G Venu, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ernakulam Rural, said the migrants who wanted to go home were chosen on first come-first serve basis, though priority was given to women, children and elderly people. As soon as news of the train flashed on local news channels, long queues formed in areas like Perumbavoor, a hub of migrant workers.
The workers were screened for symptoms of cough, cold, headache and fever. Those who passed were given certificates testifying that they were medically fit.
The officer said that those who could not get into the first batch were assured that there would be more trains in the coming days. Migrant link workers, who had been chosen by the district administration to keep channels of communication open with the workers, continuously worked the phones to tell them in Odiya that they would be allowed to go home.
A heavy contingent of police officers was deployed at Aluva railway station to take stock of the measures. Volunteers packed bread, bananas and water to be distributed to the workers in the train.
By 7 pm, the first batch of workers were ferried to the station in state transport buses. The minister, district collector and top police officers welcomed them with food and checked their medical credentials.

A migrant link worker from Odisha said on a loudspeaker that only two workers should sit on each seat in the train. They must wear masks at all times and wash hands regularly. They were warned against pulling the emergency chain to stop the train.
“The state’s responsibility was to pick them up from their camps, register them using their identification cards, conduct medical check-ups, provide food for the 34-hour journey and ferry them to the station. We have done a systematic job. Railways informed us that workers have to buy tickets for the journey,” the minister said.
Railways is expected to arrange all medical facilities on the train. “We have sent all the details of the travellers to the Odisha government. They can take a decision on quarantining measures,” the minister added.
Milon Shaikh, a migrant link worker from West Bengal, said there is massive interest among the workers in going home. The control room in Ernakulam is receiving hundreds of calls every day for the same.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US regulators approve use of experimental drug to treat coronavirus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US REGULATORS HAVE approved emergency use of an experimental drug that appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster.
It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalised Covid-19 patients.
The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir’s effects could be rigorously evaluated.
President Donald Trump announced the FDA’s action at the White House.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that is not certain from the partial results revealed so far.
The National Institutes of Health’s Dr Anthony Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill Covid-19 patients like those in this study.
The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital.
The FDA said the intravenous drug would be specifically for hospitalised patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
Early days 
FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said “this was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved”, calling the drug “an important clinical advance”.
Dr Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.
“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Dr Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”
The FDA said preliminary results for federal researchers warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir”.
The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to doctors and patients, the FDA said.
The drug, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.
The FDA authorised the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies.
But during public health emergencies, the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental drug’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.
Gilead has said it would donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the US government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to places most in need of it.
No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.
“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specialising in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”
The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalised patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication.
Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible Covid-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.
The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US regulators have approved the use of the first drug which appears to help coronavirus patients recover quicker.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the use of remdesivir, a drug previously used to treat ebola patients, after studies showed it shortened recovery time by 31 per cent, or around four days on average, for hospitalised Covid-19 patients.
Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average, compared to 15 days for the placebo group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
The drug is can now be administered to patients with severe conditions, such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US FDA Approves Emergency Use Of Anti-Viral Drug Remdesivir For Covid-19 Patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19.
In an FDA fact sheet for patients and their families and caregivers, the agency on Friday (1 May) noted that remdesivir has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product, reports Xinhua news agency.
Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral medicine to treat certain people in the hospital with COVID-19, said the FDA, adding the drug was still being studied.
"There is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19," said the FDA.
Remdesivir was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some people.
There are no medicines approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat people in the hospital who have COVID-19.
Therefore, the FDA has authorized the emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 under an EUA, said the agency.
Remdesivir is given to patients through a vein one time each day for up to 10 days depending on recommendations of healthcare providers, according to the FDA.
The drug may help decrease the amount of the coronavirus in bodies and help patients get better faster, said the agency.
Possible side effects of remdesivir include infusion-related reactions and increases in levels of liver enzymes, according to the FDA.
"These are not all the possible side effects of remdesivir. Remdesivir is still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time," said the FDA.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Remdesivir gets US emergency approval for treating Covid-19 patients: Know all about the antiviral drug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US has allowed the emergency use of the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir to treat Covid-19 based on early clinical data that shows it helps coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients recover faster.
Remdesivir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, is the world’s first drug approved based on clinical data to treat Covid-19, which has killed close to 240,000 people worldwide and infected over three million.
Emergency-use authorization allows products to be used for treatment without full data on their safety and efficacy, which has to be still submitted as trial continue.
“This was lighting speed in terms of getting something approved. From clinical trial to getting it authorized, it was 90 days,” said US Food and drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking at the White House with President Donald Trump at his side.
Remdesivir, when administered by an intravenous infusion, helped patients recover on an average in 11 days, compared to 15 days taken by those on placebo.
The emergency use of remdesivir is limited to hospitalised Covid-19 patients with low blood-oxygen levels or who need breathing support, the FDA said in its letter of authorisation.
“Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating COVID-19, and that, when used under the conditions described in this authorization, the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat Covid-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products; and there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative,” said the FDA in the letter.
A treatment will help tide the pandemic till an effective vaccine, now expected to be ready as early as six months, is available to protect against the disease and help reopen the economies and lower social-distancing restrictions, which have led to job losses, closed schools and wrecked global economy.
“Remdesivir covered by this authorization will be used only to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and severe disease defined as SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),” said FDA.
Hospitalised patients in need of oxygen support account for about 14% of Covid-19 patients, according to early studies of the outbreak. Patients on a mechanical ventilator or ECMO should be given the drug for 10 days, while those who are less sick should get it for five days, the company said.
“Gilead Sciences now plans to expand trials to many countries, excluding India. Available data shows it is one of foremost potential drugs against disease, and since the supply is limited, according to Gilead, India must consider ways to make this drug available to its population. In the past, India saved millions by providing affordable and effective anti-retroviral drugs to treat HIV and AIDS, not just to its own population, but also to other countries who needed them, including to many countries in Africa,” said Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, emeritus scientist and former director general of Indian Council of Medical Research.
Two anti-malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, have been approved for use against Covid-19 in India and the US, but these have not undergone rigorous clinical trials.
Gilead is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.
“Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir,” Gilead said in a statement.
Gilead has scaled up manufacturing of remdesivir from zero production in January to make 500,000 treatment courses by October. It plans to double that number by December through production tie-ups with a consortium of pharmaceutical companies around the world.
“One trial compared five days regimen with 10 days regimen and noted equal clinical recovery time. There was no control group and effect on deaths was not studied. Another trial was randomised, had a control group of standard care, and observed a benefit in reduction of recovery time from severe illness. The impact on death was, however, not statistically significant and hence unproven. The need for larger controlled clinical trials, which can demonstrate clear impact on hard clinical endpoints including mortality reduction, remains as search for an effective life-saving cure remains. Other trials are underway, including the World Health Organisation’s multi-country SOLIDARITY trial,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.
What is Remdesivir?
•Remdesivir is a nucleoside ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase inhibitor.
•Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, is a sterile, preservative-free lyophilized solid that is reconstituted with 19mL of sterile water for injection and diluted into 0.9% saline prior to intravenous (IV) administration.
•Following reconstitution, each single-dose, clear glass vial contains a 5 mg/mL remdesivir concentrated solution with sufficient volume to allow withdrawal of 20 ml.
•Remdesivir Injection, 5 mg/mL, is a sterile, preservative- free, clear, solution that is to diluted into 0.9% saline prior to intravenous (IV) administration.
•Remdesivir for injection, 100 mg, vials should be stored below 30 °C until time of use. Remdesivir injection, 5 mg/mL vials should be stored at refrigerated temperatures (2 °C to 8 °C) until time of use.
•Following dilution with 0.9% saline, the solution can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature (20 °C to 25 °C) or 24 hours at refrigerated temperatures (2 °C to 8 °C).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: US FDA permits emergency use of drug for treating COVID-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">US coronavirus news: National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients
US regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of an experimental drug that appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight COVID-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide.
The Food and Drug Administration acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that Gilead Sciences's remdesivir shortened the time to recovery by 31 per cent, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir's effects could be rigorously evaluated.
President Donald Trump announced the FDA's action at the White House. Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. The drug also might be reducing deaths, although that's not certain from the partial results revealed so far.
The National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci said the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients like those in this study. The drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital.
Gilead has said it would donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.
The FDA previously gave emergency use authorization to a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, after President Donald Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible treatment for COVID-19. No large high-quality studies have shown the drug to work for that, however, and it has significant safety concerns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why not share data of sampling studies, ask experts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The number of cases of COVID-19 without any clear epidemiological links – the source of infection is unknown – has been on the rise from different parts of the State in the past few days.
Public health experts and doctors have now raised questions as to why, despite claims of transparency, the Health Department has not been sharing the data of the two community-level sampling studies it did, to check whether there is unknown transmission of COVID-19 in the State.
Since April 23, 900 sentinel surveillance samples are being collected by the Health Department every week from across the State from health workers, pregnant women, and police personnel, who are at higher risk of contracting the disease, and sent for RT-PCR testing for COVID-19. On April 26, the State did a one-day mass ‘augmented’ sample surveillance amongst similar groups in the community, when 3,000 plus samples were collected for testing.
However, while the Health Department has given specific directions that the surveillance study samples are not to be mixed up with routine samples (which are from a quarantined pool of people with history of travel to COVID-19-affected places), the test results have not been kept separate.
The number of new positive cases — mostly active, asymptomatic cases — from the surveillance samples are important as these are cases wherein the source of infection is unknown and indicate pockets of silent disease transmission here.
But instead of announcing the details of these surveillance studies separately, all positive cases from both studies are announced with routine sample results as cases that contracted the infection through “contacts.”
These cases should be considered separately and spatio-temporal analysis of the aggregate data will indicate the geographic area from where these positive cases are consistently reported. The daily bulletin mentions the number of surveillance samples from sentinel survey which became negative, but not the number of positives.
The bulletin on Friday said of the 3,128 samples tested as part of augmented survey, four were positive and that 35 samples were being re-tested or still remain “indeterminate”.
The total samples tested as on Friday was 27,150, which suddenly became 31,183 on Saturday. Does that mean the 3,128 samples of augmented survey were added to the total figure? But the numbers just do not add up.
Questions are being raised now on why the actual data on the community surveillance studies has not been placed in the public domain. How many samples in each population groups were tested and what was the positivity rate in each group? Which is the population sub-group at high risk? In a disease where asymptomatic cases is a major driver of transmission and with PCR tests picking up only 70% of the cases, one would expect more than four positives from 3,128 samples.
“Given the huge number of unknowns regarding COVID-19 and the fact that asymptomatic transmission is something which no government can control, it is foolish to assume that the virus will behave differently in Kerala. Even going by the official figures, the number of ‘contacts’ seems to be climbing, indicating that community transmission may have already begun,” a senior public health professional in Health Service said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kemri Researchers on Go-slow Over Unpaid Allowances</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The war against Covid-19 could be greatly affected in Kenya, after a section of researchers at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) went on go-slow over unpaid allowances.
Researchers at the facility are in the front line in the war against Covid-19 in terms of testing, and this could explain the reduced number of people being tested per day.
It is reported that doctors have been receiving their health risk, extraneous and call allowances from the government,  while the non-medical scientists including entomologists, immunologists and parasitologists have been ignored.

The doctors had to move to court to start receiving the allowances in 2018.
Kemri so far has conducted over 6000 tests since March 13, when the first case was reported in Kenya.
“It beats logic that clinical doctors who are not even part of this arrangement are paid allowances, yet those doing the testing are not paid. What language do they want us to speak so that they listen to us? If is it a strike that will make them understand, then we will go on a go slow,” said a source quoted by the Nation.
The researchers work in the labs in shifts, and are not allowed to interact, which makes it hard to compare notes.
“The only way we can compare notes with our colleagues is through phone calls when we resume work as they leave. We spend our own money to make phone calls. We do not receive phone allowances, yet our colleagues are paid despite not doing much,” said the insider.
The situation is likely to cause bad blood between medics and researchers at the institution with salary disparities coming into play.

According to sources, a research scientist with a PhD working at the institute and who is not a medic earns Ksh391,000 while a medical doctor with a master’s degree working in the same institute earns over Ksh500,000.
“We deserve better treatment and a good working environment. How can a medical doctor right from the university earn more than a PhD scientist who is now working tirelessly to ensure that the target of Covid-19 tests is met every day?” posed the source who sought anonymity.
This is despite President Uhuru Kenyatta releasing Ksh2.66 billion to the ministry of Health towards the welfare of health workers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kemri researchers on a go-slow as ministry withholds allowances</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A section of Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) staff may go on strike over unpaid allowances and bad working conditions despite their frontline role in the war against the coronavirus.
Already, some are on a go-slow, leading to a reduction in the number of samples being tested for Covid-19.
According to a source at the institute, for the last one month, there has been tension among staff. This is because the medical doctors among the staff receive their health risk, extraneous and call allowances while the non-medical scientists, who do the bulk of the work, do not.
The non-medical staff include entomologists, immunologists and parasitologists.
Since the first case was confirmed in the country, Kemri has so far conducted over 6,000 tests.
The Kemri doctors only started receiving their allowances after going to court.
According to the institute's deputy director for co-operate affairs, Davis Mkoji, in 2011, the government issued a circular approving the payment of allowances to all the health workers in the country. Kemri staff were, however, not included in the circular.
The doctors at Kemri then went to court through their union and got an order that compelled the Kemri management to pay them. They have been receiving their allowances since 2018.
Apart from the medical doctors, others who also get the allowances include clinical officers, nursing officers and all subordinate staff deployed to the institute's facilities offering clinical services.
The non-medical staff who are in the front-line of Covid-19 testing have cited discrimination and are threatening to down their tools.
“It beats logic that clinical doctors who are not even part of this arrangement are paid allowances, yet those doing the testing are not paid. What language do they want us to speak so that they listen to us? If is it a strike that will make them understand, then we will go on a go slow,” said the source who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media.
The researcher told the Sunday Nation that their work is mostly in laboratories. They work in shifts (morning and evening) and are not allowed to interact.
“The only way we can compare notes with our colleagues is through phone calls when we resume work as they leave. We spend our own money to make phone calls. We do not receive phone allowances, yet our colleagues are paid despite not doing much,” said the insider.
He also said this would have been the best time for the government to work closely with researchers as they are the ones handling and testing all the Covid-19 samples.
He gave the example of a research scientist with a PhD working at the institute and who is not a medic earning Sh391,000 while a medical doctor with a master’s degree working in the same institute earns over Sh500,000.
He alleged that the productivity of their medical colleagues is also questionable.
“These are people who have side clinics and only give the institute half of their time while those who are dedicated to the organisation are sidelined and discriminated against. We are the ones in the front line now and we are demanding that we are also given the allowances or we will not work,” he said.
“We deserve better treatment and a good working environment. How can a medical doctor right from the university earn more than a PhD scientist who is now working tirelessly to ensure that the target of Covid-19 tests is met every day?” he asked.
According to another research scientist, three-quarters of all the research that takes place at Kemri is carried out by this cadre and that when the pandemic was first reported in the country, most of them were recalled to Nairobi conduct the tests.
“Why didn’t the management recall the medical staff? Researchers need to be at peace and have a good working environment, not toiling and have nothing to show for it at the end of the month,” he said.
Mr Mkoji told the Sunday Nation that the Kemri management has been in talks with the relevant ministries to ensure that all employees are included in the allowances.
“Two weeks ago, on April 14, we wrote to the relevant authority to allow us to pay the allowances. We are very hopeful, especially now with the Covid-19, that the government will move with speed so that everyone is included in this arrangement,” he said.
He said the scientists who are now at the forefront of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic need the allowances since they are the ones doing the bulk of work and are working more hours to ensure that all the samples are tested.
WELFARE
“All we are waiting for is a letter from the government giving us the go-ahead to pay them. This is not about Kemri,” he said.
The Union of National Research Institutes Staff of Kenya (Unrisk) secretary-general Zachariah Achacha has joined the call by its members in appealing to the Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe to look into the welfare of the scientists adding that they are risking their lives by testing the coronavirus samples.
“These people work tirelessly and must be compensated and motivated. They need health risk, extraneous and emergency allowances and any other necessary allowances that their colleagues are getting,” said Mr Achacha.
He said the current environment at Kemri exposes all the workers to high health risks in terms of handling and storage of pathogens in its facilities across the country since they handle highly infectious samples and that they should be fully protected and compensated.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has released Sh2.66 billion to the ministry of Health, saying part of this money would go towards the welfare of health workers, including insurance, to deal with the negative impact of the disease.
The Health Chief Administrative Secretary, Dr Mercy Mwangangi had also indicated earlier that healthcare workers are the government's top priority and that their terms and allowances would be reviewed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus | European leaders push vaccine financing drive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros (£6.6 billion, $8.3 billion) to find a vaccine to curb the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined the fund-raising plan for the scientific fight-back against COVID-19 on Friday.
An online pledging conference will take place on Monday to plug gaps in financing of research.
Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel gave their support in an open letter published in weekend newspapers.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and Norway’s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, also signed and all gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism about its handling of the crisis.
The funds raised will “kickstart an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals”, the leaders said.
But they warned that more money would still be needed to manufacture and deliver “available, accessible and affordable” medicines across the world.
“If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,” they added.
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Saudi Arabia and the European Commission, are co-hosting the conference, which is part of a month-long international investment drive before the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with COVID-19, said finding a treatment was “the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”.
He will confirm Britain’s pledge of £388 million for vaccine research, tests and treatments, which is part of a wider £744 million to the global effort against the virus.
“To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,” he will tell delegates, according to his office.
“The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed.”
Dozens of research projects are under way around the world to find a vaccine, which the United Nations has said is the only way for a return to normal life.
On Thursday, British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca announced a partnership with Oxford University for the large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently on trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European leaders unveil plans to raise $8 billion for Covid-19 treatments and vaccine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The European Union and its partners will host an international pledging conference on May 4 to raise $8 billion to kick-start global cooperation on effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19.
European Council President Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg issued a joint appeal on Sunday for contributions to the Coronavirus global response.
Saudi Arabia, the current president of the G20, on Sunday pledged $500 million to support the fundraising efforts and said it will co-lead the global response.
“The pledging event aims to raise funds for the immediate need of $8 billion, which the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board stated is urgently required to develop and deliver a Covid-19 vaccine, along with diagnostics and therapeutic resources,” said a statement from the Saudi government.
People familiar with developments said the Indian government is yet to take a call in participating in the drive.
The European leaders said in a statement that they intended to raise the initial $8 billion to make up a global funding shortfall estimated by the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board and others.
“The funds that we raise will kick-start an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals,” the statement said.
All the funds will be channelled through recognised global health organisations such as CEPI, Gavi, Vaccines Alliance, Global Fund and Unitaid to develop and deploy as “quickly as possible, for as many as possible, the diagnostics, treatments and vaccines that will help the world overcome the pandemic”, it added.
The European leaders said they will also support the World Health Organization and join forces with entities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust for developing diagnostics and treatment.
“While some are cautiously emerging from lockdown, others are still in isolation and see their daily social and economic lives severely restricted. Consequences could be particularly dramatic in Africa and the Global South as a whole,” the statement said.
“But what we all have in common is that none of us can really think or plan ahead with any great certainty about what the future of the pandemic really holds,” it said, emphasising the need for joint efforts against the pandemic.
The European leaders said they were building on the commitment by G20 leaders to develop a “massive and coordinated response to the virus” and had launched the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) accelerator, a global platform to scale-up research, development, access and equitable distribution of a vaccine and other life-saving therapeutics and diagnostics treatments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European leaders push vaccine financing drive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (AFP) -- European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) to tackle the global coronavirus pandemic.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined the fund-raising plan for an international effort to find a vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 on Friday.An online pledging conference will take place on Monday to plug gaps in financing of research.Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel gave their support in an open letter published in weekend newspapers.The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and Norway's Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, also signed and all gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism about its handling of the crisis.The funds raised will "kickstart an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals", the leaders said.But they warned that more money would still be needed to manufacture and deliver "available, accessible and affordable" medicines across the world."If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century," they added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US okays remdesivir for emergency Covid-19 use</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US drug regulator has allowed emergency use of experimental antiviral drug remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment based on early clinical data that showed it helps coronavirus patients recover faster. The drug is made by Gilead Sciences and is the first to be approved globally as a treatment for the viral pandemic that has killed over 240,000 people worldwide.
The emergency authorisation allows products to be used for treatment without full data on their safety and efficacy, which has to be still submitted as trials continue. “This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved. From clinical trial to getting it authorised, it was 90 days,” said US Food and drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Stephen Hahn.
Remdesivir, when administered by an intravenous infusion, helped patients recover in 11 days on average , compared to 15 days taken by those on placebo, according to a study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
US President Donald Trump, who announced the authorisation at the White House on Friday accompanied by top officials of his coronavirus task force and Gilead CEO Dan O’Day, called the drug the “hot thing” and “an important treatment for hospitalised coronavirus patients” and a “promising situation”.
The emergency use will be limited to hospitalised Covid-19 patients with low blood-oxygen levels or those who need breathing support, the FDA said.
“It is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, when used under the conditions described in this authorisation, the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat Covid-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products,” the US regulator said. “Remdesivir... will be used only to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and severe disease defined as SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).”
Hospitalised patients in need of oxygen support account for about 14% of Covid-19 patients, according to early studies of the outbreak. Patients on mechanical ventilator or ECMO should be given the drug for 10 days, while those who are less sick should get it for five days, Gilead said.
“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force.
Former Indian Council of Medical Research director-general Dr Nirmal K Ganguly said Gilead plans to expand remdesivir trials to many countries, excluding India. “Since the supply (of remdesivir) is limited, according to Gilead, India must consider ways to make this drug available to its population,” said Ganguly.
Public Health Foundation of India president Dr K Srinath Reddy said one trial compared five days’ regimen with 10 days’ regimen and noted equal clinical recovery time. “There was no control group and effect on deaths was not studied. Another trial was randomised, had a control group of standard care, and observed a benefit in the reduction of recovery time from severe illness. The impact on death was, however, not statistically significant and hence unproven.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19.
Washington: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19. In an FDA fact sheet for patients and their families and caregivers, the agency on Friday noted that remdesivir has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product, reports Xinhua news agency.
Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral medicine to treat certain people in the hospital with COVID-19, said the FDA, adding the drug was still being studied.
"There is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19," said the FDA.
Remdesivir was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some people.
There are no medicines approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat people in the hospital who have COVID-19.
Therefore, the FDA has authorized the emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 under an EUA, said the agency.
Remdesivir is given to patients through a vein one time each day for up to 10 days depending on recommendations of healthcare providers, according to the FDA.
The drug may help decrease the amount of the coronavirus in bodies and help patients get better faster, said the agency.
Possible side effects of remdesivir include infusion-related reactions and increases in levels of liver enzymes, according to the FDA. "These are not all the possible side effects of remdesivir. Remdesivir is still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time," said the FDA

    <h5 class="mb-1">US approves use of anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat coronavirus patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antiviral drug remdesivir has been approved by US regulators to treat hospitalised Covid-19 patients.
After studied showed remdesivir a drug previously used to treat ebola patients, shortened recovery time by 31 per cent, or around four days on average, for hospitalised Covid-19 patients, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its use.
Patients given the remdesivir drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average, compared to 15 days for the placebo group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.
Now, the drug can be administered to patients with severe conditions, such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.
In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies.
But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.

The United States's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the emergency use of the Ebola drug remdesivir for treating the novel coronavirus.
BBC explains that the authorisation means that the anti-viral drug can now be used on people who are hospitalised with severe Covid-19.
Legit.ng gathers that a recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten the recovery time for people who were seriously ill.

The BBC report, however, states that the drug did not significantly improve survival rates.
The drug was originally developed to treat Ebola. Though it helped reduce the recovery time for COVID-19 patients, experts warned that remdesivir should not be seen as a "magic bullet" for treating coronavirus.
In a meeting with the US President Donald Trump, Daniel O'Day, the chief executive of Gilead pharmaceutical company which developed the drug said the FDA authorisation was an important first step.
He disclosed that the company would donate 1.5 million vials of the drug.
According to BBC, emergency FDA authorisation is not the same as formal approval, which requires a higher level of review.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US approves Ebola drug for treatment of COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Authorities in the United States will allow the emergency use of Ebola drug remdesivir for treating patients with severe COVID-19.
The anti-viral drug was shown to help shorten the recovery time for people who were hospitalised with the coronavirus in recent clinical trials.
However the emergency authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration means usage has been rushed through without the usual higher levels of review medication goes through before it can be rolled out for treating the public.
Medical experts have since warned that the use of the Ebola drug, which is manufactured by Gilead pharmaceutical company, should not be seen as a “magic bullet” for COVID-19.
‘Important first step’The company will donate 1.5 million doses of the drug to help during the crisis, in what Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day said during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office was an “important first step”.
“It’s the first authorised therapy for Covid-19, so we’re really proud to be part of it,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, also present at the meeting, added.
US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that remdesivir shortened the duration of symptoms suffered by patients with Covid-19 from 15 days to 11 during clinical trials on 1063 different people with the virus in hospitals around the world.
Head of NIAID, Dr Anthony Fauci, said that the use of remdesirvir had a “clear cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery”.
Even so, while the drug may speed up recovery, and potentially stop the need for some patients to be treated in intensive care, there was no clear evidence it could actually prevent further deaths from the virus.
On Saturday morning, 65,603 deaths from coronavirus have been confirmed in the US.
Convalescent plasmaMeanwhile, in the UK, a potential treatment that uses plasma from recovered patients is being trialled at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London.
Transfusions are expected to begin in the next few weeks.
It is hoped that the “convalescent plasma” treatment will help patients whose bodies are failing to produce enough antibodies to fight Covid-19.
The NHS Blood and Transplant service is on standby to begin a national programme to deliver up to 10,000 units of convalescent plasma a week to the NHS if the treatment is proven to be effective.
That would be enough to treat 5,000 patients in hospital a week.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Solar, wind energy struggle as coronavirus takes toll</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The U.S. renewable energy industry is reeling from the new coronavirus pandemic, which has delayed construction, put thousands of skilled laborers out of work and sowed doubts about solar and wind projects on the drawing board.
In locked-down California, some local agencies that issue permits for new work closed temporarily, and some solar companies furloughed installers.
In New York and New Jersey, SunPower CEO Thomas Werner halted installation of more than 400 residential solar systems, fearing for his workers' safety.
As many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost, trade groups say.
"There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak," said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. "Up to half our jobs are at risk."
Leaders are confident the future is bright. But the worldwide slowdown is delaying a transition to cleaner energy that scientists say is not happening quickly enough to curtail climate change.
Even as some states move toward reopening, executives fear diminished incomes and work disrupted by layoffs and social distancing will do lasting damage.
The wind industry is plagued by slowdowns in obtaining parts from overseas, getting them to job sites and constructing new turbines.
"The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two," said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. "That reversal is stunning and problematic."
Residential solar business has been hit especially hard, Hopper said, with door-to-door sales no longer feasible and potential customers watching their wallets. Deals with commercial buyers also have slumped.
New solar installations could be 17% lower worldwide than expected this year, and wind turbine manufacturing could fall up to 20%, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
"Pre-pandemic, there were great dreams and aspirations for a record-setting year," said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy, a utility-scale wind and solar developer. "I'm sure we're not going to have that."
Fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal remain the leading providers of the nation's electricity, with nuclear power another key contributor, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
But renewable sources—wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal—have jumped in the last decade as production costs have fallen and many states have ordered utilities to make greater use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables produced nearly one-fifth of the country's energy last year.
The EIA predicts renewable energy, despite recent setbacks, will grow 11% this year—an indication of the sector's strong surge before the economy tanked. Meanwhile, coal-fired power is expected to decline 20% and gas generation to grow just 1%.
The setback for renewable energy still has been painful—even in California, where residential solar demand took off due to frequent blackouts and state laws requiring to new homes to produce as much energy as they consume.
"A lot of companies are just trying everything they can to just limp along and keep their workforce," said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
All 20 employees were temporarily furloughed at Cinnamon Energy Systems, which sells residential and commercial solar systems in Northern California.
"I'm sure we'll bounce back, just smaller," CEO Barry Cinnamon said, adding that people might not spend as much as they once did, because their income will likely be down. "Whether that's months or years, nobody knows."
Luminalt, a San Francisco solar company, furloughed most of its 40 employees. And when work resumes, CEO Jeanine Cotter expects that projects will take longer and cost more to keep installers safe.
"Think about working on a roof with a mask," Cotter said. "And think about not being able to pass a power tool to somebody unless you disinfect it before you pass it on."
Since his furlough in mid-March, Luminalt solar technician Tom Hicks has been collecting benefits but no salary—and he's worried about mortgage payments.
"My 401k got crushed by 30% just like everyone else," said Hicks, 55. "How much time do I have to recover?"
Still, there are hopeful signs. The Boston-based developer Longroad recently began a utility-scale solar project in California and secured new financing for another in Texas.
Sunnova Energy International, a Houston-based residential solar and energy storage service provider, is doing more videoconferencing and fewer in-person dealings with customers. But CEO John Berger said, "Our installations are still moving ahead, service is still moving ahead, we still see customers paying us."
In eastern Kansas, construction has continued at Southern Power's 200-megawatt Reading Wind Facility despite delayed parts shipments, company spokeswoman Helen Northcutt White said. Sixty-two turbines are planned for the facility, scheduled to go online in mid-May.
The wind and solar industries have asked lawmakers and federal agencies for help, including an extension of their four-year deadlines for completing projects without losing tax benefits. Similar assistance was granted during the 2008-09 recession.
The renewable energy industry's health is crucial to improving the climate and to a strong economic recovery, said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.
"These businesses, these workers deserve immediate relief," Davis said.
It's important to push for more responsible energy use as the economy reopens worldwide, said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, which studies climate change and oceans.
"My hope is that we would use this as an opportunity to build toward an economy that doesn't depend on burning coal and oil and that is more resilient to the climate impacts that are heading our way," Pershing said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus lockdowns across the U.S. may be helping clear the air of pollution, but the pandemic has also led to a setback for the country's renewable energy industry, The Associated Press reports.
The wind and solar sectors were on good footing before the pandemic struck but now trade groups are predicting as many as 120,000 jobs in solar and 35,000 in wind could be lost when all is said and done. "There are many smaller companies going out of business as we speak," said Abigail Ross Harper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. "Up to half our jobs are at risk."
The wind industry is struggling to get parts from overseas, while residential solar businesses are taking the brunt of the hit in that industry since door-to-door sales aren't possible anymore, and individual customers are being cautious during the downturn. Subsequently, new solar installations could drop 17 percent this year, while wind manufacturing could fall up to 20 percent, consulting firm Wood McKenzie estimates.
"The industry was on a tremendous roll right up until the last month or two," said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. "That reversal is stunning and problematic."
But while the pandemic has caused the industry pain, there's a sense things will turn around again in the long run. Andrew Pershing, the chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, for example, hopes the pandemic eventually results in an economy "that doesn't depend on burning coal and oil."

“Pre-pandemic, there were great dreams and aspirations for a record-setting year,” said Paul Gaynor, CEO of Longroad Energy, a utility-scale wind and solar developer. “I’m sure we’re not going to have that.”
Fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal remain the leading providers of the nation’s electricity, with nuclear power another key contributor, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
But renewable sources — wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal — have jumped in the last decade as production costs have fallen and many states have ordered utilities to make greater use of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables produced nearly one-fifth of the country’s energy last year.
The EIA predicts renewable energy, despite recent setbacks, will grow 11% this year — an indication of the sector’s strong surge before the economy tanked. Meanwhile, coal-fired power is expected to decline 20% and gas generation to grow just 1%.
The setback for renewable energy still has been painful — even in California, where residential solar demand took off due to frequent blackouts and state laws requiring to new homes to produce as much energy as they consume.
“A lot of companies are just trying everything they can to just limp along and keep their workforce,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association.
All 20 employees were temporarily furloughed at Cinnamon Energy Systems, which sells residential and commercial solar systems in Northern California.
“I’m sure we’ll bounce back, just smaller,” CEO Barry Cinnamon said, adding that people might not spend as much as they once did, because their income will likely be down. “Whether that’s months or years, nobody knows.”
Luminalt, a San Francisco solar company, furloughed most of its 40 employees. And when work resumes, CEO Jeanine Cotter expects that projects will take longer and cost more to keep installers safe.
“Think about working on a roof with a mask,” Cotter said. “And think about not being able to pass a power tool to somebody unless you disinfect it before you pass it on.”
Since his furlough in mid-March, Luminalt solar technician Tom Hicks has been collecting benefits but no salary — and he’s worried about mortgage payments.
“My 401k got crushed by 30% just like everyone else,” said Hicks, 55. “How much time do I have to recover?”
Still, there are hopeful signs. The Boston-based developer Longroad recently began a utility-scale solar project in California and secured new financing for another in Texas.
Sunnova Energy International, a Houston-based residential solar and energy storage service provider, is doing more videoconferencing and fewer in-person dealings with customers. But CEO John Berger said, “Our installations are still moving ahead, service is still moving ahead, we still see customers paying us.”
In eastern Kansas, construction has continued at Southern Power’s 200-megawatt Reading Wind Facility despite delayed parts shipments, company spokeswoman Helen Northcutt White said. Sixty-two turbines are planned for the facility, scheduled to go online in mid-May.
The wind and solar industries have asked lawmakers and federal agencies for help, including an extension of their four-year deadlines for completing projects without losing tax benefits. Similar assistance was granted during the 2008-09 recession.
The renewable energy industry’s health is crucial to improving the climate and to a strong economic recovery, said Matthew Davis, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.
“These businesses, these workers deserve immediate relief,” Davis said.
It’s important to push for more responsible energy use as the economy reopens worldwide, said Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer with Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine, which studies climate change and oceans.
“My hope is that we would use this as an opportunity to build toward an economy that doesn’t depend on burning coal and oil and that is more resilient to the climate impacts that are heading our way,” Pershing said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub ‘are staying in the maternity den and are doing well’.
A giant panda loaned by China to a Dutch zoo as part of a breeding pair has given birth to a cub.
Ouwehands Zoo said the mother, Wu Wen, and her cub “are staying in the maternity den and are doing well”.
The zoo said following Friday’s birth that it is “delighted and proud to contribute to the protection of this endangered species in a natural way”.
The new cub’s gender will not be known until it leaves the maternity den, likely in a few months’ time, with its mother.
Wu Wen and male panda Xing Ya arrived in the Netherlands from Sichuan province in 2017, as part of a loan programme. The zoo said the new cub also belongs to China and can remain in the Netherlands for four years before going to China to join the breeding programme there.
Around 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, the majority within China, while an estimated 1,864 live in the wild.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Giant panda cub born at Ouwehands zoo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The female giant panda Wu Wen gave birth to a cub at the Ouwehands Zoo in Rhenen on Friday. Both pandas are doing well, and resting in a special den set up like a maternity ward, the zoo announced.
"The birth of the young brings a wonderful end to an uncertain period that followed after mating in January. Wu Wen had been staying in her farrowing hole more often and for some time. In recent days she almost never came out," the zoo explained.
The apparently pregnant panda had started acting extremely restless at about 10 a.m. on Friday. She was also grunting and licking between her legs, which led caregivers to predict she was going into labor.
Her first cub was born at about 1:30 p.m. The gender of the cub will not be known to the zoo for the time being. "When the young comes out of the maternity den in a few months we can determine what the sex is. Only then does the little giant panda get a name."
While in the maternity den, the cub will grow bigger and stronger, and learn to walk. Once it is able to follow its mother around they will enter the main panda enclosure together.
Just like its parents, Xing Ya and Wu Wen, the giant panda cub is owned by China. It is expected the cub will remain in the Netherlands for four years before going to China to help breed more pandas.
"Ouwehands Zoo is happy and proud that they contribute in a natural way to the conservation of this endangered species," the zoo said.

Newfoundland and Labrador's number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 remains at 259, with 232 people having recovered.
There were no new cases reported over the weekend.
The majority of the cases are in the St. John's area, as Eastern Health is reporting 241 of the total positive tests.
Four people are in hospital due to the virus. Of these patients, two are in intensive care.

2:45 p.m.
New Brunswick is entering its third week with no new COVID-19 cases.
The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick remains at 118, but all have recovered.
Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, says it's good to be outside in warmer weather.
But she's cautioning that one family should consistently restrict their interactions to one other chosen family, a process known as "bubbling."

2:35 p.m.
Nova Scotia is reporting six more COVID-19 deaths at the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax, the site of the majority of the province's active cases.
The death toll in the province is now at 37, with 31 of those at the non-profit facility.
As of Sunday, Nova Scotia has 347 active cases of COVID-19, with 220 involving residents of Northwood.
The managers of the facility announced the deaths Sunday, saying it is an "incredibly heartbreaking time."

1:45 p.m.
A justice advocacy group says it wants prisoners at a federal institution in British Columbia ravaged by a COVID-19 outbreak to know there are people in the community fighting for their safety.
Meenakshi Mannoe of the Vancouver Prison Justice Day Committee says members will rally outside Mission Institution today and make noise from within their cars or at a safe physical distance.
The committee is calling for the urgent care of all prisoners across Canada and the immediate release of detainees to ensure adequate physical distancing and quarantine measures.
The B.C. government said yesterday that 133 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at the prison.

1:25 p.m.
Quebec is reporting 892 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, as well as 1,317 additional cases from April that were not previously included in the provincial tally.
The province says those previous cases originated mostly from the Montreal, Laval and Monteregie areas, and were not counted due to a technical problem.
The province now has 31,865 cases and 2,205 deaths, the latter an increase of 69 over yesterday.
Quebec says 7,258 people have recovered from the illness.

1 p.m.
Quebec's education minister is telling the province's English-language school boards that they don't have the right to refuse to reopen their elementary schools amid concern over COVID-19.
Jean-Francois Roberge's office says in an email that the government has the exclusive legal jurisdiction when it comes to deciding when the school year resumes after a pause brought on by the global pandemic.
Last week, the province's English-language school boards association signalled to the minister that they would reopen "if and when" they believed the situation to be safe, regardless of the government's schedule.
While high schools are closed for the remainder of the school year, most elementary schools and daycares are scheduled to reopen May 11, with those in hard-hit Montreal set to follow a week later.

11:40 a.m.
The federal government is investing millions to boost online access to health services and to support a Vancouver biological company's research into treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the new funding during his daily news conference in Ottawa this morning as provinces across the country prepare to start re-opening on Monday.
The government is spending $240 million to boost access to online health services, including mental-health support and virtual access to doctors for primary care.
Ottawa is also providing $175 million to AbCellera Biologics Inc., which Trudeau says has shown promising signs of progress in identifying antibodies that could be used create a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
11:15 a.m.
A rapid test developed for COVID-19 has experienced a setback.
Ottawa's Spartan Bioscience says it is voluntarily recalling its COVID-19 product and performing additional studies after Health Canada expressed some concerns Friday.
Spartan says Health Canada was concerned about the "efficacy of the proprietary swab" for the testing product. The company says Health Canada had no concerns about the accuracy and analytical performance of the product.
Health Canada says the product is restricted to research use only until adequate evidence of clinical performance can be provided.
10:50 a.m.
Ontario is reporting 434 new cases of COVID-19 and another 40 deaths related to the virus.
The death toll now stands at 1,216 and the COVID-19 case count has hit 17,553.
Of those cases, 12,005 have been marked as resolved.

The B.C. government said yesterday that 133 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at the prison.

Quebec is reporting 892 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, as well as 1,317 additional cases from April that were not previously included in the provincial tally.
The province says those previous cases originated mostly from the Montreal, Laval and Monteregie areas, and were not counted due to a technical problem.
The province now has 31,865 cases and 2,205 deaths, the latter an increase of 69 over yesterday.
Quebec says 7,258 people have recovered from the illness.

Quebec's education minister is telling the province's English-language school boards that they don't have the right to refuse to reopen their elementary schools amid concern over COVID-19.
Jean-Francois Roberge's office says in an email that the government has the exclusive legal jurisdiction when it comes to deciding when the school year resumes after a pause brought on by the global pandemic.
Last week, the province's English-language school boards association signalled to the minister that they would reopen "if and when" they believed the situation to be safe, regardless of the government's schedule.
While high schools are closed for the remainder of the school year, most elementary schools and daycares are scheduled to reopen May 11, with those in hard-hit Montreal set to follow a week later.

The federal government is investing millions to boost online access to health services and to support a Vancouver biological company's research into treatment and prevention of COVID-19.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the new funding during his daily news conference in Ottawa this morning as provinces across the country prepare to start re-opening on Monday.
The government is spending $240 million to boost access to online health services, including mental-health support and virtual access to doctors for primary care.
Ottawa is also providing $175 million to AbCellera Biologics Inc., which Trudeau says has shown promising signs of progress in identifying antibodies that could be used create a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
11:15 a.m.
A rapid test developed for COVID-19 has experienced a setback.
Ottawa's Spartan Bioscience says it is voluntarily recalling its COVID-19 product and performing additional studies after Health Canada expressed some concerns Friday.
Spartan says Health Canada was concerned about the "efficacy of the proprietary swab" for the testing product. The company says Health Canada had no concerns about the accuracy and analytical performance of the product.
Health Canada says the product is restricted to research use only until adequate evidence of clinical performance can be provided.
10:50 a.m.
Ontario is reporting 434 new cases of COVID-19 and another 40 deaths related to the virus.
The death toll now stands at 1,216 and the COVID-19 case count has hit 17,553.
Of those cases, 12,005 have been marked as resolved.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A US researcher who worked with a Wuhan virology lab gives 4 reasons why a coronavirus leak would be extremely unlikely</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A fringe theory suggests that the new coronavirus leaked by accident from a lab in Wuhan.
Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) study infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, and did before the pandemic started. So as questions about how the pandemic started continue to go unanswered, the lab has drawn scrutiny.
Matthew Pottinger, Trump’s deputy national security adviser, asked intelligence agencies in January to look into the idea of a Wuhan lab leak, The New York Times reported. But CIA officers didn’t find any evidence.
There’s a reason for that, according to Jonna Mazet, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, who has worked with and trained WIV researchers in the past.
“I know that we worked together to develop very stringent safety protocol, and it’s highly unlikely this was a lab accident,” she told Business Insider. Here are four reasons why.
The WIV houses China’s only Biosafety-level-4 laboratory. Scientists study the most dangerous and infectious microbes known to humankind in these types of facilities. Some of the institute’s researchers, including virologist Shi Zhengli, have collected, sampled, and studied coronaviruses that circulate Chinese bats. In 2013, Shi and her collaborators pinpointed the bat population most likely responsible for spreading SARS, in the Shitou Cave near Kunming.
After her team sequenced the COVID-19 virus, Shi told Scientific American that she quickly checked her laboratory’s record from the past few years to check for accidents, especially during disposal. Then she cross-referenced the new coronavirus’ genome with the genetic information of other bat coronaviruses her team had collected. They didn’t match.
“That really took a load off my mind,” Shi said told Scientific American, adding, “I had not slept a wink for days.”
Mazet has met and worked with Shi through PREDICT, a pandemic early-warning program started by the US Agency for International Development. The program has trained staff and funded labs in 30 countries, including the WIV, but President Donald Trump shut down PREDICT last fall.
“I’ve spoken to her recently,” Mazet said of Shi. “She is absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening.”
Mazet added that Shi set up a secure, shared database into which PREDICT members could upload their work for public release.
In 2018, US officials raised concerns about safety issues at WIV, according to diplomatic cables obtained by The Washington Post. But Mazet said Shi’s work in the lab and in the field was above reproach.
“In the field, they wear extreme personal protective equipment, including multiple layers of gloves, eye protection, full body suits, and masks,” she said. (She noted, however, that she has not personally visited the WIV and couldn’t speak to all the research done there.) Samples collected from bats, Mazet added, get immediately split between some vials that contain chemicals that deactivate the virus, and other containers that leave the virus alive.
All samples are then dunked into liquid nitrogen on the spot, which freezes them, then the vials are disinfected and transported to the lab. There, scientists wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) unload them into a freezer set to minus 80 degrees Celsius.
When the samples are studied later, researchers only use the deactivated, non-infectious ones, Mazet said, adding that the vials with viable virus are locked down in a special area.
Rather than a leak, the coronavirus is more likely the latest disease to have jumped from an animal host to humans, experts say.
This type of cross-species hop, called a spillover event, also led to outbreaks of Ebola and SARS. Both of those viruses originated in bats, and genetic research has all but confirmed the same for the new coronavirus – a study published in February found that it shares 96% of its genetic code with coronaviruses circulating in Chinese bat populations.
Three out of every four emerging infectious diseases come to us from other species; these pathogens are known as zoonotic diseases. The coronavirus is the seventh zoonotic virus to have spilled over into people in the last century.
The 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic – swine flu – started in pigs then killed nearly 300,000 people. People have caught bird flus via direct contact with infected poultry. Other pandemic influenza strains, including the 1957 “Asian flu” and the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic, likely started in birds, too.
And in the last 45 years, at least four epidemics have been traced back to bats.
The caves and wild habitats in which samples get collected from bats are dangerous places for people, since humans can be exposed to the live viruses circulating in the animals, Mazet said.
Shi’s researchers navigate those caves in full PPE; but tourists, hunters, poachers, and other people who rely on animals in some capacity for food or trade wander into such places less protected.
Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance (which managed PREDICT’s relationship with the WIV), told NPR last week that his colleagues are “finding 1 to 7 million people exposed” to zoonotic viruses in Southeast Asia each year.
“That’s the pathway. It’s just so obvious to all of us working in the field,” he said.
A study published in March 2019 even predicted that bats would be the source of a new coronavirus outbreak in China. That’s because the majority of coronaviruses – those that affect humans and animals – can be found in China, and many bats “live near humans in China, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock,” the authors said.
The frequency of spillover events will increase as humans encroach further into wild habitats that house disease-carrying species we haven’t interacted with before, Mazet said. Researching how past spillovers happened and which habitats present the greatest risk for such events helps scientists make predictions about the next pandemic.
Since 2014, Shi’s group at the WIV has received nearly $600,000 from a multi-million dollar, five-year grant funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to research the spillover of bat coronaviruses. The grant, which is managed by EcoHealth Alliance, was renewed for another five years in 2019.
However, after being questioned about that funding at a White House briefing on April 17, President Trump said his administration would “end that grant very quickly.”
A week later, the National Institutes of Health canceled it.
Yuan Zhiming, director of the WIV’s biosafety laboratory, told Reuters that “malicious” claims about the lab had been “pulled out of thin air” and contradicted all available evidence.
The persistent circulation of the lab-leak theory could impact future scientific cooperation and information sharing between the US and China, according to Mazet.
“What’s happening sociologically right now is our biggest risk -who’s going to want to work on this if they’re the ones put under a microscope?” Mazet said. “I think the real danger of what’s going on now is that experts like Shi and myself may not be able to keep collaborating to identify these viruses because of government pressures.” Mazet said.
That would make it harder to discover where the COVID-19 virus came from, as well as to forecast and prepare for the next spillover.
Mazet added that she worries a blame game could even put lives at risk in the short term.
“If we point fingers at other nations that have best opportunity to develop a vaccine, why would we expect them to freely share that with us?” Mazet said. “Collaboration is key right now, otherwise you have countries developing things in parallel, and you can’t assume the US is the best at everything.”

Yuan Zhiming, director of the WIV’s biosafety laboratory, told Reuters that “malicious” claims about the lab had been “pulled out of thin air” and contradicted all available evidence.
The persistent circulation of the lab-leak theory could impact future scientific cooperation and information sharing between the US and China, according to Mazet.
“What’s happening sociologically right now is our biggest risk -who’s going to want to work on this if they’re the ones put under a microscope?” Mazet said. “I think the real danger of what’s going on now is that experts like Shi and myself may not be able to keep collaborating to identify these viruses because of government pressures.” Mazet said.
That would make it harder to discover where the COVID-19 virus came from, as well as to forecast and prepare for the next spillover.
Mazet added that she worries a blame game could even put lives at risk in the short term.
“If we point fingers at other nations that have best opportunity to develop a vaccine, why would we expect them to freely share that with us?” Mazet said. “Collaboration is key right now, otherwise you have countries developing things in parallel, and you can’t assume the US is the best at everything.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Five rashes, including Covid toe, are affecting some hospital patients diagnosed with Covid-19, a small study by Spanish doctors has found.
The rashes tended to appear in younger people and lasted several days.
It is not uncommon for a rash to be a symptom of a virus, such as the spots that indicate chicken pox.
But the researchers said they were surprised to see so many varieties of rash with Covid-19.
Rashes are not currently included in the list of symptoms of the illness.
There have been many reports about "Covid toe" - a rash appearing on Covid patients' feet even in the absence of other symptoms - but lead researcher Dr Ignacio Garcia-Doval said the most common form of rash in the study was maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps that tend to appear on the torso.
"It is strange to see several different rashes - and some of them are quite specific," Dr Garcia-Doval told the BBC.
"It usually appears later on, after the respiratory manifestation of the disease - so it's not good for diagnosing patients," he added.
All the patients in the study were already in hospital and had respiratory symptoms.
The peer-reviewed paper was published this week in the British Journal of Dermatology.
All dermatologists in Spain were asked to share details of Covid patients they had seen who had developed rashes in the previous two weeks. There were 375 in total.
The five rashes were:
However, the researchers stressed that rashes can have many causes, and it can be difficult to differentiate between them without medical expertise.
"The relevance of this study is not so much in helping people self-diagnose, but rather to help build our wider understanding of how the infection can affect people," said Dr Ruth Murphy, president of the British Association of Dermatologists.
Dr Michael Head at the University of Southampton said that rashes were a well-known side effect of many viral infections, including pneumonia.
"With Covid-19, rashes and skin ulcers have been noted in a few per cent of hospitalised patients. We don't yet know the extent of these links, or precisely why this inflammation occurs in some patients but not others."
The American Academy of Determatology is also compiling a register of skin symptoms seen by its members.

Generally found in younger patients, lasted on average 12 days, appeared later on in the course of the disease, and were associated with mild infections. Accounted for 19% of cases.Outbreaks of small blisters, often itchy, found on the trunk and limbs. These were found in middle-aged patients, lasted around 10 days, and appeared before other symptoms. (9%)Pink or white raised areas of skin that looked liked nettle rash, and often itchy. Mostly on the body but sometimes on the palms of the hands. (19%)Maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps. These accounted for 47% of cases. They lasted around seven days and appeared at the same time as other symptoms but tended to be seen in patients with more severe infections.Livedo (also known as necrosis) was present in 6% of cases. The skin looked blotchy red or blue, with a net-like pattern. It's a sign of poor blood circulation.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Basra, Iraq: Bushy moustaches, thick Syrian accents, fistfights in 1930s Damascus and... medical masks? A parody of a popular Syrian television show is raising awareness on curbing the coronavirus outbreak in neighbouring Iraq.
Artists in Iraq's southern port city of Basra have adapted the beloved characters of "Bab al-Hara" ("The Neighbourhood Gate") - a 10-season period drama watched across the Arab world - to convince their compatriots to take the pandemic seriously.
In one skit, the show's main character, Abu Issam, returns to the Syrian capital, Damascus, unannounced after a long absence, just in time to keep his son from getting into a street fight.
"Put on your mask!" Abu Issam, played by Iraqi artist Mohammad Qassem, scolds his son.
When his wife - also played by Qassem - later draws close to welcome him home, Abu Issam slaps her.
"Don't you know that hugging and kissing are forbidden? We're in the time of corona(virus)! Disinfect the house!"
The scenes are meant to be lighthearted, but the messages behind them are no laughing matter, Qassem told AFP.
"We created these skits to raise the public's awareness of what measures the health ministry has asked them to commit to, how to disinfect and clean your hands, and how to abide by the lockdown," he said.
Iraq imposed a nationwide lockdown in mid-March to combat the spread of the virus, but relaxed measures to an evening and weekend curfew last week.
People quickly flooded the streets as stores opened across the country, with very few practising social distancing or wearing masks and gloves.
The language of comedy may convince people to take preventative action against the virus in ways government orders could not, said Youssef al-Hajjaj, who plays Abu Issam's son in the "Bab al-Hara" parody.
"These sketches use comedy to spread information about staying protected when leaving your homes," Hajjaj said.
Pop hits have also been used to persuade Iraqis to stay home, including a remixed music video of a beloved Egyptian hit featuring a police officer at a checkpoint.
"Corona's got us under curfew here, the world is crazy and full of fear," he croons.
Iraqi singers Wissam Daoud and Thaer Hazem were quick to put out their own tune, a ballad set to the jumpy percussion typical of Iraqi music.
official number of coronavirus cases in Iraq, many suspect numbers to be much higher.
"Be careful and don't go out, it'll get easier day by day. That's how you'll stay well and this crisis will go away," they advise.
Iraq has recorded more than 2,000 novel coronavirus cases, including over 90 deaths, although many suspect the real number of cases is much higher as authorities have yet to introduce widespread testing or contact tracing.
Basra, where health services are notoriously poor, is witnessing an uptick in infections, with nearly 100 new cases in recent days raising the total to 450.
Authorities fear a jump in case numbers could overwhelm Iraq's dilapidated health system - ravaged by decades of conflict and underdeveloped due to little investment and widespread corruption.
Qassem and his team have dedicated songs to medical staff and other artists have produced skits to show solidarity with those working long hours at Iraqi hospitals.
One video depicts a young female nurse calling her husband from the hospital, tearfully confessing she was exhausted.
"Stay strong. It's not any tougher than what we've already been through," he tells her over the phone.
Artistic director Abdullah Khaled, 28, considered it an "artistic responsibility" to support medical staff and spread reliable information about the virus.
Another film his team produced features practical tips, including how to disinfect produce and limit outings to one person per household.
Khaled's team says these videos, viewed thousands of times on Instagram, would have more of an impact than the government's conventional communications strategy.
"Awareness through videos is one of the most important tools we have to persuade people to protect themselves," said the videos' 29-year-old director Mustafa al-Karkhy.
"These videos are why people stay safe."

"Awareness through videos is one of the most important tools we have to persuade people to protect themselves," said the videos' 29-year-old director Mustafa al-Karkhy.
"These videos are why people stay safe."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Entire Stockpile Of Coronavirus Treatment Remdesivir Donated To Government, Says CEO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Sciences—which manufactures Remdesivir, the antiviral found to help hasten coronavirus patients’ recovery—is donating its entire Remdesivir stockpile to the government, said the biopharma company’s CEO in a Sunday interview on CBS.
The drug supply will be given to the federal government, which will then allocate it on as-needed basis across the country starting early next week, Gilead Sciences chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day said in the Sunday morning interview.
“We’ve donated the entire supply . . . because we acknowledge and recognize the human suffering . . . and want to make sure nothing gets in the way of this getting to patients,” said O’Day.
Though Remdesivir is not a coronavirus cure, in a study of 800 patients, the antiviral drug shortened the duration of hospital stay in users to 11 days on average, versus 15 days for COVID-19 patients who were not administered the drug.
Gilead says that 140,000-plus prescriptions will be available by the end of May, with 1 million available by 2020’s end. 
The company has yet to share what it will charge for the drug, should it be approved in the long term.
“This is really quite important,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci with a smile after Remdesivir’s promising clinical trials on Wednesday. “This will be the standard of care.”
The Food and Drug Administration gave Remdesivir emergency use authorization to treat COVID-19, meaning that it has not undergone the standard FDA vetting required of drugs on the market and it is only available for use by doctors in hospitals. In the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ 800-patient study on the drug, 50% of COVID-19 patients on the drug had shorter hospital stays than those who did not receive the drug. Also, patients who received the drug had an 8% mortality rate, compared to the 11.6% mortality rate for the non-Remdesivir group.
Foster City, California-headquartered Gilead Sciences develops and manufactures a slew of other medicines for HIV/AIDS, liver disease, hematology/oncology, inflammation and respiratory diseases, but perhaps the most common is Tamiflu, which is used to treat the common flu.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Remdesivir will be available to coronavirus patients this week: Gilead CEO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gilead Sciences has said that its antiviral drug, Remdesivir, will be available to patients as early as this week, Gilead Science CEO Daniel O’Day told American television channel CBS.
"We intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week, beginning to work with the government which will determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients are that need this medicine," O'Day said on CBS’ "Face of the Nation".
"We’ve donated the entire supply that we have within our supply chain and we did that because we acknowledge and recognize the human suffering, the human need here, and want to make sure nothing gets in the way of this getting to patients," O'Day said, according to CNBC.

"What we will do is provide that donation to the US government and they will determine — based upon things like ICU beds, where the course of the epidemic is in the United States — they will begin shipping tens of thousands of treatment courses out early this week and be adjusting that as the epidemic shifts and evolves," the Gilead CEO said.
Earlier, in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol,  a Gilead spokesperson had said that the company is open to collaborate with governments, pharmaceutical companies, including from India, and is even considering proposals of patent-pooling to expand capacity and provide access to Remesdesivir for COVID-19 patients across the world.

"It will be essential for countries to work together to create enough supply for people all over the world and we look forward to these collaborative efforts. In the event of regulatory action, we are in discussions with various groups about how we might bring remdesivir to the developing world," Gilead had said.
Earlier, on April 29, the company had said that Remdesivir helped improve symptoms in COVID-19 patients who were given the drug early than among those who were treated later.Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy

    <h5 class="mb-1">Curing Coronavirus Isn’t a Job for Social Scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The public appetite for more information about Covid-19 is understandably insatiable. Social scientists have been quick to respond. They are writing papers at a record pace, and academic journals are expediting the review process so that these new, exciting results can be published in a timely and newsworthy manner. While I understand the impulse, the rush to publish findings quickly in the midst of the crisis does little for the public and harms the discipline of social science.
Even in normal times, social science suffers from a host of pathologies. Results reported in our leading scientific journals are often unreliable because researchers can be careless, they might selectively report their results, and career incentives could lead them to publish as many exciting results as possible, regardless of validity. A global crisis only exacerbates these problems. Rushing to publish timely results means more carelessness, and the promise of favorable news coverage in a time of crisis further distorts incentives.
I am especially concerned about three trends among social scientists during the Covid-19 pandemic, the first of which is that many of them appear to be rushing their work. Good science takes time. Researchers often spend months collecting, organizing and double-checking their data. They spend more months presenting their findings and gathering feedback from colleagues before they publicly release their results. But many social scientists are already releasing and publicizing studies using Covid-19 data that was collected just days ago, and they are often failing to apply the same level of rigor that they normally would.
For example, several recent studies have asked whether partisan attitudes affect social distancing. One challenge is that it’s difficult to measure social distancing. In one recent study, survey respondents were asked to self-report their social distancing, but people often misreport their beliefs and behaviors in political surveys. Another study used GPS data to measure visits to places of interest like restaurants and movie theaters, but this seems like a poor test of social distancing at a time when many such places are closed (especially in more Democratic places). A second challenge is that even if we find a clear difference between Democratic and Republican behavior, it’s difficult to say whether this difference is explained by political attitudes or other factors. Democrats tend to live in more urban places, where the pandemic has been more severe and local governments have implemented more stringent policies and guidelines; neither of these studies accounted for these alternative explanations.
Another recent study investigated the extent to which watching “Hannity” versus “Tucker Carlson Tonight” may have increased the spread of Covid-19. This is the kind of study that might make one skeptical in normal times. An extra concern now is that the paper was likely written in just a few days. Although the authors write that they used variation in sunset times to estimate the effect of watching “Hannity,” a closer reading suggests that they’re mostly using variation in how much people in different media markets watch television and how much Fox News they watch. Maybe conservative commentators like Sean Hannity have exacerbated the spread of Covid-19, but it’s dangerous for social scientists to publicize these kinds of results before they have been carefully vetted.
Not only are social scientists rushing to write these studies, but academic journals are also rushing to publish them. An editor might typically vet submitted papers, then select experts in the field to review these papers. The reviewers might read a paper carefully and provide feedback. And then the authors would have the opportunity to revise their paper in response to that feedback, and the process would repeat (often multiple times). But for papers related to Covid-19, the typical process is being streamlined. I was recently asked to review three such papers for a scientific journal. Although an editor might normally give me six weeks to complete one review, I was asked to complete three reviews in just one week. Similarly, a political science journal asked me to referee a paper for a rapid-review series related to Covid-19. The editor explicitly stated that my review would not require the detail or length of a normal review; instead, they wanted a simple “accept” or “reject” within five days.
One possible reason for rushing science in the midst of a crisis is that the benefits of quickly getting new information to the public and to policy makers outweigh the potential costs of giving them less reliable information. Perhaps one could make this argument for those studying how to cure or prevent the spread of Covid-19. But most of the work being done by social scientists on Covid-19, while interesting and important, is not urgent. Understanding how political attitudes affect social distancing may be relevant for understanding political psychology, for example, and it might even help us design better solutions in a future pandemic, but it doesn’t significantly benefit society to have this information today.
The second troubling trend is the temptation of social scientists to speak outside their areas of expertise. There is so much we don’t know about Covid-19 and so much uncertainty about how the pandemic will play out that many are tempted to speculate and conduct their own analyses. I’ve recently seen scholars in fields as varied as political philosophy and macroeconomics giving public-health advice and predicting the future trajectory of the pandemic without seriously discussing the limits of their knowledge or the credibility of their assumptions. A legal scholar first predicted 500 deaths in the U.S., then appeared to revise that to 5,000, and most recently revised it again to 50,000. Despite the scholar’s lack of any relevant expertise or experience, these woefully optimistic early projections reportedly influenced decisions in the White House. (Apparently, this egotism is not unique to social science. Julia Gog, a mathematical modeler of infectious diseases, reports having an email folder full of documents titled “my_first_epidemic.xls.”)
The third troubling trend in social science is the temptation to overclaim. I have seen several studies and analyses by social scientists during the pandemic that are interesting, important and relevant to policy. But the studies often make stronger statements than are warranted, then journalists and policy makers run with these statements and overclaim further. Despite the appeal of favorable news coverage, part of our job as social scientists is to reliably convey the uncertainty associated with our estimates and the limitations of our studies.
In one example of these kinds of misleading claims, one study estimated the economic value of the people spared through social-distancing efforts. Essentially, the authors took estimates from epidemiologists about the number of lives that could be saved, then multiplied them with estimates of the statistical value of a life from economists. The researchers admittedly did not consider any of the potential costs of social distancing. Yet, in the concluding sentence of their abstract, they write, “Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the Covid-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.” To an economist, this sentence might simply convey that they computed large benefits but did not consider costs. But to a layperson or policy maker, it sounds like they have conducted a thorough analysis and concluded that social distancing is, on net, economically beneficial. Not surprisingly, many news outlets have cited this study to support the claim that there is no trade-off between saving lives and economic recovery.
Social scientists have for decades studied questions of great importance for pandemics and beyond: How should we structure our political system to best respond to crises? How should responses be coordinated between local, state and federal governments? How should we implement relief spending to have the greatest economic benefits? How can we best communicate health information to the public and maximize compliance with new norms? To the extent that we have insights to share with policy makers, we should focus much of our energy on that.
The Covid-19 pandemic highlights the importance of what social scientists do on a regular basis, and in time, it will provide new opportunities for us to answer long-standing, policy-relevant questions. And by the time the next crisis comes around, we won’t care whether we answered these questions in a timely or newsworthy manner. We’ll care whether we answered them well.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Curing Coronavirus Isn't a Job for Social Scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">By Anthony Fowler
(Bloomberg Opinion) — The public appetite for more information about Covid-19 is understandably insatiable. Social scientists have been quick to respond. They are writing papers at a record pace, and academic journals are expediting the review process so that these new, exciting results can be published in a timely and newsworthy manner. While I understand the impulse, the rush to publish findings quickly in the midst of the crisis does little for the public and harms the discipline of social science.
Even in normal times, social science suffers from a host of pathologies. Results reported in our leading scientific journals are often unreliable because researchers can be careless, they might selectively report their results, and career incentives could lead them to publish as many exciting results as possible, regardless of validity. A global crisis only exacerbates these problems. Rushing to publish timely results means more carelessness, and the promise of favorable news coverage in a time of crisis further distorts incentives.
I am especially concerned about three trends among social scientists during the Covid-19 pandemic, the first of which is that many of them appear to be rushing their work. Good science takes time. Researchers often spend months collecting, organizing and double-checking their data. They spend more months presenting their findings and gathering feedback from colleagues before they publicly release their results. But many social scientists are already releasing and publicizing studies using Covid-19 data that was collected just days ago, and they are often failing to apply the same level of rigor that they normally would.
For example, several recent studies have asked whether partisan attitudes affect social distancing. One challenge is that it’s difficult to measure social distancing. In one recent study, survey respondents were asked to self-report their social distancing, but people often misreport their beliefs and behaviors in political surveys. Another study used GPS data to measure visits to places of interest like restaurants and movie theaters, but this seems like a poor test of social distancing at a time when many such places are closed (especially in more Democratic places). A second challenge is that even if we find a clear difference between Democratic and Republican behavior, it’s difficult to say whether this difference is explained by political attitudes or other factors. Democrats tend to live in more urban places, where the pandemic has been more severe and local governments have implemented more stringent policies and guidelines; neither of these studies accounted for these alternative explanations.
Another recent study investigated the extent to which watching “Hannity” versus “Tucker Carlson Tonight” may have increased the spread of Covid-19. This is the kind of study that might make one skeptical in normal times. An extra concern now is that the paper was likely written in just a few days. Although the authors write that they used variation in sunset times to estimate the effect of watching “Hannity,” a closer reading suggests that they’re mostly using variation in how much people in different media markets watch television and how much Fox News they watch. Maybe conservative commentators like Sean Hannity have exacerbated the spread of Covid-19, but it’s dangerous for social scientists to publicize these kinds of results before they have been carefully vetted.
Not only are social scientists rushing to write these studies, but academic journals are also rushing to publish them. An editor might typically vet submitted papers, then select experts in the field to review these papers. The reviewers might read a paper carefully and provide feedback. And then the authors would have the opportunity to revise their paper in response to that feedback, and the process would repeat (often multiple times). But for papers related to Covid-19, the typical process is being streamlined. I was recently asked to review three such papers for a scientific journal. Although an editor might normally give me six weeks to complete one review, I was asked to complete three reviews in just one week. Similarly, a political science journal asked me to referee a paper for a rapid-review series related to Covid-19. The editor explicitly stated that my review would not require the detail or length of a normal review; instead, they wanted a simple “accept” or “reject” within five days.
One possible reason for rushing science in the midst of a crisis is that the benefits of quickly getting new information to the public and to policy makers outweigh the potential costs of giving them less reliable information. Perhaps one could make this argument for those studying how to cure or prevent the spread of Covid-19. But most of the work being done by social scientists on Covid-19, while interesting and important, is not urgent. Understanding how political attitudes affect social distancing may be relevant for understanding political psychology, for example, and it might even help us design better solutions in a future pandemic, but it doesn’t significantly benefit society to have this information today.
The second troubling trend is the temptation of social scientists to speak outside their areas of expertise. There is so much we don’t know about Covid-19 and so much uncertainty about how the pandemic will play out that many are tempted to speculate and conduct their own analyses. I’ve recently seen scholars in fields as varied as political philosophy and macroeconomics giving public-health advice and predicting the future trajectory of the pandemic without seriously discussing the limits of their knowledge or the credibility of their assumptions. A legal scholar first predicted 500 deaths in the U.S., then appeared to revise that to 5,000, and most recently revised it again to 50,000. Despite the scholar’s lack of any relevant expertise or experience, these woefully optimistic early projections reportedly influenced decisions in the White House. (Apparently, this egotism is not unique to social science. Julia Gog, a mathematical modeler of infectious diseases, reports having an email folder full of documents titled “my_first_epidemic.xls.”)
The third troubling trend in social science is the temptation to overclaim. I have seen several studies and analyses by social scientists during the pandemic that are interesting, important and relevant to policy. But the studies often make stronger statements than are warranted, then journalists and policy makers run with these statements and overclaim further. Despite the appeal of favorable news coverage, part of our job as social scientists is to reliably convey the uncertainty associated with our estimates and the limitations of our studies.
In one example of these kinds of misleading claims, one study estimated the economic value of the people spared through social-distancing efforts. Essentially, the authors took estimates from epidemiologists about the number of lives that could be saved, then multiplied them with estimates of the statistical value of a life from economists. The researchers admittedly did not consider any of the potential costs of social distancing. Yet, in the concluding sentence of their abstract, they write, “Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the Covid-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.” To an economist, this sentence might simply convey that they computed large benefits but did not consider costs. But to a layperson or policy maker, it sounds like they have conducted a thorough analysis and concluded that social distancing is, on net, economically beneficial. Not surprisingly, many news outlets have cited this study to support the claim that there is no trade-off between saving lives and economic recovery.
Social scientists have for decades studied questions of great importance for pandemics and beyond: How should we structure our political system to best respond to crises? How should responses be coordinated between local, state and federal governments? How should we implement relief spending to have the greatest economic benefits? How can we best communicate health information to the public and maximize compliance with new norms? To the extent that we have insights to share with policy makers, we should focus much of our energy on that.
The Covid-19 pandemic highlights the importance of what social scientists do on a regular basis, and in time, it will provide new opportunities for us to answer long-standing, policy-relevant questions. And by the time the next crisis comes around, we won’t care whether we answered these questions in a timely or newsworthy manner. We’ll care whether we answered them well.

The Swiss company won U.S. emergency use approval for the test that relies on taking intravenous blood draws. Roche said its test has a specificity rate of more than 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%, figures indicating very few false-positive tests and no false negatives.
“If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve...when you take blood from the vein,” Roche diagnostics head Thomas Schinecker told Reuters on Sunday. “You have to have very, very high specificity. Even 0.1 or 0.2 percent makes a difference.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day: Born May 3, 1942: Vera Caslavska, Czech gymnast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - When Vera Caslavska bowed her head and turned away in protest at the Soviet anthem during the 1968 Olympics, the Czech gymnast cemented her place as not only one of the country’s greatest athletes but also as a powerful voice against Communist rule.
Two months after Warsaw Pact tanks swept into Czechoslovakia to crush the “Prague Spring” reforms, the anti-Soviet icon dazzled at the Mexico Games, claiming four golds and becoming one of only two women to win successive titles in the all-around competition.
Yet it was her silent moment of defiance as the anthem played during the medal ceremony for the floor exercise, when she controversially shared a joint gold with a Soviet athlete after the judges upgraded the preliminary scores of her rival, that endeared her to Czechs.
It also made her a beloved figure long after her sporting career had ended.
“We Olympians were the only ones who could demonstrate our attitude to the Soviet occupation to the world at that time of occupation,” Caslavska said in a 2007 interview with iDNES.cz.
All together, Caslavska took seven golds in her two Olympic Games, including back-to-back wins in the vault. She also won the beam at Tokyo 1964 and the uneven bars in 1968.
Caslavska, who began her sporting career as a figure skater, was also the first and only gymnast to win an all-around title at an Olympic Games before winning it at the World Championships, European Championships and ensuing Olympics.
Her main rival in Tokyo, Ukrainian-born Larisa Latynina, was the only other female gymnast to win successive golds in the all-round competition, in 1956 and 1960.
“She was a phenomenal sportswoman,” Latynina told Reuters after Caslavska died in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. “Vera and I were friends and we would give each other presents. We would also swap vinyl records.”
Czech authorities, however, nearly stopped Caslavska’s journey to Mexico City in its tracks after she publicly opposed Soviet rule by signing a dissident manifesto in the spring of 1968.
Forced to hide in the mountains to avoid arrest, the gymnast only gained permission to compete at the last minute.
During her time in hiding, she lifted potato sacks to keep fit and substituted logs for beams to prepare for the games where her dominant performances and decision to use the Mexican Hat Dance as music for one of her routines won the adoration of the local fans.
Caslavska topped off her remarkable Olympics by marrying Czech 1,500 metres champion Josef Odlozil in Mexico City, 24 hours after her competition ended, in an event that drew thousands of well wishers.
Yet her triumph abroad did not translate into a warm welcome at home.
Caslavska was expelled from the Czech sports union and ostracised for criticising the 1968 invasion and refusing to withdraw her signature from the Prague Spring protest movement’s “Manifesto of 2000 Words.”
From 1974 she trained other gymnasts at home and also during a spell in Mexico. Czechs later voted her as the nation’s second-greatest athlete after runner Emil Zatopek.
When Communist rule ended in Czechoslovakia in 1989, President Vaclav Havel appointed her his adviser for sport and social issues. She also led the Czech Olympic Committee from 1990 to 1996.
Her personal life following the country’s “Velvet Revolution” that ended authoritarian rule in 1989 was not easy.
In 1993 her then ex-husband Odlozil died from injuries suffered in a fall after he was struck by their son Martin during a dispute.
In later years, Caslavska fell into a deep depression but overcame the illness and returned to public life, coaching gymnasts and serving as a mentor to younger Olympians.
She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 and died the following summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Turkey's Contact Tracers Race to Contain Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two medics in protective suits jumped out of a car in a deserted street in central Ankara and hurried inside a building - one carrying medical equipment and the other, paperwork.
Some 15 minutes later, they sped off to their next appointment, one of nearly 6,000 teams deployed across Turkey to try to stem the coronavirus pandemic by tracking down the contacts of those found to have become infected.
After recording some of the fastest growth in COVID-19 infections in the world, health officials say the outbreak in Turkey has hit a plateau around six weeks after the first case was confirmed. The death toll of 3,336 is lower than 12 other countries.

The daily death toll has been on a downward trajectory for more than 10 days, with 78 deaths confirmed in the past 24 hours, according to health ministry data on Saturday.
Health Minister Fahrettin Koca credits the country's contact tracing efforts along with Turks' largely voluntary adherence to lockdown measures, for the trend.
In contrast to South Korea, which limited deaths to below 250 with the help of a contact-tracing app, Turkey has taken a more labour-intensive approach.
Koca said on Wednesday around 5,800 teams of two or three medics had identified 468,390 people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients. He said around 99% of those had been reached and were regularly monitored by health officials.
In the capital Ankara, a coordination centre oversees the field visits and follow-up calls by telephone. The two groups cooperate to identify, test and report cases across the city.
"Since a household is on average four to five people, with the workplace added in, there have been cases where we tracked 200 people at once," said Ayse Cigdem Simsek, the Ankara Provincial Health Directorate Deputy Chairwoman of Public Health Services.
Under the system, the teams are tasked with telling contacts of a COVID-19 sufferers to stay at home for 14 days, even if they do not have symptoms.
Other teams are then instructed to call them daily to ensure compliance and check on their health. If they report symptoms, they get another visit to give a sample for testing in hospital, Kerime Altunay, a public health doctor and coordinator of the remote monitoring team in Ankara, told Reuters.
The system grew out of a method Turkey had been using for decades to contain previous outbreaks of measles and flu, Simsek told Reuters.
But while testing was launched on the day the first case was confirmed, March 11, it took a while to roll out. Initially Ankara sent testing kits to the United States when it was short of them at home, but has since ramped up testing.
Turkey, with a population of 83 million is now doing 30,000-40,000 tests a day, according to data from the Health Ministry.
Schools were closed immediately and other measures, including the closure of non-essential shops and factories and compulsory lockdowns at weekends, were brought in in stages.
The lockdown has been stricter than South Korea but less stringent than some European countries like Spain or Italy.
DEATH TOLL DEBATE
The head of the Turkish Medics Association (TTB), Sinan Adiyaman, said early in the outbreak that not enough tests were being done. The TTB has also questioned the death toll, as experts have done for other countries, and said it wants the government to include those who died with COVID-19 symptoms even if they have not tested positive.
The government says it is following reporting standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO). The TTB was not available for comment.
Irshad Shaikh, acting head of the WHO's Turkey office, told Reuters the recent declining trend in new cases showed Turkey's testing methodology was robust and that the numbers of tests were sufficient. He said contact tracing helped lessen the spread in Turkey by pinpointing the majority of people who came into contact with confirmed cases.
Shaikh said Turkey conducts tests during autopsies on suspected cases who die outside of hospitals, and repeat tests on suspected cases that initially turn up negative, which would make the potential number of errors in reporting deaths very small.
Koca said on Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak was at its peak and would decline, and that contact tracing would continue to ensure it does not reignite.
Mustafa Necmi Ilhan, head of the Public Health Department at Gazi University Medical School, said the initial speed of the outbreak in Turkey, which was similar to the worst affected countries such as Italy, prompted fears, but that contact tracing helped break the chain of infection.
Turkey also says its distinctive practice of delaying transfer of patients to intensive care from other wards has helped limit the death toll by easing pressure on instensive care resources, such as medical gear and staff.
Ankara has stressed the early use of high flow oxygen instead of intubation when respiratory difficulties appear, as well as early administration of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, before patients develop more severe symptoms.
The government said this had lowered the death rate and shortened recovery times.
Hydroxychloroquine, a decades-old generic medicine, has been touted by U.S. President Donald Trump and others as a "game changer" treatment for the highly contagious respiratory illness, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized its use in COVID-19 on an emergency basis. But there is not yet scientific proof that it works.
There are currently no approved medicines or vaccines specifically for COVID-19.
Last week the U.S. FDA cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, saying it could cause abnormal heart rhythms and dangerously rapid heart rate.
Ilhan said the drug was administered carefully, in different doses depending on the age and health of the patient. While it may have side effects, none had appeared so far, he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- The director of a maximum-security laboratory in Wuhan has rubbished claims that coronavirus originated from the lab
- Identified as Yuan Zhiming, he said it was impossible and any reports claiming such were mere speculation
- China has come under fire for how transparent it has been on reporting the outbreak
Yuan Zhiming, director of a maximum-security laboratory in Wuhan, the Chinese city which was ground zero from the outbreak of the coronavirus, has denied that the virus originated from the lab.
China is being pressured into revealing more information about the pandemic and how it handled the outbreak, with many questioning the accuracy of their statistics.
Legit.ng learnt that some people have accused the Chinese of manufacturing the virus in the maximum-security lab. The lab is equipped to deal with dangerous viruses, fueling rumours that the lab had created the virus which had then escaped.

Yuan denied this:
As early as February, the institute denied that the virus originated from their lab.
However, the United States of America has said that it would be launching an investigation into how the virus “got out into the world”.
Pressed on whether it was possible that the virus came from the lab, Yuan said:
He said that the anonymous sources quoted by the Washington Post and Fox News saying that the virus accidentally escaped the facility were "entirely based on speculation."

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Highly Unlikely’: US Researcher Rebuts Coronavirus Lab Leak Theory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the greatest mysteries of the coronavirus pandemic is how exactly the virus made its way to humans. The most widespread theory holds that it jumped from bats to humans, but some insist that a virus lab in Wuhan was at the epicentre of the outbreak.
There is very little chance, for several reasons, that the SARS-CoV-2 has been accidentally released from a Chinese laboratory, according to a US pandemic specialist who has worked with Wuhan researchers.
Mazet has led a US-funded pandemic early warning programme called PREDICT, which was wound down just months before the novel coronavirus was detected in China. That project provided money and training to virologists across the globe, including in Wuhan, the Chinese city where SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory – a rare type of lab that deals with the most dangerous pathogens in the world, with the highest level of biocontainment.
There is still scarce evidence as to where the coronavirus came from. The most widespread assumption, backed up by research, is that it has a natural origin and jumped from bats to humans, either directly or through an animal intermediary.
However, there is also a yet-unconfirmed theory that SARS-CoV-2 was leaked from the Wuhan lab. US President Donald Trump has publicly backed this theory, and the US intelligence community is currently investigating it. The lab has denied any role in spreading the virus.
Notably, however, the US national intelligence director's office has ruled out that the coronavirus was either man-made or genetically modified.
Jonna Mazet told Business Insider that she had spoken to Shi Zhengli, a prominent Wuhan researcher of bat-borne coronaviruses. She said that Zhengli is “absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening”.
Zhengli said in an interview published last month that she had gone through the lab's records and found that none of the sequences of the new coronavirus matched those of the viruses sampled by her team in the past - something that rules out a leak.
Secondly, Mazet said, Wuhan virologists use “extreme personal protective equipment” and study only the samples that have been deactivated using chemicals, while the containers with the “active” virus are kept in a special area.
She also pointed out that some visitors of bat habitats, like tourists and poachers, wander into those places less protected and are at a high risk of being exposed to viruses, unlike virologists who collect samples wearing protective equipment.
Daszak estimated that from 1 million to 7 million people get infected by bat-borne viruses in Southeast Asia every year.
“If you look at the labs in Southeast Asia that have any coronaviruses in culture, there are probably two or three and they’re in high security,” he said. “The Wuhan Institute of Virology does have a small number of bat coronaviruses in culture. But they’re not [the new coronavirus], SARS-CoV-2. There are probably half a dozen people that do work in those labs. So let’s compare 1 million to 7 million people a year to half a dozen people; it’s just not logical.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The researchers suggested that given the diversity of factors like climate and population density in different corners of the empire, the plague couldn't have affected all areas of the Mediterranean in the same way.
While medical researchers and doctors continue their battle against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, a group of scientists have turned their attention towards a certain infamous plague epidemic that ravaged the Mediterranean during the 6th century – the Plague of Justinian.
According to phys.org, researchers Lauren White and Lee Mordechai of the University of Maryland's National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) have challenged the assumption that the plague in question wiped out nearly half of the population of the Eastern Roman Empire, using the "novel mathematical models" they've developed to re-examine the sources from that time.
The researchers also question the existing assumption that the plague affected all areas of the Mediterranean in the same way, with White and Mordechai arguing that the diversity of factors like climate and population density in different corners of the empire would've made such scenario rather unlikely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New call to examine old narratives: Infectious disease modeling study casts doubt on the Justinianic Plague's impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Many have claimed the Justinianic Plague (c. 541-750 CE) killed half of the population of Roman Empire. Now, historical research and mathematical modeling challenge the death rate and severity of this first plague pandemic.
Researchers Lauren White, Ph.D. and Lee Mordechai, Ph.D., of the University of Maryland's National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC), examined the impacts of the Justinianic Plague with mathematical modeling. Using modern plague research as their basis, the two developed novel mathematical models to re-examine primary sources from the time of the Justinianic Plague outbreak. From the modeling, they found that it was unlikely that any transmission route of the plague would have had both the mortality rate and duration described in the primary sources. Their findings appear in a paper titled "Modeling the Justinianic Plague: Comparing hypothesized transmission routes" in PLOS ONE.
"This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a robust mathematical modeling approach has been used to investigate the Justinianic Plague," said lead author Lauren White, Ph.D., a quantitative disease ecologist and postdoctoral fellow at SESYNC. "Given that there is very little quantitative information in the primary sources for the Justinianic Plague, this was an exciting opportunity to think creatively about how we could combine present-day knowledge of plague's etiology with descriptions from the historical texts."
White and Mordechai focused their efforts on the city of Constantinople, capital of the Roman Empire, which had a comparatively well-described outbreak in 542 CE. Some primary sources claim plague killed up to 300,000 people in the city, which had a population of some 500,000 people at the time. Other sources suggest the plague killed half the empire's population. Until recently, many scholars accepted this image of mass death. By comparing bubonic, pneumonic, and combined transmission routes, the authors showed that no single transmission route precisely mimicked the outbreak dynamics described in these primary sources.
Existing literature often assumes that the Justinianic Plague affected all areas of the Mediterranean in the same way. The new findings from this paper suggest that given the variation in ecological and social patterns across the region (e.g., climate, population density), it is unlikely that a plague outbreak would have impacted all corners of the diverse empire equally.
"Our results strongly suggest that the effects of the Justinianic Plague varied considerably between different urban areas in late antiquity," said co-author Lee Mordechai, an environmental historian and a postdoctoral fellow at SESYNC when he wrote the paper. He is now a senior lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and co-lead of Princeton's Climate Change and History Research Initiative (CCHRI). He said, "This paper is part of a series of publications in recent years that casts doubt on the traditional interpretation of plague using new methodologies. It's an exciting time to do this kind of interdisciplinary research!"
Using an approach called global sensitivity analysis, White and Mordechai were able to explore the importance of any given model parameter in dictating simulated disease outcomes. They found that several understudied parameters are also very important in determining model results. White explained, "One example was the transmission rate from fleas to humans. Although the analysis described this as an important parameter, there hasn't been enough research to validate a plausible range for that parameter."
These high importance variables with minimal information also point to future directions for empirical data collection. "Working with mathematical models of disease was an insightful process for me as a historian," reflected Mordechai. "It allowed us to examine traditional historical arguments with a powerful new lens."
Together, with other recent work from Mordechai, this study is another call to examine the primary sources and narratives surrounding the Justinianic Plague more critically.

Traveling during the holidays is never fun, but it might be extra worse this year.
The coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted the travel industry, with fewer Americans traveling than normal. According to a new survey, this might cause more people to travel during the holidays, which is normally one of the busiest seasons.
Americans are making more travel reservations than normal for the winter holiday season- Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year, the New York Post reports. This is reportedly due to two main factors: people currently stuck under lockdown orders are anxious to get out and Americans are confident that the coronavirus pandemic will have run its course before then.

“This could be one of the biggest years for holiday travel ever,” Omer Rabin, managing director at Guesty, a global, short-term rental property management platform, said, according to the New York Post. “We know people are saving up their vacation days now and starting to book travel for later in the year.”
Rabin also noted the “data is showing an uptick in domestic travel bookings rather than international, which is no surprise considering the limited flight paths we are seeing at the moment.”

According to Guesty’s findings, bookings for Thanksgiving are up 38 percent from last year, while the other winter holidays are up 40 percent.
While travelers may be looking to forward to possibly traveling this holiday season, they may not be going to any of the Disney theme parks.

Fox News previously reported that a Wall Street analyst projected that Disneyland and Disney World will remain closed until 2021. He also predicted that the lingering effects of the outbreak - social distancing and health precautions - could reduce the profitability of the parks until a vaccine is widely available.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Book now if you’re planning to travel during the holidays.
Reservations for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s are up because so many Americans are upbeat that the coronavirus will have run its course by fall — and more than a little desperate to get out of the house, a new survey shows.
Bookings for Thanksgiving, already the busiest travel weekend of the year, are up 38%, according to Guesty, a global, short-term rental property management platform. Reservations for the winter holidays have soared, too — 40%.
The spike reflects the spring and summer vacations that many travelers put on hold because of the pandemic, according to Omer Rabin, a managing director at Guesty.
“This could be one of the biggest years for holiday travel ever,” Rabin said. “We know people are saving up their vacation days now and starting to book travel for later in the year.”
Most of Guesty’s respondents, though, will be staying in the US, Rabin said. Many plan to spend their time in the Northeast — at ski resorts in Vermont and New Hampshire.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What if we already have a coronavirus vaccine?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">by Melinda Wenner MoyerAs the world waits for a coronavirus vaccine, tens of thousands of people could die. But some scientists believe a vaccine might already exist.
Surprising new research in a niche area of immunology suggests that certain live vaccines that have been around for decades could, possibly, protect against the coronavirus. The theory is that these vaccines could make people less likely to experience serious symptoms — or even any symptoms — if they catch it.
At more than 25 universities and clinical centers around the world, researchers have begun clinical trials, primarily in health care workers, to test whether a live tuberculosis vaccine that has been in use for 99 years called the bacillus Calmette-Guérin, or B.C.G., vaccine, could reduce the risks associated with the coronavirus.
Another small but esteemed group of scientists is raising money to test the potential protective effects of a 60-year-old live polio vaccine called O.P.V.
It’s counterintuitive to think that old vaccines created to fight very different pathogens could defend against the coronavirus. The idea is controversial in part because it challenges the dogma about how vaccines work.
But scientists’ understanding of an arm of immunology known as innate immunity has shifted in recent years. A growing body of research suggests that live vaccines, which are made from living but attenuated pathogens (as opposed to inactivated vaccines, which use dead pathogens) provide broad protection against infections in ways that no one anticipated.
“We can’t be certain as to what the outcome will be, but I suspect it’ll have an effect” on the coronavirus, said Jeffrey Cirillo, a microbiologist and immunologist at Texas A&M University who is leading one of the B.C.G. trials. “Question is, how big will it be?”
Scientists stress that these vaccines will not be a panacea. They might make symptoms milder, but they probably won’t eliminate them. And the protection, if it occurs, would most likely last only a few years.
Still, “these could be a first step,” said Dr. Mihai Netea, an immunologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands who is leading another one of the trials. “They can be the bridge until you have the time to develop a specific vaccine.”
The first evidence to suggest that live vaccines could be broadly protective trickled in nearly a century ago, but no one knew what to make of it. In 1927, soon after B.C.G. was rolled out, Carl Naslund of the Swedish Tuberculosis Society observed that children vaccinated with the live tuberculosis vaccine were three times less likely to die of any cause compared with kids who weren’t.
“One is tempted to explain this very low mortality among vaccinated children by the idea that B.C.G. vaccine provokes a nonspecific immunity,” he wrote in 1932.
Then, in clinical trials conducted in the 1940s and ’50s in the United States and Britain, researchers found that B.C.G. reduced nonaccidental deaths from causes other than tuberculosis by an average of 25 percent.
Also in the 1950s, Russian researchers, including Marina Voroshilova of the Academy of Medical Science in Moscow, noticed that people who had been given the live polio vaccine, compared with people who hadn’t, were far less likely to fall ill with the seasonal flu and other respiratory infections. She and other scientists undertook a clinical trial involving 320,000 Russians to more carefully test these mysterious effects.
They found that among individuals who had received the live polio vaccine, “the incidence of seasonal influenza was reduced by 75 percent,” said Konstantin Chumakov, Voroshilova’s son, who is now an associate director for research in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.
Recent studies have produced similar findings. In a 2016 review of 68 papers commissioned by the World Health Organization, a team of researchers concluded that B.C.G., along with other live vaccines, “reduce overall mortality by more than would be expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent.”
The W.H.O. has long been skeptical about these “nonspecific effects,” in part because much of the research on them has involved observational studies that don’t establish cause and effect. But in a recent report incorporating newer results from some clinical trials, the organization described nonspecific vaccine effects as “plausible and common.”
Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccinologist and emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania who developed the rubella vaccine but has no involvement in the current research, agreed. “Vaccines can affect the immune system beyond the response to the specific pathogen,” he said.
Peter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist who has spent 40 years studying the nonspecific effects of vaccines in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, and whose findings have been criticized as implausible, is hopeful that these trials will be a tipping point for research in the field. “It’s kind of a golden moment in terms of actually having this taken seriously,” he said.
The possibility that vaccines could have nonspecific effects is brow-furrowing in part because scientists have long believed that vaccines work by stimulating the body’s highly specific adaptive immune system.
After receiving a vaccine against, say, polio, a person’s body creates an army of polio-specific antibodies that recognize and attack the virus before it has a chance to take hold. Antibodies against polio can’t fight off infections caused by other pathogens, though — so, based on this framework, polio vaccines should not be able to reduce the risk associated with other viruses, such as the coronavirus.
But over the past decade, immunologists have discovered that live vaccines also stimulate the innate immune system, which is less specific but much faster. They have found that the innate immune system can be trained by live vaccines to better fight off various kinds of pathogens.
For instance, in a 2018 study, Dr. Netea and his colleagues vaccinated volunteers with either B.C.G. or a placebo and then infected them all with a harmless version of the yellow fever virus. Those who had been given B.C.G. were better able to fight off yellow fever.
Research by Dr. Netea and others shows that live vaccines train the body’s immune system by initiating changes in some stem cells. Among other things, the vaccines initiate the creation of tiny marks that help cells turn on genes involved in immune protection against multiple pathogens.
This area of innate immunity “is one of the hottest areas in fundamental immunology today,” said Dr. Robert Gallo, the director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and co-founder of the Global Virus Network, a coalition of virologists from more than 30 countries. In the 1980s, Dr. Gallo helped to identify H.I.V. as the cause of AIDS.
Dr. Gallo is leading the charge to test the O.P.V. live polio vaccine as a treatment for coronavirus. He and his colleagues hope to start a clinical trial on health care workers in New York City and Maryland within six weeks.
O.P.V. is routinely used in 143 countries, but no longer in the United States. An inactivated polio vaccine was reintroduced here in 1997, in part because one out of every 2.7 million people who receive the live vaccine can actually develop polio from it.
But O.P.V. does not pose this risk to Americans who have received a polio vaccine in the past. “We believe this is very, very, very safe,” Dr. Gallo said. It’s also inexpensive at 12 cents a dose, and is administered orally, so it doesn’t require needles.
Some scientists have raised concerns over whether these vaccines could increase the risk for “cytokine storms” — deadly inflammatory reactions that have been observed in some people weeks after they have been infected with the coronavirus. Dr. Netea and others said that they were taking these concerns seriously but did not anticipate problems. For one thing, the vaccines will be given only to healthy people — not to people who are already infected.
Also, B.C.G. may actually be able to ramp up the body’s initial immune response in ways that reduce the amount of virus in the body, such that an inflammatory response never occurs. It may “lead to less infection to start with,” said Dr. Moshe Arditi, the director of the Infectious and Immunological Diseases Research Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is leading one of the trial arms.
The science on this is still early days. Several pre-prints — scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed — published over the past few months support the idea that B.C.G. could protect against the coronavirus. They have reported, for instance, that death rates are lower in countries that routinely vaccinate children with B.C.G. But these studies can be fraught with bias and difficult to interpret; it’s impossible to know whether the vaccinations, or something else, provided the protection.
Such studies are “at the very bottom of the evidence hierarchy,” said Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, who is raising funds for a Danish B.C.G trial. She added that the protective effects of a dose of B.C.G given to adults decades ago, when they were infants, may well differ from the protective effects the vaccine could provide when given to adults during an outbreak.
“In the end,” said Dr. Netea, “only the clinical trials will give the answer.”
Thankfully, that answer will come very soon. Initial results from the trials that are underway may be available within a few months. If these researchers are right, these old vaccines could buy us time — and save thousands of lives — while we work to develop a new one.

They found that among individuals who had received the live polio vaccine, “the incidence of seasonal influenza was reduced by 75 per cent,” said Konstantin Chumakov, Voroshilova’s son, who is now an associate director for research in the US Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.
Recent studies have produced similar findings. In a 2016 review of 68 papers commissioned by the World Health Organisation, a team of researchers concluded that BCG, along with other live vaccines, “reduce overall mortality by more than would be expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent.”
The WHO has long been sceptical about these “non-specific effects,” in part because much of the research on them has involved observational studies that don’t establish cause and effect. But in a recent report incorporating newer results from some clinical trials, the organisation described non-specific vaccine effects as “plausible and common.”
Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccinologist and emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania who developed the rubella vaccine but has no involvement in the current research, agreed. “Vaccines can affect the immune system beyond the response to the specific pathogen,” he said.
Peter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist who has spent 40 years studying the non-specific effects of vaccines in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, and whose findings have been criticised as implausible, is hopeful that these trials will be a tipping point for research in the field. “It’s kind of a golden moment in terms of actually having this taken seriously,” he said.
The possibility that vaccines could have non-specific effects is brow-furrowing in part because scientists have long believed that vaccines work by stimulating the body’s highly specific adaptive immune system.
After receiving a vaccine against, say, polio, a person’s body creates an army of polio-specific antibodies that recognise and attack the virus before it has a chance to take hold. Antibodies against polio can’t fight off infections caused by other pathogens, though — so, based on this framework, polio vaccines should not be able to reduce the risk associated with other viruses, such as the coronavirus.
But over the past decade, immunologists have discovered that live vaccines also stimulate the innate immune system, which is less specific but much faster. They have found that the innate immune system can be trained by live vaccines to better fight off various kinds of pathogens.
For instance, in a 2018 study, Dr. Netea and his colleagues vaccinated volunteers with either BCG or a placebo and then infected them all with a harmless version of the yellow fever virus. Those who had been given B.C.G. were better able to fight off yellow fever.
Research by Dr. Netea and others shows that live vaccines train the body’s immune system by initiating changes in some stem cells. Among other things, the vaccines initiate the creation of tiny marks that help cells turn on genes involved in immune protection against multiple pathogens.
This area of innate immunity “is one of the hottest areas in fundamental immunology today,” said Dr. Robert Gallo, the director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and co-founder of the Global Virus Network, a coalition of virologists from more than 30 countries. In the 1980s, Dr. Gallo helped to identify HIV as the cause of AIDS.
Dr. Gallo is leading the charge to test the OPV live polio vaccine as a treatment for coronavirus. He and his colleagues hope to start a clinical trial on health care workers in New York City and Maryland within six weeks.
OPV is routinely used in 143 countries, but no longer in the United States. An inactivated polio vaccine was reintroduced here in 1997, in part because one out of every 2.7 million people who receive the live vaccine can actually develop polio from it.
But OPV does not pose this risk to Americans who have received a polio vaccine in the past. “We believe this is very, very, very safe,” Dr. Gallo said. It’s also inexpensive at 12 cents a dose, and is administered orally, so it doesn’t require needles.
Some scientists have raised concerns over whether these vaccines could increase the risk for “cytokine storms” — deadly inflammatory reactions that have been observed in some people weeks after they have been infected with the coronavirus. Dr. Netea and others said that they were taking these concerns seriously but did not anticipate problems. For one thing, the vaccines will be given only to healthy people — not to people who are already infected.
Also, BCG may actually be able to ramp up the body’s initial immune response in ways that reduce the amount of virus in the body, such that an inflammatory response never occurs. It may “lead to less infection to start with,” said Dr. Moshe Arditi, the director of the Infectious and Immunological Diseases Research Centre at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles, who is leading one of the trial arms.
The science on this is still early days. Several pre-prints — scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed — published over the past few months support the idea that BCG could protect against the coronavirus. They have reported, for instance, that death rates are lower in countries that routinely vaccinate children with BCG. But these studies can be fraught with bias and difficult to interpret; it’s impossible to know whether the vaccinations, or something else, provided the protection.
Such studies are “at the very bottom of the evidence hierarchy,” said Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, who is raising funds for a Danish BCG trial. She added that the protective effects of a dose of BCG given to adults decades ago, when they were infants, may well differ from the protective effects the vaccine could provide when given to adults during an outbreak.
“In the end,” said Dr. Netea, “only the clinical trials will give the answer.”
Thankfully, that answer will come very soon. Initial results from the trials that are underway may be available within a few months. If these researchers are right, these old vaccines could buy us time — and save thousands of lives — while we work to develop a new one.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Khalifa University researchers studying virus load from Abu Dhabi wastewater</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Estimating the spread of the novel coronavirus in any population has so far proved a challenge, given that many individuals who contract the virus remain asymptomatic or untested.
To get a better understanding of the spread of the virus, researchers at the Khalifa University of Science and Technology have launched a project to estimate the level of the virus in municipal wastewater.
A statement by the university today (May 3) said the project will help surveil the viral load in municipal wastewater as a method for early detection, and for tracking the spread of the coronavirus in the general population.
Studies have so far indicated that people infected with the coronavirus, including asymptomatic individuals, shed the virus through human waste.
“Since the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater should mirror the number of detected infections in the population, testing a municipal wastewater sample will be tantamount to essentially testing everyone who has contributed to that sample - in other words a way of mass testing,” the university’s statement said.
Through this research, Khalifa University aims to establish a surveillance system for COVID-19 in municipal wastewater streams, linking it with simulation models developed for predicting and controlling the spread of the pandemic, together with the health authorities,” said Dr Arif Sultan Al Hammadi, executive vice-president at the University.
The project is led by Dr Ahmed Yousef, assistant professor for Chemistry, Dr Shadi Hasan, associate professor for Chemical Engineering, and Dr Habiba Alsafar, acting associate dean for student affairs at the University’s College of Medicine and Health Sciences. Dr Alsafar is also the associate professor at the Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, and director of the Center for Biotechnology.
Once further studies assess the levels of coronavirus found in COVID-19 patient fecal samples, scientists will be able to construct a model that estimates the total number of symptomatic and asymptomatic people in the population based on wastewater levels.
Similar studies to estimate coronavirus load in wastewater are also being undertaken around the world, and results have already been published by authorities in Netherlands and Paris. However, these papers have not yet been vetted and approved by the wider scientific community as a viable method for estimating the spread of the virus in the general populatioon.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madonna made sure she didn't miss out on a friend's birthday party, despite recently testing positive for coronavirus antibodies.
The Like A Virgin singer, 61, attended the bash in person and even hugged and presented her pal Steven Klein with a cake to mark his 55th birthday.
No one at the birthday bash was wearing any protective gear like face masks, despite the worldwide coronavirus crisis.
Madonna's positive test means she has recently been in contact with Covid-19.
Klein's birthday party was livestreamed on the video chatting app Zoom meaning guests could attend it virtually, but defiant Madge was there in person.
One of the people who attended shared a video of Madonna hugging Klein.
They captioned the post: "M made an appearance at Steven Klein's Virtual Birthday Party - such a blast!!
"M called his Bday cake a Covid Cake.
"She's too f**king cute!!! We are living in some crazy tiMes!
"But trying to make the most of it, and still have soMe fun!!! [sic]"
Mirror Online has contacted Madonna's reps for comment.
Madonna took to Instagram to reveal she'd tested positive for the coronavirus antibodies earlier this week.
"Took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies," she said.
"So tomorrow, I'm just going to go for a long drive in the car… and I'm going to breathe in the COVID-19 air.
"Yep. I hope the sun is shining."

    <h5 class="mb-1">How remdesivir, new hope for COVID-19 patients, was resurrected</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remdesivir, an antiviral drug designed to treat both hepatitis and a common respiratory virus, seemed fated to join thousands of other failed medications after proving useless against those diseases. The drug was consigned to the pharmaceutical scrap heap, all but forgotten by the scientists who once championed it.
But Friday, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency approval for remdesivir as a treatment for patients severely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The story of remdesivir’s rescue and transformation testifies to the powerful role played by federal funding, which allowed scientists labouring in obscurity to pursue basic research without obvious financial benefits. This research depends almost entirely on government grants.
Dr. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University is one of a handful of researchers who discovered remdesivir’s potential. He began studying coronaviruses a quarter-century ago, a time when few scientists cared about them; the ones infecting humans caused colds, he recalled, and scientists just wanted to know how they worked.
“We were interested from the biologic perspective,” Denison recalled. “No one was interested from a therapeutic perspective.”
Neither he nor the scores of other scientists interested in coronaviruses foresaw that a new one would unleash a plague that has killed nearly a quarter-million people worldwide. The FDA rushed to approve remdesivir under emergency use provisions after a federal trial demonstrated modest improvements in severely ill patients.
The trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, included more than 1,000 hospitalised patients and found that those receiving remdesivir recovered faster than those who got a placebo: in 11 days, versus 15 days. But the drug did not significantly reduce fatality rates.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the results were “a very important proof of concept” but not a “knockout.” President Donald Trump hailed the drug Friday as “an important treatment” and “really promising.”
Remdesivir is approved only for severely ill patients and only temporarily; formal approval must come later. Still, some doctors labouring in intensive care units embraced the drug as an important new weapon against a virus that is killing patients worldwide.
“It’s a great first step,” said Dr. Robert Finberg, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
Little about the early history of remdesivir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, suggested the hopes now placed upon it.
Coronaviruses hold much more RNA than scientists once theorised a virus could. Many viruses that cause epidemics rely on this type of genetic material, and almost all mutate constantly. That is why flu viruses change from year to year.
Yet coronaviruses did not change much; their mutation rate is about one-twentieth the rate of other RNA viruses.
In 2007, Denison discovered that coronaviruses have a powerful “proofreading” system. If an error occurs in copying RNA as the coronavirus replicates, it corrects the error. In lab experiments, coronaviruses that mutated were weaker, outcompeted by those without mutations.
Denison and other experts wondered if it might be possible to trick the virus with a drug that dodged the proofreading system and blocked the virus’s growing RNA chain, making it prematurely terminate.
Talking about this problem with another scientist at a meeting, Denison learned that Gilead Sciences had dozens of drugs that might do the trick. “All of these compounds had been shelved for one reason or another,” Denison said.
Most worked in lab tests to shut down coronaviruses, he found — some better than others. One of the best was GS-5734, now known as remdesivir. “I like to call it the Terminator,” Denison said.
Denison discovered remdesivir was just what they were seeking: a drug that slipped past the virus’s powerful system to protect RNA, their genetic material. Remdesivir made growing chains of the viral RNA terminate prematurely, killing the virus.
Remdesivir killed every known coronavirus in Denison’s tests. Then researchers at the University of North Carolina found that the drug also killed the viruses in infected animals.
That included not just coronaviruses that cause the common cold but also those that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome — even a coronavirus that infects only mice.
But the drug failed a number of real-life tests — not just against hepatitis but also against Ebola in Africa. The drug languished, unapproved for any use — until a new coronavirus emerged.
As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, began to grow into a pandemic, many scientists realised that remdesivir might be the best solution at hand. It had already undergone animal testing and safety testing in humans.
So doctors began giving it to patients in studies without controls and even outside of studies altogether. Anecdotes fuelled demand. Gilead sponsored some of these studies and gave the drug to doctors who treated hundreds of patients under compassionate use, a legal exemption permitting use of an unapproved drug to treat patients.
But none of this could demonstrate that a drug was helpful to patients. It took the federal trial, in which many patients were given a placebo, to show that remdesivir seems to have a modest effect.
Even a modest effect from the drug in hospitalised patients was a surprise, said Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. He had expected that patients like those in the federal trial would not respond.
They were severely ill, and such patients often suffer not from their viral infections but from overreactions of the immune system. (That is why Tamiflu does not work well in severely ill flu patients, he added.)
“Thank God we have something that works,” Monto said.
Not everyone is convinced that remdesivir will live up to its promise. A study in China, published this week in Lancet, found the drug offered no benefit to severely ill patients. And many experts want to see the data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases trial; so far, there have been only announcements about the results from administration officials.
Despite these questions, Gilead has been ramping up production and currently has 1.5 million vials on hand, enough for about 150,000 patients. Those will be provided to patients at no cost, said Daniel O’Day, the company’s chief executive.
He would not discuss what Gilead might charge in the long run, following a formal approval, but remdesivir is unlikely to be cheap, despite its origins in federally funded research.
“Gilead discovered this medicine and developed this medicine,” O’Day said. “We have been involved all the way.”
Some experts fear that taxpayers won’t get their due.
“Their pricing should reflect that the government not only invested substantial funds, but at risky stages,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard University who studies drug pricing.
If Gilead reaps all the rewards, he added, “that doesn’t seem fair.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How remdesivir, new hope for Covid-19 patients, was resurrected</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remdesivir, an antiviral drug designed to treat both hepatitis and a common respiratory virus, seemed fated to join thousands of other failed medications after proving useless against those diseases. The drug was consigned to the pharmaceutical scrap heap, all but forgotten by the scientists who once championed it.
But on Friday, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency approval for remdesivir as a treatment for patients severely ill with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The story of remdesivir’s rescue and transformation testifies to the powerful role played by federal funding, which allowed scientists laboring in obscurity to pursue basic research without obvious financial benefits. This research depends almost entirely on government grants.
Dr. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University is one of a handful of researchers who discovered remdesivir’s potential. He began studying coronaviruses a quarter-century ago, a time when few scientists cared about them — the ones infecting humans caused colds, he recalled, and scientists just wanted to know how they worked.

“We were interested from the biologic perspective,” Dr. Denison recalled. “No one was interested from a therapeutic perspective.”
Neither he nor the scores of other scientists interested in coronaviruses foresaw that a new one would unleash a plague that has killed nearly a quarter-million people worldwide. The F.D.A. rushed to approve remdesivir under emergency use provisions, after a federal trial demonstrated modest improvements in severely ill patients.
The trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, included more than 1,000 hospitalized patients and found that those receiving remdesivir recovered faster than those who got a placebo: in 11 days, versus 15 days. But the drug did not significantly reduce fatality rates.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the results were “a very important proof of concept” but not a “knockout.” President Trump hailed the drug on Friday as “an important treatment” and “really promising.”

Remdesivir is approved only for severely ill patients and only temporarily; formal approval must come later. Still, some doctors laboring in intensive care units embraced the drug as an important new weapon against a virus that is killing patients worldwide.
“It’s a great first step,” said Dr. Robert Finberg, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
Little about the early history of remdesivir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, suggested the hopes now placed upon it.
Coronaviruses hold much more RNA than scientists once theorized a virus could. Many viruses that cause epidemics rely on this type of genetic material, and almost all mutate constantly. That is why flu viruses change from year to year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With pressure growing, global race for a vaccine intensifies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Four months after a mysterious new virus began its deadly march around the globe, the search for a vaccine has taken on an intensity never before seen in medical research, with huge implications for public health, the world economy and politics.
Seven of the roughly 90 projects being pursued by governments, pharmaceutical makers, biotech innovators and academic laboratories have reached the stage of clinical trials. With political leaders — not least President Donald Trump — increasingly pressing for progress, and with big potential profits at stake for the industry, drugmakers and researchers have signalled that they are moving ahead at unheard-of speeds.
But the whole enterprise remains dogged by uncertainty about whether any coronavirus vaccine will prove effective, how fast it could be made available to millions or billions of people and whether the rush — compressing a process that can take 10 years into 10 months — will sacrifice safety.
Some experts say the more immediately promising field might be the development of treatments to speed recovery from COVID-19, an approach that has generated some optimism in the last week through initially encouraging research results on remdesivir, an antiviral drug previously tried in fighting Ebola.
In an era of intense nationalism, the geopolitics of the vaccine race are growing as complex as the medicine. The months of mutual vilification between the United States and China over the origins of the virus have poisoned most efforts at cooperation between them. The US government is already warning that American innovations must be protected from theft — chiefly from Beijing.
“Biomedical research has long been a focus of theft, especially by the Chinese government, and vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus are today’s holy grail,” John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security, said on Friday. “Putting aside the commercial value, there would be great geopolitical significance to being the first to develop a treatment or vaccine. We will use all the tools we have to safeguard American research.”
The intensity of the global research effort is such that governments and companies are building production lines before they have anything to produce.
“We are going to start ramping up production with the companies involved,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the federal government’s top expert on infectious diseases, said on NBC this week. “You don’t wait until you get an answer before you start manufacturing.”
Two of the leading entrants in the United States, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, have announced partnerships with manufacturing firms, with Johnson & Johnson promising 1 billion doses of an as-yet-undeveloped vaccine by the end of next year.
Not to be left behind, the Britain-based pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said this week that it was working with a vaccine development project at the University of Oxford to manufacture tens of millions of doses by the end of this year.
With the demand for a vaccine so intense, there are escalating calls for “human-challenge trials” to speed the process: tests in which volunteers are injected with a potential vaccine and then deliberately exposed to the coronavirus.
Because the approach involves exposing participants to a potentially deadly disease, challenge trials are ethically fraught. But they could be faster than simply inoculating human subjects and waiting for them to be exposed along with everyone else, especially as the pandemic is brought under control in big countries.
Even when promising solutions are found, there are big challenges to scaling up production and distribution. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, whose foundation is spending $250 million to help spur vaccine development, has warned about a critical shortage of a mundane but vital component: medical glass.
Without sufficient supplies of the glass, there will be too few vials to transport the billions of doses that will ultimately be needed.
The scale of the problem and the demand for a quick solution are bound to create tensions between the profit motives of the pharmaceutical industry, which typically fights hard to wring the most out of their investments in new drugs, and the public’s need for quick action to get any effective vaccines to as many people as possible.
So far, much of the research and development has been supported by governments and foundations. And much remains to be worked out when it comes to patents and what national governments will claim in return for their support and pledges of quick regulatory approval.
Given the stakes, it is no surprise that while scientists and doctors talk about finding a “global vaccine,” national leaders emphasise immunising their own populations first. Trump said he was personally in charge of “Operation Warp Speed” to get 300 million doses into American arms by January.
Already, the administration has identified 14 vaccine projects it intends to focus on, a senior administration official said, with the idea of further narrowing the group to a handful that could go on, with government financial help and accelerated regulatory review, to meet Trump’s goal. The winnowing of the projects to 14 was reported Friday by NBC News.
But other countries are also signalling their intention to nationalise their approaches. The most promising clinical trial in China is financed by the government. And in India, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India — the world’s largest producer of vaccine doses — said that most of its vaccine “would have to go to our countrymen before it goes abroad.”
George Daley, the dean of Harvard Medical School, said thinking in country-by-country rather than global terms would be foolhardy since it “would involve squandering the early doses of vaccine on a large number of individuals at low risk, rather than covering as many high-risk individuals globally” — health care workers and older adults — “to stop the spread” around the world.
Given the proliferation of vaccine projects, the best outcome may be none of them emerging as a clear winner.
“Let’s say we get one vaccine quickly but we can only get 2 million doses of it at the end of next year,” said Anita Zaidi, who directs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s vaccine development program. “And another vaccine, just as effective, comes three months later but we can make a billion doses. Who won that race?”
The answer, she said, “is we will need many different vaccines to cross the finish line.”
Speed Versus Safety
At 1 a.m. on March 21, 1963, a 5-year-old girl named Jeryl Lynn Hilleman woke up her father. She had come down with the mumps, which had made her miserable with a swollen jaw.
It just so happened that her father, Maurice, was a vaccine designer. So he told Jeryl Lynn to go back to bed, drove to his lab at Merck to pick up some equipment, and returned to swab her throat. Hilleman refrigerated her sample back at his lab and soon got to work weakening her viruses until they could serve as a mumps vaccine. In 1967, it was approved by the FDA.
To vaccine makers, this story is the stuff of legend. Hilleman still holds the record for the quickest delivery of a vaccine from the lab to the clinic. Vaccines typically take 10 to 15 years of research and testing. And only 6% of the projects that scientists launch reach the finish line.
For a world in the grips of COVID-19, on the other hand, this story is the stuff of nightmares. No one wants to wait four years for a vaccine, while millions die and economies remain paralysed.
Some of the leading contenders for a coronavirus vaccine are now promising to have the first batches ready in record time, by the start of next year. They have accelerated their schedules by collapsing the standard vaccine timeline.
They are combining trials that used to be carried out one after the other. They are pushing their formulations into production, despite the risk that the trials will fail, leaving them with millions of useless doses.
But some experts want to do even more to speed up the conveyor belt. Writing last month in the journal Vaccines, the vaccine developer Dr. Stanley Plotkin and Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center, proposed infecting vaccinated volunteers with the coronavirus — the method known as challenge trials. The procedure might cut months or years off the development but would put test subjects at risk.
Challenge trials were used in the early days of vaccine research but now are carried out under strict conditions and only for illnesses, like flu and malaria, that have established treatments.
In an article in March in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a team of researchers wrote, “Such an approach is not without risks, but every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally.”
Caplan said that limiting the trials to healthy young adults could reduce the risk, since they were less likely to suffer serious complications from COVID-19. “I think we can let people make the choice and I have no doubt many would,” he said.
In Congress, Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill. and a physicist, and Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla. and the former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, organised a bipartisan group of 35 lawmakers to sign a letter asking regulators to approve such trials.
The organisers of a website set up to promote the idea, 1daysooner.org, say they have signed up more than 9,100 potential volunteers from 52 countries.
Some scientists caution that truly informed consent, even by willing volunteers, may not be possible. Even medical experts do not yet know all the effects of the virus. Those who have appeared to recover might still face future problems.
Even without challenge trials, accelerated testing may run the risk of missing potential side effects. A vaccine for dengue fever, and one for SARS that never reached the market, were abandoned after making some people more susceptible to severe forms of the diseases, not less.
“It will be extremely important to determine that does not happen,” said Michel De Wilde, a former senior vice president of research and development at Sanofi Pasteur, a vaccine maker in France.
When it comes to the risks from flawed vaccines, China’s history is instructive.
The Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was involved in a 2018 scandal in which ineffective vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and other conditions were injected into hundreds of thousands of babies.
The government confiscated the Wuhan institute’s “illegal income,” fined the company, and punished nine executives. But the company was allowed to continue to operate. It is now running a coronavirus vaccine project, and along with two other Chinese groups has been allowed to combine its safety and efficacy trials.
Several Chinese scientists questioned the decision, arguing that the vaccine should be shown to be safe before testing how well it works.
Nationalism Versus Globalism
In the early days of the crisis, Harvard was approached by Chinese billionaire Hui Ka Yan. He arranged to give roughly $115 million to be split between Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases for a collaborative effort that would include developing coronavirus vaccines.
“We are not racing against each other, we are racing the virus,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a professor at Harvard Medical School who is also working with Johnson & Johnson. “What we need is a global vaccine — because an outbreak in one part of the world puts the rest of the world at risk.”
That all-for-one sentiment has become a mantra among many researchers, but it is hardly universally shared.
In India, the Serum Institute — the heavyweight champion of vaccine manufacturing, producing 1.5 billion doses a year — has signed agreements in recent weeks with the developers of four promising potential vaccines. But in an interview with Reuters, Adar Poonawalla, the company’s billionaire chief executive, made it clear that “at least initially” any vaccine the company produces would have to go to India’s 1.3 billion people.
The tension between those who believe a vaccine should go where it is needed most and those dealing with pressures to supply their own country first is one of the defining features of the global response.
The Trump administration, which in March put out feelers to a German biotech company to acquire its vaccine research or move it to American shores, has awarded grants of nearly half a billion dollars each to two US-based companies, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.
Johnson & Johnson, though based in New Jersey, conducts its research in the Netherlands.
Paul Stoffels, the company’s vice chairman and chief scientific officer, said in an interview that the Department of Health and Human Services understood “we can’t pick up our research and move it” to the United States. But it made sure that the company joined a partnership with Emergent BioSolutions — a Maryland biological production firm — to produce the first big batches of any approved vaccine for the US
“The political reality is that it be would very, very hard for any government to allow a vaccine made in their own country to be exported while there was a major problem at home,” said Sandy Douglas, a researcher at the University of Oxford. “The only solution is to make a hell of a lot of vaccine in a lot of different places.”
The Oxford vaccine team has already begun scaling up plans for manufacturing by half a dozen companies across the world, including China and India, plus two British manufacturers and the British-based multinational AstraZeneca.
In China, the government’s instinct is to showcase the country’s growth into a technological power capable of beating the United States. There are nine Chinese COVID-19 vaccines in development, involving 1,000 scientists and the Chinese military.
China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention predicted that one of the vaccines could be in “emergency use” by September, meaning that in the midst of the presidential election in the United States, Trump might see television footage of Chinese citizens lining up for injections.
“It’s a scenario we have thought about,” one member of Trump’s coronavirus task force said. “No one wants to be around that day.”
Traditional Versus New Methods
The more than 90 different vaccines under development work in radically different ways. Some are based on designs used for generations. Others use genetic-based strategies that are so new they have yet to lead to an approved vaccine.
“I think in this case it’s very wise to have different platforms being tried out,” De Wilde said.
The traditional approach is to make vaccines from viruses.
When our bodies encounter a new virus, they start learning how to make effective antibodies against it. But they are in a race against the virus as it multiplies. Sometimes they produce effective antibodies quickly enough to wipe out an infection. But sometimes the virus wins.
Vaccines give the immune system a head start. They teach it to make antibodies in advance of an infection.
The first vaccines, against diseases like rabies, were made from viruses. Scientists weakened the viruses so that they could no longer make people sick.
A number of groups are weakening the coronavirus to produce a vaccine against COVID-19. In April, the Chinese company Sinovac announced that their inactivated vaccine protected monkeys.
Another approach is based on the fact that our immune system makes antibodies that lock precisely onto viruses. As scientists came to understand this, it occurred to them that they didn’t have to inject a whole virus into someone to trigger immunity. All they needed was to deliver the fragment of a viral protein that was the precise target.
Today these so-called subunit viral vaccines are used against hepatitis B and shingles. Many COVID-19 subunit vaccines are now in testing.
In the 1990s, researchers began working on vaccines that enlisted our own cells to help train the immune system. The foundation of these vaccines is typically a virus called an adenovirus. The adenovirus can infect our cells, but is altered so that it doesn’t make us sick.
Scientists can add a gene to the adenovirus from the virus they want to fight, creating what’s known as a viral vector. Some viral vectors then invade our cells, stimulating the immune system to make antibodies.
Researchers at the University of Oxford and the Chinese company CanSino Biologics have created a viral vector vaccine for COVID-19, and they’ve started safety trials on volunteers. Others including Johnson & Johnson are going to launch trials of their own in the coming months.
Some groups, including the American company Inovio Pharmaceuticals, are taking a totally different approach. Instead of injecting viruses or protein fragments, they’re injecting pure DNA, which is read by the cell’s machinery, making a copy as an RNA molecule. The RNA is then read by the cell’s protein-building factories, making a viral protein. The protein in turn comes out of the cell, where immune cells bump into it and make an antibody to it.
Other teams are creating RNA molecules rather than DNA. Moderna and a group at Imperial College London have launched safety trials for RNA vaccines. While experimental, these genetic vaccines can be quickly designed and tested.
Designing Versus Manufacturing
It is one thing to design a vaccine in record time. It is an entirely different challenge to manufacture and distribute one on a scale never before attempted — billions of doses, specially packaged and transported at below-zero temperatures, to nearly every corner of the world.
“If you want to give a vaccine to a billion people, it better be very safe and very effective,” said Stoffels of Johnson & Johnson. “But you also need to know how to make it in amounts we’ve never really seen before.”
So the race is on to get ahead of the enormous logistical issues, from basic manufacturing capacity to the shortages of medical glass and stoppers that Gates and others have warned of.
Researchers at Johnson & Johnson are trying to make a five-dose vial to save precious glass, which might work if a smaller dose is enough for inoculation.
Each potential vaccine will require its own customised production process in special “clean” facilities for drug making. Building from scratch might cost tens of millions of dollars per plant. Equipping one existing facility could easily cost from $5 million to $20 million. Ordering and installing the necessary equipment can take months.
Governments as well as organisations like the Gates Foundation and the nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are putting up money for production facilities well before any particular vaccine is proven effective.
What’s more, some vaccines — including those being tested by the American companies Moderna and Inovio — rely on technology that has never before yielded a drug that was licensed for use or mass-produced.
But even traditional processes face challenges.
Because of staff illnesses and social distancing, the pandemic this spring slashed productivity by 20% at the MilleporeSigma facility in Danvers, Massachusetts, that supplies many drugmakers with the equipment used for brewing vaccines.
Then, about three weeks ago, the first clinical trials for new proposed vaccines started. Urgent calls poured from customers around the world. Even before the first phase of the first trials, manufacturers were scrambling.
“Demand went through the roof, and everybody wanted it yesterday,” said Udit Batra, MilleporeSigma’s chief executive, who has expanded production and asked other customers to accept delays to avoid becoming a bottleneck.
Treatments Versus Vaccines
Even as the world waits for a vaccine, a potential treatment for coronavirus is already here — and more could be on the way.
On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorisation for the use of remdesivir as a treatment of severely ill patients.
Remdesivir showed modest success in a federally funded clinical trial, slowing the progression of the disease, but without significantly reducing fatality rates.
The FDA’s decision to allow its use comes as hundreds of other drugs — mainly existing medicines that are being used for other conditions — are being tested around the world to see if they hold promise. The FDA said there are currently 72 therapies in trial.
Studies of drugs tend to move more quickly than vaccine trials. Vaccines are given to millions of people who are not yet ill, so they must be extremely safe. But in sicker people, that calculus changes, and side effects might be an acceptable risk.
As a result, clinical trials can be conducted with fewer people. And because drugs are tested in people who are already sick, results can be seen more quickly than in vaccine trials, where researchers must wait to see who gets infected.
Public health experts have cautioned there will likely be no magic pill. Rather, they are hoping for incremental advances that make COVID-19 less deadly.
“Almost nothing is 100%, especially when you are dealing with a virus that really creates a lot of havoc in the body,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, a former director of medical and biodefense preparedness for the National Security Council during the Trump administration.
Antiviral drugs like remdesivir battle the virus itself, slowing its replication in the body.
The malaria drug hydroxychloroquine — which has been enthusiastically promoted by Trump and also received emergency authorisation to be used in coronavirus patients — showed early promise in the laboratory. However small, limited studies in humans have so far been disappointing.
So have some HIV treatments, including a two-drug cocktail sold as Kaletra, which failed in a Chinese trial.
Other researchers have focused on identifying immunosuppressant drugs that address the most severe form of COVID-19, when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive, attacking the lungs and other organs.
Many in the medical community are closely watching the development of antibody drugs that could act to neutralise the virus, either once someone is already sick or as a way of blocking the infection in the first place.
Several hospitals are also administering plasma from recovered patients to people who are sick with COVID-19, in the hopes that the antibodies of survivors will give the patients a boost.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner, and others said that by the fall, the treatment picture for COVID-19 could look more hopeful.
If proven effective in further trials, remdesivir may become more widely used. One or two antibody treatments may also become available, providing limited protection to health care workers.
Even without a vaccine, Borio said, a handful of early treatments could make a difference. “If you can protect people that are vulnerable and you can treat people that come down with the disease effectively,” she said, “then I think it will change the trajectory of this pandemic.”©2020 The New York Times Company

    <h5 class="mb-1">With pressure growing, global race for a vaccine intensifies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — Four months after a mysterious new virus began its deadly march around the globe, the search for a vaccine has taken on an intensity never before seen in medical research, with huge implications for public health, the world economy and politics.
Seven of the roughly 90 projects being pursued by governments, pharmaceutical makers, biotech innovators and academic laboratories have reached the stage of clinical trials. With political leaders — not least President Donald Trump — increasingly pressing for progress, and with big potential profits at stake for the industry, drugmakers and researchers have signaled that they are moving ahead at unheard-of speeds.
But the whole enterprise remains dogged by uncertainty about whether any coronavirus vaccine will prove effective, how fast it could be made available to millions or billions of people and whether the rush — compressing a process that can take 10 years into 10 months — will sacrifice safety.
Some experts say the more immediately promising field might be the development of treatments to speed recovery from COVID-19, an approach that has generated some optimism in the last week through initially encouraging research results on remdesivir, an antiviral drug previously tried in fighting Ebola.
In an era of intense nationalism, the geopolitics of the vaccine race are growing as complex as the medicine. The months of mutual vilification between the United States and China over the origins of the virus have poisoned most efforts at cooperation between them. The U.S. government is already warning that American innovations must be protected from theft — chiefly from Beijing.
“Biomedical research has long been a focus of theft, especially by the Chinese government, and vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus are today’s holy grail,” John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security, said on Friday. “Putting aside the commercial value, there would be great geopolitical significance to being the first to develop a treatment or vaccine. We will use all the tools we have to safeguard American research.”

The intensity of the global research effort is such that governments and companies are building production lines before they have anything to produce.
“We are going to start ramping up production with the companies involved,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the federal government’s top expert on infectious diseases, said on NBC this week. “You don’t wait until you get an answer before you start manufacturing.”
Two of the leading entrants in the United States, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, have announced partnerships with manufacturing firms, with Johnson & Johnson promising 1 billion doses of an as-yet-undeveloped vaccine by the end of next year.
Not to be left behind, the Britain-based pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said this week that it was working with a vaccine development project at the University of Oxford to manufacture tens of millions of doses by the end of this year.
With the demand for a vaccine so intense, there are escalating calls for “human-challenge trials” to speed the process: tests in which volunteers are injected with a potential vaccine and then deliberately exposed to the coronavirus.
Because the approach involves exposing participants to a potentially deadly disease, challenge trials are ethically fraught. But they could be faster than simply inoculating human subjects and waiting for them to be exposed along with everyone else, especially as the pandemic is brought under control in big countries.

Even when promising solutions are found, there are big challenges to scaling up production and distribution. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, whose foundation is spending $250 million to help spur vaccine development, has warned about a critical shortage of a mundane but vital component: medical glass.
Without sufficient supplies of the glass, there will be too few vials to transport the billions of doses that will ultimately be needed.
The scale of the problem and the demand for a quick solution are bound to create tensions between the profit motives of the pharmaceutical industry, which typically fights hard to wring the most out of their investments in new drugs, and the public’s need for quick action to get any effective vaccines to as many people as possible.
So far, much of the research and development has been supported by governments and foundations. And much remains to be worked out when it comes to patents and what national governments will claim in return for their support and pledges of quick regulatory approval.
Given the stakes, it is no surprise that while scientists and doctors talk about finding a “global vaccine,” national leaders emphasize immunizing their own populations first. Trump said he was personally in charge of “Operation Warp Speed” to get 300 million doses into American arms by January.
Already, the administration has identified 14 vaccine projects it intends to focus on, a senior administration official said, with the idea of further narrowing the group to a handful that could go on, with government financial help and accelerated regulatory review, to meet Trump’s goal. The winnowing of the projects to 14 was reported Friday by NBC News.
But other countries are also signaling their intention to nationalize their approaches. The most promising clinical trial in China is financed by the government. And in India, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India — the world’s largest producer of vaccine doses — said that most of its vaccine “would have to go to our countrymen before it goes abroad.”
George Daley, the dean of Harvard Medical School, said thinking in country-by-country rather than global terms would be foolhardy since it “would involve squandering the early doses of vaccine on a large number of individuals at low risk, rather than covering as many high-risk individuals globally” — health care workers and older adults — “to stop the spread” around the world.
Given the proliferation of vaccine projects, the best outcome may be none of them emerging as a clear winner.
“Let’s say we get one vaccine quickly but we can only get 2 million doses of it at the end of next year,” said Anita Zaidi, who directs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s vaccine development program. “And another vaccine, just as effective, comes three months later but we can make a billion doses. Who won that race?”
The answer, she said, “is we will need many different vaccines to cross the finish line.”
Speed Versus Safety
At 1 a.m. on March 21, 1963, a 5-year-old girl named Jeryl Lynn Hilleman woke up her father. She had come down with the mumps, which had made her miserable with a swollen jaw.
Advertising
It just so happened that her father, Maurice, was a vaccine designer. So he told Jeryl Lynn to go back to bed, drove to his lab at Merck to pick up some equipment, and returned to swab her throat. Hilleman refrigerated her sample back at his lab and soon got to work weakening her viruses until they could serve as a mumps vaccine. In 1967, it was approved by the FDA.
To vaccine makers, this story is the stuff of legend. Hilleman still holds the record for the quickest delivery of a vaccine from the lab to the clinic. Vaccines typically take 10 to 15 years of research and testing. And only 6% of the projects that scientists launch reach the finish line.
For a world in the grips of COVID-19, on the other hand, this story is the stuff of nightmares. No one wants to wait four years for a vaccine, while millions die and economies remain paralyzed.
Some of the leading contenders for a coronavirus vaccine are now promising to have the first batches ready in record time, by the start of next year. They have accelerated their schedules by collapsing the standard vaccine timeline.
They are combining trials that used to be carried out one after the other. They are pushing their formulations into production, despite the risk that the trials will fail, leaving them with millions of useless doses.
But some experts want to do even more to speed up the conveyor belt. Writing last month in the journal Vaccines, the vaccine developer Dr. Stanley Plotkin and Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center, proposed infecting vaccinated volunteers with the coronavirus — the method known as challenge trials. The procedure might cut months or years off the development but would put test subjects at risk.
Advertising
Challenge trials were used in the early days of vaccine research but now are carried out under strict conditions and only for illnesses, like flu and malaria, that have established treatments.
In an article in March in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, a team of researchers wrote, “Such an approach is not without risks, but every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally.”
Caplan said that limiting the trials to healthy young adults could reduce the risk, since they were less likely to suffer serious complications from COVID-19. “I think we can let people make the choice and I have no doubt many would,” he said.
In Congress, Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill. and a physicist, and Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla. and the former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, organized a bipartisan group of 35 lawmakers to sign a letter asking regulators to approve such trials.
The organizers of a website set up to promote the idea, 1daysooner.org, say they have signed up more than 9,100 potential volunteers from 52 countries.
Some scientists caution that truly informed consent, even by willing volunteers, may not be possible. Even medical experts do not yet know all the effects of the virus. Those who have appeared to recover might still face future problems.
Advertising
Even without challenge trials, accelerated testing may run the risk of missing potential side effects. A vaccine for dengue fever, and one for SARS that never reached the market, were abandoned after making some people more susceptible to severe forms of the diseases, not less.
“It will be extremely important to determine that does not happen,” said Michel De Wilde, a former senior vice president of research and development at Sanofi Pasteur, a vaccine maker in France.
When it comes to the risks from flawed vaccines, China’s history is instructive.
The Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was involved in a 2018 scandal in which ineffective vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and other conditions were injected into hundreds of thousands of babies.
The government confiscated the Wuhan institute’s “illegal income,” fined the company, and punished nine executives. But the company was allowed to continue to operate. It is now running a coronavirus vaccine project, and along with two other Chinese groups has been allowed to combine its safety and efficacy trials.
Several Chinese scientists questioned the decision, arguing that the vaccine should be shown to be safe before testing how well it works.

Nationalism Versus Globalism
In the early days of the crisis, Harvard was approached by Chinese billionaire Hui Ka Yan. He arranged to give roughly $115 million to be split between Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases for a collaborative effort that would include developing coronavirus vaccines.
“We are not racing against each other, we are racing the virus,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a professor at Harvard Medical School who is also working with Johnson & Johnson. “What we need is a global vaccine — because an outbreak in one part of the world puts the rest of the world at risk.”
That all-for-one sentiment has become a mantra among many researchers, but it is hardly universally shared.
In India, the Serum Institute — the heavyweight champion of vaccine manufacturing, producing 1.5 billion doses a year — has signed agreements in recent weeks with the developers of four promising potential vaccines. But in an interview with Reuters, Adar Poonawalla, the company’s billionaire chief executive, made it clear that “at least initially” any vaccine the company produces would have to go to India’s 1.3 billion people.
The tension between those who believe a vaccine should go where it is needed most and those dealing with pressures to supply their own country first is one of the defining features of the global response.
The Trump administration, which in March put out feelers to a German biotech company to acquire its vaccine research or move it to American shores, has awarded grants of nearly half a billion dollars each to two U.S.-based companies, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.

Johnson & Johnson, though based in New Jersey, conducts its research in the Netherlands.
Paul Stoffels, the company’s vice chairman and chief scientific officer, said in an interview that the Department of Health and Human Services understood “we can’t pick up our research and move it” to the United States. But it made sure that the company joined a partnership with Emergent BioSolutions — a Maryland biological production firm — to produce the first big batches of any approved vaccine for the U.S.
“The political reality is that it be would very, very hard for any government to allow a vaccine made in their own country to be exported while there was a major problem at home,” said Sandy Douglas, a researcher at the University of Oxford. “The only solution is to make a hell of a lot of vaccine in a lot of different places.”
The Oxford vaccine team has already begun scaling up plans for manufacturing by half a dozen companies across the world, including China and India, plus two British manufacturers and the British-based multinational AstraZeneca.
In China, the government’s instinct is to showcase the country’s growth into a technological power capable of beating the United States. There are nine Chinese COVID-19 vaccines in development, involving 1,000 scientists and the Chinese military.
China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention predicted that one of the vaccines could be in “emergency use” by September, meaning that in the midst of the presidential election in the United States, Trump might see television footage of Chinese citizens lining up for injections.

“It’s a scenario we have thought about,” one member of Trump’s coronavirus task force said. “No one wants to be around that day.”
Traditional Versus New Methods
The more than 90 different vaccines under development work in radically different ways. Some are based on designs used for generations. Others use genetic-based strategies that are so new they have yet to lead to an approved vaccine.
“I think in this case it’s very wise to have different platforms being tried out,” De Wilde said.
The traditional approach is to make vaccines from viruses.
When our bodies encounter a new virus, they start learning how to make effective antibodies against it. But they are in a race against the virus as it multiplies. Sometimes they produce effective antibodies quickly enough to wipe out an infection. But sometimes the virus wins.
Vaccines give the immune system a head start. They teach it to make antibodies in advance of an infection.
The first vaccines, against diseases like rabies, were made from viruses. Scientists weakened the viruses so that they could no longer make people sick.
Advertising
A number of groups are weakening the coronavirus to produce a vaccine against COVID-19. In April, the Chinese company Sinovac announced that their inactivated vaccine protected monkeys.
Another approach is based on the fact that our immune system makes antibodies that lock precisely onto viruses. As scientists came to understand this, it occurred to them that they didn’t have to inject a whole virus into someone to trigger immunity. All they needed was to deliver the fragment of a viral protein that was the precise target.
Today these so-called subunit viral vaccines are used against hepatitis B and shingles. Many COVID-19 subunit vaccines are now in testing.
In the 1990s, researchers began working on vaccines that enlisted our own cells to help train the immune system. The foundation of these vaccines is typically a virus called an adenovirus. The adenovirus can infect our cells, but is altered so that it doesn’t make us sick.
Scientists can add a gene to the adenovirus from the virus they want to fight, creating what’s known as a viral vector. Some viral vectors then invade our cells, stimulating the immune system to make antibodies.
Researchers at the University of Oxford and the Chinese company CanSino Biologics have created a viral vector vaccine for COVID-19, and they’ve started safety trials on volunteers. Others including Johnson & Johnson are going to launch trials of their own in the coming months.
Advertising
Some groups, including the American company Inovio Pharmaceuticals, are taking a totally different approach. Instead of injecting viruses or protein fragments, they’re injecting pure DNA, which is read by the cell’s machinery, making a copy as an RNA molecule. The RNA is then read by the cell’s protein-building factories, making a viral protein. The protein in turn comes out of the cell, where immune cells bump into it and make an antibody to it.
Other teams are creating RNA molecules rather than DNA. Moderna and a group at Imperial College London have launched safety trials for RNA vaccines. While experimental, these genetic vaccines can be quickly designed and tested.
Designing Versus Manufacturing
It is one thing to design a vaccine in record time. It is an entirely different challenge to manufacture and distribute one on a scale never before attempted — billions of doses, specially packaged and transported at below-zero temperatures, to nearly every corner of the world.
“If you want to give a vaccine to a billion people, it better be very safe and very effective,” said Stoffels of Johnson & Johnson. “But you also need to know how to make it in amounts we’ve never really seen before.”
So the race is on to get ahead of the enormous logistical issues, from basic manufacturing capacity to the shortages of medical glass and stoppers that Gates and others have warned of.
Researchers at Johnson & Johnson are trying to make a five-dose vial to save precious glass, which might work if a smaller dose is enough for inoculation.

Each potential vaccine will require its own customized production process in special “clean” facilities for drug making. Building from scratch might cost tens of millions of dollars per plant. Equipping one existing facility could easily cost from $5 million to $20 million. Ordering and installing the necessary equipment can take months.
Governments as well as organizations like the Gates Foundation and the nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are putting up money for production facilities well before any particular vaccine is proven effective.

Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease are among the most common co-morbidities associated with serious Covid-19 cases in the country, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday.
This as 123 deaths were recorded nationwide.
“We have looked at the data for patients who have been hospitalised and found that, consistent with evidence emerging worldwide, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease are the three most common co-morbidities associated with serious illness from Covid-19,” he added.
Mkhize said other co-morbidities, which are present in admitted patients, were chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic renal disease, malignancy and HIV as well as active and past TB cases.
“I would therefore like to urge our millions of South Africans who are over 63 years of age and those who live with these conditions, to take extra precaution as we ease the lockdown.”
He reiterated the need for continued isolation from the public.
“I would also like to urge all South Africans to continue to stay at home as far as possible, only venturing out to perform essential tasks as we move through the stages of the gradual lifting of the lockdown.”
The numbers so far
Mkhize said as of Saturday night, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa was 6 336, adding tests conducted to date stood at 230 686, of which 13 164 were done in the last 24 hours.
“This is the highest number of tests done in a 24-hour cycle to date.”
Seven Covid-19-related deaths in the Western Cape and Free State have brought the toll to 123, while the number of recoveries stands at 2 549.
The Western Cape has emerged as the epicentre of the virus, with the latest data indicating it accounts for 56 of the 123 deaths countrywide.
The province recorded 779 recoveries, but also led the nation with 2 700 confirmed cases, Mkhize said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease most common co-morbidities in SA Covid-19 patients</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease are among the most common co-morbidities associated with serious Covid-19 cases in the country, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday.
This as 123 deaths were recorded nationwide.
"We have looked at the data for patients who have been hospitalised and found that, consistent with evidence emerging worldwide, hypertension, diabetes and cardiac disease are the three most common co-morbidities associated with serious illness from Covid-19," he added.
Mkhize said other co-morbidities, which are present in admitted patients, were chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic renal disease, malignancy and HIV as well as active and past TB cases.
"I would therefore like to urge our millions of South Africans who are over 63 years of age and those who live with these conditions, to take extra precaution as we ease the lockdown."
He reiterated the need for continued isolation from the public.
"I would also like to urge all South Africans to continue to stay at home as far as possible, only venturing out to perform essential tasks as we move through the stages of the gradual lifting of the lockdown."
The numbers so far
Mkhize said as of Saturday night, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa was 6 336, adding tests conducted to date stood at 230 686, of which 13 164 were done in the last 24 hours.
"This is the highest number of tests done in a 24-hour cycle to date."
ANALYSIS | The big problem with South Africa’s official Covid-19 numbers
Seven Covid-19-related deaths in the Western Cape and Free State have brought the toll to 123, while the number of recoveries stands at 2 549.
The Western Cape has emerged as the epicentre of the virus, with the latest data indicating it accounts for 56 of the 123 deaths countrywide.
The province recorded 779 recoveries, but also led the nation with 2 700 confirmed cases, Mkhize said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Overcrowded DR Congo prisons at high risk from coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus has breached the walls of DR Congo prisons with potentially catastrophic consequences for the overcrowded facilities, charity groups say.
On Thursday and Friday, 43 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19 at the Ndolo military prison in central Kinshasa, Africa's third largest city with at least 10 million inhabitants.
"Tests of all detainees are in progress," according to the latest bulletin by health authorities.
The prison holds 1,900-2,000 prisoners, according to different sources.
The Democratic Republic of Congo has registered 10-20 new cases of the virus per day since it was first detected there on March 10.
The nation has reported 604 cases in all, mostly in Kinshasa, and 32 deaths.
Health Minister Eteni Longondo wants to isolate those infected in the prison and sanitize the cells.
He said that "a woman who brought food" had introduced the virus into the prison.
In mid-April, the non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned that "the Democratic Republic of Congo's overcrowded and unsanitary prisons are at grave risk of COVID-19 outbreaks."
HRW, citing figures by the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO, said: "Congo's main prisons are at 432 percent of capacity."
The prison in Goma had an even higher rate of 600 percent, it added.
Severe overcrowding
The group published photos said to show prisoners sleeping on the floor in a cell at the Makala prison in Kinshasa, at 461 percent of capacity.
It quoted a recently released prisoner as saying that "there were at least 850 of us in a space with a capacity for 100 people."
He added that "the situation is worse in some of the other wings. If the coronavirus reaches Makala, there will be no one left."
According to the health ministry no Covid-19 cases have been detected at the prison to date.
In early January at least 11 prisoners died there from a lack of food and medication, a penitentiary source told AFP.
Other sources say up to 25 people had died.
Each year, hundreds of detainees die in Congolese prisons from starvation and lack of care.
"The quantity of food is not even enough for a two-year-old" according to Augustin, a prisoner on death row in Agenga, northwestern DRC cited by the NGO Ensemble in a report published in December.
It also reported a shortage of medication with the exception of paracetamol and treatments for malaria and tuburculosis,
In addition, the prison in Goma had only three toilets for 500 detainees, it said.
There are around 500 people who have been sentenced to death in the country, which suspended capital punishment in 2003.
They are in contact with the rest of the prison population, "around 71 percent of which still await trial," HRW said.
Justice Minister Celestin Tunda said "at least 1,200 detainees" had been released "to slow the spread of the coronavirus" and that more were expected to be freed next week.
But the Congolese NGO Justicia accused the government of "notorious negligence" in the case of those infected at the Ndolo prison and insisted it "do something to avoid a hecatomb".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AS a part of measures to find a cure to COVID-19 pandemic, an educationist and Chancellor of the Oduduwa University, Ipetumodu, Osun State, Dr. Ramon Adedoyin, has urged the Federal Government to encourage Nigerian scientists and researchers to explore the use of local herbs in the treatment of Coronavirus.
Adedoyin made the appeal while fielding questions from reporters in Ife, Osun State.
The educationist disclosed that he was setting up a research institute inside the Oduduwa University immediately and had earmarked $50,000 for this purpose alone.
According to Adedoyin, before the advent of orthodox medicine, Africans had been using traditional herbs to treat different ailments and diseases successfully, adding that COVID-19 was not an exception.
He advised the Nigerian government to look inwards and try to find internal and homegrown solution to the disease rather than wait for solutions from the western world, which may not come anytime soon.
He made reference to some African countries like Madagascar which recently launched a drug which the country claimed can prevent and cure patients suffering from COVID-19 as a result of research by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research.
“I am setting up a research institute inside the Oduduwa University immediately and has earmarked $50,000 for this purpose alone.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Encourage professors to research into herbs to combat COVID-19 ― Adedoyin tells FG</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
A renowned educationist and Chancellor of Oduduwa University, Ipetumodu, Ife North Local Government, area of Osun State, His Royal Eminence, Dr AbdulRahaman Adegoke Adedoyin has urged the Federal government to encourage Nigeria scientists and researchers to explore the use of local traditional herbs in the effective treatment of the dreaded COVID-19 (Coronavirus) for the use of people of Nigeria.
Dr Adedoyin said this in a statement he made available to Vanguardat the weekend.
The Ife born Prince noted that” before the advent of orthodox medicine, our forefathers used traditional herbs to treat different ailments and diseases successfully. This particular one looks like “lukuluku” and was curtailed then. “I have heard a number of our people claimed they used things like “ori” shea butter, garlic, lemons, palm oil etc to cure the coronavirus.”
Adedoyin was optimistic that Nigerian scientists and researchers would find a potent cure for COVID-19 virus in view of the latest breakthrough made by Madagascar which just announced the solution of a potent cure for the dreaded virus for the use of people of that country.
He said the breakthrough made by Madagascar was as a result of encouragement by the government in support of the researchers and scientists in that country particularly the research by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research.
The educationist also backed the claims by some Nigerians living abroad that some local herbs and recipes could actually be used to combat and treat the stubborn disease.
“The federal government should particularly encourage our researchers and scientists to find a potent cure for COVID-19 virus. We have all that it takes in abundant, both human and natural resources. Nigeria should find a homegrown solution to the problem, this would lasting and reliable rather than relying on drugs from foreign countries.” He said in the statement.
He, therefore, advised the Nigerian government to look inwards and try to find an internal and homegrown solution to the disease and indeed other challenges rather than wait for solutions from the western world which may not come anytime soon.
He, however, said that his university has begun the process of finding solution to end the COVID-19 virus in Nigeria
He said: “I am setting up a research institute inside Oduduwa University immediately and has earmarked $50,000 for this purpose alone”
He further advocated that research be conducted into the properties of such local herbs and recipes like Garlic, Ginger, Tumeric, Shea Butter, Bitter Kola among others which many people are claiming can be used in combatting the coronavirus pandemic.

The chairman further stated that additional ventilators have been procured by the government to assist in the treatment of patients.
On the repatriation of Almajiris in the state, Vakkai said those that test positive to the virus will be isolated before they are repatriated, while those who are negative will be repatriated to their states of origin.
A report on The Guardian disclosed that residents have been thrown into panic following news of the escape.

Some residents in Jalingo, the state capital, who expressed their misgivings to The Guardian, said there was a need for the committee to collaborate with security operatives to fashion out measures that would lead to her immediate arrest.
Meanwhile, the director-general of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Chikwe Ihekweazu, has said that Nigeria and the rest of the world would not return to normalcy until next year - at the very least.

Two more African countries have joined the list of patrons for Madagascar’s purported cure for COVID-19. Tanzania and Comoros confirmed their interest in the herbal cure over this weekend.
The Comorian president, Azali Assoumani, held a teleconference with his Malagasy counterpart, Andry Rajoelina, following which a formal request was made for the product.
Rajoelina posted a screenshot of their meeting on Twitter with the caption which read in part: “He (Assoumani) wishes to benefit from CovidOrganics for Comoros. We will supply them as a sign of solidarity with our brothers in the Indian Ocean!”
In the case of Tanzania, President John Pombe Magufuli whiles speaking at an event on Sunday disclosed that the country will also make requests of the herbal cure to help in the fight against the pandemic.
“I have been in talks with Madagascar. They say they have discovered the medicine for COVID-19. We will send a plane to bring the medicine to Tanzania so that Tanzanians can benefit from it,” he is quoted to have said.
Meanwhile, the Guinea-Bissau delegation that took flew to Madagascar to take the consignment have returned home with the products. Equatorial Guinea was the first country to receive the donation.
The Republic of Congo also announced on Saturday that a consignment will soon be imported. So far, Rajoelina has received praise from a number of his peers including presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal – all of whom he has held teleconferences with.
During an African Union meeting late last month, he stressed the importance of the herbal cure – a variant of which prevents the virus, whiles another cures it. Speaking to colleague heads of state with a bottle of COVID-Organics on his table, he reiterated the viability of the herbal cure.
“There are two treatment protocols (curative and preventive). The state of health of Covid-19 patients who took Tambavy CVO CovidOrganics improved after 7 days and fully recovered after 10 days,” Rajoelina said in an April 30 tweet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tripura doctor develops PPE face shield costing Rs 40 amid coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A doctor from Tripura has developed a PPE face shield costing only Rs 40, to protect frontline medical personnel from contracting COVID-19 while treating patients.
A face shield is a protective gear with a transparent visor attached to a headband. It protects the wearer from coming in contact with respiratory droplets through which, according to the World Health Organisation, the novel coronavirus spreads.
Dr Arkadipta Choudhury, an assistant professor at the Tripura Medical College (TMC), said that he developed the face shield, 'Stopdrop', using readily available inexpensive materials.
With the coronavirus outbreak affecting delivery of products, Dr Choudhury made the face shield using compressed polyester, inexpensive straps and visors.

The medical institution he is employed in, procured 300 pieces of 'Stradrop' after rigorously testing the product and placed an order for 2,000 more units at the rate of Rs 40 per piece.
"The manufacturing cost of a face shield used in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is only Rs 20-25, but is sold in the range of Rs 250 to Rs 499 in pharmacies and online retail platforms," the 31-year-old medical practitioner told PTI.
"According to the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health, PPE kits, including face shields, are given only to personnel treating confirmed COVID-19 patients. However, with the number of asymptomatic patients on the rise, the medical personnel are at a higher risk of contracting the disease," he said.

His products are already in use in the ENT, ophthalmology and gastroenterology departments and at the OPD of the hospital.
"The virus we are dealing with is a respiratory one which enters the body through mouth or nose. So, I helped the medical personnel cover their faces," he said.
Dr Arindam Dutta, Medical Superintendent of the hospital and chairman of the institution's COVID-19 task force, said, "We are using the face shields at our hospital. Doctors are very happy and find them very handy. Dr Choudhury has also made slight modifications to the face shields as per the requirements of various departments."
ENT Department head Dr Prabir Saha said Dr Choudhury's face shield effectively prevents medical personnel from coming in contact with respiratory droplets.
"When a medical personnel collects samples from a patient's mouth, he or she is at risk of contracting the disease. Dr Choudhury's face shield is very useful as PPE is issued only to personnel dealing with confirmed COVID-19 patients," he said.
Dr Shivasekhar Dutta, a professor of preventive medicine at the hospital, said 'Stopdrop' is entirely Dr Choudhury's brainchild.
"The device can also be useful for police personnel and journalists. We will approach the trademark office in Kolkata to get a design approval for starting commercial production," Dr Choudhury said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Reproductive Health Centre at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital has resumed its cervical cancer screening campaign but by appointments to prevent overcrowding at the facility.The screening, which started in January as part of the nationwide cervical cancer awareness campaign, was expected to end in June 2020.However, it was suspended due to the three-week lockdown in Accra to contain the spread of COVID-19.Ms Rose Eduful, the Principal Nursing Officer, of the Centre, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), therefore, urged clients to schedule appointments to be screened."One can walk-in to book an appointment or contact 0243840804 for that to be done on their behalf," she said.“The same process of calling would be followed for those coming to get their test results and also a picture of the results could be sent to the client upon request.”Ms Eduful said as part of the measures put in place by the Centre to contain the spread of COVID-19, clients were required to wear face masks, wash their hands, and use hand sanitizers.She advised women to take advantage of the ongoing cervical cancer screening exercise; while observing the new protocols for safety.The early detection of cervical cancer, she advised, could help in preventing the disease from reaching an advanced stage where it could be detrimental to the patient.“So for women having the fear of the unknown as their deterrent for not screening, they should know that early detection is key to preventing the scourge of the disease,” she stated.Cervical cancer, caused by the Humanpapilloma Virus, is the second most frequent occurring cancer in women after breast cancer, and a common cause of cancer related deaths in developing countries.Current statistics in Ghana indicate that annually, more than 3,000 women are diagnosed with the disease and more than 2,000 die from it.The disease is common in women and girls who are sexually active.Deaths due to cervical cancer are projected to rise by almost 25 per cent over the next 10 years, hence the need for the campaign to allow for more screening.Mrs Eduful said the vaccination against the virus was ongoing, adding that, women could walk in at anytime to take a shot.The screening exercise is now GH¢ 80.00 saying, but after June it will go back to GH¢ 150.00.

Ms Rose Eduful, the Principal Nursing Officer, of the Centre, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), therefore, urged clients to schedule appointments to be screened.
"One can walk-in to book an appointment or contact 0243840804 for that to be done on their behalf," she said.
“The same process of calling would be followed for those coming to get their test results and also a picture of the results could be sent to the client upon request.”
Ms Eduful said as part of the measures put in place by the Centre to contain the spread of COVID-19, clients were required to wear face masks, wash their hands, and use hand sanitizers.
She advised women to take advantage of the ongoing cervical cancer screening exercise; while observing the new protocols for safety.
The early detection of cervical cancer, she advised, could help in preventing the disease from reaching an advanced stage where it could be detrimental to the patient.
“So for women having the fear of the unknown as their deterrent for not screening, they should know that early detection is key to preventing the scourge of the disease,” she stated.
Cervical cancer, caused by the Humanpapilloma Virus, is the second most frequent occurring cancer in women after breast cancer, and a common cause of cancer related deaths in developing countries.
Current statistics in Ghana indicate that annually, more than 3,000 women are diagnosed with the disease and more than 2,000 die from it.
The disease is common in women and girls who are sexually active.
Deaths due to cervical cancer are projected to rise by almost 25 per cent over the next 10 years, hence the need for the campaign to allow for more screening.
Mrs Eduful said the vaccination against the virus was ongoing, adding that, women could walk in at anytime to take a shot.
The screening exercise is now GH¢ 80.00 saying, but after June it will go back to GH¢ 150.00.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is planning to study whether the novel coronavirus strain in India has undergone mutation while spreading within the country over the last two months.
According to a senior scientist of the country’s apex health research body, determining whether or not the SARS-CoV2 strain has changed form will help in ensuring the effectiveness of a potential vaccine. “The study will also indicate whether it has become more virulent and increased transmission capability.”

Samples will be collected from COVID-19 patients to study whether the novel coronavirus strain has mutated or not, he said.
However, the study can begin once the lockdown is lifted since currently there are difficulties involved in transportation of samples from different states and Union Territories, scientists said.
As per Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), so far the maximum difference in the novel coronavirus strain in India has been found to be between 0.2 to 0.9 per cent as compared to the strains in other countries, another scientist said.
GISAID, which promotes international sharing of all influenza virus sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data, has over 7,000 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 deposited by various laboratories across the world where they have classified the virus based on their mutations.

There are chances that people arriving in India from different countries are bringing various strains of the virus.
Three strains of the virus have been traced in India so far. One was from Wuhan, and the other two from Italy and Iran. The sequence of the coronavirus strain from Iran was similar to that of China.
“It will take some time for us to know the predominant quasi-species of the novel coronavirus in the country. But mutations are not likely to make potential vaccines ineffective, as all sub-types of the virus have the same enzymes. Also, it has been in India for three months and it does not mutate very fast,” Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar had said earlier.
Six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19, joining the global race to find a preventive for the deadly infection spreading rapidly across the world.

Nearly 70 ‘vaccine candidates’ are being tested and at least three have moved to the human clinical trial stage, but a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021.
India has also collaborated with WHO’s multi-country “solidarity trial” for developing potential treatments and drugs for COVID-19.
The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,218 and the number of cases climbed to 37,336 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 26,167, while 9,950 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Moderna Covid Drug Production Deal, And Other News: The Good, Bad And Ugly Of Biopharma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Summary
Moderna Boosts Production with Lonza Deal
Moderna Therapeutics (MRNA) announced its new collaboration with Lonza for boosting its production capacity for mRNA 1273. The company had recently struck a deal with the federal government to focus on developing COVID 19 vaccine candidate. The company stands to receive $483 million from BARDA for accelerating the development of the vaccine. Moderna dosed the first patient under its Phase I clinical trial in March.
Under the latest deal with the Swiss firm, Moderna will be able to use Lonza manufacturing facilities in the United States and Switzerland. It is expected that the technology transfer may be started in June while the batch production in the United States may begin in July. Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said, “This long-term strategic collaboration agreement will enable Moderna to accelerate, by 10 times, our manufacturing capacity for mRNA-1273 and additional products in Moderna’s large clinical portfolio. Lonza’s global presence and expertise are critical as we scale at unprecedented speed." The agreed longevity of the deal is 10 years and will involve creations of manufacturing suites at various Lonza manufacturing sites.
Moderna also recently announced that it has submitted with the FDA its plan to start Phase 2 and later stage trials of the vaccine candidate. The company has received early feedback for its Phase 2 study design. It is anticipated that the dosing for Phase 2 may start during the second quarter. The company is looking to enroll 600 healthy subjects for assessing the safety and efficacy of the shot with doses administered 28 days apart. Currently, there are a number of pharma companies in the race to produce vaccine for fight against COVID 19.
In response to the latest deal, Lonza chairman and CEO ad interim Albert Baehny said, “The current pandemic illustrates the need to combine the best science with resilient supply chains that can scale. We are fully committed to leveraging our global network and experience in manufacturing technologies to support Moderna’s manufacture of mRNA-1273 as well as collaborating on future Moderna products.”
Moderna’s collaboration with US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) involves development of mRNA 1273, which is an mRNA vaccine that encodes for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (NYSE:S) protein. BARDA is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services and its funding will support late stage clinical development programs for the vaccine. In order to scale up, Moderna anticipates to hire up to 150 new employees, including engineers, clinical staff and manufacturing staff.
The company’s new tie up with Lonza is expected to allow the manufacturing of up to a billion doses per year. Lonza is based out of Basel in Switzerland.
Marker Receives Orphan Drug Designation for AML Drug Candidate
Marker Therapeutics (MRKR) announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation to its acute myeloid leukemia drug candidate MT 401. The orphan drug candidate offers several benefits such as tax credits for qualified clinical trials and 7 years of market exclusivity if the drug candidate is approved. The FDA generally grants this tag to novel biologics and drugs aiming to provide safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.
MT 401 is a multi-tumor associated antigen-specific T cell based product developed for treating AML following allogeneic stem cell transplant. The company CEO and President Peter Hoang said, “In investigator-sponsored trials, our MultiTAA-specific T cell product candidate was well-tolerated and we have observed clinical benefit across various liquid and solid tumors, suggesting the product candidate's ability to induce a patient's own T cells to expand for a more durable anti-tumor effect.” The drug candidate has been given the tag for treating hematological malignancies and solid tumor indications.
Marker Therapeutics reported that it is planning to start its Phase 2 study in subjects with post allegeneic stem cell transplant AML. T cells are obtained from healthy donors and are made to undergo a two-step cell culture process. The process leads to creation of CD4 and CD8 cell mixture which is able to identify multiple tumor specific antigens.
Marker Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on developing next-generation T cell-based immunotherapies for treating hematological malignancies and solid tumor indications. The company’s technology relies upon selective expansion of non-engineered, tumor-specific T cells that recognize tumor associated antigens and kill tumor cells expressing those targets. However, Marker does not genetically engineer its T Cell therapies and therefore its drug candidates are expected to be less expensive to manufacture.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Draws Blank on Phase 3 Clinical Trial
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ) reported that it has halted the enrolment in its Phase 3 clinical study of defibrotide. The company stated that the decision was taken on the recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) which opined that the study is highly unlikely to produce statistical significance for the primary endpoint of VOD-free survival at Day +30 post-HSCT in the final analysis.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals further stated that the IDMC reached the said recommendation after completing pre-planned interim analysis of the initial 280 patients and where the protocol-specified futility criteria were met. Robert Iannone, M.D., M.S.C.E., executive vice president, research and development of Jazz Pharmaceuticals said, "While enrollment has been discontinued, the trial will run to completion through the follow-up of the more than 370 patients enrolled. VOD is a rapidly progressive and devastating condition that can develop following stem-cell transplantation. As the only approved treatment with demonstrated efficacy based on survival at 100 days after HSCT, defibrotide is an important medicine for this patient population." The company has notified relevant authorities about the decision of discontinuance.
The company stated that the patients already enrolled in the study may be allowed to continue participation if deemed appropriate after further investigation. The relevant Phase 3 was not intended to further assess defibrotide for the treatment of VOD and does not impact the approved indication or other ongoing clinical studies. The Phase 3 study was a randomized, open-label, multi-center trial with an adaptive design. The main aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of defibrotide versus best supportive care in the prevention of hepatic VOD.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals mainly aims to develop medicines for critical diseases with limited treatment options. The main focus of the company is on neuroscience and oncology including movement disorders, sleep medicine and hematologic tumors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vaccine leader Moderna Inc. signs deal for 1 billion Covid-19 doses a year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London: Moderna Inc., one of the leaders among U.S. companies developing experimental vaccines against the coronavirus, entered a pact with Lonza Group AG aimed at manufacturing 1 billion doses a year.
The companies announced a global agreement under which the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical company will ramp up output of the proposed vaccine, which is based on a novel technology that relies on genetic material called mRNA. They expect the first batches to be produced in the U.S. in July.
The agreement is one of several partnerships being struck between drugmakers as they rush to bring protection against Covid-19 to the market. On Thursday, AstraZeneca Plc announced an agreement to make an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, eyeing production capacity for 100 million doses by the end of the year.
Because prospects for drugs to treat Covid-19 remain uncertain, rolling out vaccines on a widespread scale could be key to reopening economies from lockdowns. Otherwise new waves of infections could emerge, potentially on a seasonal pattern like the flu. If Moderna and Lonza reach their target of 1 billion doses a year, that would be enough for more than one-eighth of the world’s population.
With dozens of projects under way around the world, the Trump administration wants to make shots available for Americans by the end of 2020. Richard Hatchett, head of the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, has said cooperation between drugmakers could accelerate the process of bringing out a vaccine, which normally would take a year or more.

Moderna’s experimental shot induces the body’s own cells to make virus-like proteins that stimulate an immune response and prepare for an actual infection. It was one of the first proposed coronavirus vaccines to enter human trials. The company said it plans to begin the next phase of studies this quarter.
Shares of Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have more than doubled since the start of the year as its studies of its vaccine candidate have advanced. In premarket trading Friday, they rose 3%.
The pact with Lonza will enable a tenfold increase in manufacturing, which Moderna has already begun, according to a statement.
The smaller players in the race won’t be able to produce a vaccine in large quantities on their own. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., another U.S. biotech company in the first stage of testing an experimental vaccine, said Thursday that it agreed to expand a manufacturing collaboration with Germany’s Richter-Helm Biologics.
A partnership between Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc announced last month brought together a pair of pharmaceutical giants with manufacturing might. Sanofi will test its experimental coronavirus vaccine with Glaxo supplying so-called adjuvants, additional ingredients that improve efficacy and make it easier to produce shots in larger quantities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scientists to test sewage for years to track COVID bug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victorian’s sewage looks set to be monitored for COVID-19 outbreaks for years after the current pandemic, with the state’s effluent a potential early warning system for new outbreaks.
Scientists from Melbourne Water have been quietly taking samples of sewage from around the city for weeks and working on a diagnostic test for the virus.
They hope this will lead to an early-warning system that senses an outbreak before it shows up in clinical testing.
The project team believes it could be just weeks away from a reliable method of detecting COVID-19 in sewage, with overseas experience suggesting surveillance of human waste can be a powerful weapon in public health officials' armoury against the virus.
Testing sewage for viruses is not new, said project manager Dan Deere, who has been hired by national body Water Research Australia to work on what has become a nationwide effort. The periodic monitoring for polio have taken place for decades.
Dr Deere said there is a lot of science to be done before a working sewage surveillance system is in place for COVID-19.
“We know we can test sewage and find diseases,” he said.
“The problem in this case is that this is a new virus and the methods for testing for it haven’t been through the usual rigour.”
Dr Deere said once a reliable test was in place, along with the know-how to use it most effectively, the team could move to “phase three” of their task – “routine surveillance”.
“This may go on for a year or two when the health department would say they want us to and test Ballarat or Shepparton and do it once a month or once a week and keep going,” Dr Deere said.
The science could also be used to detect COVID-19 in small enclosed environments such as planes and cruise ships.
But developing the test is a big job, with 12 water utilities around Australia, six health departments and 10 research organisations involved.
Nick Crosbie from Melbourne Water is leading a team that is working out the best way to sample wastewater, finding the best points in the sewage systems of Victoria’s towns and cities to tell him and his colleagues if COVID-19 is lurking in local populations.
But the detection method must be sensitive enough to be able to track down the killer bug in waste from large populations, Dr Crosbie said.
“If you take, say [Werribee’s] Western Treatment Plant, there are over 2 million people in that catchment,” he said.
“Likewise if you take a small town of say 40,000 people, if you have a sensitive method and you were able to detect COVID with that method, then that gives you another line of information to provide to health authorities.
“It won’t replace clinical testing, its additional information they can use to help target their screening and also to see if there’s anything unexpected.”
Early reports from the US, France and the Netherlands have raised hopes and Dr Crosbie said he is cautiously optimistic.
“You’d call it high risk, high gain,” he said.
“It’s technically challenging so its high risk but if you can crack that technical nut and the preliminary evidence from overseas is promising, then it’s high gain because you’d have that ability to screen a large population efficiently.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Wars threat: study
The Star Wars military program had the potential to “tear the Western Alliance apart”, the Australian-born director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Dr Robert O’Neil, said. Star Wars, officially called the Strategic Defence Initiative, had reopened the old arguments of the late '60s about the desirability of anti-ballistic missile systems. Dr O’Neil was launching the institute’s 1984-85 Strategic Survey.
No sale of the century
“A champion contestant on the television quiz show Sale of the Century has been forced to return all her prizes after the producers discovered she had appeared on the program before,” wrote entertainment reporter Richard Glover. “She did well during her first appearances on the show 2½ years ago. During her second try, recorded over the past few weeks, the woman did even better, winning eight episodes.”
Rector quits over wine
“An Anglican rector is to quit his parish in a dispute concerning the use of non-alcoholic grape juice in Holy Communion. The Rev Lance Keogh, rector of St Barnabas’s, Oberon, is at loggerheads with the Bishop of Bathurst, the Rt Rev Howell Witt, who adopts the traditional line that fermented or alcoholic wine should be used. It was hinted that the rector was concerned with the situation of recovered alcoholics.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to sanitise your smartphone during coronavirus outbreak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As per a new study, scheduled for publication in Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, mobile phones could be acting as “Trojan horses” for COVID-19. The research is a review of 56 previous studies from 24 countries and it found that 68 per cent of the phones sampled in these studies were contaminated.
These studies predate the coronavirus pandemic and found a cocktail of live germs including Golden staph and E. Coli microbes on phones. However, the authors of the review believe that SARS-Cov-2 is probably present on mobiles and other touch-screen devices of coronavirus sufferers.
“Our recommendation is that phones should be decontaminated daily and regularly with either 70% isopropyl or by sanitising with (ultraviolet) devices like PhoneSoap,” said the study. Here is how you can disinfect your phone.
Cleaning your phone or tablet could be a tricky matter and you need to be extra careful while cleaning the screen. Follow these steps to clean and disinfect your iPhone, iPad, Android smartphone, or tablet:
*Make sure your device is unplugged
*First clean your phone with a soft slightly damp lint-free microfibre cloth
*You can also dampen the corner of the cloth to wipe the screen and use the dry corner to remove excess moisture left on the phone/tablet
*Now use a disinfecting wipe to make it germs free after you are done cleaning
*In case you don’t have disinfecting wipes, you can use rubbing alcohol
*Prepare a solution with 70 per cent isopropyl and spray it on to a microfibre cloth. Now gently wipe your smartphone before the solution dries out
After you are done cleaning your phone, there is another way to disinfect your device. You can invest in a UV light sanitizer to kill off the germs present on your phone. Also, while you are at it, do not forget to clean and disinfect your phone’s case.
Notably, different types of cases need a different type of cleaning.Plastic/silicone cases could be cleaned by soaking in a soapy water solution and rinsing off with water. For leather cases, damp the microfibre cloth with soapy water solution and wipe it clean. Wood cases need to be cleaned using water and vinegar solution followed by rinsing off with water.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Researchers Produce New COVID-19 Disinfectant That Protects Surfaces for 90 Days</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What if there were a substance that, if sprayed on surfaces, could get rid of the coronavirus and other viruses and bacteria for 90 days? This would greatly reduce the chance of infection and go a long way in protecting people.
RELATED: UV BACTERIA-KILLING ROBOT CLEANS HOSPITAL ROOMS FAR BETTER THAN HUMANS
Now, researchers at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) have produced exactly such a disinfectant. They call it the Multilevel Antimicrobial Polymer (MAP-1) coating, and they report that it is "effective in killing viruses, bacteria, and even hard-to-kill spores. MAP-1 can inactivate up to 99.9% of highly-infectious viruses such as measles, mumps and rubella, and 99.99% of the surrogate feline calicivirus (FCV)," according to HKUST's press release.
The MAP-1 coating was tested in two field studies in the Kowloon Hospital and Haven of Hope Woo Ping Care and Attention Home and in the Water Supplies Department and the Drainage Services Department.
"We ran a seven-months field trial of the coating on privacy partition curtains in a local public hospital and six months study on bed linens in an elderly home, and the results are very encouraging, with the total amount of bacteria reduced by over 99% and 95.8% on the curtains and ben linens respectively," said Yeung King Lun, Professor of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Division of Environment and Sustainability.
The new coating is significantly better than traditional alcohol-based disinfectants that lose their power as soon as they evaporate. MAP-1 is activated by any type of heat, such as a hand touching a surface or even sweat droplets.
Once activated, it releases its microbial and virus-fighting power, including its COVID-19 fighting power, to disinfect the surface once more.
"According to the Technical Standard for Disinfection issued by the National Health Commission in Mainland China, the coating is proven to be non-toxic and is safe for skin and the environment, hence it also allows MAP-1 to be made into hand sanitizers, paints and coating, filter materials for air and water purification, as well as clothing and surgical masks to safeguard the health of the individual and public," reads the HKUST's press release.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doctors are struggling to give non-coronavirus patients the important care they need, due to the pandemic, a survey has suggested.
Thousands of medics also said the long-term impact of Covid-19 on NHS demand was their greatest concern for the future, according to research from the British Medical Association (BMA).
More than half of the 16,000 members questioned said the pandemic was worsening the care of those without the illness, with almost 30% saying current conditions had left them short of supplies such as medicines or oxygen.
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
The chairman of the BMA council says patients are being “neglected” and he is concerned about a “sudden spike in demand” when Covid cases begin to drop.
Dr Chaand Nagpaul added: “Before any lockdown measures are eased, the Government has rightly insisted that the NHS must be able to cope.
“These results clearly show that this is not just about Covid, but also a potential surge in other patients who may have put off accessing healthcare or indeed had their treatment deferred.”
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has called on ministers to “come forward with a funded, credible plan to help the NHS get ready to meet this growing need.”
An NHS spokesman said the poll was a “sad statement of the obvious”.
“Like every other health service around the world, hospitals in this country have had to adapt quickly and decisively to deal with the greatest public health threat in over a century.
“It’s a source of pride for the NHS that every coronavirus patient who needs hospital care has been able to receive it, and NHS emergency services have been available to all patients, with or without Covid-19, throughout this pandemic.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA Space Lasers Offer 'Fantastically Detailed' Look At The World's Ice Loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ice sheets are melting, and a new study research relies on state-of-the-art technology to reveal where the biggest losses are happening. It’s pretty freaking cool even if the results are bad news.
The findings, published in Science on Thursday, use space lasers to create a detailed view of the planet’s biggest pieces of ice. The team of researchers, which includes scientists from NASA and the University of Washington, looked at ice mass change from 2003 to 2019 to get a sense of how global warming is affecting these critical ice sheets.
The findings show increased snow accumulation isn’t enough to offset massive ice losses in Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland has shed an average of 200 gigatons of ice a year, and Antarctica has lost an average of 118 gigatons of ice a year. That’s contributed to more than half an inch of sea level rise over the past 16 years alone, a rate that is expected to accelerate and affect our numerous cities and infrastructure located on the coast.
Previous studies have shown that sea-level rise may cause extreme floods to happen daily in most of the U.S. coast by the end of the century. By 2050, we may be bidding farewell to our beloved beaches as well. But to refine our understanding of the future, scientists need to understand what’s going with ice sheets today.
The researchers gathered the data for the new study using two laser altimeters that can measure the height of snow surface from space on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite or ICESat. The first ICESat launched in 2003 and collected data until it was retired in 2010. A second ICESat—dubbed ICESat-2—launched in 2018 with an even more precise laser altimeter to gather data.
“The result is a fantastically detailed look at how the ice sheets are changing over a 15+ year period,” Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado’s Earth Science and Observation Centre who was not involved in the study, told Earther.
The study shows ice sheets are gaining some snow but losing mass overall. Though Antarctica is growing thicker in its interior, the coasts of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula are particularly vulnerable to ice loss. Warm ocean water undercuts floating ice shelves there and causing more ice to spill into the sea, more than offsetting the interior gains.
Greenland is also experiencing some thickening in its interior, but this is mostly happening at high elevations. Here, too, this snow accumulation isn’t enough to offset the melting of ice on the coasts.
“Our study showed that there are a variety of processes at work in Antarctica and Greenland, with thickening in some places and thinning in others,” author Ben Smith, the principal physicist at the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory, told Earther in an email. “We can measure both processes precisely, and our study shows that the net result is that the loss of ice from the grounded ice sheets into the ocean is making a large contribution to sea-level rise.”
This research fits in line with what previous studies have shown. It also doesn’t include other factors that could be driving even more ice loss. Smith said the satellites measure thickness of the ice sheets and shelves, but they don’t capture the majoricebergcalvingevents we’ve seen in recent years. Nor do they capture the breakdown at the front of ice shelves where researchers worry ever greater walls of ice could tumble into the ocean. That could be an unstoppable destabilizing force in the coming decades, particularly for West Antarctica. In short, what we’re seeing in this study is likely only a slice of what’s to come for these critical ice sheets—and the coasts that could suffer if melt speeds up.
“It is only capturing the beginning of the ice sheet changes we expect to see,” Smith said. “We need to keep making measurements like these in years and decades to come to understand the long-term evolution of the ice sheets.”
These findings illustrate just how quickly ice is going away as temperatures rise. How worse this gets depends entirely on much longer the world goes on without sufficient climate action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA's ICESat-2 mission tracks the decline of ice sheets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From the frozen crags of the Andes and the Rockie mountains to the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica, the world's ice has been melting at an accelerated rate in the last five years. This is why observations and data on ice sheet mass changes are essential to our understanding of present and future sea-level changes.
People may not realize this, but humans evolved on a planet where ice was a climate regulator. Not only did it reflect some of the sun's heat back into space, but the ice stored vast amounts of moisture.
The amount of water locked up in ice and snow is only about 1.7 percent of all water on Earth, but the majority of total freshwater on Earth, about 68.7 percent, is held in ice caps and glaciers.
Accurately measuring the amount of ice loss is essential to keeping track of sea-level rise. As the ice melts in Greenland and Antarctica, the water surges toward the Equator where sea-level rise is already two to three times as fast as the global average.
In a new study published April 30, 2020, in the journal Science by a team of researchers from around the country, led by Ben Smith of the University of Washington, data from NASA's ICESat ( Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite) missions was used to determine that ice sheets are losing billions of tons of mass into the ocean each year, contributing significantly to global sea-level rise.
Launched in September 2018, the mission was a much-anticipated follow-up to a previous ICESat mission, which concluded in 2009, reports Scientific American. ICESat-2 is very precise, too.
ICESat-2’s instrument is a laser altimeter, which sends 10,000 pulses of light a second down to Earth’s surface, and times how long it takes to return to the satellite – to within a billionth of a second. The instrument’s pulse rate allows for a dense map of measurement over the ice sheet; its high precision allows scientists to determine how much an ice sheet changes over a year to within an inch.
The findings are disturbing and definitely something to worry about. The study calculated that Greenland lost about 200 gigatons per year during the study period that covered 16 years of satellite data, and Antarctica about 118 gigatons annually, together raising sea level by 0.55 inches.
The study helped to differentiate between the processes that cause the melting—in some cases shifts in winds that push warmer water toward the ice, or, in other cases, changes within the ice sheets and glaciers themselves. The researchers were able to show how some polar melting is caused by shifting winds and ocean currents, or by rising air temperature alone. And that helps determine if the ice is near a tipping point that could lead to faster melting.

A new test can detect glaucoma progression 18 months earlier than the current gold standard method, said the study published in the journal Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics. Also Read - Autism Spectrum Disorder: Medical Problems That Fall Under The Condition
Glaucoma, the leading global cause of irreversible blindness, affects over 60 million people, which is predicted to double by 2040 as the global population ages.
Loss of sight in glaucoma is caused by the death of cells in the retina, at the back of the eye.
“Being able to diagnose glaucoma at an earlier stage, and predict its course of progression, could help people to maintain their sight, as treatment is most successful if provided at an early stage of the disease,” said study first author Eduardo Normando from Imperial College London.
The test, called DARC (Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells), involves injecting into the bloodstream (via the arm) a fluorescent dye that attaches to retinal cells, and illuminates those that are in the process of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.
The damaged cells appear bright white when viewed in eye examinations — the more damaged cells detected, the higher the DARC count.
One challenge with evaluating eye diseases is that specialists often disagree when viewing the same scans, so the researchers have incorporated an AI algorithm into their method.
In the Phase II clinical trial of DARC, the AI was used to assess 60 of the study participants — 20 with glaucoma and 40 healthy control subjects.
The AI was initially trained by analysing the retinal scans (after injection of the dye) of the healthy control participants.
The AI was then tested on the glaucoma patients.
Those taking part in the AI study were followed up 18 months after the main trial period to see whether their eye health had deteriorated.
The researchers were able to accurately predict progressive glaucomatous damage 18 months before that seen with the current gold standard OCT retinal imaging technology, as every patient with a DARC count over a certain threshold was found to have progressive glaucoma at follow-up.
“These results are very promising as they show DARC could be used as a biomarker when combined with the AI-aided algorithm,” said lead researcher Francesca Cordeiro from University College London (UCL) Institute of Ophthalmology.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AI-supported test for very early signs of glaucoma progression</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new test can detect glaucoma progression 18 months earlier than the current gold standard method, according to results from a UCL-sponsored clinical trial.
The technology, supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, could help accelerate clinical trials, and eventually may be used in detection and diagnostics, according to the Wellcome-funded study published today in Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics.
Lead researcher Professor Francesca Cordeiro (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, Imperial College London, and Western Eye Hospital Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) said: "We have developed a quick, automated and highly sensitive way to identify which people with glaucoma are at risk of rapid progression to blindness."
Glaucoma, the leading global cause of irreversible blindness, affects over 60 million people, which is predicted to double by 2040 as the global population ages. Loss of sight in glaucoma is caused by the death of cells in the retina, at the back of the eye.
The test, called DARC (Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells), involves injecting into the bloodstream (via the arm) a fluorescent dye that attaches to retinal cells, and illuminates those that are in the process of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. The damaged cells appear bright white when viewed in eye examinations - the more damaged cells detected, the higher the DARC count.

The researchers were able to accurately predict progressive glaucomatous damage 18 months before that seen with the current gold standard OCT retinal imaging technology, as every patient with a DARC count over a certain threshold was found to have progressive glaucoma at follow-up.
"These results are very promising as they show DARC could be used as a biomarker when combined with the AI-aided algorithm," said Professor Cordeiro, adding that biomarkers - measurable biological indicators of disease state or severity - are urgently needed for glaucoma, to speed up clinical trials as the disease progresses slowly so it can take years for symptoms to change.
"What is really exciting, and actually unusual when looking at biological markers, is that there was a clear DARC count threshold above which all glaucoma eyes went on to progress," she added.
First author Dr Eduardo Normando (Imperial College London and Western Eye Hospital Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) said: "Being able to diagnose glaucoma at an earlier stage, and predict its course of progression, could help people to maintain their sight, as treatment is most successful if provided at an early stage of the disease. After further research in longitudinal studies, we hope that our test could have widespread clinical applications for glaucoma and other conditions."
The team is also applying the test to rapidly detect cell damage caused by numerous conditions other than glaucoma, such as other neurodegenerative conditions that involve the loss of nerve cells, including age-related macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis, and dementia.
The AI-supported technology has recently been approved by both the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the USA's Food and Drug Administration as an exploratory endpoint for testing a new glaucoma drug in a clinical trial.
The researchers are also assessing the DARC test in people with lung disease, and hope that by the end of this year, the test may help to assess people with breathing difficulties from Covid-19.
DARC is being commercialised by Novai, a newly formed company of which Professor Cordeiro is Chief Scientific Officer.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the Geula neighborhood of Jerusalem, a special Coronavirus swab samples station was activated recently.
The station, built in a container, developed by the IDF and MDA, is designated to swab civilians without signs and symptoms who may reach the location on foot. The name of the station is "Keren Or" – "A ray of light", it includes 6 windows enabling teams to take hundreds of samples a day. Until now 3,166 people have been sampled.
Due to its unique design, the "Keren Or" station can be relocated on the back of a truck, and maintain the public order and social distancing procedures during operations. MDA team members are operating the station and the technical aspects are the responsibility of the soldiers and officers IDF's Technology Brigade.
The new innovative station was stationed at the Shneller compound, located in Jerusalem's Geula neighborhood, and order was kept by ushers in order to maintain social distancing. The MDA sampling teams sitting inside the container are protected by a high pressure air system that pushes out the air and maintains a fully sterile environment.
Brigadier General Tal Aharon the head of the IDF Technology & Logistics Brigade: "the mobile lab was developed by the technology division who worked day and night in order to quickly find an innovative solution and assist in the battle against the Coronavirus outbreak. The mobile station is able to conduct multiple swab samples in a relatively short amount time and by doing so assisted in reducing the rate of infection and maintaining the safety of the medical teams. The Technology and Logistics Brigade as well as all the IDF will continue to assist in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak".
MDA Director General Eli Bin: "the Keren Or station is an amazing development by the IDF Technology & Logistics Brigade, that placed the public health at the front and utilized their knowledge and expertise for the Israeli citizens. This development, like the DriveThru compounds, has a crucial role in the struggle against the Coronavirus outbreak, and make it possible to increase the number of swab samples taken throughout the country, while maintaining the safety of the Israeli public and the MDA teams. MDA will continue to be at the forefront of the struggle against the Coronavirus outbreak, with hope for better days soon".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An analysis of federal data conducted by a research team led by the Yale School of Public Health found the United States recorded an estimated 37,100 excess deaths during the coronavirus pandemic throughout March and the first two weeks of April. That's nearly 13,500 more than are attributed to COVID-19 during that same period, The Washington Post reports.
The country passed 64,000 coronavirus deaths Friday, but Dan Weinberger, a Yale professor of epidemiology who led the analysis, said his team's estimates indicate the true toll could be "in the range of one and a half times higher." The analysis is based on death certificates compiled by states and sent to the National Center for Health Statistics, which often takes weeks to count a death, leading to a backlog of fatalities that eventually add to the toll at a later date.
While the estimates likely include deaths that were a direct result of unconfirmed COVID-19 cases, that's not necessarily the cause behind every excess fatality. Instead, people may have avoided going to hospitals when they otherwise would have for unrelated illnesses, or were unable to get proper treatment for other maladies because of overwhelmed health care systems. The one thing that Weinberg wants to make clear is that, either way, "people need to be aware that the data they're seeing on deaths is very incomplete." Read more at The Washington Post.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oxford scientist says if coronavirus vaccine is effective it will likely be seasonal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir John Bell, an immunologist and the Regius Chair of Medicine at the University of Oxford, said we'll probably know pretty soon whether Oxford's highly anticipated coronavirus vaccine works.
Bell told NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday's edition of Meet the Press that researchers will likely "get a signal by June" about the vaccine's efficacy. The Oxford vaccine has made waves because of the rapid and unprecedented pace of its development and the possibility that it could hit the market in a limited capacity during the fall.
If it does prove successful — and Bell's tempered opinion is that "prospects are pretty good" — it likely won't be a one-time vaccine. Bell said as far as anyone can tell the coronavirus doesn't mutate quite as easily as the flu, whose vaccine needs to updated every year to keep up with the changes, but there's a lot that still needs to be learned about potential immunity to the new virus, so chances are seasonal vaccination will be the norm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oxford scientist says if coronavirus vaccine is effective it will likely be seasonal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir John Bell, an immunologist and the Regius Chair of Medicine at the University of Oxford, said we'll probably know pretty soon whether Oxford's highly anticipated coronavirus vaccine works.
Bell told NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday's edition of Meet the Press that researchers will likely "get a signal by June" about the vaccine's efficacy. The Oxford vaccine has made waves because of the rapid and unprecedented pace of its development and the possibility that it could hit the market in a limited capacity during the fall.
If it does prove successful — and Bell's tempered opinion is that "prospects are pretty good" — it likely won't be a one-time vaccine. Bell said as far as anyone can tell the coronavirus doesn't mutate quite as easily as the flu, whose vaccine needs to updated every year to keep up with the changes, but there's a lot that still needs to be learned about potential immunity to the new virus, so chances are seasonal vaccination will be the norm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sharansky to use Genesis Prize proceeds to fight coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JERUSALEM (AP) — Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, winner of the 2020 Genesis Prize, announced Monday that he will donate the $1 million award to organizations fighting the coronavirus pandemic and assisting people most affected by the outbreak.
In a statement released by prize organizers, Sharansky said he would support organizations in Israel and abroad, some delivering immediate relief to victims and others pursuing longer-term research against the disease. In forgoing the prize money, he follows a tradition set by previous winners.
“Many people of good will around the world have given generously to help organizations and individuals who have been devastated by COVID-19. I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this humanitarian effort,” Sharansky said.
The Genesis Prize Foundation said donations would go to organizations providing emergency services to Jerusalem residents of all faiths, and assisting severely disabled children, domestic violence victims, African migrants in Tel Aviv and people in need of mental health services.
He will also support research at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science, Columbia University and New York University, and help elderly Jewish communities overseas.
The $1 million award is granted each year to a person recognized for outstanding professional achievement, contribution to humanity and commitment to Jewish values.

Sharansky rose to prominence in the 1970s as a dissident in the Soviet Union, where he worked closely with the human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andre Sakharov. He was a founding member of the Helsinki Group, which monitored rights abuses by the Soviets, and became one of the best-known “refuseniks,” Soviet Jews who were denied permission to emigrate to Israel.
In 1977, Sharansky was imprisoned on fabricated charges of spying for the United States. He spent nine years in prison, serving much of that time in solitary confinement.
Sharansky was freed in a prisoner swap in 1986 after an intense international campaign led by his wife, Avital, and immediately moved to Israel.
The following year, he led a demonstration in Washington where, on the eve of a visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, some 250,000 Jews called for an end to persecution of Soviet Jews and for the freedom for them to emigrate. Gorbachev subsequently opened the country’s borders, clearing the way for an estimated 1.6 million Jews to emigrate.
In Israel, Sharansky has spent a lengthy career in politics and public service. He also has authored three books and received a number of prestigious recognitions, including Israel’s highest award, the Israel Prize, as well as the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sun draws many out in US, Europe; Russia virus numbers grow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (AP) — Gorgeous spring weather across the United States and Europe on Saturday drew people cooped up inside for weeks outside to soak in the sun, even as additional coronavirus hot spots in Russia and Pakistan emerged.
Though grateful to be outdoors, people were still wary — masks were worn everywhere, even on southern U.S. beaches and by some joggers in Spain. A New York City farmer’s market enforced the familiar 6 feet (2 meters) of space between people waiting to buy spring flowers. Mothers in Central Park reminded their kids to give people space. And small groups of picnickers kept their safe distances, while joggers moved past each other without a glance.
Retired New York attorney Stan Neustadter pulled down his mask to say it's been important to his spirit to get out. “Why live like a rabbit? Plus I’m approaching 78, I’ve had a great run,” Neustadter said.
Police and park officials were spread out across New York City, which sent out 1,000 officers to enforce social distancing on the warmest day since mid-March. But they were more likely to break up large groups, leaving the nuisances of social distancing and hanging out safely outside to New Yorkers themselves.
“Go for a walk, but respect the social distancing and wear a mask,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.
With gigs drying up at clubs and concert halls, German native Julia Banholzer, a saxophonist, said she has taken to playing al fresco in Central Park for whoever happens by. On Saturday that was a steady stream of folks, most wearing masks, who left tips for her trio as they worked their way through a set of jazz standards.
“It’s great to have an audience after all these weeks.” she said. “All my dates have been canceled through September, and I don’t know if any will come back this year. New York is a tough place, but this is just another tough period we need to get through.”
Meanwhile, fighter jets from the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds drew people outside as they flew over Atlanta, Baltimore and Washington in honor of health care workers. In Atlanta, motorists stopped on a major highway while other people found open places to look to the sky on rooftops or a cemetery.
New Jersey reopened state parks Saturday. Limited to 50% capacity in their parking areas, several had to turn away additional arrivals by the afternoon. But nearly everyone followed the rules on social distancing and Gov. Phil Murphy said “so far, so good” at his daily briefing.
Margie Roebuck and her husband were among the first people on the sand at Island Beach State Park. “Forty-six days in the house was enough,” she said.
Elsewhere in the world, the pandemic’s danger was still evident. Russia and Pakistan reported their biggest one-day spikes in new infections.
Overall, Russia has reported around 125,000 cases and more than 1,200 deaths. True numbers are believed to be much higher because not everyone is tested. In the far northeast, 3,000 of 10,000 workers at a vast natural gas field tested positive, Russian news agencies reported.
Moscow’s mayor said this week that officials are considering establishing temporary hospitals at sports complexes and shopping malls to deal with the influx of patients. Infection cases have reached the highest levels of government, with both the prime minister and the construction minister contracting the virus.
Pakistan appears to be joining Russia with rapidly increasing case counts. On Saturday, Pakistan announced nearly 1,300 new cases, raising the total in the country of 220 million people to about 18,000.
Newspaper photos showed large numbers of the faithful at Pakistani mosques and only some practicing social distancing. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government said it might ease controls, but doctors have pleaded for stricter lockdowns, warning an explosion of infections would overwhelm hospitals with only 3,000 intensive care beds nationwide.
The virus has killed more than 238,000 people worldwide, including more than 65,000 in the United States and more than 24,000 each in Italy, Britain, France and Spain, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health experts warn a second wave of infections could hit unless testing is expanded dramatically.
For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and those with health problems, it can cause severe illness such as pneumonia, or death.
There are economic factors to consider as well. In some areas of the United States, reopening is being urged to ease the shutdown of businesses that plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs.
It has created a patchwork of rules across the 50 states. In South Carolina, where about 20% of the state’s revenue comes from tourism, beach hotels were allowed to reopen Friday. Webcams showed dozens of people on the beach Saturday, but pools still closed. South Carolina also hasn't reopened dine-in restaurants, unlike neighboring Georgia. Some U.S. states have yet to start start the reopening process.
Business owners have also been left wondering if customers will return. On a postcard-perfect spring day, Detroit's Eastern Market had far fewer customers and vendors than normal at the farmer's market.
Jill and Mark Thomas said they felt safe selling bottles of homemade wine from their Unwined Winery, but it wasn't the same in the COVID-19 world.
“It’s easier when you can get samples to people,” said Jill Thomas. “We’re not allowed to do that now.”
In Spain, where COVID-19 has caused more than 25,100 deaths, people ventured out Saturday for the first time since a March 14 lockdown.
“I feel good, but tired. You sure notice that it has been a month and I am not in shape,” 36-year-old Cristina Palomeque said in Barcelona. “Some people think it may be too early, as I do, but it is also important to do exercise for health reasons.”
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Spaniards deserved relief after weeks of confinement, but he asked citizens to remain vigilant.
“Until we have a vaccine, we are going to see more outbreaks,” Sánchez said. “What we need to guarantee is that these outbreaks do not put our national health system in danger.”

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said people need to go outside and enjoy the warm weather.
“Go for a walk, but respect the social distancing and wear a mask,” Cuomo said.
Health officials say going outside can be a lot less dangerous than staying indoors, where droplets from people infected with COVID-19 can be spread through close contact or carried short distances through air conditioning currents.
But people must still take precautions like avoiding close contact, staying isolated if running a fever or having other symptoms and wearing masks in public places like subways, grocery stores and around other crowds.
Elsewhere in the world, the pandemic’s danger was still evident. Russia and Pakistan reported their biggest one-day spikes in new infections.

Some U.S. states haven’t even started the reopening process.
In Spain, where COVID-19 has caused more than 25,100 deaths, people ventured out Saturday for the first time since a March 14 lockdown. People ran, walked, or rode bicycles under a brilliant sunny sky in Barcelona, where time slots were set up for activities and age groups and many flocked to the maritime promenade to get as close as possible to the still-off-limits beach.
“I feel good, but tired. You sure notice that it has been a month and I am not in shape,” 36-year-old Cristina Palomeque said. “Some people think it may be too early, as I do, but it is also important to do exercise for health reasons.”

“Until we have a vaccine, we are going to see more outbreaks,” Sánchez said. “What we need to guarantee is that these outbreaks do not put our national health system in danger.”
Italy, which has suffered more than 28,700 deaths, the highest number in Europe, plans to begin easing its two-month lockdown starting Monday. China, where the pandemic began in December, reported a single new infection Saturday, extending a steady decline in confirmed cases. South Korea reported six new cases on Saturday, none of them in the hard-hit city of Daegu in the southeast.
But Pakistan appears to be joining Russia with rapidly increasing case counts. On Saturday, Pakistan announced nearly 1,300 new cases, raising the total in the country of 220 million people to about 18,000.

Like power lines in an electrical grid, long wiry projections that grow outward from neurons -- structures known as axons -- form interconnected communication networks that run from the brain to all parts of the body. But unlike an outage in a power line, which can be fixed, a break in an axon is permanent. Each year thousands of patients confront this reality, facing life-long losses in sensation and motor function from spinal cord injury and related conditions in which axons are badly damaged or severed.New research by scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine Temple University (LKSOM) shows, however, that gains in functional recovery from these injuries may be possible, thanks to a molecule known as Lin28, which regulates cell growth. In a study published online in the journal Molecular Therapy, the Temple researchers describe the ability of Lin28 -- when expressed above its usual levels -- to fuel axon regrowth in mice with spinal cord injury or optic nerve injury, enabling repair of the body's communication grid."Our findings show that Lin28 is a major regulator of axon regeneration and a promising therapeutic target for central nervous system injuries," explained Shuxin Li, MD, PhD, Professor of Anatomy and Cell Biology and in the Shriners Hospitals Pediatric Research Center at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and senior investigator on the new study. The research is the first to demonstrate the regenerative ability of Lin28 upregulation in the injured spinal cord of animals."We became interested in Lin28 as a target for neuron regeneration because it acts as a gatekeeper of stem cell activity," said Dr. Li. "It controls the switch that maintains stem cells or allows them to differentiate and potentially contribute to activities such as axon regeneration."To explore the effects of Lin28 on axon regrowth, Dr. Li and colleagues developed a mouse model in which animals expressed extra Lin28 in some of their tissues. When full-grown, the animals were divided into groups that sustained spinal cord injury or injury to the optic nerve tracts that connect to the retina in the eye.Another set of adult mice, with normal Lin28 expression and similar injuries, were given injections of a viral vector (a type of carrier) for Lin28 to examine the molecule's direct effects on tissue repair.Extra Lin28 stimulated long-distance axon regeneration in all instances, though the most dramatic effects were observed following post-injury injection of Lin28. In mice with spinal cord injury, Lin28 injection resulted in the growth of axons to more than three millimeters beyond the area of axon damage, while in animals with optic nerve injury, axons regrew the entire length of the optic nerve tract. Evaluation of walking and sensory abilities after Lin28 treatment revealed significant improvements in coordination and sensation."We observed a lot of axon regrowth, which could be very significant clinically, since there currently are no regenerative treatments for spinal cord injury or optic nerve injury," Dr. Li explained.One of his goals in the near-term is to identify a safe and effective means of getting Lin28 to injured tissues in human patients. To do so, his team of researchers will need to develop a vector, or carrier system for Lin28, that can be injected systemically and then hone in on injured axons to deliver the therapy directly to multiple populations of damaged neurons.Dr. Li further wants to decipher the molecular details of the Lin28 signaling pathway. "Lin28 associates closely with other growth signaling molecules, and we suspect it uses multiple pathways to regulate cell growth," he explained. These other molecules could potentially be packaged along with Lin28 to aid neuron repair.Reference:

What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting?
"With cleaning, you are just using regular soap and water and a detergent if you are disinfecting you are actually using a chemical agent such as bleach to help kill the germs," said Connie Steed, President of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.
But experts warn you have to clean before you can disinfect.
"Sanitizing and disinfecting won't be effective if the surface is dirty so you really do need to clean first before you disinfect or sanitize," said Caroline Forte, Director of Home Appliances and Cleaning Products Lab, Good Housekeeping.

Antibody tests are seen as a valuable tool in helping medical experts in the battle against COVID-19.

EveryDay Healthcare in Fresno, California is one of the latest clinics to unveil its capability to conduct testing for COVID-19 antibodies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Related stories about antibiotics:</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antibiotics are a popular group of medicines that help the body fight bacterial infections. In 2017, alone, physicians wrote Americans around 260 million antibiotic prescriptions, according to the Center for Disease Control.
Here’s what you need to know about this essential class of medication.
Antibiotics treat bacterial infections in a few different ways that involve disrupting various parts of the way bacteria survive and multiply in the human body.
Bacteria have cell walls that help protect them against the harsh environment inside you. These cell walls protect the fragile interior that contains the DNA and essential proteins that bacteria use to reproduce asexually. Antibiotics often work in one of three ways:
Bactericidal antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria outright. Examples include penicillin, vancomycin, and cephalosporin.
Bacteriostatic antibiotics are drugs that prevent bacteria from multiplying. Examples include antibiotics include ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and rifamycin.
Some antibiotics can both kill bacteria and prevent farther growth. It just depends on the dose you’re prescribed as well as how far your bacterial infection has progressed.
Doctors prescribe antibiotics for all types of bacterial infections from minor strep throat or urinary tract infections to severe, life-threatening conditions such as bacterial pneumonia or sepsis.
“The properties of some antibiotics make them amenable to other medical conditions, as well,” says Anthony Kaveh, MD, physician anesthesiologist, and integrative medicine specialist. For example, the quinolone and tetracycline groups of antibiotics are used in anti-malarial therapy.
Certain antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory effects, which may be useful in treating inflammation caused by a viral infection. For example, researchers are investigating how the antibiotic azithromycin may help reduce inflammation, may also help COVID-19 patients.
However, Kaveh points out that, “We are still learning about this effect of antibiotics. Azithromycin is one of these antibiotics. It is possible that some of the reported success from azithromycin is from its anti-inflammatory effect.”
Depending on the type of infection, a physician may prescribe you one of two types of antibiotics: broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria, whereas narrow-spectrum antibiotics attack specific types of bacteria.
Physicians will often times try to prescribe narrow-spectrum antibiotics when they know which bacteria caused the infection. For example in pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, a physician may prescribe benzylpenicillin.
Because using broad-spectrum antibiotics unnecessarily can contribute to antibiotic resistance. “Unfortunately, the side effects of antibiotics must be taken into account […]. In particular, bacterial resistance must be considered whenever using antibiotics for non-bacterial infections,” says Kaveh.
Scientists agree that antibiotics don’t directly affect SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. That’s because “antibiotics do not treat viral infections,” says Kaveh.
Yet, figures from China show that a large percentage of patients with severe cases of COVID-19 receive antibiotics. But it’s not the viral infection they’re treating.
Often times it’s a secondary bacterial infection that patients develop due to a weakened immune system. In a review of 247 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China, the researchers found that 15% of survivors and 50% of those who died, acquired secondary bacterial infections.
COVID-19 isn’t the only disease that causes dangerous secondary infections. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the CDC estimates that globally 151,700 – 575,400 people died. Around half of these deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia.
So physicians may prescribe an antibiotic as a precautionary measure. “We do not yet have accurate tools for determining when an infection is bacterial or viral, and in those cases, an antibiotic may be given empirically if deemed appropriate by the physician,” says Kaveh.
Antibiotics start working almost immediately. For example, amoxicillin takes about one hour to reach peak levels in the body. However, a person may not feel symptom relief until later.
“Antibiotics will typically show improvement in patients with bacterial infections within one to three days,” says Kaveh. This is because for many illnesses the body’s immune response is what causes some of the symptoms, and it can take time for the immune system to calm down after the harmful bacteria are destroyed.
Some antibiotics, such as fosfomycin that’s used to treat certain cases of UTIs, work immediately and usually only require one dose. Other antibiotics, including tetracycline that’s used to treat a wide range of conditions from acne to syphilis, may take several weeks of treatment with multiple doses before the patient notices any improvement in symptoms.
“The timeframe depends on the type of infection and whether the bacteria are susceptible to that particular antibiotic,” says Kaveh.
It’s important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better beforehand.
Because if you discontinue the treatment early you may not eliminate enough bacteria, and the condition could re-occur, as surviving bacteria multiply. Doing so also contributes to the growing issue of antibiotic resistance.
However, in the continued battle against antibiotic-resistant superbugs, researchers have started to study the dosage amount. A growing body of evidence suggests that shorter regimes of antibiotic treatment may be just as effective as the longer courses traditionally prescribed.
However, more research is needed so you should still complete the full course of antibiotics you’re prescribed for an infection.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest news on the COVID-19 global pandemic (all times Eastern):
3:55 p.m.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says British Columbia can't follow the same pandemic response plans as other jurisdictions like Sweden and New Zealand because of its proximity to the United States.
Over the course of the pandemic, Henry says the dramatic increases in COVID-19 infections across the border, especially in Washington state, "dramatically" affected how B.C. has responded.
She says B.C. must continue to be thoughtful in how it reopens the economy and details of the plan will be released next week.
The province recorded 26 news cases today, bringing the total to 2,171.

2:40 p.m.
Nova Scotia is reporting two more deaths related to COVID-19 at the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax.
That brings the death toll in the province to 31.
Of the 323 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia, 202 are at Northwood, the largest non-profit care home in Atlantic Canada.
Four new cases have been reported in the province, bringing the total to 963.
Of those, 609 have recovered.
---
1:25 p.m.
Newfoundland and Labrador has no new cases of COVID-19 today.
The case count remains at 259.
Of the 259 cases, 241 are in the Eastern Health area, which includes St. John's.
There are just 18 cases in the rest of the province.
---
1:20 p.m.
New Brunswick says all people in the province who were with sick with COVID-19 have recovered as of today.
It has now been two weeks since the province reported fresh COVID-19 cases.
It says all 118 people who had the virus are now testing negative.
Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that despite the positive milestone, she is urging the province's citizens to continue practising physical distancing and to stay home as much as possible.

1:15 p.m.
Quebec is reporting 114 new deaths linked to COVID-19 today, bringing the death toll to 2,136.
The province's Health Department says in a statement that an additional 1,008 confirmed cases have been reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the number of those infected to 29,656.
Of those cases, 1,738 have required hospitalization, with 222 people in intensive care.
Quebec has announced plans to gradually reopen daycares, elementary schools, retail businesses, construction and manufacturing gradually during the month of May.
Authorities are staggering opening dates between the rest of the province and greater Montreal, which has been heavily hit by COVID-19 cases and deaths.
The province also wants to ramp up testing to 14,000 tests per day in anticipation of the gradual resumption of activities.

12:15 p.m.
Quebec's lottery corporation says it will begin reopening some lottery terminals on Monday after shutting them down due to fears surrounding the novel coronavirus.
Loto-Quebec announced on March 20 that it would suspend sales of lottery products at retailers and in kiosks and disconnected its network of sales terminals, pivoting sales online only.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Family tries to raise £232,000 to take boy, four, to New York for cancer vaccine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus lockdown has severely hit plans to raise the money needed to get Liam Scott to New York for treatment that could save his life.
A four-year-old boy might not be able to get the life-saving vaccine he needs after the Covid-19 lockdown hit plans for vital fundraising.
Paw Patrol fanatic Liam Scott has spent most of the last year undergoing gruelling treatment for neuroblastoma, a rare cancer affecting around 100 UK children each year.
And while the end of his treatment is finally approaching, his family know there is a high chance the cancer could return in the future.
An experimental vaccine could prevent the life-threatening disease coming back, but it is only available in New York.
Parents Claire and Michael Scott, who live in Sevenoaks in Kent, need to raise £232,000 to pay for the treatment.
Speaking to the PA news agency, Ms Scott said: “He has been in so much pain.
“As a parent you can’t even begin to explain how you feel because you want it to be you, you want to take all that away from them and there’s nothing you can do.
“You just feel so helpless.”
After several rounds of tests Liam was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in July 2019, the day after Ms Scott gave birth to his baby sister Kylie.
Ms Scott, 40, said she and her husband were “absolutely devastated” at the diagnosis.
With no family history of the cancer, doctors said it was just down to bad luck.
Since then little Liam has undergone painful treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.
The last round of immunotherapy is due to finish at the end of August, when the hope is that Liam will finally be in remission.
But because there is a high risk that his cancer will return, his parents want to get him the potentially life-saving vaccine as soon as possible.
The experimental treatment is being trialled at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in Manhattan.
Ms Scott said: “The aim is that it protects the body and prevents cancer from returning because this cancer that he has has a high return rate.
“They say it’s a hard one to get rid of.”
But the several rounds of treatment and accompanying flights and accommodation comes at a price.
The family are having to raise GBP232,000, a task made even more difficult by the current Covid-19 situation.
Ms Scott said: “For me as a parent I just want to get him on that plane.
“Sadly all those marathons and races that we have had in the pipeline have all been postponed because of the coronavirus.”

They have received support from family and friends, and also a local footballer who has taken it upon himself to raise as much money as he can for Liam.
Former Dagenham and Redbridge player Charlie Holmes has set himself the huge task of running 10 miles a day for two weeks after hearing about Liam.
The feats are live-streamed on Instagram every day with DJs also getting involved to keep people entertained.
Speaking to the PA news agency, Mr Holmes, 21, said: “I thought I would try and get as much money as I could for him.
“I have got a lot of support from all my friends and family.
“I just need that one person who has a large following (to share the story) and it would take off.”
Mr Holmes refuses to set himself any fundraising target other than the full amount that Liam needs for his treatment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson urges countries to ‘pull together’ in coronavirus vaccine race</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More than 28,000 people in the UK have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for Covid-19.
Boris Johnson will describe the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as the “most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes” as he calls on nations to “pull together” in response to the pandemic.
The Prime Minister is expected to tell an online pledging conference – co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations – that the sooner states share their expertise the faster scientists will succeed in defeating the disease.
It comes as Mr Johnson revealed he feared he would not live to see his baby son Wilfred born when he battled Covid-19 in intensive care last month.
The PM will tell Monday’s conference, which aims to bring in more than £6.6 billion in funding, that the race to develop a vaccine is “not a competition between countries but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”.
“It’s humanity against the virus – we are in this together and together we will prevail,” he is expected to say.
Coronavirus has claimed more than 246,000 lives around the world, according to analysis by John Hopkins University.
A total of 28,446 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday.
Mr Johnson is now not expected to set out a road map on how the UK will exit lockdown until Sunday – three days after the Government must review the current restrictions.
Ministers have been under pressure to explain their exit strategy but have so far resisted the calls – warning that to do so risks undermining the message to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus.
However, on Sunday Michael Gove said that some social distancing measures would remain in place until a vaccine has been developed but that the Government would seek to restore people’s lives to “as close to normal as possible”.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster warned that people would have to live with “some degree of constraint” until they can be immunised against the deadly disease – suggesting Britons would have to accept a “new normal”.
Mr Gove also revealed that the number of daily coronavirus tests in the last 24 hours had fallen to 76,496 – below the Government’s 100,000 daily testing target – which was blamed on lower uptake over the weekend.
The Cabinet minister told the daily Downing Street press conference: “Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine then I suspect that we are going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.
“But we obviously want to, wherever possible, and consistent with the measures on public health, restore people’s lives to as close to normal as possible.”
He said the Government will pursue a “phased approach” to removing lockdown restrictions rather than a sudden return to “the old normal” – and that the easing had to be done in a “cautious fashion”.
In other developments:
– Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced a package of support worth almost £3 billion to help universities weather the coronavirus crisis.
– A smartphone app to trace the spread of coronavirus will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month.
– A new “fast and accurate” coronavirus antibody test has been developed by scientists in Edinburgh, although the company fears the NHS could miss out amid interest in Europe for the machines.
– Former Government chief scientific adviser Sir David King has assembled a group of experts to look at how the UK could work its way out of the lockdown in response to concerns over the “lack of transparency” coming from the Sage group of advisers.
– The Financial Times reported that companies will be expected to keep office workers separated and to stagger shifts under plans to get Britons back to work.
Mr Johnson was asked in an interview with The Sun newspaper if he had ever feared he might not live to meet his son Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday – just weeks after the PM was discharged from hospital after his battle with coronavirus.
He said: “Well, yes, of course. We’ve all got a lot to live for, a lot to do, and I won’t hide it from you, I was thinking about that, yes.”
The PM told the paper he “couldn’t see the way out of the skip” but that he had a “natural buoyancy or refusal to give in or harbour negative thoughts”.
“I never really thought that I wouldn’t come back from it. It was more frustration.”
Mr Johnson added: “I owe my life to our doctors and nurses and the healthcare workers. They pulled my chestnuts out of the fire, no question.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boris Johnson urges countries to ‘pull together’ in coronavirus vaccine race</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boris Johnson will describe the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as the “most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes” as he calls on nations to “pull together” in response to the pandemic.
The Prime Minister is expected to tell an online pledging conference – co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations – that the sooner states share their expertise the faster scientists will succeed in defeating the disease.
It comes as Mr Johnson revealed he feared he would not live to see his baby son Wilfred born when he battled Covid-19 in intensive care last month.
The PM will tell Monday’s conference, which aims to bring in more than £6.6 billion in funding, that the race to develop a vaccine is “not a competition between countries but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”.
“It’s humanity against the virus – we are in this together and together we will prevail,” he is expected to say.
Coronavirus has claimed more than 246,000 lives around the world, according to analysis by John Hopkins University.
A total of 28,446 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday.
Mr Johnson is now not expected to set out a road map on how the UK will exit lockdown until Sunday – three days after the Government must review the current restrictions.
Ministers have been under pressure to explain their exit strategy but have so far resisted the calls – warning that to do so risks undermining the message to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus.
However, on Sunday Michael Gove said that some social distancing measures would remain in place until a vaccine has been developed but that the Government would seek to restore people’s lives to “as close to normal as possible”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Say There Were a Black Hole in Our Solar System: How Would We Find It?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Last year, scientists published a paper with an iconic diagram: a black circle representing, to scale, a 5-solar-mass black hole – and the size of the hypothetical Planet Nine if it were a black hole instead of a planet. So, if Planet Nine really is a black hole, how would we find it?
Physicist Edward Witten, famed theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study, has an idea. All it requires is an army of small, laser-launched spacecraft with really accurate clocks.
The solar system, at present, has eight planets and a host of dwarf planets (including former planet Pluto). But astronomers have long wondered whether there could be a large ninth planet beyond Neptune that has so far eluded telescopes. Evidence for this planet stems from the strange collective motion of rocks past Neptune; they seem to move as if another massive object, five to 10 times the mass of Earth, were orbiting out there.
Telescope searches haven’t found Planet Nine, nor have they proven that it doesn’t exist. But last September, scientists James Unwin at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Jakub Scholtz at Durham University released a paper suggesting that Planet Nine could be a black hole that has stuck around since the beginning of the universe and now orbits the Sun. They realised that they’d made a provocative proposal and that their theory was unlikely, but they hoped that scientists would open their minds to looking for a ninth planet in different ways, such as with gamma-ray telescopes.
Witten took the idea a step further and imagined a mission specifically to hunt for Planet Nine assuming it were a black hole, publishing his paper on the arXiv physics preprint server. The work has not been peer reviewed.
The proposed mission relies on the Breakthrough Starshot proposal, where lasers on Earth are used to guide and power ultra-light spacecraft weighing just a few grams each. Witten proposes that you could send out a thousand of these spacecraft travelling fast enough to reach a distance of 500 AU (Pluto’s distance from the Sun is around 40 AU, on average). Each of these spacecraft would send timing information back to Earth. Slight changes to one of the spacecraft’s clocks could signal that it had intersected the strong gravitational field of tiny black hole.
So should we start building these craft? No, not yet. Witten said that the proposal should follow telescope searches or other, less conventional hunts. And it wouldn’t be easy. “Sufficiently accurate timekeeping in a miniature spacecraft may be the biggest obstacle to this project, though there are numerous other challenges,” Witten wrote. But hey, NASA is currently in the midst of testing an atomic clock for deep-space exploration, so many a breakthrough is on the horizon.
It’s good to know we have a backup plan for finding Planet Nine, should searching with telescopes alone fail us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Baby wipes are not meant to kill germs or viruses</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Baby wipes don’t kill germs because they’re not designed to. In this article, we discuss the ingredients in baby wipes, why they’re not designed to kill germs, and how to keep you and your baby clean through the whole diaper changing.
Baby wipes are designed mostly to clean the poop off a baby’s bottom without damaging the skin or making it red and sore. To do this, baby wipes are made from cloth, that’s soaked in a water-based solution and contains softeners and conditioners like aloe vera. Baby wipes may also contain preservatives.
But what baby wipes don’t include are germ-killing disinfectants. For example if you compare a baby wipe with what’s in a traditional disinfecting wipe – in the disinfecting wipe you’ll find sodium hypochlorite, the germ-killing ingredient in many bleach-based cleaning products. There’s also an antimicrobial ingredient called Alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride that’s common in household disinfectants.
For more information on which cleaners do – and do not – kill bacteria and viruses, check out our guide on how to kill germs.
The reason baby wipes don’t contain disinfectants, and therefore don’t kill germs is that “a baby’s skin is very sensitive because it hasn’t been exposed to a lot of things,” says Ilan Shapiro, MD, a pediatrician and medical director of health education and wellness for AltaMed Health Services in California.
Therefore, don’t use a household cleaning wipe on your baby because they’re not designed to be used on a person’s skin. Similarly, don’t bother using your baby wipes as makeshift wipes for cleaning and sanitizing your counters and faucets because they don’t contain those disinfecting agents.
Don’t rely on a baby wipe to get your hands clean. If you’re worried about germs, it’s really not enough to swab your hands with a baby wipe after a diaper change, according to Shapiro.
“The most important part is washing your hands,” he says.
So, when changing a baby’s diaper, follow these steps to be sure that everyone’s clean:
The bottom line on clean bottoms: a baby wipe is good for getting the situation clean, but not sterile. To really kill off the germs, opt for soap and water.

Nigeria has indicated interest to be part of the global solidarity trial of the vaccines being developed to combat COVID-19, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Speaking at the joint national briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, officer in charge, WHO Nigeria, Dr. Fiona Braka, said efforts are underway to start the process in the country, The Cable reports.

According to her, over a hundred countries have joined the solidarity clinical trial, launched by WHO and some partners, to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19.
She said: "More than 100 countries have joined the solidarity trial. Till date, over 1,200 patients have been randomised from the first five countries to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug combinations.
“Nigeria has also expressed interest to be part of this solidarity trial and efforts are underway to start the process in Nigeria too."
Braka noted that a total of 89 vaccines are being developed globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and several therapeutics in clinical trials.
"WHO is committed to ensuring that as medicines and vaccines are developed, they are shared equitably with all countries and people," she added.
According to The Nation report, Braka disclosed that the process for the certification of vaccines is a very rigorous and thorough process because they have to ensure that products that are approved for use meet the safety requirements.

“It usually takes years to produce a vaccine but the emergency process currently ongoing is really aiming to get a vaccine out as soon as possible for the protection of people," she added.
WHO had earlier announced that 102 potential COVID-19 vaccines are currently being developed around the world.
Legit.ng reported that documents posted on the organisation’s website on Thursday, April 30, indicated that eight of the potential vaccines have been approved for clinical trial.
There is no cure or vaccine yet to treat COVID-19 which is causing much havoc around the world. WHO has also there is no proof of a cure for Covid-19, warning against the widespread use of untested remedies.
As of Friday, May 1, Nigeria has 2,170 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WHO: Nigeria has expressed interest to be part of COVID-19 drug trials</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The World Health Organisation (WHO) says Nigeria has expressed interest to be part of the global solidarity drug trial to combat COVID-19.
The WHO launched solidarity drug trials for these specific drugs — hydroxychloriquine, chloroquine phosphate, and remdesivir — in April.
Speaking on Friday at the joint national briefing of the presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19,  Fiona Braka, officer in charge, WHO Nigeria, said efforts are underway to start the process in the country.
She said more than 100 countries have joined the solidarity clinical trial, which was launched by WHO and some partners, to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19.
She said over 1,200 patients have been randomised from the first five countries to evaluate the “safety and efficacy of drug combinations”.
Braka also said a total of 89 vaccines are being developed globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and several therapeutics in clinical trials.
She said the organisation is committed to ensuring that medicines and vaccines are shared equitably with all countries as they are being developed.
“Nigeria has also expressed interest to be part of this solidarity trial and efforts are underway to start the process in Nigeria too,” Braka said.
“Together with global health actors and partners, over the past week, WHO launched the access to COVID-19 tools ACT accelerator, a global collaboration to accelerate development for equitable access to new COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
“We have a total of 89 vaccines that are in development globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and several therapeutics are in clinical trials. WHO is committed to ensuring that as medicines and vaccines are developed, they are shared equitably with all countries and people.
“We do have the solidarity trial which is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by the WHO and partners. More than 100 countries have joined the solidarity trial and to date, over 1,200 patients have been randomized from the first five countries to evaluate the safety and efficacy of full drug and drug combinations.”
As of Friday, 2,170 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Nigeria.
There is no cure or vaccine yet for the disease.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oxford scientist says its vaccine is making headway, could show efficacy by June</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON — British scientists developing a potential vaccine for the coronavirus hope to see a "signal" as to whether their vaccine candidate is working by June, an official involved in the effort said Sunday on "Meet the Press."
Sir John Bell, the Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, where one of the leading efforts to develop a vaccine is underway, said that the prospects for Oxford's candidate are "pretty good" and that "as every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up."
The researchers hope to have enough data from their phase-two trials that "we would get evidence that the vaccine has efficacy by the beginning of June."
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
The group at Oxford is one of the many racing toward finding an effective and safe vaccine for the coronavirus alongside efforts to contain the spread of the pandemic.
More than 240,000 people have died of COVID-19 since January, and there have been more than 3.4 million reported coronavirus cases around the world, according to NBC News.
Bell didn't offer a timeline for when a vaccine might be fully developed, but he said that in the rush for one, it is imperative to make sure that safety remains a top priority. He said the Oxford group has already conducted preclinical primate studies and taken other steps to make sure "we're being very careful."
"It's a big issue for us, is trying to be sure that we do this quickly but we don't miss out any of the key safety steps," he said.
"I think we've got reason to believe that the efficacy, the efficacy of the vaccine in terms of generating strong antibody responses, is probably going to be OK. The real question is whether the safety profile's going to be fine. So that's actually the main focus of the clinical studies," he said.

With so many trials and vaccine working groups across the globe, Bell said, the Oxford group wants to be sure that there can be "wide access" to its vaccine if it ultimately proves successful.
"One of our ambitions is to make sure that there's wide access around the globe should the vaccine be successful," he said, adding that the team wants to make sure developing countries aren't "left behind in the manufacturing race to get more vaccine available."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oxford Researcher Working On Coronavirus Vaccine Could Show Effectiveness In Humans By June</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020

'As every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up,' says Sir John Bell.
An Oxford University scientist says that he’s hopeful a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be showing efficacy by June, although he didn’t offer a timetable for when the vaccine would be available for widespread use, NBC News reports.
Sir John Bell spoke to Meet The Press on Sunday and talked about the work his team, the Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group, is doing on producing a vaccine for the virus. As Business Insider reports, the Oxford team has already produced a vaccine — hAdOx1 nCoV-19 — and then shipped it to a lab in Montana to be tested on rhesus macaques. The animals were exposed to exceptionally-high concentrations of the virus. After 28 days, none of the primates showed any signs of illness, from the vaccine itself or from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Though the experiment was carried out on animals and not on humans, Vincent Munster, the head of the Virus Ecology Unit at the laboratory, said that the biological similarities between the two species means the results are promising for the vaccine’s use in humans.
“The rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,” Munster said.
Bell, for his part, is bullish on the results so far.
“As every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up,” Bell said.
He said he’s hopeful that the data will be conclusive by June that the vaccine is ready to be tested on humans.
However, Bell notes that the safety of the human test subjects is the team’s top priority.
“I think we’ve got reason to believe that the efficacy, the efficacy of the vaccine in terms of generating strong antibody responses is probably going to be OK. The real question is whether the safety profile’s going to be fine. So that’s actually the main focus of the clinical studies,” he said.
Even if Bell’s prediction that the key milestone will be reached by June holds true, that doesn’t necessarily mean that a vaccine will be deployed for widespread use in humans at that time.
Further, Bell echoed a sentiment previously expressed by Bill Gates: namely, that developing the vaccine would be a wasted effort if it’s only deployed in countries that can afford to pay for it. As reported by The Inquisitr, Gates, like Bell, is hopeful a vaccine will be developed soon. However, manufacturing, distributing, and injecting the vaccine is a process that’s going to cost money, and he, like Bell, is concerned that governments of poorer countries, and their citizens, might be left behind.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Experts advise WHO to identify animal source of COVID-19 virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GENEVA — International experts have advised the World Health Organization (WHO) to work to identify the animal origins of the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic and its transmission to humans, the UN agency said on Friday.The recommendation was among the outcomes of the latest meeting of the Emergency Committee on the new disease, established under global health regulations.“We accept the committee’s advice that WHO works to identify the animal source of the virus through international scientific and collaborative missions, in collaboration with the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during his regular virtual press conference from Geneva.A statement from the Emergency Committee advised that the partners also identify “the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts...which will enable targeted interventions and a research agenda to reduce the risk of similar events”.Wide-ranging adviceIn total, the Committee outlined more than 20 recommendations for WHO covering areas that include stepping up support for vulnerable countries and strengthening the global food supply chain. Guidance on the resumption of international travel was also suggested.“This is a difficult issue because it’s a question of confidence between member states,” said Professor Didier Houssin, chair of the 15-member Committee, made up of health experts from across the globe.“It’s a question of safe travel, but it’s also very important aspect for the activities in many countries which are relying very much on air travel.”Countries urged to support WHOThe Emergency Committee also offered advice to the international community, namely to support the WHO leadership and to work with the agency and its partners to interrupt transmission of the new coronavirus.Professor Houssin called for research to reduce “knowledge gaps”, among other recommendations.“We know too little about the transmission of the virus,” he said. “We have, at the moment, nothing for prevention with vaccines, and we have no licensed therapeutics. This should change.”Relatedly, the European Commission will on Monday host a pledging conference to generate funds for COVID-19 vaccine research, in line with a recently launched global collaboration to make medicines to diagnose and treat available to all people, known as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.Emergency Committee to reconveneThe WHO chief had convened the Emergency Committee on Thursday, three months after its last meeting where the burgeoning COVID-19 outbreak was declared an international public health emergency.At the time, there were less than 100 cases, and no deaths, outside China: the country where the disease was first reported.COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11. As of Friday, cases topped three million globally, with more than 224,000 deaths. The Emergency Committee will reconvene within 90 days. — UN News

    <h5 class="mb-1">Health experts want WHO to find source of COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | International health experts have asked the World Health Organisation (WHO) to identify the animal source of the coronavirus (COVID-19) so as to enable further research.
The need to find the source was one of the recommendations that health experts made to WHO during the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting that took place on Thursday. The meeting was the third that had been convened since the COVID-19 outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China.
The meeting was called three months after WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern-PHEIC. It was called to evaluate the way forward in handling COVID-19. Recommendations of the committee were released yesterday.
Professor Didier Houssin, the chairman of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee said that COVID-19 is still a public threat and the cause of the disease needs to be traced by WHO to help in future.
“After three months since the last meeting, Emergency committee member states found that COVID-19 is still a public concern. However, there are knowledge gaps. Too little is known about the disease. We recommend that WHO works with the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and countries to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population including the possible role of intermediate hosts,” said Prof Houssin.
Prof Houssin says further research into how the virus was transmitted would help guide the organisation on how to prevent future outbreaks of this nature.
Several theories have been put forward on the source of the virus. The United States has claimed that the virus was developed in a laboratory in Wuhan while other sources say that the virus could have come from two animals carrying different strains of coronavirus which mutated to form what is now known as COVID-19.
Scientists around the world have identified bats, snakes and pangolins as possible sources of the virus.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO says that they accept the committees’ recommendations and are going to work towards identifying the zoonotic cause of the virus.
Up until yesterday, WHO has been focused on providing training for health workers, providing technical and logistical support to low income countries and increasing their preparedness. The UN health agency has also been working towards treatment and vaccine trials for the disease.
The committee also recommended that all member countries of WHO work with the health organisation and support the leadership of the organisation as the world only has one WHO and its needed during this pandemic.
The remarks come after the organisation and its leadership have been criticized by Brazil and the United States- both member states of the organisation.
Dr Ghebreyesus reiterated the need for member states to follow WHO advise when dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. ” We encourage countries to follow WHO’s advice which we constantly review and update as we learn more about the virus.”
To date, over 185 WHO member countries ave reported COVID-19 cases.  As of May 2,2020 over 3 million cases have been confirmed and over 238,000 deaths registered.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A company is calling for talks with the UK Government after developing a 99.8% accurate blood screening test for coronavirus antibodies.
A new “fast and accurate” coronavirus antibody test has been developed by scientists in Edinburgh, although the company fears the NHS could miss out amid interest in Europe for the machines.
Researchers for blood-screening company Quotient have developed a new test for whether people are immune to Covid-19 by spotting whether a person has developed antibodies to the disease.
Each serological screening machine has capacity for up to 3,000 tests a day and produces results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy, the firm said.
The company behind the new tests says it has 12 screening machines available, with a further 20 expected to be ready by the end of the year, but it has already had talks with interested parties across Europe.
However, with the new test developed by scientists in Edinburgh, the company is calling for the UK and Scottish governments to begin talks so that the NHS might be able to benefit.
While the UK Government says it has laboratory capability to test for coronavirus immunity, it is currently being used for survey testing of existing blood samples and the capacity is not known.
It is also attempting to develop home testing kits, rather than requiring analysis in laboratories, but so far these have proved unreliable.
The tests aim to establish whether a person has developed antibodies to the Covid-19 virus, usually after being infected by the disease, and is therefore immune from being infected again.
On Friday, Quotient received European regulatory approval for the MosaiQ serological screening machines with 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity, meaning there is a low chance of a misread or “false positive”.
Chief executive Franz Walt – who was managing director of a laboratory that developed the first diagnostic test for Sars in 2003 – said: “We are truly proud to have developed such a fast and accurate test.
“This is an outstanding performance by our teams in both Edinburgh and Switzerland.
“We now want to make sure that we can help as many people as possible as quickly as possible.
“We have strong roots in the UK and want to speak to ministers there so MosaiQ can be used in the amazing national effort to tackle Coronavirus and relaunch the economy.
“We realise ministers and the NHS are incredibly busy but are keen to talk given the strong interest from across Europe in the product.”
Ed Farrell, chief operating officer at the Edinburgh office, added: “We’re incredibly proud of all our work here in Scotland and Switzerland.
“We’ve got such a rich history here and we hope we can now make a difference at this challenging time.”
A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Health Protection Scotland, with key partners, explore all options around new antibody tests as they become available on the market.
“The Scottish Government is working closely with the UK Government to ensure that everyone is able to access new antibody tests when they become available.
“It is essential that any new tests are reliable, and time is needed to undertake rigorous evaluation so that there is confidence that tests are accurate.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus 2 May: at a glance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
At least 3,334,406people have been infected and at least 238,787 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University.
The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting, as well as differing testing and statistical regimes.
UK health secretary Matt Hancock has been accused of changing the criteria for counting Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,00 per day. But critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday were tests that had been mailed to addresses and had not been carried out.
Top US health official Anthony Fauci will not testify next week to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the White House said on Friday, calling it “counterproductive” to have individuals involved in the response testify. Also in the US, a New York nursing home has reported 98 residents have died from the disease.
Medics, funeral workers and gravediggers in Somaliahave reported an unprecedented surge of deaths in recent days amid growing fears that official counts of Covid-19 deaths reflect only a fraction of the virus’s toll in Africa .
Singapore’s health minister says the city-state will relax some anti-coronavirus measures after a fall in the number of cases in the broader community. Some businesses will be allowed to open again after 12 May while some schools will reopen from 19 May. Singapore saw cases flare up recently in a second wave as infections spiked in its crowded migrant worker dormitories.
The US congress has launched an investigation into the conduct of Carnival Cruise Line over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, questioning why the company did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival’s ships, which saw major outbreaks at least nine ships including the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. Many cruise ship crew remain trapped on board cruise ships around the world.
Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country’s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Over 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday’s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers live, rights groups had said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No 10's coronavirus briefings: stick to the script and hope no one sees your nose growing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Coronavirus – latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage
Not all lockdown masterclasses involve unwelcome exertion. By now, anyone who has been watching the daily Downing Street coronavirus press briefings, even intermittently, should have acquired enough skill in evasion and excuses to present one, if not to a professional standard, certainly as persuasively as the average UK cabinet minister. The following technique can be mastered in as little as six weeks.
1. Congratulate the prime minister if he has produced another child, wish him a great recovery/holiday if he is unavoidably absent. Conscious or not, he is in great spirits. Introduce your scientists. Pray that they include Jenny Harries, England’s deputy chief medical officer,whose deflection methods are unrivalled. Recall, for instance, her wish for a “more adult conversation” on personal protective equipment, following evidence that shortages are endangering lives.
2. Firm voice on, before an update on the government’s step-by-step battle plan to defeat the virus. Recite, slowly and clearly, the five tests. This should use up at least five minutes. Repeat, as required by ministers since 9 March, that the government is taking the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest scientific advice.
3. Solemn face. Report the latest infection and death figures. Condolences. Reflect, instructively, that these grim numbers are a reminder of just how serious the virus is, showing that your five-point plan is correct.
4. A more positive note. Congratulate the heroic frontline, ditto the sacrifice of the British people, in rising to the challenge. You are proud of their determination to turn the tide and win the war. Beating this enemy is a team effort. (The forthcoming press attacks are therefore tantamount to siding with the enemy.)
5. But admit there are challenges. Cannot sugar-coat. Unprecedented times. Select any or all of the following: you are working night and day, round the clock, fighting tooth and nail, unflinchingly and unblinkingly moving heaven and earth and straining every sinew while you move mountains in a herculean, mammoth effort to get to the light at the end of the tunnel.
6. Don’t mention care homes.
7. Today, the government can announce it is ramping up something. At pace. Budget of millions. On anything from badges to research. A jingoistic comparison is, at this point, recommended. Although maybe not Boris Johnson’s fantasy, from 16 March, that the UK is now “leading a global campaign to fight back”. Substitute: “Our world-leading scientific experts.”
8. Finally, recite the approved slogan (on the front of the lecterns, if you’ve forgotten) and it’s over to a scientist for the latest curve-flattening data. Since the UK figures will be among the worst in the world, emphasise that comparisons are meaningless.
What follows – press questions – is not always as straightforward, even now favoured civilians are, in a rare borrowing from Jeremy Corbyn, invited to use up time and, being warmly praised, show up the journalists. “Even in our darkest moments,” as the first secretary, Dominic Raab, recently said, “the crisis has also shone a light on the best among us.” Step forward, Lynne in Skipton.
Happily, the virtual plague set-up does afford some defence against hostile interrogation. Observe how the health secretary, Matt Hancock, learned smartly to introduce the next questioner, closing down an annoying one. And remember some journalists will always ask, basically: “Are we nearly there yet?” Take at least three minutes to revisit the five tests.
Even death-obsessed hacks, rehearsing Britain’s fatal delays during Johnson’s “sing Happy Birthday” period, may feel awkward about associating an individual minister with failures, effectively, unforgivable negligence. But deploy accompanying scientists, in case of such attacks, as your bespoke, personal protection equipment. We have followed the science and always made the right decisions at the right time.
Try answering a difficult question with – Raab’s speciality – the response to a different one. How many tests completed? Journalists still bringing up Johnson’s early pledge of 250,000 a day? Also irrelevant. We’re ramping up. Herculean effort. Finest military planners in the world.
On PPE, the guidance is similar: befuddle them with billions of items, deploy the heroic “working night and day”/“all hours God sends” and agree, fervently, on the need. So let’s hope the heroic frontline isn’t wasting it. “We need,” Hancock warned on 10 April, “everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource that it is.”
There’s no avoiding care homes. Improvise. Say these were a top priority from the start and hope nobody remembers Johnson’s vague advice, as late as 16 March, against “unnecessary” visits. Hancock recalls, future inquiries will note, that in January “one of the first things we knew about this virus was that it had a very strong age profile, as in it was much more dangerous for older people”. But he wants to “dispute” the suggestion that the sector had been desperate for tests, there’d been these “index” ones “and no doubt many lives were saved as a result”.
That the government, by way of building trust, is committed to defending clear failures with vastly tragic consequences was re-established last week when a returning Johnson depicted almost 27,000 deaths as a good outcome, for not being 500,000. Plainly, if Dominic Cummings did not calculate that such misrepresentations were, regardless of the press mischief, politically advantageous, the briefings would not be happening.
But for all the obfuscation they allow glimpses of the truth. It can’t have been the intention to expose the dismaying inadequacies of Johnson’s cabinet, selected, as its members mostly were, for loyalty rather than intelligence or experience. It can’t have been Cummings’s plan to underline the culpability of a leader who bequeaths as his substitute in a national crisis a man you would not trust with a stepladder.
Perhaps the lingering memory of these sessions will be ministers’ collective adherence to a script composed by the authors of Get Brexit Done, which no death toll is big enough to revise. No scientist should have to take responsibility for that.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus means science is suddenly being done differently – and so is politics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If we are to return to our normal lives, we need answers to many questions and they will only be delivered by science and medicine and their applications. In fact, the speed with which the virus has spread around the globe has been matched by the speed with which many scientists have mobilised themselves to take on this pandemic.
The British science community has responded rapidly. The government’s funding agency, UK Research and Innovation-Medical Research Council (UKRI-MRC), has created new funding schemes, the Wellcome Trust has partnered with the Gates Foundation to speed up research and Cancer Research UK is supporting work into how Covid-19 is disrupting cancer treatment. In the last weeks, Oxford University and Imperial College London have reported on their plans for new vaccines and on more modelling of the impact of the virus. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Sanofi have put competition behind them and are working closer together to develop drugs and new vaccines. “Mega-labs” have been set up to undertake virus testing, supported by “small-boat” laboratories in research institutes and commercial testing facilities.
Suddenly, science is being done differently. Scientists have made dramatic shifts in their research, often without the funding in place to support these new directions. Results are shared rapidly, with papers in research journals being published in days and weeks rather than months and years, and through informal channels not always peer reviewed, like the popular press and social media. Barriers have been broken down between different areas of science, blurring the boundaries between disciplines and the conventional separation of basic discovery research from research aimed at developing useful applications.
The breakdown in barriers is very obvious at the Francis Crick Institute in central London, where I work. The institute was set up deliberately mixing research groups of all types together. Basic research biologists are cheek by jowl with clinical researchers and with translational scientists who work closely with industry. So when Covid-19 hit the UK it was easy for these scientists to shift from their established programmes to work together on the virus. They brought different skills and expertise to the endeavour, stimulating each other, driving new ideas, thinking “out of the box”.
In less than three weeks, with no government support, working in close collaboration with UCL Hospitals Foundation Trust and the diagnostic company Health Services Laboratories, an accredited virus testing facility was put in place, testing NHS frontline workers and providing a new team that can help research into the virus. Being locally organised, the team was well placed to solve problems in all parts of the virus testing workflow, from sample collection to laboratory analysis, and to returning the information back to hospitals within 24 hours. This helps to keep patients and healthcare workers safe by tracing those who are infected, assisting hospitals to run securely and maintaining the trust of patients who are avoiding hospitals because they are worried about infection.
These experiences gained locally will help the mega testing labs get their workflows operating effectively. The mega labs will encounter similar difficulties to those the Crick has faced, including issues that have arisen due to NHS guidelines that prevented frontline care workers being routinely tested when they do not have symptoms but may still be infectious. Problems such as these have contributed to the challenges of getting to the government’s target of 100,000 tests a day.
A number of Covid-related research projects have also rapidly sprung up at the Crick. These include how the virus replicates in human cells, why for some people the disease is mild and for others it is deadly, how the virus gets into cells and is transferred from animals to humans, what happens to the human immune system after viral infection and how the treatment of cancer patients is affected by the virus. The projects addressing these questions range across scientific disciplines and ways of working and involve a wide spectrum of expertise from fundamental researchers to frontline healthcare workers.
Science is crucial to developing sound public policy to manage the pandemic, but it is important to recognise that at this stage scientific knowledge of the virus is still tentative. Scientists can only give the best advice available at the time, but some of that advice will turn out to be incorrect. It is only through sustained quality research that clarity will emerge and advice will become increasingly reliable and that will take time.
There has also been a sea change in the relationship between politicians and scientists. This is important because as well as high-quality scientists, we need high-quality political leadership to guide us through this pandemic. The political populists, so vocal at the election and before, have gone strangely silent.
We are not hearing experts being scoffed at or simplistic soundbites such as “get Covid done”. These may win elections but if there is nothing beneath them they are useless to deal with complex political issues such as the present crisis. Perhaps this pandemic will lead to a more mature relationship between politicians and experts, which will help strengthen our country’s leadership at a time when we need it most. Maybe dealing with the current crisis will not only get rid of the coronavirus but also the virus of unsubstantiated populism.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'How is this possible?' Researchers grapple with Covid-19's mysterious mechanism</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Respiratory physician Dr David Darley says something peculiar happens to a small group of Covid-19 patients on day seven of their symptoms.
“Up until the end of that first week, they’re stable,” says Darley, a doctor with Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital. “And then suddenly, they have this hyper-inflammatory response. The proteins involved in that inflammation start circulating in the body at high levels.”
In these patients, the lungs begin to struggle. Blood pressure lowers. Other organs, including the kidneys, may begin to shut down. Blood clots form throughout the body. The brain and intestines may also be affected. Some suffer changes to their personality, suggesting brain damage.
“I think what is evolving is a very specific set of stages of disease and for some reason, not everyone goes through all of the stages,” Darley says. “Some go through to the most severe stage and they require breathing support and oxygen. These patients who are severe tend to be older, they are more likely to be men, and also have other medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease.”
But there is no way of knowing which patients will be affected by the most severe symptoms. Clinicians like Darley hope that a disease biomarker – a unique characteristic in the blood, body fluids, or tissues – will eventually be discovered for each stage.
“It would help clinicians predict what stage patients are at and maybe even if they will progress to the next stage of disease,” he said. “It could help us predict who needs to be more closely observed in hospitals and would mean we have all the systems ready to go if they worsen. And it would give us more confidence to have them discharged to home if a biomarker says they are low risk for developing severe illness.”
Darley is one of the researchers working on a long-term St Vincent’s study of patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. Patients will be followed for a year after being discharged, receiving tests at regular intervals to see if there are any lasting effects or changes in the body’s immune system and blood. They will also be assessed for any ongoing changes to lung, gut and brain functions. No one yet knows if the virus causes permanent or long-term harm.
“I don’t think it’s clear yet whether it’s the virus infecting the lungs and the blood vessels, or if it’s the body’s immune system which goes out of control which then causes lung and blood vessel injury,” Darley said. “Or, it could be a combination of both.
“The pathogenesis is not clear yet. We are observing brain inflammation in a subset of patients, and in those we are seeing agitation and a change in behaviour or personality. That’s really interesting, and there are reports coming from elsewhere of some people, including younger patients, suffering stroke. It’s unclear whether the virus is infecting the lining cells of blood vessels in the brain, or whether the patient’s blood is excessively prone to clotting because of all the inflammation, leading to stroke.”
A renowned intensive care specialist from Italy, Prof Luciano Gattinoni, said this type of clotting in respiratory diseases is “extremely unusual”.
The 75-year-old has been working in intensive care for 40 years, and said he has never seen anything like what is happening to the lungs of some Covid-19 patients. What is particularly baffling is patients are presenting with poor oxygenation but little lung damage. This type of presentation is more typical of patients suffering from altitude sickness than a viral infection, Gattignoni says. As a result, patients who are very sick may not feel like they’re really struggling to breathe – even as they’re being critically deprived of oxygen.
“How is this possible?” Gattinoni told Guardian Australia from the intensive care department of the German hospital where he is working as a guest professor. “Bad oxygenation and good lungs tells me this must have something to do with the blood vessels. But these vessels are everywhere. In the brain. In the kidneys. So, in some patients, many organs are affected.”
The problem is, mechanical ventilation in intensive care replaces the strength of the respiratory muscles. If patients are struggling to breathe but their lung structure is OK, this ventilation does little to help and in fact may prove harmful, Gattinoni said, because mechanical ventilation is invasive.
He said while only a small number of patients are severe enough to require ventilation, a significant proportion of those on ventilators die, continuing to show low blood oxygen levels despite mechanical assistance.
Gattinoni said doctors must use ventilators only when needed, and at the right time. Getting this right can improve survival rates, he believes, and he thinks wrongly timed ventilation is why some intensive care units treating Covid-19 patients have higher death rates than others.
“Timing with this disease is absolutely critical,” he said. “Ventilation cannot begin too early or too late.” In the meantime, patients are given anticoagulants, drugs that prevent or slow blood clotting in the hope that stroke can be prevented.
Darley said scans of the lungs of Covid-19 patients are unique, showing “ground glass opacity”, a hazy pattern that does not obscure the underlying lung structure. Lung cancer, for example, would typically show on a scan as a dark, solid lesion, obscuring other structures in the lungs. While other illnesses, for example bacterial infections, can result in ground glass opacity on a scan, there were some unusual features on scans for Covid-19, Darley said.
“It has a classic pattern in Covid,” he said.
He suspects men are more severely affected than women because the virus is activated by an enzyme controlled by androgens, a group of hormones that play a role in male characteristics. But more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Darley added that any research into the virus needed to be conducted ethically and with strong scientific protocols.
“With no treatments for this virus, all we can do for severe patients at the moment is provide supportive care,” he said. “If the level of fluid is low, we can replace it. If they need ventilation, we can help them breathe. But treatments for this disease can only come from clinical trials.
“Our commitment at our hospital is to work with the highest level of scientific inquiry. People are desperate for treatments but we are reluctant to try treatments outside of clinical trials here.
“If we don’t clearly show a treatment is better than placebo or other treatments, we could be creating noise and adding to the current chaos of the scientific community. Our responsibility is to find treatments that work.”
Gattinoni agrees. He said scientists had been trying for decades to find drugs that moderate the inflammatory reaction, and he said these drugs had been “romanticised and popularised” in the race to find treatments for Covid-19.
“But in thousands of experiments over the years trying to block inflammatory responses, we’ve only had a lot of poor results,” Gattinoni said. “Like many other things in medicine, we have to be patient.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus may keep Norwegian flying – but it’s not much to celebrate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For the over-ambitious airline’s bondholders, investors and lessors, survival means the lesser of two evilly large losses
As one of Norway’s greatest exports, A-ha, put it, in their classic 1980s hit Take on Me, it’s no better to be safe than sorry. This advice may appear ever more overwhelmingly wrong to those who bet their kroner on the vision of the two Bjorns, Kjos and Kise, the co-founders turned chief executive and chairman of Norwegian Air.
The pair wisely exited the scene last year after an extraordinary ride during which they turned Norwegian from a small local carrier into a global pioneer of low-cost, long-haul air travel, and eventually established bases all around Europe. With half an eye on transatlantic links and another on a booming short-haul operation, Norwegian became a dizzying array of subsidiaries whose complexity could not disguise the fact that it was heading for financial disaster.
Although Norwegian had started to streamline and argues that it was on its way back from the brink prior to coronavirus, the pandemic may yet allow it to unexpectedly survive. However, the terms of that survival may be little consolation to investors, who face the choice of salvaging crumbs or waving goodbye to it all.
Norway’s government has offered a lifeline, a 3bn kroner (£230m) aid package to tide it through months of grounded planes, but dependent on the airline effectively making itself solvent again by wiping out debt. Three groups have to decide just how palatable the scraps on offer are. First, the bondholders, who are being asked to take equity in the airline instead of ever seeing their money repaid, and whose foot-dragging past deadlines on Friday suggested little appetite for playing along.
Second, the aircraft lessors, who have in theory until Sunday night to decide whether to accept an even less alluring proposition. For these firms, who own the tangible, flying, metal-and-carbon-fibre assets instead of mere paper, the swap is not exactly tempting. Do they want to trade $500m of aircraft payments to own a chunk of an airline? Norwegian’s hope is that the leasing companies decide it is better to take a stake – effectively becoming the airline operator themselves – rather than parking dozens of Boeings and trying to find a new customer in the current market.
Should those two groups get on board, it finally falls to Norwegian’s battered shareholders, at an emergency general meeting on Monday, to approve the plans. That will mean voting for their own stake to be diluted again to just 5% of the current value – which, in context, is already only 3% of where it stood just two years ago.
In those brave days, the Bjorns’ ambition was so great that they even launched a Norwegian operation in Argentina, which has to be the most insanely optimistic South American transport venture since Fitzcarraldo attempted to haul a steamship over a rainforested Peruvian mountain. And, having placed enormous orders for Dreamliners and other new planes, Norwegian boasted that it had the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet in the world.
Of a fleet that was due to grow beyond 160 aircraft this summer, just seven planes remain in operation – pootling around Norway, delivering bits and bobs of essential cargo. Norwegian may yet rise from these ashes – but no investor will ever want to see a Bjorn again.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pandemic! by Slavoj Žižek; Where Is God in a Coronavirus World? by John Lennox – review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Detained at home with time to write instant books, two septuagenarian sages here make very different attempts to wrest a meaning or moral from the coronavirus pandemic. The Slovenian theorist Slavoj Žižek treats the disease as an intellectual malaise from which we will only be rescued by a “philosophical revolution”; John Lennox, an Oxford mathematician who moonlights as a Christian evangelist, approaches Covid-19 as a theological conundrum and tries to explain why God seems so unbothered by our distress. While clinicians work on decoding the coronavirus, Žižek unhelpfully inflates it to an imaginary bogey, a “spectral fantasy”. In the absence of a vaccine, Lennox prescribes prayer, which at least is better advice than injecting bleach.
Žižek deplores our superstitions about the virus as a regression to “pre-modern thinking” and in Pandemic! he rethinks the crisis with the aid of the usual postmodern gurus. Michel Foucault’s account of the disciplinary state prompts him to mock hygiene rules: warned against touching our faces, are we being told not to play with ourselves? (Well, no, because the health authorities in New York have officially recommended masturbation to the shut-in users of dating apps, advising ”you are your safest sex partner”.) Drawing on the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Žižek says that a blindly self-replicating pathogen has loosened our hold on reality and exposed “the ultimate abyss of our being”. The remedy is a dose of updated Marx: because the pandemic is a byproduct of global capitalism, the solution must be “some kind of reinvented communism”.
The pandemic reminds Žižek of the alien invasion in HG Wells’s TheWar of the Worlds, where humanity is fortuitously spared because the Martians have no resistance to microbes, “the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, put upon this Earth”. But what if it were God who, in his malice, concocted coronavirus in the first place? In the Old Testament, the vindictive ogre whips up an exterminating deluge, followed later by the 10 plagues of Egypt. Lennox, however, is anxious to rule out divine retribution and in Where Is God in a Coronavirus World? he declares that the “wonderful and good capacity” of free will with which the creator endowed us “also makes us capable of evil”. This means, I assume, that airborne contagion must be a consequence of our bad choices. It’s a grotesque notion, though it could be applied to the Trump-loving protesters against lockdown in American states: for them, liberty means the right to go back to the diner or the nail salon and to die after doing so.
Lennox backtracks by defining Covid-19 as a specimen of “natural evil”, which sounds like an invitation to demonise the bats, civet cats and scaly anteaters at the Wuhan market, even though they too are surely God’s creatures. As so often, theology stumbles over the problem of undeserved suffering and Lennox defies both logic and common decency when he contends that Covid-19 might turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Viruses, he insists, “are in the main beneficial”. They recycle nutrients through food chains, regulate which species eat what and keep ecosystems functioning smoothly; a medical researcher therefore calls them “unsung heroes”, as if they were selfless NHS workers. Agony like that caused by the coronavirus can be an aid to what Lennox calls “character formation”: after all, “American football, British rugby and boxing” demonstrate that “enthusiasts will put up with a great deal of pain in order to excel”. So should we admire the sporty zeal of patients on ventilators and see them as athletes in training for some spiritual version of the Tokyo Olympics?
By contrast with this happy talk, Žižek describes the virus as “a dark shadow” that will continue to haunt us. At one point, he pictures it as a ghoul from a horror movie, calling it “undead” like a vampire or zombie. Elsewhere, he visualises this invisible enemy as a sci-fi monster: like Wells’s Martians sucking blood from their human prey, it is a parasite with a “stupidly repetitive, pre-sexual life” that uses the bodies of those it infects as “its copying machine”. Television news reports show us a purple grenade studded with spiky red coronets; Žižek’s less decorative image is grislier and truer.
Lennox may be God’s apologist, but it is Žižek, paradoxically identified as “a Christian atheist”, who does a better job of deriving good from evil. Invoking Hegel’s idea of a spirit that pervades nature, he calculates that the pandemic has already resulted in “some kind of ethical progress”: next time you deliver an elderly neighbour’s groceries, please consider your act of kindness an exercise in transcendental idealism. But Žižek zanily overdoes it when he volunteers to grapple with the devil and harrow hell. He says that he sometimes longs to contract the virus, which would demystify the “spectral agent” and drag it down into physical reality. I’d advise him to be careful what he wishes for.
Housebound isolation even leads Žižek to liken himself to “Christ on the cross”, abandoned by God but accompanied on Calvary by Julian Assange, who is crucified “in his prison cell, with no visits permitted”. Despite such grandiosity, Žižek does acknowledge the stress or dread we are all experiencing. Lennox is more glibly optimistic. Playing on words, he makes the coronavirus mutate into the “crown of thorns” worn by Christ, which somehow enables him to conclude that the pandemic may ultimately prove to be “very healthy”.
Perhaps as a sign of desperation, Žižek’s book begins in the same way that Lennox’s ends: both ponder Christ’s resurrection, luckily without noting the coincidence of BoJo’s emergence from hospital on Easter Sunday. Žižek remembers the risen Christ telling Mary Magdalene not to touch him and ingeniously links this with the protocols of physical distancing. We must learn, he says, to transmit emotion by semaphore, relying on a “deep look” into someone’s eyes rather than a handshake. Lennox finishes with another slippery pun, promising that when Christ next reappears he will perform a mass coronation and award “the crown of righteousness” to those who have kept the faith. We’re given no date for the saviour’s second coming: let’s hope that while we wait we’ll be reprieved by medical science.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The promise of an Oxford vaccine reveals how a new Britain could thrive</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was some good news last week. Oxford University’s Jenner Institute announced it was teaming up with AstraZeneca to take a promising prototype of coronavirus vaccine into volume production by the autumn. Of course there are caveats – the institute’s confidence in its vaccine may not be validated by the trials that began last week.
Still it was heartening, after so much tragic incompetence, that a British university and a British company could forge a relationship of such potential national importance.
AstraZeneca’s recent history also tells a cautionary tale – pointing to how our financial, ownership and banking ecosystem is fundamentally decadent. But it also points to a story of promise: if we can be as fast as we’ve been in developing a potential vaccine, in building Nightingale hospitals and in learning to live online, perhaps we can repurpose the British financial system just in time.
The cautionary tale: Britain very nearly did not have AstraZeneca. If six years ago the company had not had some lucky breaks it would not now exist, taken over by the US drug company Pfizer that had no parallel commitment to sustaining drug research in Britain. It was and is run by a Frenchman, Pascal Soriot, passionate about medicine (his three brothers are doctors), who knew the long-term value of the company, did not accept that the share price was all and was backed by an unexpectedly determined board. What’s more, the company being half Swedish – the result of an EU-driven merger between the Swedish Astra and the best of the old ICI – it had the unwavering support of long-term shareholders, notably the Wallenberg family holding. They, together with some unfashionably long-term British shareholders, held the line.
It was a close-run thing. David Cameron’s government won some worthless promises from Pfizer, but it said it would not stand in the way of “market forces”, whatever the company’s strategic importance. No thanks to it, but rather those long-term shareholders, Britain now has one of the world’s great drug companies, beginning to flourish while Pfizer is in the doldrums. Its value is crystal clear.
Sadly, the same cannot be said of Britain’s capacity to manufacture a range of medical equipment – witness the ongoing debacle over PPE, ventilators, face masks and the rest. The same decadent financial and ownership system is in part to blame. One statistic reveals its priorities: of the £1.7tn stock of British bank lending, £1.45tn is on real estate while a tiny £10bn has been advanced to small- and medium-sized manufacturers.
But as economic disaster looms, British banks could, and should, become conduits for finance to flow to our crippled business sector, and in particular manufacturing – as urgently as the Jenner Institute is trying to develop a vaccine. Unless that happens, Britain is going to have the deepest and most prolonged recession in its history.
In fairness, the Treasury and Bank of England have been quick in creating some genuinely innovative financial support packages. There is the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme and the generous term funding scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises, which banks can access to finance up to £190bn of new lending over the next 12 months. As the Bank of England dryly observes, that is 13 times more than the banks managed themselves over the entirety of 2019. On top, the banks were told not to pay any dividends to help conserve capital, better to support the impending scale of lending to distressed companies.
British banks are trying – £1.3bn was lent last week and 25,000 applications processed – but the degree of cultural and organisational change required is dramatic. To avert a disastrous wave of closures, bankruptcies and redundancies by the summer, the weekly rate of lending has to rise to between £12bn an £15bn. That’s lending in a week what banks used to lend in a year. It is telling that Britain’s 10,000 bank branches have been closed or are working greatly reduced hours during lockdown. They do not have the economic function of supermarkets, which have had to stay open.
British banks have a longstanding aversion to business lending: it is regarded as too risky and costly. With the same ruthlessly short-term shareholders owning them as those prepared to sell AstraZeneca to the highest bidder, banks know that they must deploy their capital to where profits are high and reliable – real estate lending. This means that the piping through which emergency credit must flow is atrophied and weak.
The chancellor should chair an emergency financial task force with the purpose of driving lending up by the day, to be monitored with the same intensity as we monitor Covid testing. The British Business Bank, embarrassingly minuscule compared with its foreign counterparts, needs immediately to be given the mandate and capital to increase its own lending 10 times – across the country. Bank shareholders need to declare much more publicly and vocally than they have that they understand the demands being made.
Nor can the insurance industry, with funds under management of £1.9tn, stand on the sidelines. The loans the banks make, some with government guarantees, could be packaged in “cover bonds” that the insurance industry commits to buying – relieving pressure on bank balance sheets and recycling vital cash.
Some companies will not need loans but equity investment: the venture capital and private equity industries must transmute themselves from their default role as predators and asset-sweaters to long-term, patient investors – working with the newly created Future Fund to take generous equity stakes in companies in need. Supporting intellectual capital rather than seeking property collateral should become the new north star of British finance. If there is not to be a terrifying slump, the British financial and ownership system needs a revolution – and it has to take place in mere weeks.
Good people abound, marginalised until now by the predominant culture of wealth extraction. They need to be unleashed. And once we get to the other side, the new systems of engagement and support need to be retained. Good, perhaps, might yet come from all this pain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Ratline by Philippe Sands review – on the trail of the Nazi who got away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In his much-celebrated 2016 memoir, East West Street, Philippe Sands deftly wove together the story of a personal quest to uncover family secrets in the Ukrainian city of Lviv with the great arcs of global history that surrounded them – the Nazi occupation of Lviv in the 1940s, the Holocaust and the establishment of international law in Nuremberg in the aftermath of the second world war.
The result was compelling: a feat of narrative intensity and worldly insight that Sands has surpassed in his follow-up, The Ratline, an investigation into the life and mysterious death of Nazi Brigadeführer turned man on the run Otto von Wächter. This is a taut and finely crafted factual thriller, reminiscent in density and pace of John le Carré (who is also revealed here as Sands’s real-life neighbour).
A professor at UCL and renowned international barrister who has been engaged with human rights violations in Chile, Guantánamo Bay, Congo and Iraq, Sands grapples here with material left unresolved at the end of East West Street, where Von Wächter, though indicted in 1945 for mass murder, is the man who escapes justice, the one who gets away.
In The Ratline, we delve deeper into the story of the escape of a committed Nazi, a party member since 1923 who rose through the ranks as Hitler consolidated his power to be appointed governor of Kraków in 1939 and then of Galicia in 1942, directly accountable to Heinrich Himmler until the fall of the Nazi regime.
In 1945, wanted by the allies, Von Wächter evades capture, surviving as a fugitive for three years in the Austrian Alps before coming under the protection of a Vatican bishop, Alois Hudal.
Hiding in Rome, an anonymous tenant in the Vigna Pia monastery, Von Wächter waits for safe passage via the secret channels by which Nazi refugees were trafficked to Argentina along “the ratline”, a shadowy pathway out of Rome in a city now abuzz with Soviet and American spies.
Three months in, Von Wächter is taken ill under mysterious circumstances. Two monks drop him off at the nearby Santo Spirito hospital, under a false identity. Four days later, he’s dead.
Sixty years after the event, Otto’s youngest son, Horst von Wächter, is still haunted by his father’s death. He believes Otto was murdered in Rome in 1949.
He is the inhabitant of the family seat – “a vast, dilapidated, empty, magnificent castle” in Upper Austria bequeathed to him by his mother. He’s also the last defender of his father’s honour and, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Horst refuses to believe that his father was a criminal at all.
He was “against the racial theories”, he insists. “[He] didn’t see the Germans as supermen and all others as Untermenschen. He wanted to do something good, to get things moving.”
His evidence is, at best, circumstantial – letters and diaries, the artefacts of a life that he says speak to his father’s basic decency. But in spite of himself, Sands hears him out. He finds he likes Horst. He sees him as “gentle and open, seemingly with nothing to hide” and Horst in turn seems to need Sands. He says he brings relief to his “solitude”.
An unlikely friendship develops as Horst looks to Sands, inheritor of his own and strangely interconnected family tragedy, to help him do the work that he cannot do alone: to exonerate his father’s soul.
Horst shares everything: every letter, every diary, every photograph, bequeathed, along with this castle, by his mother, Charlotte. He urges Sands to get to the bottom of the mystery of his father’s untimely end.
What emerges is the mesmerising story, both of an extraordinary love that bound Charlotte and Otto and that endured even as their world was brought to ruin and a forensic investigation into the shady world of plots and double-dealings that saw the emergence of a new world order taking root in postwar Rome.
What is evil? The possibility, as we travel with Sands into the moral maze that he sets up is that we will come to see how a man’s capacity for love, not his crimes, constitutes the real measure of his soul.
Sands is unflinching, though, where Horst cannot be. He pursues the details and we are left with the unsettling, discordant portrait of a man who is conceivably a passionate husband and devoted father, but irrefutably a war criminal with blood, including that of Sands’s own family members, on his hands.
It’s treacherous terrain, but in Sands we have an incomparable guide who finds a kind of redemption on every road of the human experience, though never at the expense of responsibility or truth. The outcome is a feat of exhilarating storytelling – gripping, gratifying and morally robust.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus crisis could increase users' drug habits – report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic could push some recreational drug users into more serious and potentially harmful substance use, while use of “party drugs” declines, a leading addiction expert has said.
For some casual users of cannabis or cocaine, the lockdown will probably prove to be a mental health crisis point that leads them to take drugs more frequently, said Prof Adam Winstock, the founder and director of the Global Drug Survey.
Some drug users, whose habits already verge on being problematic, could also switch to using different and possibly harder drugs, increasing the risk of dependency, overdose and other harms, he said before the launch of the 2020 survey.
But Winstock, a London-based consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, said it was also probable that many recreational drug users would reduce their intake during the Covid-19 outbreak, with early evidence showing a drop in demand for party drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine.
“I’m certain there will be a proportion of people for whom Covid will be the tipping crisis,” said Winstock. “Where previously their use of weed or coke was once or twice a week, it’s now three or four times a week, and when they don’t use, they’re feeling anxious and miserable.
“If you were someone who was verging towards problematic use, you’re either going to use the pandemic as an opportunity to reduce use and improve mental health, or your use is going to escalate. And as you run out of your preferred choice of drug, you will look for other drugs to compensate for that.”
This year’s survey asks respondents to describe how the coronavirus has affected their drug use, mental health and personal relationships. For the first time, it will also include questions about domestic violence owing to a spike in cases during the lockdown.
Research led by Prof Gail Gilchrist, of the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London, who advised on the survey, found an increased risk of men perpetrating intimate partner abuse when they were in withdrawal or craving alcohol and heroin.
Winstock said evidence from other drug experts and law enforcement worldwide suggested a drop in demand for drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, which were usually taken socially, partly due to the increased risk for dealers of doing home deliveries.
He added that supplies of some drugs could start to run out in the coming weeks, leading vulnerable users in particular to take more dangerous alternatives.
For example, there were reports of homeless users in the UK turning to heroin and alcohol because of a shortage of synthetic cannabinoids, such as spice.
Interesting trends in drug use overseas during the pandemic included a spike in demand for ketamine in Berlin, said Winstock, adding that at low doses the dissociative anaesthetic had a numbing effect that may appeal to people wanting to cut themselves off from the crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antarctica vs. Science</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At the start of January, the same month the world marked the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica, scientists on snowmobiles were zipping across its diamantine ice, dragging a rig of metal detectors in their wake. Researchers were hoping to discover a hypothesized cache of iron-rich meteorites, the remnants of ancient asteroids and would-be planets, under the frozen wastes.
But the unexpected roughness of the ice caused the rig to shake itself to pieces. Components were being shorn off, and the electronic circuitry quickly became unstable, with multiple points of failure. On the 18th day in Antarctica’s Outer Recovery Ice Fields, the device collapsed. All the backup metal detectors had been used in earlier repairs. No more repair jobs could resuscitate the unit.
“It was death-by-vibration, but also death by a thousand cuts,” said Wouter van Verre, an electrical engineer from the University of Manchester in England who helped build the system.
This is no isolated tale. The history of the scientific exploration of Antarctica is riddled with tales of woe, most often loss of life for the continent’s earlier explorers. And while major technological advancements and vastly improved safety regulations mean that the risk to Antarctic adventurers has been greatly reduced, equipment malfunctions that freeze scientific discovery persist there, said Daniella McCahey, a historian of Antarctica at the University of Idaho.
When a vital piece of kit fails, the research often can only continue with MacGyveresque engineering solutions. Or projects end, leaving the prospects of additional discovery uncertain.
The Snow Cruiser was an early example of an ill-fated piece of equipment. Weighing 37 tons and built with pride in Chicago in 1939, it was designed to glide across the perilous Antarctic terrain with ease, allowing its crew to make scientific observations wherever they wished. But once it arrived in Antarctica, its massive and far-too-smooth tires were unable to power the wheeled beast across much of the ice. Eventually, after a particularly heavy storm, it was abandoned to a snowy grave.
But even far less complex technology can be vulnerable to Antarctica’s viciousness: During the 1957-1958 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, the explorers’ wristwatches — vital for telling the time in a place with distinctly alien hours of light and darkness — simply didn’t work.
“It’s remarkably easier to keep the human machine working than the physical machines,” said James Lloyd, an astronomer at Cornell University who spent two years at the Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole in the mid-1990s.
Preparation only gets you so far. You can test your technology as many times as you wish in the laboratory, or in Antarctic-like wildernesses. Those iron meteorite hunters did both, and even conducted a successful trial run on a sliver of Antarctica. But until you try it at your eventual research site, “you don’t know how it’s going to work,” Dr. McCahey said.
“I promise you, there are no projects in Antarctica where the equipment works perfectly,” said Matthew Siegfried, a glaciologist at the Colorado School of Mines.
There are no heavy-duty supply stops outfitted with abundances of gear at the icy end of the world, so expeditions bring as many spare parts as they can fly out, and hope for the best. “It’s only a very short step from what you can resource people with in space,” said Liam Marsh, an electrical engineer from the University of Manchester who helped build the meteorite detection system.
Dr. Siegfried recalled a time he drove his snowmobile 45 miles from base to a remote GPS station, bringing along fuel canisters. When he stopped to refuel, he realized that the hand-pump pipe that fed gas to the snowmobile had vanished, forcing him to transmogrify other parts of his kit into a fairly messy — but ultimately effective — fuel transfer system.
This sort of ad hoc repair work is rarely enjoyable, Mr. van Verre said. You quickly miss the luxury of tables and chairs. Gloves are removed when fiddling with small components, leaving hands exposed to a painfully violent chill.
Such difficulty can result in moments of posterior-clenching horror. Nelia Dunbar, director of the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, remembers bringing a snowmobile back to camp after its drive chain snapped. Mid-repair, the snowmobile suddenly roared to life and reversed in full throttle, narrowly missing tearing up her team’s tents.
Even with perfectly functioning equipment, Antarctic malevolence can be remarkably inventive. Hank Statscewich, an oceanographer at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, visited the continent in 2014 to study ocean currents near a biological hot spot. While there, an utter behemoth of an iceberg, pulverizing everything in its wake, improbably parked right on top of his small submerged scientific probe, severing its communication to the surface.
Remarkably, months later, the probe’s mangled remains were found floating listlessly about, its violent encounter with the iceberg dutifully chronicled by its scientific instrumentation. Mr. Statscewich’s experience epitomizes the surprising reality about scientific expeditions to Antarctica: many manage to recover from seemingly terminal technological tribulations.
This includes Manchester’s meteorite hunters, who managed to find more than 100 space rocks, including several iron-rich ones, on the surface during their Antarctic adventures. One meteorite was found while dragging the corpse of the detector rig back to camp. And, for 18 days, their bespoke rig gathered invaluable data. Like each troubled expedition before it, their quandaries serve as learning experiences that hopefully make the same setbacks less likely on future expeditions.
But if the past is any indication, it will be a long time before Antarctica’s wanton destruction of scientific equipment comes to a close.
“It’s a remorseless environment,” said Patrick Harkness, a space systems engineering expert at the University of Glasgow. “If you’ve made any mistakes in your preparation, it will find them out.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Do You Fight the Coronavirus Without Running Water?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Several weeks ago, Larry Welch and his mother, Mary Ann, contracted Covid-19 and died. In the midst of a pandemic in which one of the first lines of defense is vigorous hand washing, they were among more than two million Americans who lack running water.
Mr. Welch was a disabled Army veteran who served in Operation Desert Storm. His mother lived in Arizona in a remote corner of the Navajo reservation, and her son often visited her to help out by cutting firewood, caring for her sheep and hauling her drinking water.
Hauling water required Mr. Welch to leave the safety of his home, another line of defense against the coronavirus, to fill a 200-gallon tank in his truck from a public tap and drive 90 minutes to his mother’s house. In mid-March, he probably also brought thevirus to his mother without knowing it. Weeks later, their family and community are mourning their loss.
They are two of the more than 60,000 Americans who have succumbed to Covid-19 so far. I can’t help feeling that their deaths were especially senseless. DigDeep, the organization I lead, was working to install indoor plumbing for Mary Ann Welch through our Navajo Water Project. Just days after surveying her home, we were forced to suspend operations because of the pandemic. If we had completed that work, perhaps they’d be alive.
More than 2.2 million Americans, through no fault of their own, lack access to the clean running water and basic indoor plumbing the rest of us take for granted. Every state is home to entire communities facing this virus without being even able to wash their hands, but the federal government has yet to form an emergency response that addresses their safety.
It’s no accident that these places tend to be communities of color. Decades ago, they were bypassed by government initiatives to build water infrastructure, and federal funding for water projects is now just a tiny fraction of what it once was. Today, race is the single strongest predictor of whether you have access to a tap or a toilet in your home. Nationwide, Indigenous households are 19 times more likely than white households to lack access to complete plumbing, while African-American and Latinx households are nearly twice as likely.
It is too soon to say what impact the lack of clean running water has had on the spread of the coronavirus in most of these communities. But in the Navajo Nation, more than 27,000 square miles in the four-corners region of the Southwest, more than a third of homes lack running water, and there are more Covid-19 cases per capita than in any state other than New York and New Jersey.
In parts of California’s Central Valley, where tap water is too tainted by agricultural chemicals and other contaminants to drink, mothers have formed water-sharing groups on Facebook to get around the bottled water purchasing limits at many stores. Remote communities in Alaska rely on “washeterias” — shared laundry and shower facilities — that typically provide two washers and two dryers for an entire village. That makes social distancing difficult, to say the least. And across the country, the more than 500,000 Americans experiencing homelessness face some of the most difficult barriers to water access.
These conditions are making the virus more powerful than it should be, endangering all of us. But this is not an intractable challenge. We can close America’s water access gap.
To address the immediate crisis, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should work together to distribute packaged drinking water to communities without water, using existing natural-disaster response protocols. These agencies should also partner with states and municipalities to provide water deliveries and set up hand-washing stations.
In the meantime, water donations can help fill the gap. Nestlé recently provided my group with 248,000 gallons of bottled water, which we distributed through Navajo agencies and local partners to about 30,000 people across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. But much more water is urgently needed.
And as Congress sets priorities for future infrastructure and stimulus bills, it should prioritize water infrastructure investments that target these communities. Investing in our water system is one of the smartest ways to help jump-start the economic recovery, creating jobs and generating economic activity. Most important, it will make us more resilient to future outbreaks of the coronavirus or another viral threat and provide those without water the health and dignity we all deserve.
Larry and Mary Ann Welch might have had a better chance at fighting the virus if they had running water at home. Let’s make sure every American does.

    <h5 class="mb-1">She Predicted the Coronavirus. What Does She Foresee Next?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I told Laurie Garrett that she might as well change her name to Cassandra. Everyone is calling her that anyway.
She and I were Zooming — that’s a verb now, right? — and she pulled out a 2017 book, “Warnings: Finding Cassandras to Stop Catastrophes.” It notes that Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, was prescient not only about the impact of H.I.V. but also about the emergence and global spread of more contagious pathogens.
“I’m a double Cassandra,” Garrett said.
She’s also prominently mentioned in a recent Vanity Fair article by David Ewing Duncan about “the Coronavirus Cassandras.”
Cassandra, of course, was the prophetess of Greek mythology who was doomed to issue unheeded warnings. What Garrett has been warning most direly about — in her 1994 best seller, “The Coming Plague,” and in subsequent books and speeches, including TED Talks — is a pandemic like the current one.
She saw it coming. So a big part of what I wanted to ask her about was what she sees coming next. Steady yourself. Her crystal ball is dark.
Despite the stock market’s swoon for it, remdesivir probably isn’t our ticket out, she told me. “It’s not curative,” she said, pointing out that the strongest claims so far are that it merely shortens the recovery of Covid-19 patients. “We need either a cure or a vaccine.”
But she can’t envision that vaccine anytime in the next year, while Covid-19 will remain a crisis much longer than that.
“I’ve been telling everybody that my event horizon is about 36 months, and that’s my best-case scenario,” she said.
“I’m quite certain that this is going to go in waves,” she added. “It won’t be a tsunami that comes across America all at once and then retreats all at once. It will be micro-waves that shoot up in Des Moines and then in New Orleans and then in Houston and so on, and it’s going to affect how people think about all kinds of things.”
They’ll re-evaluate the importance of travel. They’ll reassess their use of mass transit. They’ll revisit the need for face-to-face business meetings. They’ll reappraise having their kids go to college out of state.
So, I asked, is “back to normal,” a phrase that so many people cling to, a fantasy?
“This is history right in front of us,” Garrett said. “Did we go ‘back to normal’ after 9/11? No. We created a whole new normal. We securitized the United States. We turned into an antiterror state. And it affected everything. We couldn’t go into a building without showing ID and walking through a metal detector, and couldn’t get on airplanes the same way ever again. That’s what’s going to happen with this.”
Not the metal detectors, but a seismic shift in what we expect, in what we endure, in how we adapt.
Maybe in political engagement, too, Garrett said.
If America enters the next wave of coronavirus infections “with the wealthy having gotten somehow wealthier off this pandemic by hedging, by shorting, by doing all the nasty things that they do, and we come out of our rabbit holes and realize, ‘Oh, my God, it’s not just that everyone I love is unemployed or underemployed and can’t make their maintenance or their mortgage payments or their rent payments, but now all of a sudden those jerks that were flying around in private helicopters are now flying on private personal jets and they own an island that they go to and they don’t care whether or not our streets are safe,’ then I think we could have massive political disruption.”
“Just as we come out of our holes and see what 25 percent unemployment looks like,” she said, “we may also see what collective rage looks like.”
Garrett has been on my radar since the early 1990s, when she worked for Newsday and did some of the best reporting anywhere on AIDS. Her Pulitzer, in 1996, was for coverage of Ebola in Zaire. She has been a fellow at Harvard’s School of Public Health, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and consulted on the 2011 movie “Contagion.”
Her expertise, in other words, has long been in demand. But not like now.
Each morning when she opens her email, “there’s the Argentina request, Hong Kong request, Taiwan request, South Africa request, Morocco, Turkey,” she told me. “Not to mention all of the American requests.” It made me feel bad about taking more than an hour of her time on Monday. But not so bad that I didn’t cadge another 30 minutes on Thursday.
She said she wasn’t surprised that a coronavirus wrought this devastation, that China minimized what was going on or that the response in many places was sloppy and sluggish. She’s Cassandra, after all.
But there is one part of the story she couldn’t have predicted: that the paragon of sloppiness and sluggishness would be the United States.
“I never imagined that,” she said. “Ever.”
The highlights — or, rather, lowlights — include President Trump’s initial acceptance of the assurances by President Xi Jinping of China that all would be well, his scandalous complacency from late January through early March, his cheerleading for unproven treatments, his musings about cockamamie ones, his abdication of muscular federal guidance for the states and his failure, even now, to sketch out a detailed long-range strategy for containing the coronavirus.
Having long followed Garrett’s work, I can attest that it’s not driven by partisanship. She praised George W. Bush for fighting H.I.V. in Africa.
But she called Trump “the most incompetent, foolhardy buffoon imaginable.”
And she’s shocked that America isn’t in a position to lead the global response to this crisis, in part because science and scientists have been so degraded under Trump.
Referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and its analogues abroad, she told me: “I’ve heard from every C.D.C. in the world — the European C.D.C., the African C.D.C., China C.D.C. — and they say, ‘Normally our first call is to Atlanta, but we ain’t hearing back.’ There’s nothing going on down there. They’ve gutted that place. They’ve gagged that place. I can’t get calls returned anymore. Nobody down there is feeling like it’s safe to talk. Have you even seen anything important and vital coming out of the C.D.C.?”
The problem, Garrett added, is bigger than Trump and older than his presidency. America has never been sufficiently invested in public health. The riches and renown go mostly to physicians who find new and better ways to treat heart disease, cancer and the like. The big political conversation is about individuals’ access to health care.
But what about the work to keep our air and water safe for everyone, to design policies and systems for quickly detecting outbreaks, containing them and protecting entire populations? Where are the rewards for the architects of that?
Garrett recounted her time at Harvard. “The medical school is all marble, with these grand columns,” she said. “The school of public health is this funky building, the ugliest possible architecture, with the ceilings falling in.”
“That’s America?” I asked.
“That’s America,” she said.
And what America needs most right now, she said, isn’t this drumbeat of testing, testing, testing, because there will never be enough superfast, super-reliable tests to determine on the spot who can safely enter a crowded workplace or venue, which is the scenario that some people seem to have in mind. America needs good information, from many rigorously designed studies, about the prevalence and deadliness of coronavirus infections in given subsets of people, so that governors and mayors can develop rules for social distancing and reopening that are sensible, sustainable and tailored to the situation at hand.
America needs a federal government that assertively promotes and helps to coordinate that, not one in which experts like Tony Fauci and Deborah Birx tiptoe around a president’s tender ego.
“I can sit here with you for three hours listing — boom, boom, boom — what good leadership would look like and how many more lives would be saved if we followed that path, and it’s just incredibly upsetting,” Garrett said. “I feel like I’m just coming out of maybe three weeks of being in a funk because of the profound disappointment that there’s not a whisper of it.”
Instead of that whisper she hears wailing: the sirens of ambulances carrying coronavirus patients to hospitals near her apartment in Brooklyn Heights, where she has been home alone, in lockdown, since early March. “If I don’t get hugged soon, I’m going to go bananas,” she told me. “I’m desperate to be hugged.”
Me, too. Especially after her omens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Flattening the Truth on Coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The People (P): What is happening?
Answer (A): A virus has come.
P: Is it dangerous?
A: Very dangerous. But not dangerous to most. It strikes the elderly most viciously. But it can kill the middle-aged, the young, the thin, the healthy.
P: What should we do?
A: Stay away from others. Stay inside.
P: And then we won’t get the virus?
A: Absolutely you will get it. Everyone will get it.
P: Wait. No one told us this. They’re telling us to stay inside and we won’t get it.
A: Well, I’m telling you now. Almost everyone will get it. Seventy percent of you, give or take. Think about it. It’s everywhere, and there’s no vaccine. But we want everyone to get it at different times. Like on a schedule of getting it. At least five million people already have it in the United States.
P: Wait. Five million? Everyone says one million.
A: That’s the known, confirmed cases. We just started testing in earnest like, an hour ago. For every case we know, there’s five, 10, 50 that we don’t know. Maybe they got it and were asymptomatic. Maybe they got sick but not sick enough to go the hospital or get tested. Five million is an extremely low estimate of how many cases there are. It’s probably more like 20 million.
P: Twenty?
A: That’s good news! In a way. That means it’s less deadly to most people than we thought. And it proves the inevitability of you getting it yourself. So stay inside till it’s your turn to get it.
P: How long should we stay inside?
A: I’m thinking two months. No, three. Six? No, 12. Yes, 12!
P: Then it will be gone?
A: The virus? Lord no. It could be 18 months till we get a vaccine. But by then you’ll have already gotten it, so the date doesn’t really matter. Especially given that the virus will come back double-strong in the fall.
P: So it’s less potent in the summer?
A: Absolutely not. Who told you that?
P: You just said it’ll come back stronger in the fall. Which implies its power is dissipated in the summer.
A: Are you a doctor? No? Good. Then pay attention. The virus is everywhere, in every city and state, but we’re flattening the curve. Then it’ll very likely come back with a vengeance in the fall. Winter, too. Also, in the meantime, it’ll be with us all summer with probably no change in its potency. Capiche?
P: No one’s giving us this information.
A: Well, you know how we’re stretching out the cases over a longer period of time? Flattening the curve? We’re also flattening the truth. So just stay inside, and you’ll be fine. Order stuff online. Support your local restaurant.
P: Whew. OK. We can do that.
A: But do so knowing that you are putting the lives of everyone at risk — the cooks, the clerks, the delivery people. I’m actually a bit shocked by your selfishness and the cavalier way you’re sacrificing the lives of people who have no choice but to expose themselves to grave danger during a pandemic.
P: It sounds like you’re saying we shouldn’t order stuff to be delivered.
A: You shouldn’t. Unless you want local businesses to die.
P: So we should support local businesses …
A: Absolutely. While risking their workers’ lives. Yes. Order food, eat it, watch the news about the pandemic that can’t be stopped. Get plenty of sleep, and start smoking. Turns out smokers are less likely to get sick.Which only makes sense! So remember to exercise. Go for a run!
P: Where should we go for a run?
A: Ideally some place where you can spread out, where you aren’t in close proximity to other people.
P: Like the beach? A park?
A: Sure. Beaches and parks are wide-open spaces. They’re about as safe as you can be.
P: We just went to the beach and the park. There were hundreds of other people there.
A: You went to the beach? The park? What were you thinking? There are hundreds of people there! Go home. Be with your kids. Do you have kids?
P: Yes.
A: Well, make sure they keep up with school. Keep up with their worksheets and Zoom, and check their work, and keep them off screens, and go outside, and don’t worry about school. It’s a pandemic, after all.
P: Um. Many of the things you just said sound contradictory.
A: Not at all. I’ll rephrase: Your kids are living through a crisis. It’s all right if they feel anxious, or if you can’t maintain routines or keep up with regular school schedules. Just make sure they don’t fall behind, and remember that kids thrive on routine. So stick to a schedule, but give them space, and stay inside, and go outside, and use technology to connect with teachers and friends, and limit screen time.
P: Wait. So …
A: But enjoy some downtime together! Relax and watch a movie. Cook some food! Just don’t go to the stores, because that’s dangerous to everyone. Order in! But don’t. Stay home. Move to the country. And stay in the city. If you get sick, go to the hospital. But don’t get too sick, because you wouldn’t want to be going to one of those hospitals now! They’re full of sick people!
P: When did you say this would all end again?
A: Eighteen months. That said, the soonest we’ve ever come up with a vaccine was four years.
P: But everyone’s talking about reopening stores and everything now. How does that square with 18 months?
A: That’s easy. People will die.
P: Wait. What?
A: Oh sure. So many more. Oceans of people. Even just 1,500 a day for eighteen months means 800,000 in the U.S. alone will die from this virus.That’s what the Minnesota scientist says. Osterholm. He’s one of the foremost experts in the world. He’s been right every step of the way so far.
P: What? 800,000?
A: That’s if things stay more or less steady. It could be higher, much higher. With the easing of restrictions and all.
P: But isn’t the rate of death declining?
A: Friday was one of the deadliest days yet! And that’s after everyone’s been inside for a month. Once everyone goes back to work, it’ll probably go up significantly. Total blood bath.
P: So why are we easing restrictions?
A: Something something the economy?
P: Excuse me?
A: Mumble mumble the economy maybe?
P: We don’t understand.
A: Listen. People are fatigued. They want to go back to work. They want to shop. More than anything, they want to roll balls toward white pins and make loud bang-bang sound. And then possibly end up with a tube inserted in their trachea, helping them breathe while their lungs cease to function, until they almost invariably die and die alone.
P: Why don’t we just freeze the economy? Just close most businesses and have the government give everyone a living wage while we wait until there’s a vaccine?
A: Hmm. First of all, ridiculous. Second, that would take significant coordination between local, state and federal governments.
P: Can we do that?
A: Well. I don’t know … I mean … OK. For starters, we’d need superadvanced ways to coordinate everyone. We’d certainly need phones. Maybe email. We might even need spreadsheets and/or computers.
P: Do we have all those things?
A: I think we … might? But there are still so many questions. Like, how would we know who to give money to? We’d have to have a national database with all the salaries of all the nation’s workers.
P: Don’t we have that? Seems like we could get that.
A: Here’s another plan: We promise money to pretty much every person and every business. We give this money to maybe half the people, and to a very small percentage of businesses. We let big banks control most of this money meant for small businesses, and the big banks can funnel it to their biggest clients.
P: That sounds terrible.
A: Those big banks sure know how to handle cash!
P: It seems it would just be easier to give people the exact salaries they had before they lost their jobs to one of the deadliest viruses in 100 years. Just freeze everything. Just mutually agree to pause, together, so we don’t have to lose 730,000 more souls.
A: First of all: boring. Where’s the intrigue? The drama? With our system, you have wave after wave of unemployment, with no end in sight. Every week brings something new: business closures, bankruptcies and ruptures of the supply chain — a never-ending, cascading, domino-orgy of lost savings, empty storefronts and shattered dreams. That’s much more exciting than some boring old guaranteed income that would allow everyone to simply ride out the pandemic knowing their jobs and businesses would be there when the virus was defeated.
P: So there’s no plan.
A: Having no plan is the plan! Haven’t you been listening? Plans are for commies and the Danish. Here we do it fast and loose and dumb and wrong, and occasionally we have a man who manufactures pillows come to the White House to show the president encouraging texts. It all works! Eighteen months, 800,000 deaths, no plan, states bidding against states for medicine and equipment, you’re on your own, plans are lame.
P: I’m going to lie down. I don’t feel good.
A: Should we sing a patriotic song? I feel like our forebears would be so proud of us now. It’s just like how we all pulled together in World War II, every element of society, from the White House to Rosie the Riveter, with common purpose and shared sacrifice. This is just like that, except instead of coordination, we have competition, and instead of common cause, we have acrimony and chaos. Instead of fireside chats, F.D.R. and Churchill, we have tweets, Lysol and Ron DeSantis. Other than that, it’s exactly the same.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus lockdown: Can nature help improve our mood?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At a time when so many of us are facing a heightened sense of threat as well as deep worries about our future, can nature lift our spirits?
"Our current crisis has switched us out of normal existence and into survival mode," says Dr Anna Jorgensen, who researches the connection between environment and wellbeing at the University of Sheffield.
"We no longer see ourselves as quite so immortal," she says.
With far more people unable to work, or working from home, many have been inspired to explore nature in their neighbourhood as they refocus on their immediate surroundings.
As one Instagram user summed it up: "[It] takes a lockdown to find new paths from home. Escaped the 'office' to follow the River Trent winding through the floodplain at the bottom of our road, past gnarly old tree stumps and a statuesque heron."
As factory and car emissions have declined, there are fewer tiny particles in the air, so it's easier to see beyond built-up areas and to the stars in the night sky. Less city noise also highlights the sounds of birds.
There is also greater interest in gardening. Google Trends shows a doubling of worldwide online searches for compost and seeds compared with a year ago.
While the impact of experiencing nature on our physical health is less well documented, a wealth of studies have demonstrated the positive effects of the natural world on our mental health.
Even a brief nature fix - 10 minutes of wind brushing across our cheek, or the sun on our skin - can lower stress, explains Dr Mathew White, from the University of Exeter.
If we immerse ourselves in beautiful landscapes, like a rich coastline or a wild forest teeming with an array of species, we feel more intense emotions, he adds.
Connecting with nature can help us feel happier and more energised, with an increased sense of meaning and purpose, as well as making tasks seem more manageable.
Dr Gretchen C Daily from Stanford University, in the US, uses this evidence to help the World Bank and city governments around the world develop policies to integrate the natural environment into our urban landscapes.
Nature-based activities, such as gardening and farming, have been used as part of mental health treatments around the world for centuries.
GPs in London, Liverpool and Dorset have been prescribing nature experiences for patients with depression and anxiety. These include a healthy walk or planting mint to nurture and grow.
Evidence indicates you can also benefit from "bathing" yourself in nature remotely. One experiment installed large plasma displays of real-time natural scenes outside an office, resulting in people's connection to their wider social community and the natural world increasing.
Sounds have a particular power to evoke memory, according to PhD researcher Alex Smalley.
So your feelings can be enhanced by listening to recordings of natural sounds, such as crashing waves or squawks of forest birds, after you've experienced them in person or watched a powerful film or programme featuring that landscape.
Dr Jorgensen believes seeing the recurrent rhythms and rebirth of nature, in which plants and animals survive despite the harshness of winter, can also offer us hope and help us cope with the tragedies in our lives.
Part of nature's power lies in its ability to wash away whatever is provoking a lot of our stress, explains Dr Daily.
Slow movements such as the ripples of water or clouds moving across the sky place effortless demands on our working memory but enough to distract us from spiralling rumination, self-blame and hopelessness.
Researchers call this capacity to hold our attention the "soft fascination" of nature.
Tending to a plant helps us to appreciate the power we have to nurture, and gives us a sense of achievement when the plant flourishes, which Dr Jorgensen says is particularly important for those struggling with their mental health.
According to Dr White, the benefits are maximised if we can spend a total of two hours a week connecting with nature. The more senses we use - not only sight and sound but also smell, feel and taste - the greater the benefits.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From the archives: Unlocking the mystery of superhuman strength</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Editor's note: This story, on the mystery of superhuman strength, was originally published on July 8, 2019. Watch "The Mountain" Thor Bjornsson, 2018's World's Strongest Man, attempt the world deadlift record of 1,105 pounds at 12 p.m. ET on Saturday, May 2, on ESPN.
HANNAH SMITH WAS a 16-year-old high school basketball player in rural Lebanon, Oregon, when she heard her father scream. She was outside with her younger sister, who was 14 at the time, walking the dogs. The date was April 1, 2013.
Given the date, her first thought was that this was a joke. The sisters walked on. Then there was another scream, desperate, real. They dropped the leashes and ran. Their father was probably 500 feet away, on the other side of a utility shed and workshop, in the vegetable garden portion of their 5-acre property, which sat "in the middle of nowhere." Though not a working farm, the Smith homestead had cows, pigs, chickens, sheds and various large machines for outdoor labor. Their father, Jeff Smith, a millwright at a local factory, particularly enjoyed performing tasks while perched atop his classic 1949 fire-engine-red Ferguson TO-20, an agricultural tractor with enormous rear tires and an exposed engine block, like what's used for hayrides.
On this day, Jeff had been using the rig to pull a tree stump out of the ground. When the Smith girls rounded the corner of the shed, they saw their father's legs sprawling from under the engine block of the Ferguson. Somehow the machine had turned upside down. It did not have a roll cage. Its motor was still running. The weight of the engine block lay across him. The steering wheel pinned his chest to the ground. According to specs listed on TractorData.com, a fully fueled 1949 Ferguson TO-20 weighs approximately 1.4 tons.
ON THE CUSP of battle, members of the Viking warrior cult known as the berserkers stripped down naked. They also chewed on the rims of their iron shields, foamed at the mouth and howled like beasts. They were, now, berserk. Then they hacked their way through opposing armies, killing until there was no one left to kill. For as long as the frenzy lasted, they were "not of human nature," in the words of one Icelandic saga; they were immune to both "fire and iron." The state they entered had a name. It was called berserkergang, and when it finally wore off, the warriors would collapse in total fatigue and sleep for days. (If you wanted to kill a berserker, that, apparently, was the time to do it.)
Not only in war could they summon berserkergang. One evening in the Norse town of Borg, a berserker hero named Skallagrim was playing a friendly "ball-game" -- the sagas give few details about the nature of this sport -- against a team composed of his son and his son's friend, Thord. Frustrated that he was not winning, Skallagrim suddenly went berserk. Whether he also went on to win the match, the saga doesn't say, but he did kill Thord by lifting him in the air and smashing him on the ground, and he would have killed his own son if a bystander hadn't snapped him out of his frenzy.
No one knows if, or to what extent, the berserkers actually existed. Some scholars believe they're rooted in fact. Others assert they're simply figures of legend. But they are part of a deep tradition. The mythologies of countless cultures include stories of altered psychophysiological states in which superhuman deeds become available to the select. Like the related search for fountains of youth, humans have for eons sought the keys that might unlock access to this mysterious matrix of mind and body.
There is anecdotal evidence that humans carry unfathomed reserves of strength. Stories abound of those -- often mothers -- who lift burning cars off trapped children. It raises the question: What would we be capable of if we could access it all?
And so the quest to find the maximal limit of human physical performance has persisted -- in the military, in sports, in science and in pseudoscience. And it has taken many, often quixotic, forms.
The CIA's lunatic studies to create superwarriors were part of the search. Ditto athletes who dose with PEDs. But the quest began long before that.
In 1747, in his lab in Lake Geneva, Swiss scientist Jean Jallabert sent bolts of electricity through the arm muscles of a patient who'd been paralyzed for 15 years. The muscles moved -- violently, strongly -- and the patient, Jallabert reported, eventually recovered the use of his arm. All over Europe, scientists were suddenly conducting batteries of such experiments, electrically stimulating muscles in animals and humans both dead and alive. Especially dead. There was a craze, a fad, of corpse animation, scientists inducing cadavers to sit bolt upright on stages in theaters packed to the rafters with thrilled, gasping audiences -- leading to breakthroughs in our understanding of human neuromuscular mechanics.
Jokichi Takamine, a Japanese chemist and inventor -- the scion of an ancient samurai family -- was among the first to isolate adrenaline, squeezing it from the glands of sheep and oxen, in 1900. His patents on the technique made him as rich as a robber baron. At Harvard, some 20 years later, the scientist Walter Cannon surgically altered the nervous systems of lab cats and dogs, stressed them out, and was thus able to discern that a blast of adrenal hormones in moments of emergency taps into hidden "reservoirs of power" and induces a "violent display of energy." For this crisis response, he coined the phrase "fight or flight."
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union poured money into finding the maximal limits of athletic performance. From the sport-research labs of Moscow came some of the first performance-enhancing drugs. From the same institutions came strength-training techniques still in currency today.
Vladimir Zatsiorsky was a champion competitive Russian acrobat. But while earning a doctorate in biomechanics from the renowned Central Institute of Physical Culture -- where his roommate was powerlifter Viktor Bushuev, future gold medalist at the 1960 Olympics in Rome -- Zatsiorsky found himself hanging around a group of Soviet muscle heads. "They respected one quality in people: strength."
Zatsiorsky went on to become chair of the biomechanics department at the Central Institute, where he would lead the Soviet Union's research into maximal strength. Among other things, he wrote that most people are able to access only 65 percent of their total theoretical muscle potential, while the best weightlifters can approach about 95 percent. He also observed something strange about heart rates. "If you test marathon runners, their highest [heart] rates will be somewhere close to finish line." But the elite Soviet weightlifters Zatsiorsky studied achieved maximal heart rates, in excess of 180 beats per minute, before performing any physical act. They knew how to "bring themselves to this condition, the huge emotional excitement. They don't do anything, no running around. They're just preparing mentally in these extreme ways."
In 1990, Zatsiorsky came to the U.S. and stayed, teaching for 25 years at Penn State. He's now 87 years old and retired in California. His treatise Science and Practice of Strength Training, he said, will soon go into its third edition. Like all the other editions, it will contain a photograph of Zatsiorsky from way back in his Soviet acrobat days. "You will see I have good six-pack."
But one thing Zatsiorsky's work does not contain? The secret to harnessing the outermost reaches of human strength.
THE FIRST THING Hannah Smith thought to do was dig. Just the day before, her father had tilled this patch of garden in preparation for planting. The ground, in other words, was soft. Hannah -- all 5 feet, 3 inches and 125 pounds of her -- dropped to her knees beside him and clawed at the earth with her bare hands, screaming at her sister to do the same. Hannah clawed so frantically that only later did she notice that she'd torn some of her fingernails off and that her fingers were covered in blood. "There was no pain," she says.
When she realized that digging wouldn't work, she stood up and looked around. Leaning against the nearby shed were a bunch of two-by-sixes. She took one of them, wedged it under one of the front tires nearest her father's chest and, using two cinder blocks as a fulcrum, tried to lever the tractor off him. The wood bowed under the strain but did not budge the Ferguson. She tossed the lumber aside.
Her father, meanwhile, was struggling to breathe; at one point she thought he'd lost consciousness. Hannah took out her cellphone and dialed 911. "But we're out in the middle of nowhere and it's a 30-minute drive just into town. I knew we didn't have time to wait."
SINCE AUGUST 2006, a term called "hysterical strength" has enjoyed its own Wikipedia entry; its etymology is unclear. The entry, regardless, contains a list of 10 incidents, anecdotal evidence of the phenomenon the term is supposed to describe.
In an Inuit community in northernmost Quebec, near the Arctic Circle, a woman sprints and "tackles" and fights off a polar bear that is predatorily eyeing her 7-year-old son and a friend as the boys, unaware, play hockey, reported the Nunatsiaq News in February 2006.
One night in a parking lot in Tampa in 2011, Danous Estenor, then a 295-pound lineman at the University of South Florida, sees a woman and two men trying and failing to lift a 1990 Cadillac Seville off another person stuck underneath. Estenor takes action. "When I first tried, it didn't budge," he later told a reporter with the St. Petersburg Times. "I backed up. I don't know. But I felt this energy come, and I lifted it."
A year later, in Glen Allen, Virginia, a man is working underneath his BMW in his garage when the jack fails and the car crashes down. His 22-year-old daughter, Lauren Kornacki, home from college, walks into the garage, sees this and takes hold of the car's undercarriage. Like Estenor, she at first fails to lift it. Frustrated, she begins throwing her shoulder against the machine and screaming with such wild abandon that, she says, her little sister, standing nearby, "has a little bit of PTSD from it." The next thing Kornacki recalls is being on top of her father, administering CPR.
E. PAUL ZEHR, a neuroscientist at the University of Victoria, in British Columbia, is something of the go-to expert on the physiology of maximum human physical performance. "What we think are human limits," he says, "are, in fact, just soft barriers." He is familiar with the phenomenon termed hysterical strength, but, he says, "It's not an area that gets research attention." Why? Designing experiments to study it in human beings in the lab would be difficult to achieve, he explains, without also violating the norms of modern scientific ethics.
But those codes weren't always in place. Consider 1961, in Chicago, where a visiting professor of physiology from the University of Tokyo named Michio Ikai teamed up with Arthur H. Steinhaus, an American physiologist and fitness expert with a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, to run some experiments. They recruited a group of 25 people, hooked them up to a device to measure "maximal efforts to flex the forearm" by pulling on a cable, and asked their subjects to flex as hard as they could; then they walked behind their subjects and, without warning, fired a gun -- a starter's gun! -- next to the subjects' ears. Pow! They asked them to pull the device again. When scared, the subjects overall were 7.4 percent stronger.
That wasn't all. Ikai and Steinhaus also hypnotized their subjects, assuring them in pacific tones that they were really, really strong. One, two, three,flex: 26.5 percent stronger. Then they handed their subjects Dixie cups with pills inside them -- 30 milligrams of amphetamine sulfate, better known on the street as speed. Swallow, wait for it, woo! Flex: 13.5 percent stronger. Then they got their subjects drunk, or at least buzzed, on grain alcohol. Flex: no improvement. Then they took a big syringe and injected their subjects "intramuscularly" with half a milliliter of adrenaline. How did this make their subjects feel? Who knows? Those details went unrecorded. But the flex numbers were, and the results were surprising: A literal shot of adrenaline produced a statistically insignificant rise in muscle strength.
What did it all add up to? Ikai and Steinhaus thought their findings showed that "psychologic rather than physiologic factors determine the limits of performance." Which is akin to saying they had no idea. Chalking something up to "psychologic" factors is, in science, the equivalent of a shrug.
HANNAH SMITH TOOK hold of one of the small front tires, wrapping her arms around it. Her sister, Haylee, did the same with the other. Then they counted -- one, two, three -- straining to raise the tractor into the air until it felt like the capillaries in the sclera of their eyes had burst. The red Ferguson didn't budge. Their father wheezed, losing air. They tried again, urgent, desperate.
Early spring in Oregon's Willamette Valley can be balmy and fragrant, and so it was on this day. Birds sang, indifferent to the crisis. Sweat ran down from Hannah's face and forehead. She felt lightheaded. Behind her forehead, deep in her temporal lobe, twin nut-sized neuron clusters had by this point shot an electric signal over to her hypothalamus, another neuron cluster, which in turn had activated the adjacent pituitary gland, whose function it is to broadcast a portfolio of hormonal messengers throughout the body's various systems. Hormones triggering hormones, an endocrine cascade. The pituitary signals would almost instantly have reached two yellow blobs of tissue perched atop each of her kidneys like mushroom caps: the adrenal glands. These would then have brewed and spewed more epinephrine and norepinephrine, crucial chemicals and neurotransmitters, than almost assuredly they'd ever produced in Hannah's young life to date.
Among other things, the epinephrine would have flooded her liver, then bound chemically with cells there to help form glucose -- giving her a burst of energy, the stressor equivalent of a sugar high.
Coursing through her bloodstream, the epinephrine would have entered her heart, found the pacemaker cells there and emboldened them to make that muscle beat harder, faster, stronger -- a myocardial turbocharge for the whole of her anatomy.
Hannah and Haylee lifted again ... and this time the tractor moved. It moved maybe an inch in the air and an inch laterally, but it moved. Then they did it again. And again. Up and down, up and down. They were oonching the Ferguson's front end across their father's chest.
IN THE EARLY 1960s, when Jan Todd was a 9-year-old girl growing up in Nova Scotia, she heard a story. A bad accident had left a child trapped underneath a car. The child's mother, apparently unharmed in the crash, had lifted the car and saved her child. The story fired young Jan's imagination. She determined that when she grew up, she too would be strong like this woman who'd performed this heroic feat. And so when she got older she began lifting weights. This was in the early 1970s: not an era when the gyms of America were known for their gender diversity. By the time she was 25, she could dead-lift almost 450 pounds and was profiled in Sports Illustrated as "the world's strongest woman." She eventually broke more than 60 world records.
"The trick of competitive lifting is: Your mind isn't part of the process. You want to be on some strange autopilot," Todd says. "You want to be almost blacked out. On the other hand, if you want to lift something really large, it's sort of like being a Viking berserker. He goes into battle and is some other person during that period of time."
To entertain friends, Todd would bend down and grab hold of the undercarriage of her Ford Fiesta. As she rose into a standing position, up would climb that side of the car.
Today Todd is a historian of physical culture at the University of Texas at Austin. When asked about the term "hysterical strength," she says she's never heard that locution before. But she does note that the word "hysterical" comes from the Greek for "womb" and emerged out of a kind of fearful, premodern gynecologic pseudoscience. "There was this concern that your uterus could travel, that it could move upward." It was believed that this propensity made women physically and mentally frail. In his 1615 anatomical tome Mikrokosmographia, a Description of the Body of Man, Helkiah Crooke, the king's physician, wrote of the "hysterical women ... such as are in fits of the mother." Hysterical came to mean a kind of female madness tied to a woman's very anatomy, and "hysterical strength" came to refer to the episodes of physical power that would supposedly come over women afflicted with it. Over time those gendered meanings faded but were never fully erased. Victorian novels are full of men and women -- but mostly women -- who fall into spells of mania, rage and "hysterical strength." The term even found its way into the science fiction of the Cold War, with characters capable of harnessing it at will, weaponizing it. In Joanna Russ' 1975 feminist classic, The Female Man, one of the heroines, an assassin and man hunter living in a dystopian world, does just that: "The room is beginning to sway with the adrenaline I can pump into my bloodstream when I choose; this is called voluntary hysterical strength and it is very, very useful, yes indeed."
According to Todd, it used to be axiomatic that "women could be no stronger than two-thirds of a man. But that was an era when no woman lifted weights." A strength gap still exists, but one woman, a powerlifter, recently squatted 800 pounds, which would've set the men's world record a few generations ago. "At every Olympic Games," Todd says, "it seems like there's always a trainer who will come out and say: 'We're getting close to the limit of human performance; there won't be much record breaking in the future.' But pretty much everything gets broken."
EACH TIME THE Smith sisters lifted the tractor off their father's chest, Hannah could hear him wildly gasping for air. And each time they set it back down they could hear its weight squeeze the air out. Hannah recalls being "super frustrated" by their slow pace, by their failure to remove the machine in one swoop. "I wanted to move it faster," she says. "I wanted to get it up and off of him." She recalls that frustration welling up inside her, fueling bursts of energy, what she calls the "adrenaline pumping."
The girls bent down and hugged the tires and lifted again. It was a kind of positive feedback loop. Feelings of frustration causing energy bursts causing little lifts, which caused more frustration and more energy bursts ... until finally, the tractor came off their father's chest. The girls had moved it about 3 feet. He could finally breathe. His life was no longer in danger. When he was ultimately freed, Jeff stood up and looked at his daughters. "When your mom calls," he said, "don't tell her anything."
Jeff Smith suffered only minor injuries, a broken wrist chief among them. As for Hannah, she collapsed that night in total fatigue. "I did not feel any pain until the next day." She basically couldn't move. She'd strained every muscle in her body from the neck down. She was bedridden for two weeks and never played competitive basketball again.
IN ICELAND, ON a farm in the village of Husafell, a boulder called the Kvíahellan, or the Husafell Stone, has beckoned strongmen for more than 200 years. It is one of the world's most famous tests of strength. These often take the form of boulders, often called "lifting stones" or "strength stones" or, sometimes, "manhood stones." The Husafell Stone reportedly weighs 409 pounds. Legions of confident, burly men have grunted over it and, hours later, dejected, have left it where it lay. No woman had ever gotten it off the ground. Few, if any, had ever tried.
In April, Liefia Ingalls arrived in Husafell from her home in Orange County, California. She is not only a professional competitive strongwoman but a trainer of professional competitive strong people. Just a month before traveling to Iceland, she'd set the world record on monster-dumbbell press at The Arnold, Schwarzenegger's annual extravaganza of strength, for the second time. She'd been planning the Iceland trip for a year with her powerlifting friend Sandra Bradley. "The Husafell is sort of regarded as the archetype of strength," Ingalls says, "and, specifically, male strength."
In some ways, Ingalls says, she prefers stone lifting to other, more technical, strength challenges. She has called herself "overanalytical" and "a highly anxious kind of person." "I'm more of a stoic lifter, a thinking lifter," she says. "But when it comes time to lift stones, that's when I need to tap into all of my energy and all of my power and just be explosive and violent and go. You're talking about maximal capacity. It's just grit. It's just pain tolerance. There's something fatalistic about pushing yourself to the extreme. In that moment, there's nothing else you can do. You can't make a different choice. You can't go back in time and train differently. It's like freedom from analysis. All the thinking goes away. All the worrying goes away. All that matters is that one simple task. Pick up the thing."
The heaviest stone she'd lifted previously was a 340-pound "atlas stone" -- a rock cut into a perfect sphere. The Husafell Stone is shaped like a wedge. It's also dense and smooth and thus difficult to grab and difficult to balance. She wore no gloves. In jeans, a fleece and a green knit cap over shoulder-length hair dyed a shocking pink, she paced around the stone, looking at it, thinking. She squatted down and embraced it. She tried once and failed. She tried again and dropped it. On the third try, she rolled the thing into her lap, stood up ... and walked with it for 30 feet. She felt pride but at the same time frustration. She hadn't carried the stone far enough. "I didn't make it all the way around the pen," she says, which is the traditional Husafell task. "That's going to have to be for later."
Later that day, her friend Sandra also lifted the stone.
As Ingalls learned on this trip, a little-known legend lies behind the Husafell Stone and its origins as a test of strength. The stone sits in a sheep pen adjacent to a 12th-century church. The pastor of this church 200 years ago was also a sheep farmer. He had three sons and four daughters and employed them all on his farm. But he paid his daughters less than his sons. One day, one of the girls challenged this arrangement, agitating for equal wages. Her father replied with a challenge of his own. The wedge-shaped boulder wasn't just a random slab sitting in the yard. The pastor and his sons, all brawny, used it as the pen's gate. When the herd went out to graze, someone lifted the rock out of the way. When the animals came back, back went the 409-pound door. Inefficient, yes, but a good workout. If the daughter could lift the stone and put it back in its place in the gate, well, then she could receive the same wages as her brothers. The father's challenge: Pick up this rock.
Liefia Ingalls finishes the story: "And so she did."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Clinical Trials Of Mesoblast’s Stem Cell Treatment For COVID-19 Set To Begin Soon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Melbourne-based biotech company Mesoblast announced earlier this week that it’s begun enrolling up to 300 patients for a randomized, controlled study of its stem cell therapy remestemcel-L in the treatment of COVID-19 patients experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Over 20 hospitals will participate in the study, which is anticipated to last 3-4 months.
The announcement came about a week after the company reported that treatment with remestemcel-L in a group of 12 COVID-19 patients with ARDS at Mt. Sinai hospital in New York had a survival rate of 83%. The purpose of the randomized, controlled clinical trial is to test that survival rate on a larger scale. 
“We were very pleased with preliminary data demonstrating the cells seem to have benefitted some of these patients,” says CEO Silviu Itescu. “If the cells work in COVID-19 ARDS, we’re in a position to provide products to as many patients as possible.” 
For coronavirus patients, ARDS is one of the deadliest complications of the disease, and often ends up requiring the use of ventilators in order to ensure they’re getting sufficient oxygen. It’s caused by what’s known as a “cytokine storm” - an overreaction of the immune system in which the body ends up damaging the lungs in an attempt to destroy the coronavirus and the lung cells that it has infected. 
“The cytokines these cells make destroy lung tissue,” says Itescu. “It’s a trade-off being trying to get rid of the virus and trying to limit destruction to your own lung tissue.”
According to the CDC, between 20-42% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop ARDS, with as many as 85% of patients admitted to intensive care having this complication. Among those ICU patients who develop ARDS, over 40% die (some studies show that number as high as 72%) and those who survive spend an average of 10-13 days in the hospital. 
Mesoblast’s remestemcel-L treatment is derived from allogenic mesenchymal stem cells, which when infused into the body can slow down an immune response and prevent the body from damaging itself. Its technology originally spun out of a research collaboration between Columbia University and Australian scientists, leading to the founding of the company in 2004. 
One of the diseases the company has been working to treat is graft-vs-host disease, a condition that arises in patients who receive bone marrow transplants. In that disease, the donated bone marrow begins to see its new host as “foreign” and directs the immune system to attack it in a manner similar to that of the cytokine storm seen in ARDS. 
The company is one of several biotech firms aiming to use mesenchymal stem cells as a potential COVID-19 treatment. Cleveland-based Athersys, which is working on stem cell therapies for strokes, heart disease and other conditions, is also expected to begin clinical trials soon. Haifa, Israel-based Pluristem, which is developing stem cell treatments as well, secured 50 million Euro (about $55.4 million) in financing this week from the European Investment Bank to support its COVID-19 trials.
So far, says Itescu, Mesoblast’s treatment has been tested in clinical trials in over 1,100 graft-vs-host patients. On April 1, the FDA accepted a priority review filing for use of the treatment against graft-vs-host disease. On April 6, the FDA gave clearance for an investigational new drug application for remestemcel-L in COVID-19 patients, which paved the way for this clinical trial.   
Using Mesoblast’s treatment for coronavirus patients with ARDS “has a rationale behind it” says Dr. Wayne Marasco, who’s studied a number of coronavirus diseases and is currently researching potential antibody treatments for COVID-19. “That would be in line with how it works with graft-versus-host disease.”
Itesecu says that his company is focused on the next phase of its clinical research in the midst of this pandemic, and hopes it proves to be part of a number of effective therapies against the disease. 
“We’re going to do our best to provide a solution to those patients in greatest need: those who are in intensive care on ventilators, where I think a safe and effective way to reduce severe inflammation is needed,” says Itescu. “We hope that what we’re doing is complementary to what folks who are developing vaccines and antivirals are doing.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Assess Talent And Conduct Annual Reviews During COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Due to COVID-19, employers may be shying away from reviewing employee performance, preferring to deliver feedback in person as opposed to over the phone or in a virtual video conference. But employees are gauging right now whether their manager and their employer are treating them with respect and care. They’re also making decisions now about whether they want to stay with that organization.
69% of employees say they would work harder if they felt their efforts were better recognized. Nearly one-quarter of employees that don’t feel recognized when they do great work have interviewed for a job in the last three months, compared to just 12% that do feel recognized. And recognition is the number one thing employees say their manager could give them to inspire them to produce great work.
With U.S. COVID-19 cases causing stay at home orders as early as mid-March, some employees haven’t received performance feedback for nearly two months. Alex Rizzuto, a talent management leader, believes now, more than ever, consistency in communication and strong leadership is critical. Rizzuto focuses on executive and leadership coaching to transform leaders by guiding them to define and achieve their development and career aspirations. She has led the global talent management and organization and performance functions at multi-billion-dollar, multi-national organizations such as McCormick & Company, Dentsply Sirona, and Oshkosh Corporation. Rizzuto explains:
“Not only do you need to share with your team what is changing, as quickly as possible, but you also need to keep communicating what is NOT changing. This will help dispel any rumors of what might be changing and focus your team on what is important. The traits that strong leaders are demonstrating now – agility; resilience; ability to lead in ambiguity; and inclusion and engagement - will continue to be traits for successful leaders in the future.”
Rizzuto shares three ways employers can continue to evaluate talent so employees can continue to receive constructive feedback during the stay at home orders:
Rizzuto describes, “in any time of disruption, organizations, and teams naturally experience a decline in productivity. While external factors can’t be controlled, internal factors- such as how individuals, team members, and the workload- can be controlled.” For female leaders within an organization, the ambiguity of the pandemic is unsettling. Ambiguity decreases the opportunity to control and perfect. But right now, managers should focus on strengthening other traits team members can deliver in this disruptive time (such as encouraging creativity and learning). It can help individuals contribute new solutions that might become part of future work methods.
“As we lose the work world we knew, it’s natural to feel anger, fear, anxiety, loss. We are concerned about letting go of the known and moving into doing things outside our current comfort zone. Some employees will spend a great deal of time in this phase; others will just want to move quickly to the ‘what next.’ You’re probably not a certified therapist, but you are a leader. It’s essential to listen to what your employees are saying informally (such as through their tone of voice, body language, and casual conversation at the start of calls). The best managers will recognize and empathize where each employee is and acknowledge the grief they’re experiencing in losing their ‘old normal.’ Most importantly, they won’t chastise employees for their grief, but coach them so that business goals can be accomplished and productivity can get back to an appropriate level.”
“If it’s been a while since you evaluated your talent, either through a self-assessment or 360° feedback assessment, consider a formal refresh in the coming weeks,” Rizzuto encourages. “Consider your style and approach with your team. You cannot pay attention and manage your team’s emotions and uncertainty if you are not clear on where you are yourself. Are you managing your stress, your workload, setting realistic expectations of what you can get done? When you show up for your team or individual employees, are you prepared – do you know what information you need to share? Are you communicating priorities? What is your tone, method, etc.? What questions do you anticipate? How will you answer what you don’t know? Get feedback from your team on the new methods and practices – what’s working and what needs to be adjusted.”
Rizzuto also provides additional ways to assess talent and conduct annual reviews during COVID-19 stay at home orders, including varying communication methods, ensuring two-way communication, checking for understanding, and telling the truth. Additionally, she encourages documenting approaches to the crisis so that the entire team can address challenges, opportunities, and debrief on lessons learned post-pandemic.
Employees are turning to their leaders and their organizations for stability in our uncertain world of divisiveness and environmental unrest. Some leaders and organizations will emerge more successfully than others, having better prepared and honed new leadership skills in existing talent.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Costa Rican And His Robots Could Close California’s Coronavirus Testing Gap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a robot-filled lab in California, a team including a scientist from Costa Rica are working out how to use automation to do Coronavirus testing on a massive scale – a technology US states will need if they are going to ‘reopen’ safely.
Costa-Rican scientist Enrique Lin Shiao arrived last year in the Doudna Lab, famous for being world-leaders in CRISPR/Cas-9 technology, to work as a post-doctoral researcher focusing developing novel methods to improve targeted substitutions and insertions of DNA into the genome.
But, Lin Shiao says, by early March 2020, the lab was closed, with no idea of when he would be able to start his research again.
“The next day, I started volunteering in setting up a SARS-Cov-2 diagnostics facility here at the Innovative Genomics Institute at UC Berkeley,” he said, “I have been co-leading the technical team together with another postdoc from the Doudna lab, Jennifer Hamilton.”
Lin Shiao says they have been setting up the testing pipeline, making sure it is gives consistent, accurate results and they are already processing around 200 samples a day, with numbers increasing daily.
“The automation is almost ready, after which we’ll be able to process over 1000 samples daily,” he said.
By adapting techniques and machines used in other kinds of genetic testing, the team hopes to develop an FDA-compliant testing facility that will cut down on human error and time, while allowing a massive number of tests.
For now, Lin Shiao samples are coming mainly from Berkeley and Oakland in the Bay Area.
“We are testing students and staff from campus and also now have extended to first responders, fire fighters and the homeless population in the area,” he said.
Lin Shiao says initial funding for the work was provided by IGI Founders Fund, Dr. Anders Naar, Rick and Rachel Klausner, and the Shurl and Kay Curci Foundation.
In addition to his day job, Lin Shiao also helps put together a podcast focused on researchers from Latin America.
“I started the podcast Caminos en Ciencia together with my colleague Kevin Alicea Torres in 2017, “ he said, “at that time the rhetoric against Latin American immigrants in the USA was very negative and we wanted to re-frame the narrative by highlighting the awesome work many people from the region were doing here.”
Lin Shiao says they ask their interviewees to not only talk about their successes , but also share with the listeners what unique challenges and lessons they’ve encountered, so others can more easily imagine themselves in their positions and also better understand how to get there.
In his own case, Lin Shiao says his interest in DNA was sparked at 8-years-old, when Dolly the sheep became the first cloned mammal. “I wanted to pursue a career where I could answer questions and discover new things,” he said.
“I was very fortunate to grow up in Costa Rica at a time when Costa Rican-American astronaut Dr. Franklin Chan-Diaz was shown on TV and on billboards all across the country floating in space and tinkering with space ships,” Lin Shiao said, “his example made me any many other Costa Ricans believe that we could reach for the stars and that even our wildest dreams could become true.”
Costa Rica has been one of more proactive countries in Latin America.
As of the end of April, Costa Rica only had 390 active cases and 6 deaths, in stark contrast to over 5000 active cases and 178 deaths in neighboring Panama – or the nearly 6000 confirmed deaths in Brazil.
In addition, the Costa Rican government announced in late April the country would be developing their own COVID-19 test kits to eliminate dependence on the international market.
Lin Shiao is far from only US-based researcher from the global south using their talents for the great good.
Libyan doctor-turned-tech-CEO Mohamed Aburawi helped develop a telehealth platform so doctors who had left their countries could treat patients back home– now it’s being used to help triage cases in Libya’s fight against COVID-19.

Thanks to an agreement with the Libyan health authorities, Speetar, a telehealth startup Aburawu helped found will be now be the main platform between the government and citizens in regards to COVID-19. 
Another example is Kashmir-born Junaid Nabi, a public health researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who is using big data and machine learning to help detect useful patterns in the tsunami of public health data generated world-wide by the COVID-19 crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Temple Grandin: Big Meat Supply Chains Are Fragile</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">About five years ago, I was giving a lecture in my livestock handling class at Colorado State University about animal welfare, and when I turned to write on the whiteboard, I had a light bulb moment. I immediately was triggered to recall a moment during the floods of 2013 when I was driving home to Fort Collins from the Denver airport. Interstate 25 was flooded so I first drove east to get around it. Then I drove north, and everywhere I went, I found roads impassable. Finally, I got out past Greeley, the agribusiness hub where JBS’s American division is currently headquartered, and went around the huge Kuner feedlot, which at the time was owned by JBS. The cattle were all dry but the flooding lapped around the edge of the feedlot. The water stayed out because JBS had done an excellent job of rebuilding it. And it was there that I finally found a bridge that was dry. It was only a foot out of the water and closed an hour later.
My students are often concerned that large corporations are bad, but my answer has always been badly managed is bad. I was thinking about that when this new epiphany struck me. Big is not bad, it is fragile. 
That’s important now more than ever, because everything is bigger. When I first started my career as a designer of cattle handling systems in the early 1970s, the meat supply chain was more diversified with many smaller packing plants. In the city of Denver, there were several slaughterhouses and Los Angeles even had a whole row of companies on a single street. Each one of these plants processed 500 to 1,000 cattle per day.
But almost all of these smaller, independent plants have now closed. What drove these packers out of business was the transformation of the entire industry in the 1980s from selling retailers carcasses to packing and shipping meat in boxes. Most of these independents were located in major cities. There was no room to build the additions required for all the extra cutting and they couldn’t afford to build new plants outside the city. It ushered in an era of closures and acquisitions. And today the big companies are running plants that are really massive: a single plant may process 2,000 to 6,000 cattle per day if it runs two shifts. A large, double-shifted pork plant may process 20,000 pigs per day.
Because today’s system is so concentrated - and slaughter and processing is done in fewer, larger plants - the pandemic we’re facing has overwhelmed this supply chain. There is an old saying “do not put all of your eggs in one basket.” When a supply chain becomes more concentrated, there is greater loss of supply when a single plant is closed. A Tyson beef plant in Kansas closed last year due to a fire, and it did cause some production disruptions, but other plants ran Saturday shifts to compensate. The supply chain was able to compensate for the temporary closure of a single large plant.
But without sufficient slaughterhouse space to process all the pigs and chickens that are growing today, farmers have been forced to euthanize poultry and pigs. This is both a tragic waste of food and if euthanasia is done poorly there could be great animal welfare problems, and it can be really traumatic for the farm workers who have to do this.
A disruption or plant shutdown at any point along the chain is more likely to cause shortages that consumers can eventually see. Meat is not the only industry with a concentrated supply chain. Other food processors have shut down recently. And the pharmaceutical industry’s supply chain for common generic drugs may be even more concentrated. The raw materials are made in China and the pills are manufactured in India. There is a major difference between pigs and raw materials for manufacturing generic medicines. The system can handle a short disruption of several months because a supply of chemicals can be stored. Pigs cannot be stored because their numbers would quickly overcrowd the buildings.
Big operations are extremely cost efficient. That’s why they’ve been built this way. The downside is the fragility of the supply chains, as Covid-19 proves. This pandemic is going to be a wakeup call and I expect many to become a lot more interested in more distributed local supply chains. Local production provides the opposite: it will always be more expensive because fixed costs such as labor, electricity, and water to process each pig will be higher. But a local supply chain is less prone to disruption. It also has a lower dependence on long distance trucking. During the floods in Colorado, semi-trucks had a difficult time re-supplying many stores.
The bottom line is, there will always be a tradeoff. Big suppliers are low cost, efficient and fragile. More numerous local producers are more expensive, but the entire supply is more robust. It will be less prone to disruption from floods, fires, electric power failures, storms or diseases like coronavirus or others in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can COVID-19 Coronavirus Live In Water? What About Drinking Water And Swimming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like the COVID-19 coronavirus may be able to live in water for a few days, potentially even a few weeks. There is a big but, though. And you’ll like this big but. Just because a virus can survive in water doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s present in large enough concentrations to infect you.
Is this situation a bit like a teenager pointing out a few hairs on his face and then claiming that it’s a beard? There actually has to be enough hairs to make it a beard. When you can still count the number of hairs, it’s not a beard, unless, of course, the hairs are really, really long and very, very curly.
Similarly, consider what is known about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in water. Indeed studies have suggested that the SARS-CoV2 could actually hang out in the wet stuff for a little while. For example, a study published in the journal Water Research in 2009 found that two viruses that have similarities to the original SARS virus, the transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV) viruses, could survive up to days and even weeks in water. The University of North Carolina team (LisaCasanova, William A.Rutal, David J.Weber, and Mark D.Sobsey) that conducted the study concluded that “coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated.”
Then there was the poopy study described by a paper posted April 17 on medRxiv. For this study, the team sampled sewage (you know, the watery stuff in sewers) in the greater Paris, France, area for over a month. They found that concentrations of the SARS-CoV2 correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in the region over time. In other words, when COVID-19 cases were rising, so did the concentrations of the SARS-CoV2 in the sewage. This seems like one more reason why splashing sewage or taking a deep breath near sewage is probably not a great idea.
Take this second study with a grain of sewage though. It has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. That means real scientific experts haven’t had a chance to review the study for quality or accuracy. Telling people that you’ve posted something on medRxiv can be a bit like telling people that you’ve auditioned for America’s Got Talent. There’s no guarantee that this study will ever make it close to the final stage of getting published in a reputable peer-reviewed scientific journal.
Regardless, the results from both studies do suggest that the virus can survive for a little while in water, which initially may cause you to wet yourself. Before you do, here’s the big but again. Neither study showed that you can actually get infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus from water under the conditions that you’d normally be exposed to water. That means via drinking (assuming that you aren’t drinking sewage or some other type of dirty water), showering, or swimming (assuming that you don’t swim in sewage.)
In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 coronavirus hasn’t even been found in drinking water. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said that “the risk to water supplies is low. Americans can continue to use and drink water from their tap as usual.” Such a virus would have to get through all of the filtration and water treatments that drinking water typically goes through, and that can be harder than getting on to the red carpet at the Oscars.
Moreover, the great thing about water is that it’s water. It tends to dilute things. Even if the COVID-19 coronavirus were to somehow make the epic journey of getting into your drinking water, it may not be at high enough concentrations to be of risk to you. This goes back to the whole beard thing. Every virus has a minimum infectious dose, the amount of virus that needs to be present to cause illness. Although it’s not completely clear yet what the minimum infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 may be, dilution makes it less likely that what reaches you can surpass this threshold.
The same probably goes for water in pools and hot tubs. The CDC indicates that “there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas.” For these things, not only would the water dilute the virus, but also disinfection with chlorine and bromine would likely inactivate the virus.
If you are actually thinking of swimming or soaking in a pool or tub that is not properly chlorinated or bromated, don’t. Just don’t. There’s a whole lot of other nasty, disease-causing microbes that could then be swimming or soaking along with you. The poop about many swimming pools and hot tubs is that’s what people may do in them. As I have described previously for Forbes, 24% of respondents to the 2019 Healthy Pools survey indicated that they would enter a swimming pool "within one hour of having diarrhea." Yes, diarrhea. Yes, within one hour of having it. And those are just the people who admitted to doing this. Still don’t want to social distance from others?
As for the ocean, it is pretty big. Then there’s the motion of the ocean, so to speak. Both of these aspects can dilute and separate viruses fairly quickly. The salt in the water may decrease the survival of the virus as well.
This doesn’t mean that you should rush to the beach to do what’s seen in this Reuters video:
Sun of a beach. Does this look like social distancing to you? Is everyone in the video staying six feet away from each other? Six feet apart means roughly one Denzel Washington apart, since Washington is about six feet tall. See any people less than one Denzel apart?
When it comes to the COVID-19 coronavirus, the riskiest thing at swimming pools, hot tubs, and oceans is not the water itself. No, it’s the coughing, sneezing, panting, face-rubbing, and diarrhea-ing things that are in or next to the water: people. It’s also the things that people touch frequently such as guard rails, chairs, towels, and thongs.
So, the key once again will be doing what you should be doing on land: practicing good social distancing, good hand hygiene, good disinfecting (of objects), and good avoid-touching-your-enormous face. And if you see any random objects such as a sign post, a statue, or a thong, don’t touch it if you don’t have to do so. You don’t know where it has been. Actually, in the case of a thong, you know exactly where it’s been. That’s the problem.
Also, wait until beaches, swimming pools, and other water areas are officially open before going to them. Yes, staying inside is not easy. Yes, there are only so many episodes of Breaking Bad that you can watch or mind games that you can play with your cat. But patience now will pay off later.
Once such places are officially open, it won’t be the time to release the kraken, so to speak. Sure you may have stored up all this energy, all those ingenious pick-up lines that probably won’t work anyway, and all the urges to do what you have done before while cooped up inside. But (there’s that word again), try to remember that the virus is still circulating. It will be some time before it is water under the bridge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lamprey Vs. Shark Seen Off Rhode Island In Rare Observation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When one sees a shark, they usually do not see a lamprey attached to said shark. But that’s exactly what scientist Joshua Moyer, PhD Candidate at the University of Massachusetts, and others saw. “Once I recognized that it was a lamprey on the shark, my next thoughts were a series of questions: 'How often do those species interact,' 'How far can a Blue Shark carry a lamprey,' and 'Don't lampreys have a tough time hanging on to a shark covered in placoid scales?' When I turned to the literature, there were no concrete answers to any of those questions,” said Moyer. “The goal of the note we wrote is to use our observation to raise awareness of these questions in the hopes that future research may provide some answers.”
Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) are Agnathans, or fish who lack a jaw. Although they are classified in the subphylum Vertebrata, they actually lack a vertebrae and their entire skeleton is made out of cartilage- similar to the shark this lamprey was attached to! Native to the Atlantic Ocean, these animals prefer shallow coastal areas, but can be found at depths between 3 – 15 feet (1- 4.5 meters). Commonly known for their smooth, cylindrical bodies, they are often confused for eels. But just because this animal lacks a jaw doesn’t mean it’s a meek little thing. Sea lampreys are the largest and most aggressive species of lamprey and can get up to 3 ft (1 m) in length as adults, weighing up to 5.5 lbs (2.5 kg).
This particular sea lamprey measured less than a foot long (0.24 m) and was attached to a blue shark (Prionace glauca) in pelagic waters off Rhode Island. Blue sharks are one of the most wide-ranging shark species, found from the tropics to cold temperate waters all around the world. They mainly dine on fish and cephalopods, reaching depths of 1,148 ft (350 m) to hunt for these delicacies. Blue sharks aren’t exactly small, growing to around 12.5 ft (3.8 m) in length, but the lamprey didn’t seem to take that into account as it latched on to this blue shark’s right clasper.
“Our observation was occasioned by happenstance. We were in the right place at the right time,” explained Moyer. “We had gone out that day to study the feeding performances of Blue Sharks with the Atlantic Shark Institute. Although sharks with lampreys on them are not unheard of, when a Blue Shark showed up carrying a lamprey it took us a moment to recognize what we saw. You expect to see copepods and other small ectoparasites but typically don't associate lampreys with large pelagic sharks.”
Sea lampreys live their adult life as parasitic organisms, and the specific behavioral patterns of this species is not well studied. Lamprey parasitism on sharks isn’t exactly new, as there have been previously published accounts, but they are quite rare. This observation, coupled with those that date back to 1993, suggests that when a sea lamprey does adhere to a shark, the cloaca and that surrounding region is a common point of attachment. Why? “This may be because the placoid scales of that region do not exhibit the same roughness as elsewhere on the body, as has been demonstrated in several shark species,” explains the article.
Like sharks, they have an uphill climb when it comes to earning our affection. Lampreys are often the stuff of nightmares for some people, with movies of these blood suckers with “razor sharp teeth” being made into horror movies (i.e. look up ‘Blood Lake: Attack of the Killer Lampreys’). Despite their unsavory looks, they are quite important in the ecosystems they inhabit. For example, their nests help create cleared habitat ideal for spawning fish like salmon and trout. Not to mention that larval lampreys, called ammocoetes, filter feed and improve their surrounding water quality similarly to mussels. Some lamprey species even have cultural value!
Still not a fan? Well, don’t forget- we are all descended from fish similar to lampreys.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Coronavirus Is Making Business More Human</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The personal veneer that proliferated in the pre-COVID business world has been washed away. Thanks to mandatory WFH and other major changes to how we live and work, we’re getting a much more realistic picture of our colleagues, employees and managers and we’re engaging with them on a deeper, more emotional level. And that’s a good thing. Being able to bring your true self to work is a key ingredient for happiness on the job, and effective personal branding is rooted in authenticity, not fake veneers.
Home Life Becomes Work Life
The combination of working from home while using video conference platforms like Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts, WebEx, etc. has created a unique opportunity to peer inside the lives of our co-workers. When you went to an office, your curated life was the only version of you on display. You would get up and put on your “work clothes” and the associated persona. And even though people see what we do in social media, that’s typically heavily filtered content—sharing the elements of our lives that we choose to make public. But having your video camera on while working at home provides a more revealing lens into your life.
Video conferencing use is up so significantly that the estimated net worth of Zoom founder Eric Yuan has increased by more than $4 billion since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Guardian. This huge uptick in video communications is giving us glimpses inside the living rooms of our colleagues. We’re seeing how they really live in those rooms. We’re being introduced to their partners, kids, and pets.
Video has been poised to become the most prominent form of communication for years. The only impediment has been people’s comfort with being on camera . . . but the coronavirus has blasted people far beyond their comfort zone. Combined with peer pressure—it seems that everyone has their camera on—being camera shy is no longer an option.
We see what people wear (and we have discussions about what they’re sporting from the waist down, which is likely to be sweatpants or pajama bottoms). Even Stephen Colbert showed us that he was in his underwear while doing one of his shows from home. And this reporter was caught with his pants down.
A Shared Existential Threat
The nature of the COVID-19 threat and the fear and uncertainty associated with it is making it easier, and almost necessary, for us to connect with our managers and colleagues about deeply human topics. In Psychology Today, Mark Bolino Ph.D.suggests that “managers be more transparent and discuss worst-case scenarios, to reduce stress along with other dysfunctional outcomes, like increased gossip and decreased commitment, which often occurs when employees are faced with ambiguous situations.” An ailing parent who is in a nursing home, a partner or relative who is a healthcare worker, people we know who “have it” and those who have succumbed to the virus—such grim topics are no longer off-limits. Pre-COVID, discussions around the office water cooler were more likely about whether you’re bingeing on Tiger King or Schitt’s Creek. Chit-chat been replaced by video calls that focus on far more personal, more visceral topics. Bolino adds, “Social distancing needs to be more about physical separation than social or psychological isolation as we deal with this pandemic.”
Flexing For People’s Lives
I was speaking with a client who told me that she is working whenever her 17-month-old son is sleeping, which includes daytime naps and evenings from 8 to midnight. This has replaced her every-day-in-the-office from 8:30 to 6 schedule that she had for five years. Before, going into your boss’s office to let her know that your work hours would be at the whim of your child’s nap schedule wasn’t likely. Today, accommodations for life situations are not only acceptable, they’re being encouraged. In an article in theconversation.com, Paula Caligiuri, a professor at Northeastern University and Helen De Cieri, a Professor in the Monash Business School in Australia, suggest that “employer flexibility must match specific employee needs. Companies should require managers to have open conversations with their employees about how and when work can be accomplished and offer a wider range of options for flexibility, such as more leeway when assignments need to be turned in or adjusting work hours per day to allow more time to care for children and others.”
It seems topics and situations that were taboo in the office have become common and necessary because of COVID-19. This has made us get in touch with our humanity and with the needs of the human beings with whom we work. We can’t shake hands right now (and that custom may go away permanently), but the human connection we’re experiencing is more powerful and will hopefully endure.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID19: A Stress Test For Couples</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Everything about this crisis is revelatory – for countries, companies and… couples. Countries are discovering whether their leaders care more about their power or their people. Companies are revealing the values they stand for and killing or strengthening their brands as a result. So too for couples. Some will emerge from this turbulence stronger and more united. Others will be adding to the growing number of COVID divorces.
It’s the ultimate bake off. Take your average couple, stick them in a smallish, lidded pot. Throw in equal measures of ambiguity, fear, boredom, and ambient anxiety. Add spice with kids (one to three works well). Additional heat comes from two jobs, two bosses and no home office or daycare. Or two layoffs, no money and no end in sight. Add in lashings of guilt from not being able to care for elderly parents, some possibly in high-risk care homes. Stir, then leave to marinate for a couple of months.
Exceptional circumstances don’t create entirely new relationships – they simply expose its usually invisible underbelly. This COVID crisis is like a ton of bricks suddenly fallen from the sky, smashing onto the foundations that couples have built – over the past few months or the past few decades. Like the three little pigs, couples are getting a report card from the wolf – did they build in sticks, straw, or stone? If there were cracks, they become more visible. If these aren’t addressed, plastered and filled, they morph into ever-deeper gullies, which end up ripping homes apart.
One of the things the stress test reveals is how genuinely gender balanced a couple is at its heart. That’s a polite way of saying it reveals the power dynamics in a relationship (so it’s not just true for opposite-sex couples). Power plays inside couples are a fascinating, if hard-to-measure, phenomenon. There is the obvious, physical sort of domination, that is being horrifically reported in countries around the globe, with escalating rates of domestic abuse.
But more commonly, there are the millions of minutes of what couples have or haven’t done together. To change metaphors, have they built roots, rituals and respect? Or seeded resentment, indifference or doubt. This Covid-spring, have the flowers in their garden blossomed, or are the weeds running amok?  Does one person’s opinion, preferences or career dominate? Has the crisis been an excuse to spread their dominion and further silence anyone else’s needs? Or, on the other hand, have you carefully used the crisis to consciously couple, with the expressly democratic objective of building a life of mutual enhancement – which integrates the little ones and the elders into the voting system? In these cases, the crisis becomes an exercise in cooperation and mutual support which nourishes everyone’s roots and responses for the decade to come.
I have been listening to both in my coaching Fridays. There are families discovering the delicious luxury of time together. Daily family meals. Quality time with children. Pulling the net closer in as the storm clouds gather. Contracting to establish schedules and rhythms that accommodate everyone’s needs. There are others where proximity is pushing all the buttons they haven’t yet taken time to explore. Low self- (and other-) awareness, combined with a dose of culturally reinforced self-centredness, is hard to overcome when crises come calling.
I once wrote that any ambitious human, but especially career-prioritising women, really only have two choices when it comes to their partners: a super-supportive spouse, or none at all. “Anything in between becomes a career and moral-sapping mess.” Never has this proved more true than in the current circumstances. If dual career couples haven’t found a way of re-designing life around their respective personal and professional obligations and expectations, they are likely planting seeds of discord deep into their relational DNA.
If men revert to traditional gender roles in pulling the blanket of money, work or pre-eminence over their heads, they are likely to lose more than they are yet measuring. The Economist warns of this, but seems to put women into the active tense, as though it were their choice, rather than their partner’s withdrawal from active duty: "Women are more likely to take care of home-schooling and entertainment of bored children, meaning their careers suffer more than men’s.”
This may not lead to immediate ruptures, although China is seeing a sudden, post-crisis spike. As I found researching my book on Late Love: Mating in Maturity, people don’t necessarily split quickly. They wait, often for many years, until they feel ready to move on. They wait for the kids to have grown, for their finances to steady, for their confidence to have been fired by the no-longer tenable. The fissures fester, confirmed with each repetitive turn of the sterile, hope-draining patterns. And yes, it’s mostly women who do the walking. Seventy percent of divorces are initiated by women – and that’s been true for the past 100 years.
Like the leadership of countries, the leadership in couples comes down to a simple question. Are you together because of love or fear? There is nothing more resilient in a crisis than the immunity built by love and strong relationships. But if the only reason you are together is because you fear the alternative more, you can probably hear the cracks deepen… So if things at home are tough right now, don’t just assume it’s a bad patch that will pass when the lockdowns lift. Lean into your couple as though your life depended on it. It does.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will There Be A Renaissance After The Coronavirus Crisis?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron was one of the first literary masterpieces of the Renaissance. It is set in a villa outside Florence, at the height of the Bubonic Plague. Seven women and three men flee the Plague, ensconce themselves in a villa and spend ten days flirting, philosophising and debating. I have no doubt that Netflix NFLX or other entertainment channel will copy the idea and send an ensemble of Hugh Grant, Gwyneth Paltrow, George Clooney, Mara Rooney and friends off to the Hamptons to repeat the experience.
Black Death ravaged Europe
If the Decameron were to be repeated, the guests in the villa might even ponder how the world has been changed by the coronavirus. The Black Death itself radically changed Europe, largely through the demographic effect that a 30% reduction in population had – in England nearly 40% of land changed hands, a shortage of labourers meant a rise in wages and innovation of farming methods and produce.
Rising wages for those who survived the Black Death altered the social mix (Walter Scheidel’s The Great Leveler is very good here) to the extent that the wealthy begun to dress more extravagantly in order to distinguish their social standing and in this were helped by regulation (i.e. England’s Sumptuory Laws 1363).
The Black Death altered the geopolitical map of Europe (similar, much earlier plagues like the Athens Plague and Antonine Plague had profound geopolitical effects), led to trade and banking revolutions and spurred the rise of cities like Madrid and Genoa, and the demise of others like Winchester.
Globalization ending
Back to the villa, where if our guests were discussing the post coronavirus world they might fall upon the following points. First, the coronavirus crisis has simply exacerbated the faultlines in a fracturing world – indebtedness is growing rapidly, the China-US diplomatic relationship deteriorates, and globalization is crashed.
Second, more optimistically and in the spirit of the Renaissance, the crisis will I hope bring a number of positive changes. One is the realisation of the correlation between climate damage and economic activity. Another is the sense that our cities are places to be lived in – there will be significant changes to the way cities use space, transport and commercial real estate.
Human Development
A more profound change will be a trend towards improving human development – in developed and developing countries. The components of human development - from life expectancy, to education and healthcare, to economic development – have come to the fore during the coronavirus crisis in the sense that countries with high levels of human development (Germany, New Zealand, Norway) have appeared to deal relatively better with the crisis than others, and the value of good, accessible healthcare systems has become abundantly clear. I might even stretch the point to say that well educated leaders, who take science seriously, have also done reasonably well.
The concept of human development however does not lend itself to political soundbites and as such is hard for politicians to communicate as a policy goal. Neither do initiatives that promote human development pay off in the short term – so politicians need to be around to gain credit for them (Russia is an interesting example where the HDI (Human Development Indicator produced by the World Bank) has been rising steadily). Hopefully, the coronavirus will change this and permit broader discussions on the need to focus government scorecards on human development centric scorecards. If this happens, we may see public goods like accessible education and healthcare become more valued in countries like the US and UK. In this light, there is an opportunity for politicians and those involved in the policy process to craft the idea of human development in a way that people understand and value, and to put it at the centre of political manifestos.
Unrest?
As a final point, when I think of our ten guests in the villa in the Hamptons, Agatha Christie’s book ‘And then there were none’ passes through my head. The idea of wealthy people secluding themselves in a villa to avoid a highly contagious disease is as unpopular today as it was in the 14th century. Again, as Walter Scheidel has pointed out, the Bubonic Plague was a leveller of inequality in the 14th century though amidst plenty of periods of unrest (La Jacquerie in France in 1358 and the Peasant’s Revolt in 1381 in England).
So far, the policy response to the economic fallout from the crisis has arguably boosted wealth inequality (notably in the USA). In the coming weeks the generous provision of liquidity by the Federal Reserve will give way to rising solvency/credits risk, and with it more redundancies unfortunately. As I’ve mentioned before in these pages, market volatility will give way to social and political volatility.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How climate change could make infectious diseases even more difficult to combat in the future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today's novel coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the globe.
The pandemic has rapidly uprooted life as we know it and left countries across the world scrambling to contain the outbreaks. In just a few short months, billions of people have become jobless, ill, or had their lives significantly disrupted.
But this might not be the only infectious disease we'll have to battle in our lifetimes.
According to research from the World Health Organization, and other institutions, the threat of climate change could make outbreaks even worse in the coming decades.
Researchers fear that as temperatures continue to rise, infectious-disease carrying animals could adapt to more widespread climates, pathogens could become stronger at surviving in hotter temperatures, and the human immune system could face greater difficulty in battling illness.
Though the COVID-19 pandemic has not been linked to climate change, here's how rising global temperatures could lead to an increase in future infectious diseases.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How cat allergies could soon be prevented by injecting pets with a drug following research into gene editing tool</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scientists think they may have discovered a way to prevent cat allergies with just a simple injection for our feline friends.
American company Indoor Biotechnologies have used a gene editing tool to eliminate the production of the protein in cats which causes some people to suffer allergic reactions.
The protein, called Fel d 1, is found in cats' salivary glands and skin and is spread when they groom themselves and shed their fur.
Indoor Biotechnologies says it has successfully deleted the gene that prompts the production of Fel d 1 in cells it has tested from 50 different cats.
If further trials are successful, the aim is to find a way to develop the treatment into a drug that can be given to cats via an injection, pill or cream.
The firm, which specialises in drugs for allergies, says it could be available to vets within the two to three years.
Martin Chapman, chief executive of Indoor Biotechnologies, said although it sounded 'like science fiction' it could in fact be a viable solution.
'We want people to be able to take cats to the vet, get an injection and then have that reduce or eliminate the Fel d 1 for good,' he told The Times.
However, it is not yet known whether eliminating the protein would be bad for a cat's health as scientists are still unsure what it is used for.
Some believe it may be a form of communication for mating while others think it could protect cats' skin from viral or bacterial infections. 
Alena Pance, a scientist from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: 'Deleting Fel d 1 might be feasible without causing damage to the animals but this would have to be thoroughly tested.
'I don't think any cat lover would put their cat to harm for the sake of alleviating their allergy.'
Indoor Biotechnologies are attempting to find out if removing the protein could damage cats by trying to delete the gene that produces it in fertilized eggs. They would then implant this into a female cat to see if the resulting kitten with the mutated gene developed any medical issues. 
The company says if the solution is proven to work only one or two injections would likely to be needed before a cat becomes less likely to spark an allergic reaction.
However, it is still unclear how expensive the treatment may initially be for pet owners.
Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute's Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics Laboratory, said: 'One of the main reasons cats are turned over to shelters is for allergy reasons so this would be a nice benefit for the cat as well.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Iran and Russia launch hacking attacks on British universities in attempt to steal coronavirus vaccine secrets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British institutions fighting Covid-19 have been subject to cyber attacks traced back to Russia and Iran, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.
Hackers linked to hostile states have targeted UK universities attempting to produce vaccines and testing kits as well as scientists and doctors studying the virus.
Spy bosses at the National Cyber Security Centre branded the attacks ‘utterly reprehensible’ and confirmed they were working ‘round the clock’ to battle the online menace.
Security and Whitehall figures have revealed a sustained attempt to target Britain’s efforts to fight the virus by accessing emails and servers in universities and scientific facilities. One said: ‘It looks like they’re trying to steal or borrow information about our response to coronavirus.’
A separate security source said: ‘This problem – intellectual property theft and a blurred line between state and serious crime – has been around for a while but there’s obviously now an increased need to ensure we protect UK PLC and its assets.’
However, it is understood that so far no major attack has been successful – and there has been no attack on NHS computer systems, as happened in May 2017 with devastating effect.
The incidents mirror activity detected in the US last week. The director of America’s National Counterintelligence and Security Center, Bill Evanina, said the US government had warned all its medical research organisations of the threat. 
He told the BBC: ‘We have been working… to ensure they are protecting all the research and data as best they can. 
'We have every expectation foreign intelligence services, to include the Chinese Communist Party, will attempt to obtain what we are making here.’
Britain’s security services and online crime fighters have passed a similar warning to UK researchers. Last night, Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Committee, said Britain should ‘not hesitate in retaliating appropriately’. He added: ‘The global distraction of Covid-19 provides the perfect fog of war to conduct cyber attacks. Especially when the prize of a vaccine is so huge.’
The National Cyber Security Centre said: ‘We have seen an increased proportion of cyber attacks related to coronavirus and our experts work around-the-clock to help organisations targeted.’ 
GCHQ has been drafted in to protect the NHS from cyber attacks.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock issued a directive giving the intelligence agency oversight of the NHS IT network to combat criminal gangs and foreign spies.
The National Cyber Security Centre has taken down more than 2,000 online scams since the pandemic began.
GCHQ is also providing the encryption for a coronavirus contact-tracing app being devised by NHSX, the digital arm of the health service.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Owners who tug on their dog's leash risk injuring the animal's neck - and it can lead to breathing difficulties, research finds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Owners who yank at their dog’s lead when out walking risk injuring the animal or causing it breathing difficulties, according to new research.
Even the lightest tug exerts a force on the animal’s neck that is double the pressure felt from a tourniquet used to prevent bleeding, say scientists.
And when a dog on a lead suddenly lunges after a squirrel or its owner jerks the lead to correct their pet, the force can be at least six times greater.
Anne Carter, a canine scientist at Nottingham Trent University and co-author of the study, wants dogs to be trained to walk on a loose lead or in a harness to prevent choking, breathing problems and neck damage. Laboratory tests were conducted on seven types of dog collar sold at pet shops. None measured a force low enough to avoid the risk of injury when a dog pulled on the lead.
‘I was surprised by the findings,’ Dr Carter said. ‘All types of dog collars have the potential to cause harm when the dog pulls on the lead.
‘Collars are important to display identity tags but we don’t want owners to use them for restraint and control, especially on dogs that like to pull on the lead. If a dog is trained to walk nicely to heel, it will do so.
‘Dogs should be trained to walk on a loose lead or in a harness, which distributes pressure on the dog’s body rather than the neck.’
Dr Carter warned that the dangers posed by leads could be even greater for dogs prone to breathing difficulties, such as short-snouted breeds like bullmastiffs, pugs and shih tzus.
During the study, reported in the science journal Veterinary Record, tests were conducted on a simulated model of a dog’s neck.
Each collar, which included leather, padded, rolled, webbing, rope and chain types, was pulled using three rates of force – firm, strong and jerk – for five seconds and the pressure on the neck was recorded.
Animal psychologist Roger Mugford, who has trained the Queen’s corgis, said: ‘I have never approved of yanks to the lead or dogs pulling leads and have been trying to educate owners to “chuck the choke” for years. Pulling is bad.’
Rachel Casey, canine behaviour director at the Dogs’ Trust, added: ‘We advocate dogs being walked on loose leads or in harnesses. They can be retrained to walk on a loose lead.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former chief scientific adviser sets up rival to Sage in wake of secrecy row to offer alternative advice that Britons can follow on YouTube</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former chief scientific adviser has assembled a rival team of experts to the government's Sage panel after the group became engulfed in a secrecy row. 
Sir David King's group will run parallel to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which has been guiding Boris Johnson's coronavirus crisis response.  
It will broadcast its 'robust, unbiased' advice on YouTube which will likely underscore splits among the country's top scientific minds.
Sir David's transparency mission comes amid mounting concerns over the secrecy of Sage, whose membership is classified and advice is not immediately published.
A simmering row over the group's covertness reached fever pitch last month when it emerged top Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings had attended its meetings. 
Sir Patrick Vallance, who chairs the group and is a podium regular at the daily Number 10 briefings, moved to calm the storm by agreeing to reveal Sage's membership list 'shortly'.
But Sir David's new team could prove a fresh blow to the government panel if its advice runs contrary to the Prime Minister's current battle plan. 
Sir David told the Sunday Times: 'I am not at all critical of the scientists who are putting advice before the government... but because there is no transparency the government can say they are following scientific advice but we don't know that they are.'
The group will submit their findings to the Commons' health select committee and hold their first meeting tomorrow.
The 12-strong team includes some of the world's most distinguished experts, including former World Health Organisation director Anthony Costello, who lashed out at Sage for being 'somewhat opaque'.  
Ahead of their first roundtable, Sir David described Mr Cummings's attendance of some Sage meetings as 'dangerous'. 
He said: 'Cummings is an adviser to the prime minister, and the chief scientific adviser is an adviser to the prime minister.
'So there are two voices from the scientific advisory group and I think that's very dangerous because only one of the two understands the science.' 
The PM's chief adviser came under fire when it emerged he had sat in on some meetings, but Downing Street insist he was not a 'member' of the panel.
It was reported last week that he attempted to sway the scientists towards enforcing a lockdown sooner. 
Sir David worked under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 2005 to 2007 and was at the centre of the foot and mouth crisis. 
He has been particularly scathing of the decision to allow the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead and believes it helped 'accelerate' the spread of the disease on UK soil.
While Sage's membership list is not published, some scientists have revealed themselves to be members. 
They include Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College whose initial modelling forecast a potential 250,000 deaths prompted the current social distancing.
Today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 'transparency is incredibly important in this crisis,' as he prepared to answer questions from the public.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elderly coronavirus patients should be given anti-ageing drugs to make their immune systems 'younger' so they can fight the virus faster, scientists claim</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elderly coronavirus patients could be given anti-ageing drugs to restore their 'young' immune system and help them fight the coronavirus, scientists say.
Over 80 per cent of COVID-19 hospitalisations are those over 65 years of age with a greater than 23-fold increased risk of death. 
As a person ages, their immune system becomes suppressed and it takes longer for their body to recognise and attack the virus.
It gives the virus time to replicate and cause serious disease - which may be heightened by pre-existing health conditions.
But Harvard scientists say this could be fixed with NAD boosters, a relatively new class of anti-ageing supplements. 
Lower levels of NAD+ in the body as a result of ageing are thought to impair biological functions important to health, which might contribute to age-related diseases. 
One of the paper authors sees NAD as the 'closest we’ve gotten to a fountain of youth'. 
The Harvard paper, which is yet to be peer reviewed by other scientists, said: 'The most exciting and potentially impactful technologies to treat Covid-19 are those that activate the body's defences against ageing.
'It may even be possible to reset the age of cells and tissues so currently high-risk individuals can respond to viral infections as though they were young.'
Even though the science is still developing, the available evidence supports the notion that older people are more at risk of the coronavirus.
For example, NHS data shows of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 72 per cent are over the age of 60 - 58 per cent of which are men. 
And more than 91 per cent of people who have died from the virus in England (total 20,853) are over the age of 60, data shows.
More than half of deaths have been in those over 80. 
The Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School team said the severity of coronavirus symptoms experienced by a patient depend on how their body responds to the virus when it enters the body.
The presence of already existing health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes, fail to explain exactly why the elderly are less resilient, the team said. 
An effective immune system response is to recognise the virus, alert the body to it and then destroy it with speed and then clear it from the body.
In a young person, immune cells recognise the SARS-CoV-2 virus when it first enters the upper respiratory tract.
The immune cells act appropriately to directly kill the virus and infected cells, preventing the spread of the virus.  
These mechanisms are 'known to be dysfunctional' in the elderly, the paper, authored by three scientists, said.  
Viral alert signals are slow, resulting in greater viral replication and the movement of the virus into the lower respiratory tract where it can infect more cells.  
During ageing, the immune system changes in two fundamental ways which are 'major drivers of the high mortality rates in older patients', according to the research.
Firstly, there is a gradual decline in immune function, called immunosenescence, which hampers the body's ability to recognise pathogens and respond to them effectively. 
The second immune change is a chronic increase in inflammation. It means the body overzealously registers the presence of a pathogen but fails to effectively respond to it.
The team added that in half of fatal COVID-19 cases, the patient experienced a cytokine storm - 82 per cent of whom were over the age of 60.
A cytokine storm is when chemical-signalling molecules which guide a healthy immune response become overactive and go haywire. 
COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome experience a cytokine storm that features high level circulation of inflammatory cytokines in the body.
It exacerbates symptoms and triggers inflammation in major tissues such as the lungs, kidneys, liver and brain. 
Why the elderly are more at risk of a cytokine storm is not known, but there are some ideas - one of these being a decline in levels of NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
'Stiff' lung tissue seen in the elderly may be why the novel coronavirus is more deadly to older patients, a new review article suggests.
The virus invades mucosal cells - cells that produce mucus - before multiplying and spreading throughout the body.
Researchers say the virus replicates itself better in these stiff cells, found in the lungs and upper respiratory tracts of older people, which allows the disease to spread faster.
The team, led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says its findings indicate the prevalence of the virus may not be due to the weakening of the elderly's immune systems as many scientists suspect.
When humans are infected with the new strain, known as SARS-COV-2, the virus first attacks cells that secrete mucus in the respiratory tract. 
After the virus invades a cell, it 'hijacks' the machinery of the cells to replicate itself thousands of times.
These copies infect other cells the body or are expelled via droplets from a cough or sneeze that then infect other cells.
In older people, tissue in the lungs and respiratory tract are stiffer due to a larger supply of protein fibers, according to the researchers.
The researchers say stiff cells 'favor the multiplication of the virus' meaning they replicate themselves easier.
'Biopsies or cell culture experiments could now be used to determine whether this is indeed the case,' they wrote.
The team says this could help scientists determine where to focus their efforts as they research and develop drugs to fight against the virus.
NAD+ lowers as we age, which results in the depression of other important proteins and enzymes, and the surge of others.  
NLPR3, centrally responsible for the activation of inflammatory responses, are thought to be hyperactivated when NAD+ levels drop.
It doesn't help that NAD+ levels are depleted during the course of COVID-19, according to early research. 
And, there is 'increasing evidence that lower NAD+ levels in the lung and vascular endothelium contribute to poor Covid-19 outcomes'. 
The team envision a 'two-step model' whereby inflammation increased due to ageing, and the hyperactivation by SARS-CoV-2 triggers a cytokine storm. 
'Maintaining NAD+ levels may therefore alleviate COVID-19 symptoms,' the authors of the paper said. 
NAD boosters are supplements that contain nicotinamide riboside, a form of vitamin B3. When taken as a supplement, the body converts the nicotinamide riboside to NAD+ - the prized coenzyme in youngsters. 
There is scarce evidence that NAD boosters work. They have only started to creep onto the market in the last 10 years or so.
But a 2017 study published in the journal Science found that boosting NAD+ levels in mice reversed the signs of aging in the tissue and muscles of older mice. 
The reversal was so drastic that researchers could no longer tell the difference between four-month-old mice and two-year-old mice, Futurism reported.
Though it was on animals, the study strongly suggests that boosting NAD+ levels in humans could have health benefits by optimising cellular health.
David Sinclair, an author of the recent Harvard paper, said at the time: 'NAD+ is the closest we’ve gotten to a fountain of youth.
'It’s one of the most important molecules for life to exist, and without it, you’re dead in 30 seconds.' 
The team also said NAD boosters and other techniques may be needed to improve the effectiveness of vaccines, which typically are weaker in the elderly.
They write: 'In the aged, immune responses to vaccination are often weak or defective...Therefore, in designing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, it will be important to consider that older people may not respond as well to vaccines as young people.'
The academics concluded that research into older people will be essential for understanding the threat of the virus among different ages.
There is still 'much to be elucidated' about the varying effects of Covid-19 on people of different ages.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Triangle-Shaped UFO-Like Object Detected in Texas Skies for Fourth Time in a Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The mysterious lights were recorded days before the Pentagon officially released much-debated videos taken on board aircraft of alleged guests to Earth in order “to clear up misconceptions” about the authenticity of the circulated clips.
A strange triangle-shaped UFO is claimed to have appeared above Texas in what has been reported as the fourth such sighting in a year, according to a YouTube channel dedicated to suspicious hovering objects.
A new video from the town of Tomball has emerged showing one of the clearest sightings to date, featuring three bright “rings” slowly forming into a triangle. Hardly do they start to vanish before they re-emerge, stunning a woman behind the camera, who can be heard uttering “oh my God” before questioning what it might be.
The previous sightings of this kind in Texas - at least three of them - were dismissed as Chinese lanterns, balloons, and kites.
The Texas video comes after the Pentagon officially released intriguing footage taken by the US Navy of “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena”. The clips were recorded in 2004 and 2015 by infrared cameras on US Navy aircraft and show what the Pentagon calls “unidentified aerial phenomena”. The oblong objects appear to move through the sky in elaborate ways, while the pilots can be heard in the videos wondering about the breakneck speed they were moving at and how they managed to fly into a substantial headwind with ease.
The declassified videos have been circulating for a few years after first being reported in 2017. This week, the DoD made them officially available for download in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request “to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos”, according to Sue Gough, a DoD spokeswoman, who said that the objects in the records remain unidentified.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sumerian King List Could Help Pinpoint the Location of Biblical Garden of Eden, Professor Claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Garden of Eden is the Biblical paradise of God described in the Book of Genesis. While it is considered mythological by many religious scholars, those who consider it real have cited various places, including the Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Armenia, as areas where it might have been located.
A clue to the location of the Garden of Eden could potentially be hidden in the Sumerian King List, said college Professor Tom Meyer in an interview with the Express. Meyer, who is known as the Bible Memory Man for his extraordinary ability to recite over 20 Biblical books, said the artefact, which is inscribed on a clay tablet, tells the story of the ancient Mesopotamian site of Eridu, describing it as the first city ever built. The scholar claims that the Garden of Eden might have been located at Eridu, located in what is now southern Iraq.
The Sumerian King List, which dates to the Middle Bronze Age, between 2100 BC and 1650 BC, is currently on display at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
​Another argument that Professor Meyer uses to support his theory is Eridu’s close proximity to other cities mentioned in the Biblical records. "The Biblical city of Ur, the home of Abraham, was 12 miles from Eridu. Erech, a capital city of the famous post-flood King Nimrod was 50 miles from Eridu and the city of Babylon – also built by Nimrod – was 150 miles north of Eridu", Meyer explained in the interview.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (Sputnik) - The German government said earlier that Merkel would be participating in the conference of donor countries on the fight against pandemic on Monday at the invitation of the European Commission.
Vaccines against the coronavirus disease that the European Union is planning to develop will be globally available, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday.
It is about "how we are developing vaccines, drugs, and good diagnostic options for all people around the world," Merkel said in a statement, adding that Germany "took this responsibility."
According to Merkel, about eight billion euros are still not enough to develop a vaccine. Germany "will make a significant financial contribution" to this work, she stressed.
The chancellor welcomed the fact that not only government agencies were involved in this activity, but also private foundations, vaccine and drug manufacturers.
Merkel added that Germany intended to continue working closely with the World Health Organisation on this matter.
Merkel and other EU leaders have previously called for fundraising in the amount of 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and medications.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mark on Kim Jong-un's Arm a Possible Sign of Heart Surgery, Medical Experts Claim</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to North Korean state media, the country's leader has appeared in public for the first time in weeks after a smattering of unconfirmed reports that he was on the brink of death after a failed heart surgery.
A fresh mark on Kim Jong-un’s arm corroborates earlier reports about his alleged heart surgery, some medical experts suggested after footage of the North Korean leader's most recent public outing was published by local media.
On Friday, the Korean Central News Agency reported that the 38-year-old on Friday had inspected a fertiliser plant in Sunchon, providing photos and videos of the visit which brought an end to his almost three-week absence from public functions.
Health professionals who examined the footage told South Korea-based NK News that Kim showed what appeared to be a mark on the inner side of his right wrist, a possible sign of cardiovascular surgery.
“It is hard to tell from the foreshortening of the photograph, but it seems a bit medial. It is not an IV [intravenous], which wouldn’t leave such a mark,” they said.
A South Korea surgeon told the outlet that the dot on Kim’s arm “looks more plausible to be a procedure or check-up mark from a procedure on a heart-related issue”.
However, a third expert, Harvard Medical School's Jason H. Wasfy, said that the placement of the mark was off for it to be a sign of a radial puncture, which is typically performed closer to a thumb and causes a hematoma.
Kim Jong-un’s health drew international interest after he missed out on the 15 April anniversary of the birthday of his grandfather and state founder, Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on North Korea’s calendar.
Daily NK, a South Korean website which bases its stories on accounts by defectors from the North, cited an unidentified source inside DPRK on 20 April as claiming that Kim was recovering from a heart surgery allegedly conducted a week prior because of his “excessive smoking, obesity, and fatigue”.
The following day, CNN reported that the US was monitoring intelligence that Kim was in “grave danger”, according to a government source, but South Korea played down the claims about Kim's health. Another news report from Japan then speculated that the North Korean leader was in a “vegetative state”, and a few outlets reported that he had died.
Pyongyang has not commented on the rumours, but Friday's footage from the factory visit came in apparent rebuttal of the claims.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dead Star's Signal May Finally Help Learn the Origins of Fast Radio Bursts, Scientists Say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While so called fast radio bursts (FRB) are hardly a novelty, with the first such signal being picked up by scientists back in 2007, it appears that for the first time, one such burst was recently detected originating from a celestial body in our very galaxy, Science Alert reports.
The signal in question, emanated by magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which is located about 30,000 light years away from our planet, was picked up by observatories on Earth on 28 April.
And according to the media outlet, while "work on this event is very preliminary", as astronomers still strive to analyze the data they've obtained, this discovery may finally help solve the mystery of the origins of such signals, as other theories also suggest supernovas and extraterrestrials as possible sources.
Astronomers were also able to detect "the X-ray counterpart" to the signal, with astrophysicist Sandro Mereghetti of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy noting that this is "a very intriguing result and supports the association between FRBs and magnetars".
The media outlet points out, however, that even if the SGR 1935+2154 signal confirms the magnetar origin of FRBs, which remains to be seen, it won't mean that magnetars are the only source of such signals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nearly Half of UK Doctors Purchase Their Own PPE Or Rely on Donations, BMA Study Finds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the United Kingdoms mobilises the resources of the National Health Service (NHS) to combat the coronavirus, alleged shortages of the necessary protective equipment for frontline staff have put pressure on the government.
Up to half of doctors in England are purchasing their own personal protective equipment (PPE) or relying on donations, a survey published by the British Medical Association (BMA) on Sunday revealed.
The study which surveyed 16,000 doctors discovered that 65% feel they are only partly or not at all protected while at work tackling the coronavirus pandemic.
48% of doctors reported that the had bought PPE directly for themselves, their department, or relied on donations from a charity or local firm to supply the material.
GPs are disproportionately affected by the alleged shortages with 55% of family doctors saying that they had to source their own equipment, compared with 38% of hospital doctors
Almost a third of doctors said that they had not spoken out about the PPE situation, staff shortages, testing, or shortages of drugs because they did not believe any action would be taken, according to the survey.
He claimed the survey showed that while the number of supplies was improving, staff are still not in a situation where they are confident they are sufficiently protected from the virus.
The government said on 23 March that it is "working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered" to healthcare staff and confirmed that more than a billion items had been supplied since the crisis began.
In early April it was claimed that frontline medical staff had been forced to use bin bags in place of protective gear due to lack of equipment, as workers pleaded for extra PPE supplies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus disproportionately effects women's health, finances</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus crisis is not without its little pleasures. For Audrey Lebeau-Live, one of them is pushing the mute button on the video and audio conferences from her work. This button allows her to do the washing up, listen with one ear to her daughter giving a presentation in the next room to her computer camera and — if all goes well — put a load of washing in the machine.
Since the French government imposed comprehensive stay-at-home regulations and temporarily closed schools in mid-March, Lebeau-Live has been feeling like many parents across the world who have to work and look after children at the same time. "You have the sense of never getting enough done, never coping with everything," she says on the telephone.
Under normal circumstances, she and her husband used to share household chores. But now, for example, cooking lunch is an additional task, as everyone ate in the canteen before the coronavirus crisis hit. "It's mostly the mothers who get burdened with the extra work," Lebeau-Live says, and laughs, even though she doesn't really feel like laughing. She says she feels responsible for it all, unlike her husband, who thinks: What I manage, I manage; the rest can wait for the time being.

The missing female perspective
Lebeau-Live feels that this has to do with the fact that women still have to prove themselves more, especially when they have a leadership position. She heads a small team at IRSN, the French agency responsible for protection against radiation and for nuclear security, situated near Paris. She criticizes the fact that those who decide on making people work at home and forbidding them to leave the house are often men who do not take into account the perspective of women.
Hannah Elsche, an art therapist from Berlin, sees things in a similar light. Like Lebeau-Live, she has three children. Because of the coronavirus crisis, she decided — of necessity — to extend her parental leave. "Many women are looking after children more at the moment because their husbands or partners earn more," Elsche says. She says she sees this happening around her as well, and that her husband wasn't even asked who was looking after the children at home.
Although many may call these "First World problems," Catriona Graham sees the situation as serious. "Gender stereotypes are among the strongest and most rigid causes of sexism and inequality," she says. Particularly in times of crisis, many people find security in going back to stereotyped roles, says Graham, who works for the European Women's Lobby, an organization that advocates women's interests.
Among these cliched role stereotypes is the one that women are more responsible for children and the household, and perhaps care for older family members as well. According to UNICEF, women across the world did three times as much unpaid care work as men even before the current crisis. And the UN says this type of work is now growing "exponentially."

Keeping things running
Single mothers are affected particularly severely by the restrictions imposed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Some 85% of parents who look after children on their own are women. Some years ago, Laurence Helaili-Chapuis from Dublin founded a group to support these mothers. She says many such women are now getting in touch with her because they are "in a complicated situation." Helaili-Chapuis says even shopping is difficult for a lot of them, while some are also worried about their professional future.
And not without cause. The UN is already warning that women will be the ones to suffer the most under the economic consequences of the crisis. It estimates that almost 60% of women worldwide work in the informal economy; they earn less than men, can save less as a result and are at greater risk of descending into poverty.

At the same time, it is largely women who are keeping things running at the moment. In the European Union, for example, women make up almost 80% of workers in the health sector. Employees in supermarkets who continue to operate the tills and cleaning personnel who are still keeping things hygienic are mostly women. And because of the types of work they do, they are exposed to a higher risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus.
It is not the first time that women have been the ones to bear the brunt of a crisis. Studies on the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, for example, show that women were in greater danger of being infected, partly because it was mostly them looking after those who were ill.
Codeword 'Mask 19'
There is also another type of danger lying in wait for women who have to stay home during the coronavirus crisis, and this one is homemade: domestic violence.
Evelyn Regner, an Austrian Social Democratic politician who is the chair of the committee for women's rights in the European Parliament, says that one in three women had already had an experience of violence in her direct environment even before the current crisis.
She says that number has now exploded, with the UN saying that in Italy, 75% more women are ringing helplines; in other countries, such calls have doubled.
But Regner also mentions some hopeful developments. In Spain, for example, women can get help in pharmacies — one of the few places they are still allowed to visit amid the restrictions — if they use the codeword "Mask 19." The pharmacists will then know what is meant and tell the police, Regner says.
"The coronavirus is making crises worse," Regner says, whether violence against women, the salary gap, or the difficulties faced by single mothers. "Things that were already bad are now getting even more serious."

“What we are seeing are scenes from a horror movie."
Those words came from Artur Virgilio, the mayor of Manaus, about the coronavirus crisis developing in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil.
The city had a record number of burials in April -- about 100 a day, or triple the average -- forcing authorities to do many en masse in improvised cemeteries.
“We aren’t in a state of emergency. We are in a state of utter disaster, like a country that is at war but has already lost," Virgilio said.

The city's public health system has already collapsed, with 100% of intensive-care beds occupied and hundreds of people left untreated.
Relatives of victims report that burials have been carried out collectively, with some people left not knowing if their loved one was, in fact, buried.
In some cases, corpses were placed on top of each other in graves, according to reports. The official cause of death is often listed as "unknown" or "severe acute respiratory failure," which experts say is contributing to a massive under-count of coronavirus cases.
Between April 21 and April 28, the government reported 118 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Manaus. But in that same week, more than 200 people were buried due without a determined cause of death, in addition to 395 due to respiratory failure or suspected coronavirus.
According to one projection, the number of burials in Manaus may reach 4,200 later this month..
BOLSONARO EFFECT? MORE BRAZILIANS SEEN DEFYING CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS
The crisis in Manaus could be a sign of things to come for the whole country.
Although conditions in São Paulo, the largest city in South America, and Rio de Janeiro, are not as dire, experts warn that the country faces a coronavirus surge similar to those that devasted Italy, Spain and parts of the United States. Or even worse,
Edmar Santos, Rio’s state secretary of health, said in a television interview that a "collapse" of the nation's health care system could happen this month.
"What we expect for the next three to four weeks is that Brazil will experience the same collapse that [happended in] Italy, Spain and the United States. Rio has over a thousand people waiting for a bed, with 361 patients in serious condition."
The government is weighing a possible nationwide lockdown if COVID-19 cases keep surging.
Getting people to engage in social distancing, however, can be easier said than done. The country's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sabotaged efforts to impose effective social distancing, firing his health minister who defended the move, and attacking covid-19 as “hysteria”.
Asked about Brazil's rising death toll, the far-right politician recently declared: “So what?”
BRAZIL SEES SPIKE IN CORONAVIRUS CASES, WITH SOME HOSPITALS OVERLOADED
His supporters seem to be following his words.
A study conducted by researchers of Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) and Cambridge University found that social isolation declined among Bolsonaro’s supporters after his speeches in March, using geolocation data on more than 60 million mobile devices.
Bolsonaro was elected with over 55 million votes and, according to a recent poll, his popularity reaches almost 40% of the electorate, which would represent around 40 million people. According to economist Luis Meloni, from Universidade de São Paulo, the president has shown "impressive" resilience amid the health crisis.
But the resignation of his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had strong popular approval, and the loss of the highly popular justice minister, Sérgio Moro, who resigned because he disagreed with the president's actions, may have greater consequences for Bolsonaro, Meloni said.
"The president has benefited from social isolation because people contrary to his presidency are at home, unable to protest, although every day there are records of people protesting at their windows. But those who support him have been out on the streets showing support for him. So it is difficult to calculate, at that moment, the possibility of him falling from power, but, in fact, the size of his popularity is impressive, even with the current disastrous situation of Brazil in the fight against the epidemic."
Moro, on his way out, said the president tried to influence Federal Police investigations involving his sons, Carlos Bolsonaro and Eduardo Bolsonaro. This week, the president gave another sign in this direction: He appointed a friendly delegate to the post of director of the Police, which was blocked by the Supreme Federal Court due to a conflict of interest.
The Supreme Court also authorized the opening of an investigation against the president, and political parties filed a request for impeachment in the House of Representatives.
In the meantime, rising numbers of coronavirus deaths and a looming economic crisis are likely to seriously damage Bolsonaro.

As of Saturday morning, Brazil had more than 92,000 confirmed cases and more than 6,000 deaths. Experts believe, however, that the real numbers could be up to 15 times higher than official statistics.

President Trump renewed his criticism of the World Health Organization Thursday for the way the United Nations organization failed to challenge false information China initially provided minimizing the coronavirus outbreak in that country. He should also call out the WHO for its disgraceful role in spreading absurd lies and hatred about U.S. ally Israel for years.
Trump recently suspended U.S. funding of the WHO. America is by far the largest donor to the agency and was scheduled to give it $894 million during the current two-year funding period.
The president said Thursday that “the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they’re like the public relations agency for China.” He could have also added that the WHO has operated like a PR and propaganda agency for the enemies of Israel – the only democracy in the Middle East.
GOP REP UNVEILS BILL TO PROBE WHO’S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, PAST ACTIONS
A year ago, WHO member countries voted 96 to 11 – with the U.S. in opposition – for an annual resolution blaming Israel for “health conditions in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syria Golan.”
While one might expect the WHO to be apolitical, it – like nearly every other U.N.-associated organ – is used by Israel’s enemies as a platform for viciously attacking the Jewish state. What may be even more disturbing is that democracies that should know better – including France, Belgium and Sweden – joined in the unjustified condemnation of Israel.
As U.N. Watch noted, out of 21 items on the WHO agenda, the only one focused on a specific country applied to Israel. This targeting of Israel has been going on since at least 2000.
U.N. Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer noted that “anyone who has ever walked into an Israeli hospital or clinic knows that they are providing world-class health care to thousands of Palestinian Arabs.”
It will not be surprising if this year the WHO adopts the usual Israel-bashing resolution and falsely accuses Israel of preventing Palestinians from getting treatment for COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus.
In fact, Israel is doing a great deal to help the Palestinians contain the coronavirus outbreak that first apparently arrived in the West Bank in Bethlehem.
Israel quickly provided 250 coronavirus test kits to the Palestinian Authority and began joint training sessions for Israeli and Palestinian medical personnel to study the coronavirus, the protection of medical personnel, and the testing of patients suspected of being coronavirus carriers.
In Gaza, the Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed the receipt of test kits and medical equipment from Israel that were requested by Palestinian medical personnel.
“Handling the coronavirus outbreak takes precedence over any political consideration, and without help from Israel, Gaza would be in a very difficult situation in the case of an outbreak,” a Palestinian Health Ministry official told the Israel Hayom newspaper.
Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, Israel permitted thousands of Palestinians to enter Israel for medical treatment. After Israel instituted a lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, it continued to provide medical supplies to Gaza – 88 tons during one week in April alone.
On March 20, Israel delivered hundreds of test kits and 1,000 protective medical gear kits to Gaza. Five days later, more than 3,000 test kits and 50,000 masks from the WHO were delivered to the Palestinian Authority.
Israeli and Palestinian health and security officials are in frequent contact and have coordinated training sessions for Palestinian medical professionals. A training session was held, for example, for medical staff from Gaza at the Erez Border Crossing by a team from the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan in Israel.
The Palestinians benefit from the Israeli assistance, since Israel was just ranked the safest country in the world during the pandemic by the Deep Knowledge Group.
But despite all this, it will be no surprise if the WHO has the chutzpah to condemn Israel this year once again. We don’t know if Western democracies will again go along.
Last year’s WHO resolution attacking Israel ignored the impact of Palestinian terrorism on the health of the Palestinian people, as well as the mistreatment of Palestinians by the Hamas terrorist group that governs Gaza and by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
Just five months ago, the Palestinian Authority objected to an American plan to build a hospital in Gaza. And, of course, the same group has utterly rejected the peace plan advanced by President Trump to end hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians – and has even cut off contacts with the Trump administration.
Hamas goes even further, refusing to even acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and harshly condemning the U.S. and the Trump administration.
In 2017, reportedly under pressure from Syria, the WHO hid a positive report on Israel. This was especially galling given that four years earlier the Israel Defense Forces had begun treating hundreds of sick and wounded Syrians at field hospitals staffed by volunteers in the Golan Heights.
In 2016, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Good Neighbor to expand its aid program and allow Syrians to be treated in Israeli hospitals. According to the IDF, more than 4,900 Syrians – including 1,300 children – were brought to Israeli hospitals during the five years of providing medical assistance.

During that time, Israel transported into Syria 1,700 tons of food; 1.1 million liters of fuel; 26,000 cases of medical equipment and medication; 20 generators; 40 vehicles; 630 tents; 350 tons of clothing; 8,200 packages of diapers; and 49,000 cases of baby food.
The operation was shut down in September 2018 after Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Assad reestablished control over southern Syria in that country’s civil war.
While the WHO condemns Israel for health conditions on the Golan Heights, it says nothing about Assad’s attacks on hundreds of Syrian medical facilities and the humanitarian disaster he has created in the war against his own people. The WHO simply refers to “attacks” as if no one is responsible.

Meanwhile, Israeli medical supplies have continued to flow into Gaza even as terrorists attack Israelis at the border and fire rockets into civilian areas. Tens of thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza are admitted to Israel every year for medical treatment.
Even Palestinian leaders who call for Israel’s destruction send their family members to Israeli hospitals. For example, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s daughter was hospitalized in Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. His brother-in-law, mother-in-law and one of his granddaughters were also treated in Israel.
The sister of another senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, was treated in Israel for cancer and an Israeli medical specialist went to Ramallah on the West Bank to help save the life of Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. A year later, Abbas said Palestinians would be barred from treatment in Israel.

If the WHO had any integrity and honesty it would be praising Israel as a model of good neighborliness for the massive medical assistance is has provided to the Palestinians for years, including during the coronavirus pandemic.
The truth is that Israel has done far more than both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to care for the health of the Palestinian people. It’s long past time for the WHO to recognize this and end its dishonest Israel-bashing campaign once and for all.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, New Jersey has begun issuing temporary emergency licenses to doctors licensed in other countries. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy called the new policy "entirely fitting" for the state, which has the second-most cases of COVID-19 and the second-most deaths after New York.
It's a smart move.
The United States was suffering from a shortage of doctors long before the coronavirus landed on our shores. The pandemic has cast that shortage into even starker relief. Right now, we need every qualified doctor we can find – and that need will not go away after the pandemic ends.
KATHY GIUSTI: WAR ON CORONAVIRUS CAN TEACH US HOW TO MORE EFFECTIVELY WAGE WAR ON CANCER
State and federal regulations make it hard for physicians licensed in foreign countries to practice medicine in the United States. Doctors from other countries, with the exception of Canada, must pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Fair enough.
But doctors from outside the U.S. must also complete a three- to seven-year residency – even if they've already trained and practiced in their home countries. Some states even make established doctors redo part of their graduate education before granting them a medical license.
It can be next to impossible for these doctors to secure the medical residencies they need. This year, more than 40,000 applicants vied for just over 37,000 residency positions.
These regulations force even the most qualified foreign physicians to essentially redo their medical training if they want to practice in the United States. That's time-consuming and expensive. So many of them take on other jobs for which they're supremely overqualified.
The stories are astonishing. A Macedonian primary care doctor became a nurse in Boston. An accomplished Sri Lankan anesthesiologist taught medical test prep courses in New Jersey. Other doctors work as waiters or cab drivers while trying to gain a U.S. medical license.
Our country can't afford to turn away talented physicians. The United States will need an additional 122,000 physicians to meet patient demand by 2032, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Public officials have taken some steps to address the shortage. The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact allows doctors to get licensed simultaneously in multiple states. In theory, the compact allows doctors to move freely to in-need areas. But the compact only applies in 26 states. Big states including California, New York and Texas are not among them.
Given the six-figure shortage of doctors we're facing, we must do much more to increase the supply of physicians.
Some may worry that foreign-trained doctors provide worse care than those educated in the United States. Sure, we need standards. But is a policy that makes it harder for doctors educated at the likes of Oxford or Cambridge to come to the United States really all that wise?
Further, there's plenty of evidence that doctors educated abroad provide excellent care. For example, a 2017 study led by a Harvard researcher found that patients treated by international medical graduates posted lower mortality rates than those treated by U.S. medical graduates.

Besides, we already rely on foreign doctors to fill gaps in our nation's health care workforce. Half of all foreign-trained doctors work in areas where the annual per-capita income is less than $30,000 per year. These doctors also make up one-third of our country's primary care physicians.
An influx of immigrant doctors could also lead to more experimentation in the provision of care – and ultimately spur competition throughout the health care system.
Immigrants are more likely to start businesses than people born into the United States, according to the National Immigration Forum. Perhaps they'd be more willing to try out direct primary care, where patients pay a flat monthly fee for a suite of services. These models have the potential to yield lower costs and better care for patients.

Entrepreneurial foreign doctors may also be more interested in launching independent practices, which have been on the decline. Increasingly, doctors are working for big hospital systems with few competitors. That's one of the reasons health care costs have been on the rise.
Many foreign-trained doctors are ready, willing and able to help the United States battle pandemics, doctor shortages and more. All we have to do is let them.

Big Tech companies should make up their minds. Are they public fora, open to one and all, that faithfully carry an infinite spectrum of messages — much as AT&T phone lines transmit liberal, moderate, and conservative robocalls during election season? Or are they private institutions, exclusively for those with whom they agree — much as Mother Jones peddles the Left and National Review promotes the Right?

Either approach is fine and honorable. But Facebook, Google, YouTube, and their ilk should not do both — especially while morphing into the private/exclusive model, and savoring government protection to boot.
DEROY MURCOCK: DEMOCRATS ON CORONAVIRUS — CANDIDATES MUM ON COVID-19 DURING DEBATES
Big Tech’s private-sector censorship has been on vivid display during the COVID-19 crisis. Opinions with which these companies differ simply disappear, as three examples show in just the last week.

Department of Homeland Security scientist William Bryan said at President Donald J. Trump’s April 23 press briefing that ultraviolet light seems to kill COVID-19. Trump wondered aloud, “supposing you brought the light inside the body.” That’s all it took for Hate Trump, Inc. to hammer the president for medical malpractice. (He also mused over the prospect of doctors using disinfectants to treat patients, which the Trump-loathing press wildly inflated into “reports” that he wanted physicians to inject COVID-19 patients with Lysol.)

Dream Sequence Editions isn’t your average photo collective. The 20 photographers involved are doing more than just sharing their artwork, they are raising money to help in the fight against the coronavirus.
“Art is the artists' resource and I think in times like this you have to look around and see what resources you have and how you can use them to help out,” Tim Barber, the curator of Dream Sequence Editions, told Fox News.The collective started raising funds March 23 and has been able to donate over $50,000 in just five weeks. Barber said he always wanted to figure out a way to sell prints like this and it all came together as the lockdown in New York began. The print edition platform is currently working with nine different charities and are adding new prints to their list every week.
“We're getting suggestions from the artists we're working with on different places they're interested in helping or supporting,” Barber said.The process is simple. Every Monday, Barber posts new photographs to the website and when a print is purchased, at least 50 percent of the proceeds go to coronavirus relief efforts. The other half of the sales are split between the contributing artists and production costs. Each photo is limited to 100 prints so once they sell out, they are out.Barber said people who have been purchasing the prints have been sharing the new photos on social media, which has helped them get the word out about their relief efforts. He added that he plans on keeping the collective going indefinitely. 
“As long as we can keep making sales and keep raising money,” Barber said of continuing the collective. “There's probably going to be a never-ending need for help out there in the world as this thing progresses.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Commentary: 10 signs a greater depression is coming</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We may see an L-shaped greater depression later in this decade even if there is lacklustre economic recovery this year, says economist Nouriel Roubini.
NEW YORK CITY: After the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, the imbalances and risks pervading the global economy were exacerbated by policy mistakes.
So, rather than address the structural problems that the financial collapse and ensuing recession revealed, governments mostly kicked the can down the road, creating major downside risks that made another crisis inevitable.
And now that it has arrived, the risks are growing even more acute. Unfortunately, even if the Greater Recession leads to a lacklustre U-shaped recovery this year, an L-shaped “Greater Depression” will follow later in this decade, owing to 10 ominous and risky trends. 
DEBT AND FISCAL STRENGTH
The first trend concerns deficits and their corollary risks: debts and defaults. 
The policy response to the COVID-19 crisis entails a massive increase in fiscal deficits – on the order of 10 per cent of GDP or more – at a time when public debt levels in many countries were already high, if not unsustainable.  
Worse, the loss of income for many households and firms means that private-sector debt levels will become unsustainable, too, potentially leading to mass defaults and bankruptcies. 
Together with soaring levels of public debt, this all but ensures a more anaemic recovery than the one that followed the Great Recession a decade ago.
A second factor is the demographic time bomb in advanced economies. The COVID-19 crisis shows that much more public spending must be allocated to health systems, and that universal health care and other relevant public goods are necessities, not luxuries.
Yet, because most developed countries have ageing societies, funding such outlays in the future will make the implicit debts from today’s unfunded health-care and social-security systems even larger.
A third issue is the growing risk of deflation. In addition to causing a deep recession, the crisis is also creating a massive slack in goods - unused machines and capacity - and labour markets - mass unemployment - as well as driving a price collapse in commodities such as oil and industrial metals.
That makes debt deflation likely, increasing the risk of insolvency. 
A fourth and related factor will be currency debasement. As central banks try to fight deflation and head off the risk of surging interest rates - following from the massive debt build-up - monetary policies will become even more unconventional and far-reaching.
In the short run, governments will need to run monetised fiscal deficits to avoid depression and deflation. 
Yet, over time, the permanent negative supply shocks from accelerated de-globalisation and renewed protectionism will make stagflation all but inevitable.
DISRUPTION OF SYSTEMS
A fifth issue is the broader digital disruption of the economy.
With millions of people losing their jobs or working and earning less, the income and wealth gaps of the 21st century economy will widen further. 
To guard against future supply-chain shocks, companies in advanced economies will re-shore production from low-cost regions to higher-cost domestic markets. 
But rather than helping workers at home, this trend will accelerate the pace of automation, putting downward pressure on wages and further fanning the flames of populism, nationalism, and xenophobia.
This points to the sixth major factor: de-globalisation.
The pandemic is accelerating trends toward balkanisation and fragmentation that were already well underway. 
The United States and China will decouple faster, and most countries will respond by adopting still more protectionist policies to shield domestic firms and workers from global disruptions. 
The post-pandemic world will be marked by tighter restrictions on the movement of goods, services, capital, labour, technology, data, and information.
This is already happening in the pharmaceutical, medical-equipment, and food sectors, where governments are imposing export restrictions and other protectionist measures in response to the crisis.
The backlash against democracy will reinforce this trend. Populist leaders often benefit from economic weakness, mass unemployment, and rising inequality. 
Under conditions of heightened economic insecurity, there will be a strong impulse to scapegoat foreigners for the crisis. 
Blue-collar workers and broad cohorts of the middle class will become more susceptible to populist rhetoric, particularly proposals to restrict migration and trade.
IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ORDER
This points to an eighth factor: the geostrategic standoff between the US and China. With the Trump administration making every effort to blame China for the pandemic, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime will double down on its claim that the US is conspiring to prevent China’s peaceful rise.
The Sino-American decoupling in trade, technology, investment, data, and monetary arrangements will intensify.
Worse, this diplomatic breakup will set the stage for a new cold war between the US and its rivals – not just China, but also Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
With a US presidential election approaching, there is every reason to expect an upsurge in clandestine cyber warfare, potentially leading even to conventional military clashes.
And because technology is the key weapon in the fight for control of the industries of the future and in combating pandemics, the US private tech sector will become increasingly integrated into the national-security-industrial complex.
PANDEMICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
A final risk that cannot be ignored is environmental disruption, which, as the COVID-19 crisis has shown, can wreak far more economic havoc than a financial crisis.
Recurring epidemics - HIV since the 1980s, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2011, Ebola from 2014 to 2016 - are, like climate change, essentially man-made disasters, born of poor health and sanitary standards, the abuse of natural systems, and the growing interconnectivity of a globalised world.
Pandemics and the many morbid symptoms of climate change will become more frequent, severe, and costly in the years ahead.
These ten risks, already looming large before COVID-19 struck, now threaten to fuel a perfect storm that sweeps the entire global economy into a decade of despair.
By the 2030s, technology and more competent political leadership may be able to reduce, resolve, or minimise many of these problems, giving rise to a more inclusive, cooperative, and stable international order.
But any happy ending assumes that we find a way to survive the coming Greater Depression.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day: Born May 3, 1942: Vera Caslavska, Czech gymnast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: When Vera Caslavska bowed her head and turned away in protest at the Soviet anthem during the 1968 Olympics, the Czech gymnast cemented her place as not only one of the country's greatest athletes but also as a powerful voice against Communist rule.
Two months after Warsaw Pact tanks swept into Czechoslovakia to crush the "Prague Spring" reforms, the anti-Soviet icon dazzled at the Mexico Games, claiming four golds and becoming one of only two women to win successive titles in the all-around competition.
Yet it was her silent moment of defiance as the anthem played during the medal ceremony for the floor exercise, when she controversially shared a joint gold with a Soviet athlete after the judges upgraded the preliminary scores of her rival, that endeared her to Czechs.
It also made her a beloved figure long after her sporting career had ended.
"We Olympians were the only ones who could demonstrate our attitude to the Soviet occupation to the world at that time of occupation," Caslavska said in a 2007 interview with iDNES.cz.
All together, Caslavska took seven golds in her two Olympic Games, including back-to-back wins in the vault. She also won the beam at Tokyo 1964 and the uneven bars in 1968.
Caslavska, who began her sporting career as a figure skater, was also the first and only gymnast to win an all-around title at an Olympic Games before winning it at the World Championships, European Championships and ensuing Olympics.
Her main rival in Tokyo, Ukrainian-born Larisa Latynina, was the only other female gymnast to win successive golds in the all-round competition, in 1956 and 1960.
“She was a phenomenal sportswoman,” Latynina told Reuters after Caslavska died in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. “Vera and I were friends and we would give each other presents. We would also swap vinyl records.”
Czech authorities, however, nearly stopped Caslavska's journey to Mexico City in its tracks after she publicly opposed Soviet rule by signing a dissident manifesto in the spring of 1968.
Forced to hide in the mountains to avoid arrest, the gymnast only gained permission to compete at the last minute.
POTATO SACKS
During her time in hiding, she lifted potato sacks to keep fit and substituted logs for beams to prepare for the games where her dominant performances and decision to use the Mexican Hat Dance as music for one of her routines won the adoration of the local fans.
Caslavska topped off her remarkable Olympics by marrying Czech 1,500 metres champion Josef Odlozil in Mexico City, 24 hours after her competition ended, in an event that drew thousands of well wishers.
Yet her triumph abroad did not translate into a warm welcome at home.
Caslavska was expelled from the Czech sports union and ostracised for criticising the 1968 invasion and refusing to withdraw her signature from the Prague Spring protest movement’s “Manifesto of 2000 Words.”
From 1974 she trained other gymnasts at home and also during a spell in Mexico. Czechs later voted her as the nation's second-greatest athlete after runner Emil Zatopek.
When Communist rule ended in Czechoslovakia in 1989, President Vaclav Havel appointed her his adviser for sport and social issues. She also led the Czech Olympic Committee from 1990 to 1996.
Her personal life following the country's "Velvet Revolution" that ended authoritarian rule in 1989 was not easy.
In 1993 her then ex-husband Odlozil died from injuries suffered in a fall after he was struck by their son Martin during a dispute.
In later years, Caslavska fell into a deep depression but overcame the illness and returned to public life, coaching gymnasts and serving as a mentor to younger Olympians.
She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 and died the following summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adopt a sun bear or terrapin: Wildlife conservationists in Malaysia appeal for donations to ride out COVID-19 impact</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KUALA LUMPUR: On a normal day, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Sandakan, Sabah, would have tourists and schoolchildren coming in droves to see rescued Bornean sun bears, the smallest species of bears, and hiking through part of the Kabili-Sepilok forest complex on elevated walkways.
Since Malaysia’s government imposed a nationwide movement control order (MCO) in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, the centre has fallen quiet. The only activities there now are of the bears roaming the forest enclosure, and the keepers going about feeding their charges and maintaining the centre.
With only essential travel allowed, the country’s tourism has ground to a halt for over six weeks. This has greatly impacted eco-tourism sites like the Bornean sun bear centre, which is also a wildlife conservation and rehabilitation centre for rescued sun bears.
"We depend on tourism revenue for our operations. In 2019, we counted 84,496 visitors through our gates," its founder and chief executive officer Wong Siew Te told CNA. 
The centre has 43 rescued bears and 30 staff members, who are divided into teams in-charge of taking care of the bears, education outreach and tourism. Since its founding in 2008, the centre has released seven rehabilitated bears back into Sabah’s forests.
The Gibbon Conservation Society in Raub, Pahang, is also facing the same predicament. With an aim of rehabilitating the gibbons and releasing them back into the wild, the organisation had always depended on contributions and donations to fund its expenses.
It used to take in volunteers, usually university students studying zoology, to help with preparing the gibbons’ feed, running data collection and helping with the gibbons’ learning enrichment.
Not anymore. Project leader Mariani Ramli said she had stopped taking student volunteers just prior to the MCO, which restricts both domestic and international travel. 
“As it is, one of our four employees is stuck in Kedah, and can’t return to the centre to help. We managed to get a local volunteer to help with the centre’s daily operations,” she said. 
With the MCO disrupting the traditional means of funding for these private wildlife conservation efforts, they are now compelled to re-orientate and source new means of revenue to ensure the animals’ eventual return to the wild is not affected.
FUNDING DRIES UP
Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre is cutting costs wherever it can, but there are fixed costs even though it is temporarily shut. 
“It takes about RM120,000 a month to run the centre and to pay for the bears’ food and medicines, as well as staff salaries,” Wong said.
The centre relies on a local supplier, who sources vegetables from local farmers in another town. Wong said he would not consider switching to other suppliers who might be able to offer a cheaper price for now. 
“Sometimes you have to look at the bigger picture. If I were to start looking for an alternative now, that would mean difficulties and problems up the supply chain. The supplier and farmers in turn would face problems too,” he said.
Along Peninsular Malaysia’s East Coast in Kemaman district, Terengganu, the Turtle Conservation Society’s executive director and co-founder Dr Chen Pelf Nyok said she had never expected a pandemic to hit Malaysia.
But the past nine years educating and working with the local community about conserving the river terrapin along the Kemaman river has borne fruit, she said. Previously, terrapin eggs were part of the locals’ diet, a threat to the population of the riverine turtle known as tuntung in Malay.
“Now they are the ones on hand to help with ensuring that the 700 terrapins hatched at the conservation centre’s incubator are cleaned and fed daily, until they are old enough to be released back into the rivers,” Dr Chen said. 
Besides conservation, the Turtle Conversation Society also carries out education outreach programmes for both government students and home-schoolers to highlight the local fauna and ecosystem. 
The centre derived about one-fifth of its operating budget from small eco-tourism activities, where tourists and visitors could visit the centre and enjoy firefly watching along the Cherating River. The rest came from donations, contributions and merchandising. 
All that is gone now, hit by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting MCO. 
Dr Chen explained that she could not be at the hatchery, as her home was more than 10km from the conservation centre. Instead, work is currently being carried out by a local, Wazel Mahad, 57, who spends about six to seven hours each day to clean the tanks, refill them with fresh water and also feed the turtles. 
“This community-based conservation project was at the back of my mind when we started TCS. It was a long and difficult journey for nine years, but I’m glad it happened, because it has paid off with the local participation,” said Dr Chen. 
DONATION AND ADOPTION CAMPAIGNS
To ensure their continuous operations, the sun bear and river terrapin centres are ramping up promotional efforts for their "adopt an animal" programmes, besides soliciting donations online. 
Donors for specific animals will receive certificates, gifts and updates on the recipient animals. 
In the case of the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, those interested could donate money to a “Share A Bear” campaign for RM300 (US$69) a year, or opt for the more personalised “My Bear” adoption for RM600 a month or RM7,200 a year. 
“I am also writing everywhere to apply for grants. The only issue is that grants are tricky, there are not many organisations which provide that sort of funding and they are usually for a specific project and time frame,” said Wong.
He and his non-bearkeeping staff have turned to social media to drum up financial support.
“I’m actually busier than before the pandemic,” he said, adding that he was scheduled to give a webinar for a US audience at 3am local time the next day. 
Similarly, the Turtle Conservation Society is also running an “Adopt A Terrapin” campaign, with the adoption fee helping to defray the costs of searching for and incubating the eggs for hatching and release later. 
Bulk of the adoption fee will go to microchipping the turtles, Dr Chen explained. This provides another avenue of scientific research come nesting time and if the locals happened upon a turtle carcass.  
Dr Chen is also working with the local women’s community to produce and market local handicrafts such as terrapin-motif batik, batu seremban (five stones game) painted with turtles, tote bags and others. 
“This doesn’t just raise funds for the project, but also provides them with a way to earn a living during the MCO. Many of the men here earn day wages and are itinerant workers. With the MCO, there’s no work coming in, so it’s a way to help the community as well,” she said. 
With everyone working from home, Dr Chen has had to re-orientate herself from doing fieldwork for the moment to learning new skills and settling down to tackle paperwork concerning TCS.
“I will miss out on taking the turtles’ measurements and all this year, but it’s alright, we’ve already built up a large database from the previous years’ sampling. Luckily this MCO wasn’t imposed during nesting season (usually mid-January to mid-March)” she said. 
Meanwhile, Gibbon Conservation Society's Mariani and her team have not run any adoption campaigns, but instead are highlighting the individual gibbons on social media while soliciting for donations in the same post. 
“We’ve cut down and are stretching everything as much as we can," she said. 
Previously, the team had a permit letter to travel to the Selayang wholesale market to buy supplies for the gibbons. The market has a lot of variety and prices are cheaper. 
Her colleague would drive 90 minutes from Raub to the Klang Valley, decked out in their personal protective equipment (PPE), purchase the fruits and vegetables needed and drive back to Raub again.
As an additional measure, Mariani and her staff also turned to home gardening, and occasionally foraging from the surrounding jungle to supplement their food supply. With the Selayang area now under an enhanced MCO, the centre is also sourcing from local farms. 
While adult gibbons are frugivores, infants rescued from illegal wildlife trade still require milk formula until their digestive systems can handle solid food. 
THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME: CONSERVATIONISTS
While the nationwide MCO has been extended to mid-May, majority of businesses have been allowed to reopen from May 4 onwards under a "conditional MCO". 
However, even if the MCO is lifted one day, things would never be the same, all three conservationists noted.
Dr Chen does not foresee resuming the turtle centre’s eco-tourism activities for a long while. A terrapin gallery that Dr Chen and her colleagues set up at Kampung Pasir Gajah in Kemaman will remain closed. Usually, it is visited by people coming from near and far. 
“Life for the centre post-MCO would still be a very cautious one, and we will focus more on education,” she said. Incubation and release would still go on, but she would start exploring alternative channels for her outreach programmes, such as webinars.
The Gibbon Conservation Society’s set-up has also taken on a regimented outlook, with only one staff member designated for supply runs. She undergoes disinfection after every outing.
“Actually, pre-MCO I was already strict about noise levels and human interaction with the gibbons, including who’s to feed the babies and sanitary procedures, to prevent any human-animal disease transmission. Now we’ve just tightened it to make doubly sure,” Mariani said.
The centre will still continue its pared-down operations and continue stretching every ringgit. "Because who knows how long it will be before we can get funds again,” she said. 
For Wong, tourists numbers back to Sepilok and his Bornean sun bear centre are unlikely to achieve their former numbers for the foreseeable future.
“We’ll probably not have tourists coming back until the world economy improves, and it’s safe to fly again. But everything’s for the bears. If it means having to work harder and stay up later, it’s fine,” he said. 
He also appealed for government help, noting that the his centre was assisting in preserving the country’s wildlife heritage, as the bears legally still fell under the Sabah Wildlife Department’s jurisdiction. At the same time, the centre has long been a favourite destination for tourists in Sandakan.
The drop in funds also has the centre rethinking its previous methods of releasing bears into the wild, where a helicopter was chartered to fly the bear in a transport cage into the middle of Tabin Wildlife Reserve, a 1,225 sq km forest near Lahad Datu.
"We released in the middle of Tabin because it was large and very remote from any human settlement. We will need to think about releasing them in other forests closer to Sepilok, and different modes of transport," Wong said.
More worrying for Wong though was the possibility of the sun bears being poached for their bile, especially after bear bile was promoted as a coronavirus treatment by the Chinese government.
“People who are desperate for a cure might hunt bears for their gall bladders, further contributing to the decline of the wild sun bear population,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: UAE Cardiac patients warned against delay in seeking medical help</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Faced with fears about contracting coronavirus, cardiac patients in the UAE are shying away from seeking medical help, even during emergencies, leading to further complications, doctors have warned.
Speaking to Gulf News, they said patients are seeking medical help as late as four to six days after developing symptoms like chest pain and tightness.
Dr Walid Shaker
“In our most recent case, a 44-year-old patient visited the hospital three days after he had started experiencing chest pain. When we carried out an angiogram, we found that his left main coronary artery had narrowed – a condition that can suddenly become life-threatening,” Dr Walid Shaker, cardiothoracic surgeon at Burjeel Hospital Abu Dhabi, said.
“We understand that people prefer to stay at home at a time like this. But it is essential to consult a doctor in case of certain emergencies, especially cardiac ones. Otherwise, they could be risking their lives,” Dr Shaker said.
Dr Brajesh Mittal, interventional cardiologist at Medcare Hospital, Dubai, said 30 to 35 per cent of patients with acute cardiac emergencies have delayed presentation at the hospital, compared to just 10 to 15 per cent before the coronavirus outbreak.
Dr Brajesh Mittal
“Patients are obviously afraid to contract the virus, so they may be hiding symptoms for as long as possible. But it must be remembered that delays in medical intervention can increase complications, including permanent damage to the heart muscles, while also slowing down recovery,” he added.
As Gulf News reported earlier this month, patients have been delaying medical care since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, in an attempt to limit any exposure to the virus.
However, certain emergencies require prompt medical attention, and doctors have to intervene even before patients can be tested for COVID-19.
“In all cases, patients experiencing symptoms like chest pain, tightness and increasing breathing difficulties should at least consult their physicians, especially now that telemedicine options are available,” Dr Shaker said.
When patients present to an emergency department with symptoms, they are first tested for COVID-19. But test results become available only after 48 hours or more, but delaying treatment until then can be dangerous.
“Holding off on treatment until we can confirm if a patient has COVID-19, especially one with acute cardiac symptoms in unstable condition, can prove fatal. So we’ve been undertaking surgeries in full protective gear,” Dr Shaker said.
Over the last month, the surgeon and his team have performed about five surgeries while donning full personal protective equipment, including hazmat suits, N95 masks, as well as surgical gowns for surgeons, assistant surgeons and scrub nurses.
“It is difficult, especially as procedures can last up to six hours, but this is the only way to keep patients and surgical teams safe,” Dr Shaker explained.
According to Dr Mittal, other precautionary measures are also important.
“We minimise the number of medical staff in the cath lab, and only allow cleaning staff to sterilise it after an hour following a procedure,” he said.
The doctor has carried out four emergency cardiac procedures over the last month.
Experts around the world have also observed a 40 per cent reduction in the presentation of cardiac emergencies at healthcare facilities.
“It could be because fewer people are facing myocardial emergencies, perhaps as a result of being largely at home and facing somewhat less stress, or because they are eating healthier. But this trend is not yet fully understood,” Dr Mittal said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Will warm weather slow coronavirus?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Will there be another wave of COVID-19? And if so, how big will it be, and will there be more waves after it?
The answer to those questions depend on seasonality, the susceptibility of the population to the disease, the rate at which the coronavirus mutates and how we come out of lockdown.
Colds and influenza are seasonal because those viruses generally survive outside the body for a shorter time in high heat and high humidity than in cold weather and low humidity. People also spend more time indoors in winter, coming into close contact with others with less ventilation, so respiratory infections are far more common in winter, although of course they can sicken people in summer, too.
But in 1918 and 1919, the years of the world’s deadliest pandemic, the seasons seemed to have little impact on the influenza.
That pandemic had a mild first wave which began in February 1918. It struck relatively few places in the United States or around the world, followed by a lethal second wave which began in Switzerland in late July and spread rapidly around the world from September to December 1918, hitting the Northern and Southern Hemispheres simultaneously. (Australia was hit late; its rigid quarantine of arriving ships delayed the pandemic’s arrival until January 1919, the middle of its summer.) Then a third wave began in February 1919, marking two distinct pandemic waves in the influenza season, a highly unusual occurrence.
Susceptibility clearly was a more important factor than the seasons, because it turned out that the entire world — young and old people on every continent — was susceptible to the disease.
Mutation was also an important factor. It probably accounts for the timing of the third wave in 1919: It seems likely that by then, the virus had changed enough that any immunity to the initial virus didn’t protect well against its mutated form. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that exposure to the first wave provided up to 89 per cent protection against second wave illness (the best vaccine in the last 15 years provided 62 per cent protection), but neither first nor second wave exposure protected against that third wave.
What does all this mean now?
Nothing is certain and little is known about COVID-19, but a few things are likely.
First, modellers estimate that the true number of infected persons is up to 20 times the reported number, which still leaves about 95 per cent of the population susceptible. If, as in 1918, susceptibility proves more important than seasonal influences, hot weather will not give as much relief as hoped for. By the same token, that would mean the expected seasonal surge when colder weather arrives might not be as large as feared.
Second, COVID-19 mutates much more slowly than influenza, and its key spike protein — the part of the virus that attaches to cells — seems particularly stable. Amid all of the bad news that this virus has brought, this characteristic of the virus is a silver lining in several ways.
Since the virus does not mutate nearly as fast as influenza, this reduces almost to zero the chance that it will become more virulent, as happened in 1918. Moreover, because the spike protein is a key part of the virus likely to be recognised by the immune system, then mutation will probably not account for a new wave soon. For the same reason, the consensus view of virologists seems to be that those who recover from the illness probably develop immunity lasting a year and possibly longer, and that a vaccine will most likely protect reasonably well against COVID-19.
Third, the incubation period, on average nearly six days, is roughly triple the average incubation period of influenza, and the disease itself takes much longer for people to recover from and stop shedding virus. Therefore even without social distancing it would take months for the outbreak to pass through a community, as opposed to six to 10 weeks for influenza. With social distancing — necessary to reduce deaths by keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed — it will take even longer. Additionally, the incubation period allows an asymptomatic person more opportunity to spread disease.
But these factors will give the country more time to expand testing and contact tracing, and to isolate and quarantine contacts. All of those are impossible with fast-spreading influenza.
How then do we restart the economy? We cannot simply wait for herd immunity to develop from natural infection. That would take many months and be accompanied by an unacceptable death toll. Nor can we wait a year or more for a vaccine.
Instead, a consensus has formed among public health experts to continue current measures until the epidemic curve bends significantly downward and the stress on health care is alleviated, followed by a phased-in approach guarded by, in effect, a public health army. That army would be fighting a guerrilla war, armed with tests, tracing, isolation and quarantine to search and destroy inevitable flare-ups.
This approach has worked around the world. It will work here. COVID-19 would continue to spread, but the cases would be in manageable numbers. We would see not so much distinct waves as continuous, undulating swells, broken by occasional angry whitecaps.
But if we do not manage our public health response well — for instance, allowing a widespread lifting of restrictions too quickly — we could generate a storm surge that washes away everything gained so far by so much sacrifice. That seems to be what too many politicians seem willing to risk.
Those politicians should consider this: In 1918, San Antonio was one of the slowest cities to close, yet one of the quickest to reopen. As a consequence, more than half of the city’s population got sick, and almost every household had at least one person ill. And COVID-19 is more contagious than influenza.
It’s past time we start doing things the right way. We still lack the testing capacity and anything approaching the necessary public health army. It’s past time we start building both.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Why field hospitals are so important in the battle against COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: As the world watched the coronavirus rage across China two months ago, it also saw the rapid pace at which two hospitals were built.
Within 14 days, the two facilities in Wuhan were set up to provide 2,600 additional hospital beds for those infected with the virus. And when the pictures were revealed, it was clear that these were field hospitals.
Now, as the virus ravages other countries, field hospitals have become a mainstay of coronavirus treatment, with countries ramping up construction and operations to convert existing buildings into fully-fledged hospitals. New York’s first field hospital was set up at the Javits Convention Centre and London converted its massive ExCel London exhibition and convention centre into the NHS Nightingale Hospital.
The UAE has followed suit, opening up its first field hospital at the Dubai World Trade Centre on April 18. Fitted with 300 beds, the facility can be expanded to accommodate 3,000 beds.
Soon after, three other field hospitals were announced, including a 1,000-bed one at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre in the capital, another with 1,200 beds at the Emirates Humanitarian City in Abu Dhabi’s Mohammad Bin Zayed Suburb, and a third with 1,200 beds to be located at the Dubai Parks and Resorts. These will be managed by the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (Seha), Abu Dhabi’s public health provider.
According to Dr Sherbaz Bichu, chief executive officer and specialist anesthetist at Aster Hospitals, the concept of a field hospital is one rooted in the battlefield. This is not surprising, given that much of the current pandemic has been referred to as an ongoing battle against a microscopic enemy.
Dr Sherbaz Bichu
“Field hospitals are common in war zones, where they are set up to a large number of wounded personnel at the same time. In the case of a pandemic, with many people getting people at the same time, they are just as useful,” Dr Bichu explained.
With dozens of beds placed adjacent to one another, these facilities allow for cohort care, where a dedicated team of healthcare professionals care for patients infected with a single infectious agent.
“Cohort nursing is the most obvious advantage of designated field hospitals to treat COVID-19. In such a setting, one nurse can tend to up to a 10-12 patients, instead of just 4-5 at a time. This decreases staffing needs, and as a result, less personal protective equipment is required,” Dr Bichu said.
Because personal protective equipment like masks, gloves and surgical gowns have become valuable commodities in the fight against COVID-19, this is an important benefit.
In addition, all operations are centrally controlled, allowing for quicker decision making as treatment protocols change for a disease that is still being explored and understood, Dr Bichu said.
And, given that many expats in the UAE live in shared housing, the large number of beds at field hospitals allows infected patients recover in in quarantine, away from uninfected roommates and flatmates.
However, field hospitals do have certain disadvantages. For example, privacy can be limited, given that beds are placed in close proximity to one another. Patients also have to share bathrooms, while staff are usually allocated separate bathrooms.
Unlike mainline hospitals, field hospitals have limited surgical intervention capacity.
And because people treated at these field hospitals carry a contagious virus, patients have to be isolated from family members and friends, who cannot visit the facility.
Facilities in the UAE have however overcome many of these challenges.
The Dubai World Trade Centre hospital, which has 300 beds and can be expanded to accommodate 3,000 beds, quickly facilitates hospital transfers for patients in critical condition.
Meanwhile, the 1000-bed ADNEC hospital has curtains installed for privacy between beds at the 1,000-bed ADNEC hospital. In this way, each patient has a pseudo-cubicle to himself.
And going beyond basic amenities, it also offers free high-speed Internet, personal iPads for each patient, as well as access to gym facilities and shared televisions.
“There are 48 urgent care beds with oxygen supply to stabilise critical cases and a plan is in place to transfer critical cases to hospitals in a timely manner,” said Dr Anwar Sallam, group chief medical officer at Seha.
Each bathroom is shared by seven patients, and that the beds are placed in single cubicles.

“This facility has been designated only for male patients, whereas female patients and families will be treated at the Emirates Humanitarian City,” he said. Presumably, this has been done in response to cultural privacy preferences in the UAE.
Abu Dhabi’s field hospitals are designed to manage and treat mild to moderate cases, whereas patients with severe infection, the elderly and children are being treated at mainline facilities.
As announced, each of Seha’s field hospitals will be manned by 150 to 200 medical professionals.
Till date, the number of coronavirus cases in the UAE has exceeded 10,000. It is however hoped that a fully active and advanced healthcare sector, bolstered by multiple field hospitals, will help the vast majority of COVID-19 patients to safely recover from the disease.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19 UAE: Stem cell treatment is supportive, not curative</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: The innovative and promising treatment for COVID-19 infections using stem cells is supportive not curative, it helps patients to defeat the COVID-19 symptoms rather than eradicating the virus itself, a top health official has revealed on Saturday.
While speaking during the UAE Government regular media briefing , Dr. Fatima Al Kaabi, Head of Hematology and Oncology Department at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, and research assistant of the Stem Cell Project, said: “At the Abu Dhabi Stem Cell Center, we are proud to work on developing a supportive treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is undergoing clinical trials for the first time in the UAE, this is a national achievement”.
Dr. Fatima added: “We have successfully passed the initial phase of clinical trials - with 73 patients making full recoveries without any adverse side effects. The recipients were moderately or severely ill before treatment, with 25 per cent of them were at ICUs”.
“We are finalizing data collection to establish the effectiveness of this treatment, comparing a control group with the same characteristics of the patients that received the treatment. Next steps involve evaluating its effectiveness and application to a wider group”.
She further said: “A total of 28 researchers at Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center worked on isolating an early-developed stem cell that maintains regenerative qualities. The procedure is less invasive, only requiring drawing blood from patients, and administration is done via jet nebulization method”.
“After we collect blood and separate cells, we put them through a biochemical process whereby the patient’s own platelets growth factor is used to activate the cells. We believe they are able to regenerate damaged cells, help in repairing pulmonary damage,” Al Kaabi noted.
Dr. Fatima also said: “Stem cells are a special type of cells found throughout the human body. They have multiple characteristics including the ability to transform into other types of cells and reproduce indefinitely to create more of the same cells. The idea behind using stem cells in treatments is to harness their unique characteristics to regenerate cells that do not regenerate on their own”.
She highlighted that stem cells have been used as supportive therapies in many cases, including leukemia and immunodeficiency disorders for more than 30 years.
Also speaking during the briefing was Prof. Alawi Al Sheikh-Ali, Emirates Scientists Council‘s spokesperson.
“The scientific community of the UAE continues to focus on the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). Several research groups across UAE universities are conducting extensive studies to reach a deeper understanding of the virus” Prof. Alawi said.
He added: “A group of researchers from the University of Sharjah and Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences worked on a study to understand why older adults and patients with comorbidities get severe COVID19 symptoms than younger populations”.
Emirates Scientists Council‘s spokesperson noted that the study has found that children have less of specific receptors called (ACE2) in their nasal and lung tissue compared to adults, which make the virus entry possible. Also, the study has found that these receptors are increased in smokers, patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthmatic patients, and patients with pulmonary hypertension.
Another study with collaborative team including Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Sharjah and Al Jalila Children’s Specialty Hospital is examining the relationship between obesity and COVID-19, he underlined.
The findings of the studies contribute to our understanding of why older adults and people with comorbidities may be at a higher risk of infection and develop severe COVID19 symptoms. They also confirm the need to adhere to the precautionary measures set by the UAE Government, he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Who knows where the time goes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Absent any other marker, nature indicates the passage of time. Daffodils and hyacinths give way to roses. Blossoms fall; new leaves bud; pink petals are gone from empty New York streets. Frozen figures in rumpled clothes may note some slight change in the canvas. Who knows where the time goes?
We met in the warm season. We met in the cold season. It becomes possible to imagine time reordered in such a way. Oh, yes, in the warm season, I remember the peonies. A friend tells me her marker of time’s passage in Paris has become the advancing decomposition of a dead rat in the bike lane on her circumscribed daily outing. Who knows where the time goes?
We are all in a box. A smaller or larger Zoom box, depending on the number of people in the conversation. A sidewalk box that sets appropriate social distancing. The box behind the new plastic panels in stores, the box of four too-familiar walls, a mental box of insistent yet unanswerable questions — and in those boxes we are all grieving.
Grieving for a loved one lost to the coronavirus, for lost cities, for lost worlds, for America lost. The virus has revealed a nation in decomposition, incapable of coherence, un-led, angry, disoriented, scattered.
The pathogen itself becomes a political Rorschach test, perceived according to tribal allegiance. The vice-president refuses to wear a mask on a visit to the Mayo Clinic, a wink to one of those tribes. Why the heck did the hospital break its own rules and let him in?
Who would have thought it is possible to become nostalgic for alternate-side New York parking, that implacable marker of the days? Anything is possible; the proof is before our eyes.
Grieving is not missing. We miss conviviality. We grieve for life. For loves lost and retraced, for the precious moment unappreciated. Perhaps at root we grieve for the failure of our imaginations.
That is to say for our inability to grasp what W.G. Sebald, the German writer, called “the ghosts of repetition,” the ever-recurring patterns of dislocation and disaster that punctuate human history until they impose themselves on the present.
A middle-aged woman sits on the steps of a synagogue sobbing. A young woman props her bike against a fence and sobs. It seems indelicate to intrude on such grief. The loss of time itself can engender a terrible emptiness. I see the clock without hands, and the face without features, in the deserted streets of the shattering nightmare sequence in Ingmar Bergman’s “Wild Strawberries.” Who knows where the time goes?
Speaking of dreams, here is another one. A friend finds herself in a cumbersome crude contraption that looks like a beekeeper’s bonnet but is made of sheets of clear plastic screwed together with wood framing. She cannot figure out why it is there, until she learns that banks now require clients to box their faces in this way to get money from an ATM. Perhaps, in intimate circles, the box-bonnet bump will replace the elbow bump.
In our boxes, the great health-versus-wealth debate rages. How, when and where to restart the economy, the appropriateness of this or that trade-off. As if the great trade-offs that produced this dysfunctional America had not already happened.
The trade-offs that disempowered the body politic and democratic practice, and empowered special interests and the wealthy; that starved a health system that might have helped people survive better; that conferred sanctity on soaring executive compensation but not on a decent living wage for the mass of Americans; and on and on and on.
The pandemic is also an urgent call for national and personal reinvention and rebalancing. After the Black Death came the Renaissance. From the depths of economic horror came Roosevelt’s New Deal. From this horror, so far, come the senseless twists and turns of the orange Narcissus.
Bandits hold sway. I have visions of Howard Beale in “Network,” and his that brought screaming Americans to their windows.
“All of humanity’s problems,” said Blaise Pascal, “stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” We are learning. Seeing frenetic consumption for what it was, shuddering at the frantic quest for distraction and status in the time before.
I have been listening to “Who Knows Where the Time Goes?” Fairport Convention, 1969, wonderful song, transporting. Turned time’s arrow backward for me, listening to Pink Floyd in Hyde Park in 1968. An ache, we all feel it now.
A cemetery may seem an unlikely source of solace, but Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, ranging over 478 acres, is a beautiful sanctuary. At the main entrance, a large colony of blue-green parrots has established itself. Urban legend has it the birds escaped from a transport at JFK. I watched them for a while swooping in mesmeric patterns with twigs in their mouths to add to a multistoried nest that appears to need no additions whatsoever. The parrots get on with their DIY anyway.
Stir, breathe, look around, do something. Who knows where the time goes? The birds know.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus UAE: Remote learning workload becoming a stressor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: The coronavirus outbreak may have deemed school unsafe for thousands of children, and positioned remote learning as a viable alternative to continue education. But after more than a month of the new systems, parents are complaining about the extensive workload for children.
Speaking to Gulf News, parents and students said they spend many more hours with schoolwork each day than when regular school was in session. And as the school term drags on, many are asking for an early end to it.
“My five-year-old attends live sessions every day from 9am to 2pm, and I don’t think they go very well. A lot of the time, there are connection issues, background noise and general confusion. Eventually, my daughter is unable to finish her work and has to work on the assignments till 6pm every day,” Akvile Sayf, 34, a Lithuanian marketing executive told Gulf News. Her daughter attends a British curriculum school.
“I am set to go back to work soon, and am also expecting a second child. I honestly don’t know how we will continue lessons then, especially as she needs my help to print out resources and upload her work,” she added.
The UAE implemented remote learning in all schools and universities on March 22 as a means to physically distance children, educators and parents, and ultimately limit the COVID-19 outbreak. Schools were allowed to determine the mix of live sessions and offline assignments required to deliver content to students.
While the nationwide e-learning was greeted by parents, many have since complained about the way learning is organised, especially for younger children who need greater support to carry out tasks.
A parent with children enrolled at an IB curriculum school said there are far too many live sessions during the week, and that these are especially difficult to manage during Ramadan.
“My eldest son is just in KG1, and he has had to attend two live sessions every day for the past month. Suddenly, four more weekly sessions have been added since the start of Ramadan. I have two other younger children to attend to as well. With Ramadan responsibilities, how are we supposed to keep pace with all the work being given?” said S.N., a Jordanian mother.
Another Bangladeshi mother said she has to balance her child’s learning while completing her work responsibilities.
“He is only in KG1, and there is simply too much work for him to do on his own. Because it is not a school environment, it doesn’t make sense to a four-year-old why he suddenly has to do so much learning at home, especially when he was never assigned homework before the remote learning began. So he is often reluctant to learn. In addition, the fact that he has to do these tasks alone, without having his peers to look at, is simply not motivating enough,” she said. The mother said she often has to work with her son in the evenings and on weekends to complete assignments.
The complaints aren’t limited to one curriculum either.
Z.A., a grade 9 student at an Indian curriculum school, said it takes her until the evening to get all her work in order.
“I can’t fully understand why it takes so long, given that our teachers do spend quite a time explaining concepts to us. My guess is I end up spending a lot of time printing lessons and worksheets, and then uploading them later,” she said.
There are also other concerns, with parents saying that the learning is not engaging enough in certain subjects.
“Both my son and daughter finish their work quite quickly, but I’ve noticed that there are no lessons in subjects like Social Studies, and just far too much being assigned in Arabic. In addition, I do feel some of the lessons have been made simplistic,” said Santa Fonseka, 46, a content programmer from Sri Lanka.
Given the multiple challenges with e-learning, a number of parents, especially those with young children who are themselves working from home, said they would prefer an early end to the term, with the holidays adjusted later in the year.
“Children and their parents are stressed out enough, without having to manage the stresses of remote learning, Perhaps it would make better sense to finish the current term early, and shorten the winter holidays later in the year, when the outbreak is controlled,” Sayf suggested.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Khalifa University researchers studying virus load from Abu Dhabi sewage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Estimating the spread of the novel coronavirus in any population has so far proved a challenge, given that many individuals who contract the virus remain asymptomatic or untested.
To get a better understanding of the spread of the virus, researchers at the Khalifa University of Science and Technology have launched a project to estimate the level of the virus in municipal wastewater.
A statement by the university today (May 3) said the project will help surveil the viral load in municipal wastewater as a method for early detection, and for tracking the spread of the coronavirus in the general population.
Studies have so far indicated that people infected with the coronavirus, including asymptomatic individuals, shed the virus through human waste.
“Since the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater should mirror the number of detected infections in the population, testing a municipal wastewater sample will be tantamount to essentially testing everyone who has contributed to that sample - in other words a way of mass testing,” the university’s statement said.
Through this research, Khalifa University aims to establish a surveillance system for COVID-19 in municipal wastewater streams, linking it with simulation models developed for predicting and controlling the spread of the pandemic, together with the health authorities,” said Dr Arif Sultan Al Hammadi, executive vice-president at the University.
The project is led by Dr Ahmed Yousef, assistant professor for Chemistry, Dr Shadi Hasan, associate professor for Chemical Engineering, and Dr Habiba Alsafar, acting associate dean for student affairs at the University’s College of Medicine and Health Sciences. Dr Alsafar is also the associate professor at the Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, and director of the Center for Biotechnology.
Once further studies assess the levels of coronavirus found in COVID-19 patient fecal samples, scientists will be able to construct a model that estimates the total number of symptomatic and asymptomatic people in the population based on wastewater levels.
Similar studies to estimate coronavirus load in wastewater are also being undertaken around the world, and results have already been published by authorities in Netherlands and Paris. However, these papers have not yet been vetted and approved by the wider scientific community as a viable method for estimating the spread of the virus in the general populatioon.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: More than three people can travel in the same car if they are from the same family, police confirmed on Sunday.
An Abu Police spokesperson confirmed this to Gulf News and clarified that such limits were only for taxis and motorists who transport passengers in their vehicles.
Members of the same family should not be concerned about the ruling, the spokesperson added.
Major General Saif Ziri Al Shamsi, Commander in Chief of Sharjah Police said that this decision applies everywhere in the UAE.
“This applies to all Emirates,” he told Gulf News. “Each case is measured according to its circumstances,” he added.
On March 23, the Ministry of Interior and the National Emergency and Crisis and Disasters Management Authority stated that the public are urged to use their own family cars with a maximum of three individuals per vehicle.
It asked all UAE citizens, residents, visitors and all those living in the nation, to comply with the instructions and guidelines issued by competent health and security authorities in order to stem the spread of coronavirus.
Police said members of the same family are permitted to travel in one car and they wouldn’t be fined.
But if the people are not first degree relatives, they will fall under the MoI rules of three persons in a car and violators to the rule will be fined Dh1,000.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Residents experiencing coronavirus symptoms can now get tested for free at all healthcare facilities in Abu Dhabi emirate, the Department of Health (DoH) announced today (May 3).
In addition, free tests are available at all facilities, for the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic diseases.
Today’s announcement means that COVID-19 tests are now being conducted at public and private hospitals and clinics, in addition to those at drive-through screening centres run by Abu Dhabi’s public health provide, the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (Seha).
Other residents who wish to confirm they are virus-free must pay Dh370 to get tested, the DoH said in a statement.
“Testing is one of the key steps to curbing the spread of the virus and one of the most influential preventative measures to maintain the health and wellbeing of the community. This has pushed all [public and private facilities] to come together [and] further expand the scale of coronavirus screening services, thus ensuring its availability and easy access to all members of the community,” the statement added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UAE to develop strategy to deal with aftermath of coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: A national development strategy to deal with the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic will be launched. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, gave instructions to develop the strategy during a video conference meeting of the Cabinet on Sunday.
As per Sheikh Mohammed’s directives, a series of intensive federal and local government meetings featuring ministers, undersecretaries, executive councils and global experts will be held regularly to shape the UAE’s post-COVID-19 strategy.
He called for developing detailed policies in the short and long term to ensure the recovery of economic activity as well as growth and stability across economic and community sectors in the country.
Sheikh Mohammed stressed the importance of engaging brilliant local, Arab and international minds and experts to participate in intellectual and analytical seminars, whose outputs constitute theoretical and practical frameworks for policy-making and setting visions to build new foundations and action mechanisms in all sectors.
The new plans and policies should take into account vital sectors that are key to development and community mobility, primarily health, education, technology and food security.
Sheikh Mohammed underlined that people’s safety, security, well-being and mental health must be at the heart of such policies and plans, and in parallel with state’s foreign policies in coordination with the international community to ensure a global economic and geopolitical cooperation to best address, contain and reduce the consequences of health and environmental disasters.
Sheikh Mohammed also ordered the setting up of a working group to study the dossier of the national medical and pharmaceutical industries in the UAE to develop investment opportunities for the medical industry sector and enhance production capacity.
The team, chaired by the Ministry of Energy and Industry, will roll out an emergency plan to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the medical industries sector as part of preparation for the post-COVID-19 era in the country.
Other teams have been set up to work swiftly in response to daily and rapid changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Our national priorities need to reviewed to cope with the post-COVID-19 world…Our financial and human resources need to be redirected to strengthen our medical, food and economic security through new programmes and projects… Preparing for the post-COVID-19 is preparing for a new future that no one predicted a few months ago,” Sheikh Mohammed said.
During the remote meeting, the Cabinet approved a draft law amending some provisions of the Federal Law on Commercial Companies aiming at strengthening and raising UAE’s rankings on global competitiveness indicators.
The amendment also aims to create an attractive business environment supporting the national economy. The draft law targets companies and foreign investors representing international companies and investment funds.
The Cabinet also approved a federal law regulating the union of landlords to enhance the sustainability of infrastructure and increase community engagement in preserving sustainability of infrastructure within housing projects and residential communities to preserve and ensure sustainability of common properties in communities.
The organisational structure of the Ministry of Justice was approved during the virtual Cabinet meeting, within the framework of upgrading the work system at the ministry in all its sectors, strengthening legislation and the rule of law and upgrading the services provided to customers, which reflects positively on the indicator of competitiveness in the advancement of the UAE’s position at the international level.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: The Higher Sharia Authority (HSA) for financial and banking activities in the UAE held its second meeting of 2020 on April 26.
The meeting was chaired by Sheikh Dr. Ahmed Bin Abdulaziz Al Haddad, the Chairman of the HSA, and attended by members including Sheikh Prof. Dr. Jassim Ali Al Shamsi, Sheikh Issam Muhamad Ishaq, Sheikh Dr. Aznan Hasan, and Sheikh Dr. Usaid Muhammad Adeeb Al Kilani.
The HSA adopted its report for the year 2019, which maps the most significant achievements, initiatives and resolutions conducted during the year.
The authority also discussed COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy and approved a set of Sharia parameters to mitigate the affect on individuals and companies.
It also urged Islamic financial institutions to join their efforts in supporting sectors and individuals affected by the pandemic.
The HSA also issued Sharia parameters related to the postponement of installments for Islamic financial institutions’ customers and how to deal with such postponement from a Sharia perspective, based on the type of transaction and Sharia contracts.
Moreover, the HSA reviewed its agenda and adopted some Sharia standards and parameters for calculating the collections costs incurred by Islamic financial institutions from late payment transactions.
The HSA also discussed issues related to the imposition of fees on loan-based transactions. The Islamic Banking Committee of the UAE Banks Federation will be consulted to identify best practices in this regard.
The HSA also reviewed requests for new financial products submitted by some Islamic financial institutions, and approved the applications that comply with the applicable Sharia standards. The HSA stressed the need to strike a balance between development and innovation in Islamic financial products and the regulatory and Sharia requirements.
Furthermore, HSA reviewed the requests submitted by Islamic financial institutions regarding the approval of annual Sharia reports, the appointment of members of the Internal Sharia Supervision Committees, and the heads of the Internal Sharia Control and Sharia Audit Departments, and issued resolutions in this regard.
To further improve the role of Internal Sharia Supervision Committees in Islamic financial institutions, the HSA was instructed to prepare a charter template for the Internal Sharia Supervision Committees based on best practices and to initiate a consultation about it with Islamic financial institutions.
The HSA completed the discussion of the remaining topics listed on the agenda and undertook the necessary action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PhD candidate at QF homegrown university talks about air pollution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doha: Air pollution is harmful — we know that — but it becomes deadly in a global pandemic of a disease that attacks the lungs. With water quality taking precedence, it may seem that the quality of air we breathe is taken for granted. Polluted air has killed millions around the world, and a large number of deaths caused by COVID-19 have been linked to pre-existing health conditions similar to diseases caused by air pollution, according to Hanadi Al Thani. 
Studies have shown that over the past few years, air quality in Qatar, especially in its major urban centres, has been deteriorating due to rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and increasing traffic. Qatar is also known to have a dusty climate, and Al Thani’s research is in close relation to the impact this has on human health and environment. 
“For example, we have found out that 60 percent of this dust comes from natural resources while the rest comes from human activities such as transportation and construction. While the natural sources of dust might not impose critical health impacts, it still stimulates allergic reactions, such as asthma, in a large number of children and adults.
“Hence, we have recommended several sustainable policies and solutions for air pollution problems in urban areas, including planting certain types of trees that have proven efficiency to enhance air quality such as Samar and Sidra trees. These findings can be relevant to other countries in desert regions as well,” Al Thani, a Ph.D. candidate at Qatar Foundation’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University’s Environmental Sustainability programme, said. 
With the current pandemic forcing everyone to stay indoors, air quality in various parts of the world has improved. Satellite images of China, for example, showed a dramatic reduction in air pollution. And research has shown a drastic “decline in NO2 concentrations compared to early January when power plants were operating at normal levels in industrial locations,” said Al Thani. 
In Qatar, traffic has reduced by a large measure due to online work practices and the closure of malls and recreation areas, and “this would have significant impact on air quality – reducing harmful emissions much below the normal levels. Hence, it is expected that fewer asthma and emergency entries, due to respiratory diseases related to dust, would be admitted to hospitals,” Al Thani said.  But the question remains – if air quality has improved amid the current lockdown, are there lessons to be learned for future actions and policies? 
“Indeed, this is a very important point to highlight. Although the current situation has improved the air quality in Qatar and other parts around the world, we have learned many lessons from COVID-19,” said Al Thani.  The first lesson is that work and learning can be successfully accomplished online, she says. Also, that people should maintain hygiene and implement safe distancing while shopping for necessary items. Al Thani suggests that although the long-term impact is unpredictable, especially if life goes back to normal once the crisis ends, it is the responsibility of governments to implement strict measures on the use of transportation and other emission polluting practices where a balance is achieved between productivity and acceptable air quality.
As someone who is at the forefront of research that is designed to help build a more sustainable Qatar, and as a mother of four and a researcher, Al Thani’s vision of herself was to contribute to building a sustainable environment in Qatar. “It was something I have always aspired to do and it’s only the beginning for me as my research will expand,” she says. But surely her contribution comes with a tough ask – of balancing her work life and her personal life. 
“There is no perfect formula to balance being a mother and having so many commitments. If I did, I would solve a lot of mothers’ problems. Sometimes I wish there were 30 hours instead of 24 in a day, but I work with what I have. 
“Compromise is my solution, and it is something I learned to do quite well. I may not be doing activities with my kids every afternoon, but I will make sure to make it up to them during the weekends.
“The love for STEM fields is growing nowadays with all the exciting new breakthroughs and I would love my children to explore them. And there is no better way of encouraging them than to do it myself first.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Blood pressure patients are more susceptible to complications from COVID-19, says HMC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doha: Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) has warned that patients with high blood pressure may be at greater risk of developing severe complications if they are infected with coronavirus (COVID-19), therefore they must take more preventive measures to prevent this infection.
Dr Mawahib Ali El Hassan, Acting Director of the Coronary Intensive Care Unit (CICU) at HMC's Heart Hospital said patients who have high blood pressure may be more susceptible to complications from COVID-19 and should take extra precautions to avoid contracting the virus.
"We don't yet fully understand why people with poor cardiovascular health and high blood pressure seem to be at higher risk for more severe illness from this virus, but what we do know is that COVID-19 puts a strain on the lungs and this also burdens the heart. For this reason, it is extra important that anyone who has poor cardiovascular health takes extra precautions," said Dr El Hassan.
"COVID-19 is a new coronavirus so we are still learning about its pathology, including how it attacks the body. Available data from China, where the virus originated, seems to indicate that individuals with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are among those who experienced worse outcomes. We strongly encourage people with these conditions to exercise a greater degree of prevention and protection," said Dr. El Hassan.
Dr. El Hassan explains that high blood pressure means the heart must work harder to pump blood around the body. She says high blood pressure causes the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart to lose their elasticity and narrow, which places individuals with the condition at an increased risk for a heart attack. She says patients with high blood pressure should not panic but they should ensure they follow their doctor's instructions and take extra precautions to prevent contracting the virus.
"It's normal for people to feel concerned, especially if they have a preexisting medical condition. My advice for any patients with high blood pressure is to follow prevention guidelines around personal hygiene and social distancing, which includes avoiding places where they might encounter crowds, like busy grocery stores. They should also continue to follow whatever direction they've been given by their doctor, including taking any prescribed medications. It is also really important for people to ensure they are getting information about COVID-19 from reliable sources, like the Ministry of Public Health and the World Health Organization (WHO)," says Dr. El Hassan.
Dr. El Hassan says defensive steps everyone can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include avoiding people who are sick, thoroughly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with unclean hands, and frequently cleaning surfaces touched often, like doorknobs, handles, steering wheels, and light switches.
The Ministry of Public Health has established a dedicated website (www.moph.gov.qa) to provide the public with updates on the current situation as well as information on how to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. A hotline (16000), which is available 24-hours a day to answer COVID-19 related queries, and an educational social media campaign have also been launched, with the MoPH, HMC, and Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) sharing infographics and videos through their social media channels.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inside the extraordinary race to invent a coronavirus vaccine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ian Haydon, a healthy 29-year-old, reported to a medical clinic in Seattle for a momentous blood draw last week.
"Oh yeah," said the nurse taking his blood. "That is liquid gold."
Haydon is an obscure but important participant in the most consequential race for a vaccine in medical history. In early April, he was among the first people in the United States to receive an experimental vaccine that could help end the coronavirus crisis. He volunteered to be a test subject while knowing about the risks and unknowns, but eager to do his part to help end the worst pandemic in a century.
Scientists at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, will study blood from Haydon and others for signs that the vaccine triggered an immune response to a pathogen they have never encountered. It would be the first, preliminary signal the vaccine could provide immunity to covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.
A coronavirus vaccine has become the light at the end of a very long tunnel, the tool that will bring the virus to heel, allowing people to watch sports in stadiums, hug friends, celebrate weddings and grieve at funerals. The goal to deliver a vaccine in 12 to 18 months, often repeated by the nation's top infectious disease scientist, has become the one reassuring refrain during the crisis. The White House put together a task force called Operation Warp Speed to try to move even faster, making hundreds of millions of doses ready by January.
With at least 115 vaccine projects in laboratories at companies and research labs, the science is hurtling forward so fast and bending so many rules about how the process usually works that even veteran vaccine developers don't know exactly what to expect.
Scientific steps that typically take place sequentially over years - animal testing, toxicology studies, laboratory experiments, massive human trials, plans to ramp up production - are now moving in fast-forward and in parallel. Experts keep using the word "unprecedented."
It's a thrilling time in vaccine science, but also an unnerving one.
U.S. regulators are firm they won't sacrifice safety for speed, but some ethicists raise concerns about "pandemic research exceptionalism," in which the demand to speed a vaccine to market could come at the expense of evidence and end up fueling the powerful anti-vaccine lobby.
"The 26 years it took us to make the rotavirus vaccine is pretty typical. If it's 12 to 18 months, you're skipping steps," said Paul Offit, who developed a vaccine for rotavirus, which causes deadly diarrhea in infants and children. "Is that a little risky? Yes it is, but so is getting infected with the virus."
Designing a vaccine
On a weekend in early January, scientists at Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company outside of Philadelphia, began designing a vaccine for a mysterious pneumonia that didn't even have a name.
They, like other teams around the world, used the genetic blueprint of the novel coronavirus, shared online by Chinese scientists, as their guide.
It took about three hours to design the vaccine, said Joseph Kim, chief executive of Inovio.
Scientists at NIH had been in talks about partnering with a Massachusetts biotechnology company, Moderna, and immediately began designing another vaccine candidate. By the end of the month, it was in production in a factory filled with robots in a suburb south of Boston.
With an array of promising vaccine technologies fueled by early scientific openness, dozens of vaccine efforts kicked off blindingly fast in dozens of countries.
"Then, the tough work began," Kim said.
Designing a promising vaccine is, in some ways, the easy part. Showing that it is safe and effective, and then scaling up production can takes years, or even decades. Researchers are now trying to compress that timeline in ways they never have before, against a type of virus they have never successfully quelled. In some cases, they are also harnessing technologies that have never been used in approved vaccines. In contrast, scientists develop a new flu vaccine each year, an effort that is more of a "plug and play" situation, where a time-tested basic platform can be redirected to fight new flu strains.
"It's another reason for better preparedness," said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, pointing out that his lab had developed a vaccine for MERS, a related coronavirus, but only got it through mouse studies. "If we'd taken at least two to three vaccine concepts through early phase clinical trials on MERS, we might have a better idea on what to focus on for this SARS coronavirus - so instead of working with 115 different vaccine ideas, we might be working on five."
Scientists at Oxford University have announced the most aggressive timeline, with plans to make their vaccine - which depends on a weakened cold virus that typically infects chimpanzees - available in the fall.
Moderna and Inovio are developing vaccines that ferry two different types of genetic material into cells to train the immune system to recognize the distinctive "spike" protein on the surface of the coronavirus. A Beijing company is trying an inactivated virus. Giant pharmaceutical companies, flush with government funding, are turning their vaccine platforms toward coronavirus. Researchers at Texas A&M University are repurposing an existing tuberculosis vaccine to see if it can prevent deaths or severe illness.
To make things more difficult, as the infection spread across the world, scientific teams have had to change how they work, practicing social distancing in their labs so the virus doesn't take out the effort to combat it. That happened at NIH, when one scientist became infected with covid-19 and two close colleagues on the effort had to quarantine for 14 days.
Graham's Vaccine Research Center is working with only about 10% of its people coming in, and his laboratory - which usually houses 20 people - can only have two at any one time.
Meanwhile, the difficult laboratory science, such as animal testing, is in many ways, being leapfrogged or running in tandem with testing in people.
"This is unusual," Kim said. "It's really moving at lightning speed with the urgency to match it."
Typical trials need time 
Many researchers can describe how vaccines are typically developed. But they can't say precisely how the coronavirus vaccines will come about. So much will depend not just on the science, but on how the outbreak evolves, how flexible regulators decide to be and what we continue to learn about the virus in real time.
Philanthropist Bill Gates argues things can't really return to normal until the world's 7 billion people are vaccinated - a daunting scenario that could take years and create a new kind of public strife, as governments and individual people scramble for limited doses. More than one vaccine will likely be needed, because the first one may not be as effective as the follow-ons.
The front-runner vaccines in the U.S. have never been made at an industrial scale, and some vaccines require two doses to be given, further complicating scale-up.
"We really have never made those kinds of vaccines in large, large quantities. How quickly can that be done?" said Kathryn Edwards, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
"We're not going to be able to say in 18 months that we have enough for all the world's people to be immunized with two doses."
Typically, human clinical trials occur after extensive animal testing. Then, a small number of human subjects receive the vaccine in a phase 1 trial intended to determine the safety and the right dosage.
People are monitored for any side effects, as well as early hints that the vaccine works. After carefully analyzing that data, companies decide to proceed to a larger phase 2 trial in several hundred patients, which look for signs the vaccine is working. Then, they could proceed to a large phase 3 trial in which people are randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a dummy shot - a definitive test of safety and effectiveness, which often take thousands of patients and several years.
Offit, who is helping advise the U.S. vaccine effort, said the "large" trials being considered that he is aware of range from 1,000 to 6,000 people that would likely take place over months. In contrast, when he developed a vaccine against rotavirus, the pivotal trial included 70,000 healthy infants over four years. The human papilloma virus vaccine was tested in 30,000 people.
"Those are typical trials," Offit said. "They tell you, pretty comfortably, that the vaccine is effective - and to some extent, that it doesn't have an uncommon side effect."
No one is talking about that for coronavirus.
Moderna, the company that manufactures the vaccine that Haydon received, plans to start its next larger trial in 500 to 600 people this spring, according to Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer. He said the company began planning the trial nearly a month ago, even though it was still giving shots to the first human subjects.
"We said, 'We cannot wait,'" Bancel said.
Instead of holding off until the subjects have signs in their blood that the vaccine works, they are going to proceed to the next trial as soon as it shows safety. Bancel said Moderna hopes to sign a contract soon with a government agency so that they can start manufacturing and stockpiling the vaccine before approval. They could have 100 million doses ready to go on day one, if it is approved in a year.
Regulators insist that even under unprecedented urgency, products will be held to a high safety bar.
"My motto is a woodworking one: Measure twice, cut once. Measure quickly twice, cut quickly once," said Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.
But vaccine experts point out that many rare safety problems can only be picked up in very large studies, or even through monitoring after a vaccine has deployed. They are most concerned about the risk the vaccines could actually make the disease worse in some people, as happened in some animal studies of vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), through a mechanism called antibody dependent enhancement.
In 1966, for instance, an experimental vaccine for RSV, a common respiratory virus in children, backfired when some children developed more severe disease. Scientific debate is still raging about a dengue vaccine used in the Philippines in recent years that increased the risk of hospitalization for dengue in children who had not previously been infected.
The public's health - and the trust in vaccines generally, considered one of the most successful public health interventions in human history - will be guarded by regulators, even as the political pressure intensifies to get a vaccine into broad use.
"They're good at holding the line, and aren't going to do anything that's reckless, because if they did it could jeopardize the whole U.S. vaccine effort, especially with the anti-vaccine lobby," said Peter Jay Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
Human trials 
One way to speed up vaccine development is "human challenge" experiments, in which people are intentionally infected with the virus after being vaccinated. While the idea has gained steam among some scientists, people working on vaccine trials said it is an ethically challenging approach they would be uncomfortable with unless an effective treatment is discovered.
"Right now, I think it's a little premature. However, it's not off the table," said Wilbur Chen, chief of the adult clinical studies section in the University of Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. "I think it could be something that could be done; it could help us to really evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine much more quickly."
Volunteers for such a challenge effort have already flooded an online sign-up created by a grass roots group of researchers. Scientists are hopeful that enthusiasm will fill up all the trials necessary to prove the vaccines work. That will mean people willing to be test subjects for unproven vaccines with thinner-than-usual animal evidence behind them. It will mean people volunteering for trials in which half of them get a placebo. It may mean people weighing a vaccine whose benefits and risks aren't fully known against the risk of the virus.
Haydon, who is due for his second shot of the vaccine next week, said he'd never participated in a research study but was eager to assist.
"I'm incredibly hopeful we'll arrive at a vaccine," he said. "But in order to do that, we need clinical trials - and at some point, for each new vaccine and each new drug, that has to go into someone for the first time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Qatar eyes new medicine showing positive results in COVID-19 treatment</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Qatar is eyeing to bring a new medicine which has shown potentially effective results in the treatment of COVID-19 patients during trials, said a health official.
“Recently some results of the experiments which were conducted by the US on using a new medicine called ‘Remdesivir’ for coronavirus patients were found effective somehow,” said Dr. Abdul Latif Al Khal, Head of the Infectious Diseases Division at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) while speaking to Qatar TV yesterday.
He said that the new medicine which is administered through veins of critical cases of coronavirus showed help in alleviating the symptoms of disease in the patients in 11 days instead of 15 days and the mortality rate also reduced from 11 percent to 8 percent.
“We are awaiting more results and details of the experiments on the new medicine and also awaiting when this medicine is made available to buy and provide to the patients in Qatar,” said Dr. Al Khal. He said that there are a number of medicines which are being used for the treatment of coronavirus patients and the medicine is being given when needed.
“However, cases that do not show the symptoms or carrying very mild symptoms are not given medicines of coronavirus,” said Dr. Al Khal. He said that the patients suffering from coronavirus severely with symptoms like high temperatures and breathing problems are being given medicines like hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and others which help in treatment and recovery.
Dr. Al Khal called upon people to not come out from homes at the time when the positive cases are on spike except in the cases of utmost need. He said that people should wear face masks while going out and interacting with others. “They are also needed to keep sanitising their hands and keep safe distance, at least two meters, especially when they are in public places like shopping complexes,” he added.
He said that Qatar is tracing and screening all cases which came in the contacts of the confirmed positive cases of coronavirus. 
“The Ministry of Public Health dispatches immediately a medical team to the accommodations and work places of infected people to screen all those came in their contacts,” said Dr. Al Khal.
He said that sometime thousands of people of contacts were screened in a day which led to detect more cases that did not show any symptoms of coronavirus but if they were left without screening, they might cause spreading virus largely.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Social media, technology and COVID-19: View from QCRI scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doha: From disseminating important information to assisting in potentially life-saving research and development, various forms of technology have a leading role in Qatar’s and the wider world’s response to COVID-19. 
Experts from Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) at Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) outline how social media platforms are tackling the spread of false information, AI’s contribution to research activities, and more.
According to Dr. Kareem Darwish, a principal scientist at QCRI’s Arabic Language Technologies, and Dr. Faisal Farooq, Head of Digital Health research at QCRI, false information concerning COVID-19 includes conspiracy theories, fake cures and questionable political motivations.  Popular conspiracies include suggestions that symptoms are caused by sarin gas and that 5G towers are behind the genetic mutation of the virus. Other theories claim that COVID-19 is a hoax designed to subdue and track people, or the work of a secret cabal bent on eliminating populations to save the environment. The effects of such rumors include the creation of a sense of helplessness and complacency among communities.  
Social media is currently awash with outlandish cures and remedies for COVID-19. It’s been claimed, for example, that alcohol, tobacco and even cow’s urine are useful for treating symptoms. The politicization of COVID-19 is equally – if not more – controversial. For instance, supporters of Donald Trump initially pushed the narrative that liberals were exaggerating the effects of the virus to undermine support for the US President. Similarly, followers of Narendra Modi have attributed the spread of COVID-19 around India to the Muslim missionary group Tableeghi Jaamat after some of its members tested positive following a religious gathering.
Dr. Faisal Farooq
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have consistently pointed users to the World Health Organization (WHO) website for reliable information concerning COVID-19. Our research also highlights that many social media users have been actively dispelling rumors and discrediting sources.  This is a positive sign, says Dr. Darwish and Dr. Farooq.
“We’ve also observed that open social media platforms have been more successful in reducing fake news and rumors than their messaging counterparts, such as WhatsApp. Similarly, many of these platforms have created dedicated aggregators that distill information from articles, news and organizational posts while providing access to reliable information in a consolidated manner. Nonetheless, some rumors have made their way around social media at an alarming rate.  You know you are in trouble when you receive the same video mentioning a specific rumor or conspiracy theory multiple times on WhatsApp,” they said. 
Similarly, under the compassionate use criteria many experimental drugs - or drugs approved for other diseases - are being tested on patients. This is resulting in a large number of trials, vast amounts of literature and the generation of new clinical data. AI and other data mining technologies are being utilized to generate insights from this data to answer high priority scientific questions. For example, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD19) released by various organisations is now part of a strategic call to the scientific community from the White House for contributions. This includes the discovery of novel treatments or the off-label use of approved medicines, says Dr.  Darwish and Dr. Farooq. 
Also artificial Intelligence is being applied to various aspects of the pandemic. For instance, China has deployed an AI radiology tool that uses CT images to diagnose COVID-19. This helped the country to overcome a shortage of test kits, which otherwise remains the standard practice within the scientific community. Variants of AI technology were also used to identify and track possible outbreaks and disease clusters, as well as patients entering quarantine and self-isolation. 
“Researchers are also using AI to identify novel and existing drug candidates based on molecular structure and protein interactions. While this does not obviate the need for lab testing, it significantly speeds up candidate generation. Elsewhere, research is ongoing into a data-driven approach to predict various end points like severity, length of recovery and mortality. If successful, this approach will prove extremely useful in situations where proper resource utilisation is critical,” says Dr.  Darwish and Dr. Farooq.

    <h5 class="mb-1">QF webinar urges individuals to reduce food wastage</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Qatar Green Building Council  (QGBC) of Qatar Foundation (QF) has hosted a webinar to discuss easy methods that can be incorporated into daily lifestyles to reduce food wastage, in the present pandemic situation.  
Experts discussed methods of responsible shopping and how governments make policies to reduce food wastage. 
The webinar featured Nodoka Nakamichi, Co-Founder/Marketing and PR Manager, QUBE; Kim Wyatt, TV Presenter and Food Writer & Co-Director; and Aisha Al Maadeed, Founder, Greener Future at the webinar. The discussion was led by Ruba Hinnawi, Technical Coordinator QGBC.
Food wastage accounts for around 7-10 percent of global greenhouse gases, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. And, in Qatar alone, nearly 60 percent of the total domestic waste is organic, and comes from within the home. 
In the backdrop of this situation, when COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic — and nations began locking down — stockpiling goods became a worldwide issue, and in turn many perishables were wasted. 
Nakamichi said that the freezer can be our best friend. “If you can see that things are going to go off, put it in your freezer. I think people will be surprised with the amount of things you can actually freeze for later consumption.” 
Wyatt also spoke in the same lines and said that people should utilize their freezer – it’s as it is  great way of reducing food wastage.  
“And saving money, too. The other plus on reducing food wastage and storing it well is that you will save money, reducing your food bill and reducing the amount of times you need to go to the supermarket,” she added. 
Another key topic within the discussion was about holy month of Ramadan, which started last week, and how, because of COVID-19, the world is experiencing a new side of the holy month, including smaller tables and no gatherings. 
“Statistically, Ramadan is one of the peak times of the year for excess food wastage, and I think that’s certainly a cultural part of society, because food is love. And like any celebration, we want to share with our guests; we want to show our appreciation and our love. And it’s prevalent throughout different cultures around the world, be it birthdays, weddings, or other occasions,” said Wyatt. 
While AlMaadeed suggested solutions such as portion control and asking family members what they would like for Iftar ahead of preparing meals. 
The panelists also addressed how to choose produce at supermarkets highlighted the importance of seasonal buying.  “Things that are in season have the least carbon footprint because there is less storage. Buy local produce. Qatar is doing a great job at growing vegetables locally — they’re expanding every week, growing so many different varieties. I think the most important thing we can do is support the local market,” said Nakamichi.  
Panelists also called for new government policies and legislation by citing South Korea, which has reduced the nation’s food wastage immensely. But the panellists agreed that reducing food wastage is about individuals taking small, sustainable steps.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">euronews_icons_loading
Dogs in Corsica are being trained by the emergency services to try to detect people who may be infected with coronavirus.
Firefighters in Ajaccio are doing this by using sweat samples from COVID-19 patients who've agreed to be part of the trial.
Corporal Mar Anto Costa, a firefighter based in Ajaccio, said: "Dogs are known for their capacity to recognise other diseases including cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers and even diabetes, although it has not been officially proven.
"What remains to be proven is whether the COVID-19 molecule emits a particular odour."
The samples are placed in particular places to see if the dogs can then detect them.
Brice Leva, another Coriscan firefighter, said:
"It's simply a plastic tube by which the smell is placed, leaving the smell-emitting molecules. And then, with these plastic tubes, we train the dogs."
If this test is successful and the results are confirmed, it would allow rapid and massive screening of the population.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hawksmoor strives to outlive coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">March was meant to be a moment of triumph for Hawksmoor: after six years of planning, the UK steak house chain’s first international outlet was due to open in New York, selling prime British beef to a city that knows a thing or two about grilled meat.
But the spread of coronavirus to the US stopped Hawksmoor in its tracks: the opening of the New York restaurant was postponed and staff were told by management to go home. With Covid-19 also sweeping through the UK, the company shut its eight outlets in London, Manchester and Edinburgh.
“The whole thing was burning,” said Hawksmoor founder Will Beckett, alluding to the devastating impact on the company of lockdowns in the UK and the US.
“The US launch was going to be the highlight of our careers. We were busy, our reputation was great. We’d worked towards this for six years. Then we had to close it all down.”
Hawksmoor was founded by Mr Beckett and his best friend Huw Gott in 2006 as a place to buy top quality steak. It is a favourite haunt of City of London traders, with its breakfast for two (including bacon chop, sausages, black pudding, and short-rib bubble and squeak) washed down with a Corpse Reviver No 2 (gin, triple sec, Cocchi Americano, lemon and absinthe) the stuff of legend for hungover workers. 
Until February, Hawksmoor had been having one of its best years yet, with the number of staff rising to about 700. The company was generating £45m of revenue, and £6.5m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
But on March 20 prime minister Boris Johnson ordered restaurants, pubs and cafés to close to try to halt the spread of the virus, and then three days later unveiled a nationwide lockdown, instructing people to stay at home. “We call it ‘that Tuesday’ in the trade,” said Mr Beckett, referring to the morning after the lockdown announcement.
Hawksmoor’s sales fell to nothing. The company responded by making more than 300 of its most recent recruits redundant, said Mr Beckett, to enable the remaining 400 staff to stay to “rebuild the business on the other side”. When the government set up its job retention scheme — under which the state pays 80 per cent of company employees’ wages — Hawksmoor rehired the laid-off staff and immediately furloughed them.
Like other sectors, restaurants are now waiting nervously to learn whether the government will stop the job retention scheme on its scheduled expiry date of June 30 — a move that could threaten millions of jobs across multiple industries.
More importantly, restaurants have no idea when they can reopen, although Mr Johnson is this week due to unveil an exit strategy from the lockdown that should enable sectors to reopen, probably on a staggered basis. The hospitality industry risks being at the back of the queue, and continued strict rules around social distancing could be devastating for restaurants.
“We need a fighting chance,” said Mr Beckett. “The worst will be ending the support schemes while also telling people to stay away — that would mean lasting damage to the restaurant sector.”
Hawksmoor tried to access the government’s bailout loans to help the company through the pandemic, but was turned down by one of the banks that administer them. The coronavirus business interruption loan scheme provides interest free loans for a year for small companies with an annual turnover of up to £45m, but it has been widely criticised for its slow rollout and the strict qualification criteria being applied by banks. 
The restaurant sector feels particularly hard done by, with many companies struggling to pass the viability test contained in the loan scheme given they have no revenue because of closure.
Hawksmoor’s inability to access the scheme partly results from how it has fallen foul of an EU directive that is meant to stop companies in long-term financial difficulty from benefiting from state aid.
Hawksmoor’s income statement records losses stemming from how private equity group Graphite went about purchasing a 51 per cent stake in the company in 2013, even though the steak house chain is profitable at an operating level. 
“We are exactly the sort of company that the government-backed loan scheme was designed to save: profitable, successful and growing,” said Mr Beckett.
The EU directive was not the first obstacle raised by the banks, added Mr Beckett, who was initially told the company was too successful for the state loan scheme and should instead use commercial credit. Then he was told the lack of revenue was a problem.
“We feel powerless but are still talking to our banks about how to get around it,” he said.
Meanwhile, if he had not taken the radical decision to stop paying rent on Hawksmoor’s outlets to its landlords, Mr Beckett said the company would only have enough cash to see it through to the end of the summer.
“We are not paying rent. We can’t,” he said of Hawksmoor’s £2m annual property bill.
He added he was sympathetic to the plight of landlords, but said the relationship with tenants needed to be reset. He is a supporter of a campaign for the government to bring in nine-month rent deferrals across the hospitality sector. “The government needs to step in otherwise the failure rate among restaurants will be astronomic,” he said.
Without the burden of rent, Hawksmoor can make it through the rest of the year in a mothballed state.

Starting up again will be tough, said Mr Beckett. Above all, restaurants need customers, and he said the government must be clear in any future advice that people are safe to return to public places before telling the sector to go back to work.
“Restaurants have to be busy,” said Mr Beckett. “They operate on such thin margins at the best of time. We need a road map from the government about what’s going to happen. We can’t make the same mistakes on the way out as we did on the way in.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From the dawn on time, humans have manipulated the material world around us to suit our will. We started off banging rocks together before moving on to wielding bronze and then iron tools. We parlayed iron into steel and built an industrialized existence before entering the modern silicon era. But there is one ancient technology without which today’s world would not exist: glass. Because without glass, we’d likely never have uncovered the true nature of cathode rays. CRT televisions and monitors would not have been devised, nor would the subsequent smartphone screen you’re reading this text on.
In her latest book, The Alchemy of Us - How Humans and Matter Transformed One Another, Pulitzer-prize winning author Ainissa Ramirez takes readers on a fascinating journey through the stories of eight inventions — from clocks and copper wiring to light bulbs and hard drives — that have fundamentally altered (both intentionally and unintentionally) the ways in which we live our lives. In the excerpt below, Ramirez examines the efforts of an absent-minded 19th century British scientist along with the labware that allowed him to uncover the existence of electrons and usher in the modern era.

Long before the Great War, in 1895, science and magic were hard to separate. That year, Wilhelm Roentgen took a ghostly picture of his wife’s hand using mysterious rays that showed her bones. These invisible rays, later called X-rays, shot out of a contraption made of metal and glass that looked like something out of Dr. Frankenstein’s laboratory. Newspapers packed their pages with depictions of a person’s insides on the outside, and readers snatched up copies. Scientists were also enchanted by X-rays. Some of them wanted to know what else they could do. Others wondered where they came from. All these scientists understood that a battery attached to a stretched glass globe spawned a glowing stream called a cathode ray, and when this cathode ray collided with a piece of metal inside the globe, out came X-rays. Their thinking was that there must be more to these cathode rays. So while the whole world was wowed with X-rays, a few scientists were hoping to find the next great thing in cathode rays. Little did they know that this bright stream would explain how the world worked.
Cathode rays had been known for decades, but there was little consensus about their origin, and eventually the case went cold. With the renewed interest in them, scientists obsessed over every move of cathode rays, writing articles with reports of their behavior, though not yet knowing that cathode rays held a key to their science understanding. Locked in those cathode rays was the currency of all chemical reactions. Locked in those cathode rays was the answer to science questions from how toasters work to how planets were born. Locked in those cathode rays were the droplets that powered a river of modern technologies from televisions to computers to cellphones. Unbeknownst to these early scientists was that inside the cathode ray was a part of the atom that they didn’t know existed—the electron. But deciphering the puzzle of cathode rays required uncovering clues. Just as the popular character Sherlock Holmes used his intellect and his magnifying glass to solve mysteries, scientists too had to observe cathode rays under glass. For some scientists, this puzzle was too delicious to turn down, and Joseph John Thomson was one of them. It was this short man from the nineteenth century who would make the giant leap that made the technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries possible.
Thomson’s potential in answering one of the biggest questions of his day seemed doubtful when he was fourteen years old in 1870. All he wanted to be was a botanist. As a small boy growing up near the city of Manchester, England, he spent all his pocket money on weekly gardening magazines. His father, a modest bookseller, wanted him to have a stable trade as an engineer. Being an engineer was good work, as Manchester’s textile mills turned American cotton into goods. To please his father, J. J., as Joseph John Thomson was nicknamed, attended Owen’s College in Manchester in 1870. But when his father died, J. J. scrambled to stay in school by winning scholarships. He entered Trinity College in Cambridge to study mathematics, choosing the beauty of numbers, instead of their utility, as in engineering. Walking on the hallowed grounds that Sir Isaac Newton strolled was an achievement for any son of a bookseller. But J. J. never fit in.
J. J. may not have felt at home at this old university, but his genius certainly was at home there. By 1895, Thomson was the thirty-nine-year-old head of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, blossoming into an absentminded mathematics professor. His eyeglasses had two positions—one on his nose, which meant he was thinking, and the other on his forehead, which meant he was thinking more. He did not trouble his brain with worry about his appearance so his hair was long, his mustache overgrown, and his chin badly shaven. His brain was congested with abstract ideas, so his new research on cathode rays meant there’d be even less space to worry about ordinary things.
Uncovering the origin of the cathode rays was a perfect puzzle for J. J. because it challenged him by linking abstract ideas with observable events. Cathode rays shot from one electrical connection to another inside of a glass tube without air, and there were two dueling beliefs among scientists about how cathode rays moved in the world. One group thought that cathode rays were a wave that was a wrinkle in the ether. Others concluded that the beam was made up of small bits of particles acting together, like a migrating flock of birds. “Neither side was wholly right nor wholly wrong,” said J. J. There was evidence to support both ideas, but the cathode ray could not be both.
One definitive way to see if a cathode ray was a wave or a particle was to observe its dance with magnets. There was an old theory that said that if cathode rays fly undisturbed by a magnet, they are a wave; and if a magnet deflects the ray, they are made up of particles. J. J. wanted to test this theory and learned that fourteen years earlier, in 1883, another scientist performed this very same experiment. Cathode rays did not move when a magnet was nearby, supporting the wave argument. But J. J. thought there was something wrong with that earlier attempt. Scientific tools had advanced since then, and could draw more air out of a glass tube to better create a vacuum. A vacuum with less air was the habitat where cathode rays thrived best. So J. J., who believed that cathode rays were full of particles, wanted to repeat this old experiment using a glass tube with less air in it, made possible with an improved vacuum. J. J.’s mathematical genius, unfortunately, did not translate into manual dexterity. For such a small man, he was a Victorian bull in a china shop. When he visited his students in the laboratory, they’d wince when he offered help, and quickly tried to move fragile things out of his way. They took deep breaths when he sat on a lab stool to speak. Life was no better at home. J. J.’s wife did not permit him to use a hammer in the house.
J. J. needed help with his experiments and that help came from a former chemistry assistant, Ebeneezer Everett. While the name Ebeneezer conjures a miserly image, Everett was a dashing, mustached man, with cowboy good looks, who leaned a bit to seem less tall. Little is known of this Everett, except that he was a patient soul and a virtuoso for making laboratory glassware out of common soda lime glass into works of art that would have pleased a Murano glass master. Lab benches were full of Everett’s glass constructions, braced in place with wood brackets, with wires on every surface and sticking up into the air. Everett was the scientific brawn to J. J.’s brain. Starting in late 1896, J. J. wanted to make a cathode-ray Obstacle course to settle this wave/particle debate. Everett made a sophisticated glass bulb with pieces inside, reminiscent of a model ship in a bottle. On one end of the glass two metal pins stuck out that were attached to the ends of a battery to produce the cathode ray. Inside the glass, the cathode rays sprayed out in many directions like water out of a hose and were focused into a narrow stream, with two slits that acted like a nozzle. That beam then hit the interior surface of a round bulb, creating a green glow.
Cathode rays required that there be very little air inside the glass tube. “This was more easily said than done,” said J. J. To remove the air, Everett poured liquid mercury into a tower, which he connected to his glass bulb with a glass bridge. As the heavy liquid fell, it sucked air across the bridge from the glass bulb, creating a vacuum. Removing the air sometimes took most of the day, so Everett started in the morning before the hurricane in the form of J. J. Thomson arrived in the laboratory in the afternoon.
Only glass worked for these experiments. Copper would not do, nor any metal for that matter, for metals would bury the cathode ray. Wood or clay would not work either, for they could not hold a vacuum. Clear plastics hadn’t been invented yet. Glass was the best keeper of a vacuum; transparent, uninterested in conducting electricity, and malleable to an inventor’s imagination. But, mostly, glass was vital in science because it allowed scientists to do what they do best, which is to use their power of observation—and this was what J. J. excelled at.
Sometimes J. J. complained to his colleagues about his glassware. “I believed all the glass in the place is bewitched,” he said. Standard recipes did not yet exist for glass. Some parts of a glass tube were richer in key ingredients than others. To build with glass required compositions that were uniform all over, so that they would melt at the same temperature. And a glass piece divulged how well the bond was made only after many hours of work had passed. Sometimes glass whispered with a small air leak that there was something wrong, other times it screamed with explosions. Glass was temperamental, and it was up to Everett to tend to it like a newborn baby. In the summer of 1897, Everett completed J. J. Thomson’s obstacle course for testing cathode rays. He inserted two additional metal plates and attached them to another battery, creating an electric field, as a way to nudge the rays. As Everett turned the contraption on, J. J. saw that the cathode ray moved downward to the metal plate connected to the positive end of the battery. This told J. J. that the cathode ray was negative. Everett then put a huge horseshoe magnet around the center of the glass tube, and when he turned it on, J. J. saw that the cathode ray moved up, like migrating birds swept up by a strong wind. From J. J.’s mathematical calculations, written on the backs of random scraps of paper, he was able to deduce that the cathode ray was made of small bits that were electrically charged and negative. He calculated they were smaller than an atom, and were thus the tiniest part of matter yet discovered.
And when he and Everett repeated these experiments with different metal plates and with different gases inside the tube, J. J. saw that these same small negative charges existed in all materials. He called these bits corpuscles, but they would later be known as electrons. J. J.’s discovery changed the world, but he could not predict that it would. This small and odd man found the small and odd electron, opening up a door in science and expanding the understanding of matter. The discovery of the electron gave us clues about how galaxies and planets formed, because the exchange of electrons, in chemical bonds, explained how hot gases from the Big Bang coalesced into us. This discovery also revealed the basic building block of technology. With the electron, scientists would come to understand the workings of circuits, static electricity, batteries, piezoelectricity, magnets, generators, and transistors. With the knowledge of electrons, technology—and society—blossomed.
When J. J. Thomson was growing up, many inventions that we now take for granted did not exist. There was “no car, no airplane, no electric light, no telephone, no radio.” But the electrons in his glass, which made up electricity, would power all these machines as well as later developments such as computers, cellphones, and the internet. As smart as J. J. was, he could never have predicted that this abstract science would have practical implications. But it did, and it had many. With his discovery, humanity was thrust into a new age—an electronic one. None of these technologies, however, would have happened if it weren’t for the ability to see electrons in action. Our modern world was made possible by the ancient and old material of glass.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Highest-ever concentration of microplastics found on seafloor: scientists</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Scientists say they have discovered the highest levels of microplastics ever recorded on the seafloor.
As part of an international research project led by the University of Manchester, scientists were able to uncover a staggering 1.9 million pieces of microplastics in a single square-metre of the ocean’s floor in the Mediterranean.
In a study, published in the journal “Science” on Thursday, the researchers showed how deep-sea currents act as conveyor belts to transport and deposit tiny plastic fragments and fibres across the seafloor.
As a result of these currents, “microplastic hotspots” or large accumulations can occur in certain locations, the study said.
“Almost everybody has heard of the infamous ocean ‘garbage patches’ of floating plastic, but we were shocked at the high concentrations of microplastics we found in the deep seafloor,” Ian Kane, the study’s lead author and an earth scientist at the University of Manchester, said in a press release.
“We discovered that microplastics are not uniformly distributed across the study area; instead, they are distributed by powerful seafloor currents which concentrate them in certain areas.”
While people often think of microplastics as tiny pieces of plastics in exfoliants, detergents, and glitter; the deposits found in the study area of the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea, consisted primarily of fibres from textiles and clothing.
These types of microplastics can easily enter rivers and oceans because they’re not effectively filtered out in domestic waste water treatment plants, the researchers said.
According to the scientists, more than 10 million tons of plastic waste enter the oceans each year.
And although there has been much attention given to floating debris, such as plastic drinking straws and bags, which are visible on the surface, it only accounts for one per cent of the plastic that enters the world’s oceans.
The other 99 per cent of plastic waste is believed to be somewhere below the surface in the depths of the oceans.
The difficulty for scientists, however, has been locating where exactly all that plastic waste has wound up in the oceans.
That is why the international team set out to determine how deep ocean currents affects the location of microplastic hotspots. To do this, they collected sediment samples from the seafloor of the Tyrrhenian Sea and combined them with calibrated models and deep ocean currents and detailed mapping of the seafloor. They then analyzed all the samples using infra-red spectroscopy to determine the different plastic types.
“Our study has shown how detailed studies of seafloor currents can help us to connect microplastic transport pathways in the deep sea and find the ‘missing’ microplastics,” Mike Clare, a co-lead on the project and a researcher at the National Oceanography Centre, said.
The researchers said understanding where the microplastic hotspots are is vital because deep ocean currents carry oxygenated water and nutrients, which means these areas are also likely to house important ecosystems with marine life that can consume or absorb the harmful plastics.
“The results [of the study] highlight the need for policy interventions to limit the future flow of plastics into natural environments and minimize impacts on ocean ecosystems,” Clare said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 'I Love You' virus caused billions in damage and exposed vulnerabilities that remain 20 years later</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wearing a striped shirt and Matrix-style dark glasses, Onel de Guzman stared at the floor as he made his way through a crowd of photographers into a hastily arranged press conference in Quezon City, a suburb of the Philippines capital Manila.
Skinny, with a mop of black hair falling to his eyebrows, he appeared to barely register the journalists' shouted questions, his only movement the occasional dabbing of sweat from his face with a white towel. Seated to his right, de Guzman's lawyer Rolando Quimbohad to lean in close to hear the 23-year-old's mumbled response, which he then repeated in English for the waiting press.
"He is not really aware that the acts imputed to him were indeed done by him," the lawyer said. "So if you ask me whether or not he was aware of the consequences I would say that he is not aware."
It was May 11, 2000, and if de Guzman was feeling shell-shocked, he had good reason to be. He was accused of authoring and releasing the first truly globalcomputer virus that had disrupted the operations of businesses and government agencies the world over, from Ford and Merrill Lynch to the Pentagon and the British Parliament, and was on track to cause a estimated US$10 billion in damages — all in the name of love.
Twenty years on, the ILOVEYOU virus remains one of the farthest reaching ever. Tens of millions of computers around the world were affected. The fight to contain the malware and track down its author was front page news globally, waking up a largely complacent public to the dangers posed by malicious cyber actors. It also exposed vulnerabilities which we are still dealing with to this day, despite two decades of advances in computer security and technology.
This account of the virus is based on interviews with law enforcement and investigators involved in the original case, contemporaneous CNN reporting and reports by the FBI, Philippines police and the Pentagon.
Multiple attempts to reach Onel de Guzman for this article, including through his family and former lawyer, were unsuccessful. De Guzman had not commented publicly since around 2000, until this week when author Geoff White tracked him down to the phone repair shop he now runs in Manila, where he admitted to authoring the virus.
 
 
On the afternoon of May 4, 2000, Michael Gazeley was in his office at Star Computer City, a warren of IT companies and shops selling electronics and gadgets overlooking Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor.
A few months earlier, Gazeley and his longtime business partner, Mark Webb-Johnson, founded their own information security firm, Network Box, which specialized in protecting customers from online threats. Both men had decades of experience in the industry, and had just finished the grueling (though occasionally lucrative) work of preparing for the new millennium by staving off the Y2K bug that threatened to cause widespread damage to systems worldwide.
Though largely remembered today, much to the chagrin of those involved, as an overreaction — or worse, a hoax — the Y2K bug was real, and the potential costs massive. They were avoided thanks to the diligent efforts of programmers around the world working together. It was a sign of the new connectivity that the internet, still in its relative infancy, was fostering.
That connectivity cut both ways, however, as Gazeley was reminded of that afternoon.
All the phones in his office started ringing at once. First were his clients, then came non-customers, all calling frantically in the hope that Network Box could help stop a virus that was screaming through their systems, destroying and corrupting data as it went.
They all told the same story: Someone in the office had received an email with the subject "ILOVEYOU" and the message, "kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me." When they opened what appeared to be a text file — actually an executable program masquerading as one — the virus quickly took control, sending copies of itself to everyone in their email address book. Those recipients, thinking the email waseither some weird joke or a serious declaration of love, opened the attachment in turn, spreading it even further.
Office email servers were soon clogged as thousands of love letters went back and forth, disseminating the virus to more people. It turned out to be much worse than just a self-propelling chain letter. At the same time as it was replicating itself, the ILOVEYOU virus destroyed much of the victim's hard drive, renaming and deleting thousands of files.
Many of the increasingly panicked callers Gazeley was fielding inquiries from did not have backups, and he had the awkward job of explaining to them that many of their files — everything from spreadsheets and financial records to photos and mp3s — were likely lost for good.
"This wasn't something that people were used to as a concept, they didn't realize that email could be so dangerous," said Gazeley, recounting the first calls.
The entire concept of the internet was still relatively new in 2000. According to statistics from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a United Nations body, just 28% of Hong Kongers had access to the internet at that time, along with 27% of the United Kingdom, and 15% of France. Even in the United States, where the technology was invented, only some 43% of Americans were getting online.
Two years earlier, Hollywood star Meg Ryan asked "is it infidelity if you're involved with somebody on email?" as the movie "You've Got Mail" introduced people to the idea of cyber-romance — and that email could be used for something other than boring office work.
 
 
From Hong Kong, where the virus crippled the communications and ravaged file systems of investment banks, public relations firms and the Dow Jones newswire, the love bug spread westward as the May 4 workday started.
Graham Cluley was on stage at a security conference in Stockholm, Sweden, when the virus hit Europe. He had just finished describing an unrelated virus which targeted a now-defunct operating system, hijacking users' accounts to broadcast messages to their coworkers, including "Friday I'm in LOVE." This, Cluley cracked, was likely to cause severe embarrassment for most people, but could potentially lead to some office romance.
As the conference broke for coffee, attendees' mobile phones and pagers began going off wildly. Several guests approached Cluley, asking if the virus he'd described was spread via email. He assured them it wasn't — and, anyway, it was limited to a niche system that most people didn't use.
"They said, Well, that's weird because we're suddenly getting loads of emails with the subject line 'I love you,'" Cluley said in an interview from his home in the United Kingdom.
When Cluley turned on his own phone, he was bombarded with notifications of missed calls, voice mails and text messages. Back home, Cluley's employer, the anti-virus firm Sophos, had been getting "absolutely hammered" with phone calls from clients begging for help and journalists trying to understand what the hell was going on.
Cluley raced to the airport to catch a flight to London, and even traded phone batteries with a generous taxi driver as the constant stream of messages drained his Nokia cellphone of power. When he landed in the United Kingdom, a car was waiting to whisk him to a TV studio to discuss what had by now become one of the biggest tech stories in the world.
In five hours, ILOVEYOU spread across Asia, Europe and North America, some 15 times faster than the Melissa virus did when it struck a year before, infecting over 1 million computers.
Soon after starting business on May 4, the United Kingdom's House of Commons had to take its overloaded email servers offline, as did the Ford Motor Company and even Microsoft, whose Outlook software was the primary means of spreading the virus.
At the time, Windows controlled more than 95% of the personal computer market, and Outlook came bundled with Microsoft Office, then all-but-required for doing business on a computer. For most people, Outlook was email.
Unlike today, when many email services are run via centralized servers — think Outlook.com or Gmail — companies in 2000 were running email off the same servers on which they hosted their website. This could be janky, slow and startling insecure.
Back then, Cluley said, "many companies didn't have in place filters their email gateways to try and stop spam, let alone viruses."
Even though the United States had advance warning, the virus spread just as quickly there — as almost everyone seemed apparently unable to resist opening the "love letter." Within the Pentagon, there was consternation as the virus hit the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) mailing list, with 50,000 subscribers.
From there, almost every major military base in the country — barring a handful that didn't use Outlook — watched as their email services were crippled and forced offline for hours as the problem was fixed.
 
 
Across the Potomac River, at the FBI's Washington, DC, headquarters, Michael Vatis was scrambling to get a handle on the crisis.
As director of the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), a relatively new intergovernmental agency tasked with tackling cyber threats, Vatis was awoken early May 4 with news of the ILOVEYOU virus hitting the United States. The NIPC soon sent out an alert warning of a "new, in-the-wild worm virus identified as LoveLetter or LoveBug [that] is being propagated globally via e-mail," but it came too late to prevent much of the US government and military, as well as dozens of private companies, from being affected.
As anti-virus companies slowly began rolling out patches, stemming the damage and enabling companies to come back online, attention within the FBI turned to tracking down those responsible. The investigation was led by the New York field office, which soon found evidence pointing back east, beyond Hong Kong, to the Philippines.
"In a very short period of time, we ended up identifying individuals in the Philippines and seeking the assistance of Philippine law enforcement," said Vatis, now a partner at the New York law firm Steptoe. "And a very short time after that, the Philippine authorities ultimately made an arrest."
Both the technical fix and first break in the case came so fast because, for all its rapid dissemination around the world, the ILOVEYOU virus was clumsily coded and startlingly unsophisticated. It mashed together several existing pieces of malware and did little to hide its workings.
"Every single victim of the love bug got a copy of the love bug's code, the actual source code," said Cluley, the Sophos analyst. "So it was simple to write an antidote. It was no more complex than any of the other thousands and thousands of viruses we'd seen that day. But of course, this one was particularly successful at spreading itself."
As well as containing the blueprint for defeating it, the code also included some lines pointing to the identity of its author. It contained two email addresses — spyder@super.net.ph and mailme@super.net.ph — both of which were based in the Philippines. There was also a reference to GRAMMERSoft Group, which it said was based in the country's capital.
While investigators were wary that those clues could be a smokescreen, the virus also communicated with a server hosted by the Manila-based Sky Internet, to which it sent passwords scraped from victims' computers. Sky quickly took the server offline, which stopped at least part of the virus in its tracks.
Without the servers to send information to — and it appears the virus's author was never able to access what was sent to the server, or at least act upon it — ILOVEYOU became purely an engine of chaos and destruction. It churned through email inboxes around the world and deleted files, while not actually serving the apparent original purpose of scraping passwords.
 
 
Four days after the virus began spreading, Philippines police searched an apartment in Manila and seized computer magazines, telephones, disks, wires and cassette tapes. They also arrested one of the occupants, Reomel Ramones.
Ramones, a curly-haired 27-year-old who worked at a local bank, seemed like an unlikely computer hacker, and investigators wondered if they had arrested the wrong guy. Attention turned to the apartment's two other residents: Ramones' girlfriend, Irene de Guzman, and her brother, Onel.
Onel de Guzman — who was not in the apartment when it was raided, and could not be found — was a student at AMA Computer College. The college was home to a self-described hacking group, the now-defunct GRAMMERSoft, which specialized in helping other students cheat on their homework. While police could not prove initially that de Guzman was a member, officials at the school shared with them a rejected final thesis he had written, which contained the code for a program bearing a startling resemblance to ILOVEYOU.
In the draft thesis, de Guzman wrote that the goal of his proposed program was to "get Windows passwords" and "steal and retrieve internet accounts [from] the victim's computer." At the time, dial-up internet access in the Philippines was paid for by the minute, in contrast to the blanket-use fees in much of Europe and the United States. De Guzman's idea was that users in the developing world could piggyback on the connections of those in richer countries and "spend more time on [the] internet without paying."
Reading his proposal, de Guzman's teacher was outraged, and wrote "we don't produce burglars" and "this is illegal" in the margins. But while the thesis would cost de Guzman his degree, his teacher's argument about illegality would be proven incorrect.
 
 
After several days out of the public eye, de Guzman appeared at the press conference in Quezon, flanked by his lawyer and sister. Asked whether he might have been responsible for the virus, he responded through his lawyer: "It is possible."
"He did not even know that the actions on his part would really come to the results which have been reported," his lawyer said. To a ripple of laughter from reporters, the lawyer added, after a mumbled consultation with de Guzman: "The internet is supposed to be educational so it should be free."
Asked what he felt about the damage caused by the virus, de Guzman said "nothing, nothing."
Nothing would also turn out to be de Guzman's punishment, despite reams of evidence gathered by police in the Philippines and the agreement of the country's National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the FBI and private security investigators, that he was the culprit.
The problem was not a lack of proof, but the lack of an appropriate law to charge him with. The Philippines, like a number of countries at the turn of the millennium, had not legislated against computer crime. And an attempt to prosecute de Guzman on fraud charges was later dropped. While the Philippines did have an extradition treaty with the United States, it only applied to crimes prosecutable in both countries. Once the case was dropped, there was little chance of sending de Guzman abroad.
While Philippines lawmakers did rush through a law criminalizing computer hacking soon after the ILOVEYOU incident, it could not be applied retroactively.
"We were unable to bring to justice a wrongdoer who caused harm to millions of people and companies around the world," Senator Edgardo J. Angara said years later, echoing the embarrassment felt by many Philippines politicians and law enforcement officers.
For others in the country, de Guzman was a hero. "Here is a Filipino genius who has put the Philippines on the world map," wrote one newspaper columnist. "[He] has proven that the Filipino has the creativity and ingenuity to turn, for better or for worse, the world upside down." It even spawned a movie, "Subject: I love you," which depicted the virus creator as a lovelorn man trying to reconnect "with the only woman he had ever loved."
At de Guzman's college, a fellow student told the New York Times, the virus had "made us proud." Another basked in the ability of a Filipino hacker to "penetrate the Pentagon ... even though the Philippines is a third-world country, even though we're behind in technology, they were able to do that."
Two decades on, this reaction still annoys Cluley, the Sophos investigator. "It's the kind of thing that has you thumping your head against a wall in frustration," he said. "This was when malware was just beginning to get a little nastier and a little more malicious and more financially motivated."
"This wasn't the message we wanted to give young people, that this was all right."
 
 
There were admirers of de Guzman's work outside the Philippines, too. Within hours of ILOVEYOU spreading, remixed copycats had sprung up, with messages such as "very funny," "joke," "Mother's Day," or, most cynically, "VIRUS ALERT!!!" Amazingly, despite the near wall-to-wall mediacoverage of the ILOVEYOU virus at the time, this did not stop many people opening suspicious attachments which bore a different message.
The love bug and its variants would cause some $10 billion of damage, the FBI later estimated, before updates to anti-virus software and email clients reined them in. To this day, ILOVEYOU remains one of the farthest reaching viruses, striking millions of machines in countries across the world.
"It had an enormous effect," said Vatis, the former NIPC director. "It was really worldwide front page news for at least several days in a way that computer attacks had not been in the past."
While previous attacks had caused more direct damage, and those in the future would be more sophisticated and far more effective in their goal, they were also much more limited in scope.Other viruses have targeted specific locations, businesses or governments. ILOVEYOU could affect just about anyone running Windows Outlook.
"It hit home in a way that other previous attacks did not," Vatis said. "It made people aware that this is not just something that happens to defense agencies or owners of websites, this is something that can happen to any Joe or Jane sitting at home on the computer or in the office, and it can shut you down and really disrupt your ability to operate."
And while email clients have gotten better at filtering out malicious-seeming messages, the main weakness that ILOVEYOU exploited remains impossible to fix.
"You can update your operating systems or you can have the best email filters in the world, but you can't patch the human brain," said Cluley.
To this day, some of the most successful cyber attacks — whether they be linked to nation-state actors, criminal organizations or lone-wolf hackers — have used social engineering as their primary weapon. The hackers that stole emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 did so by tricking Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta into handing over the password to his Google account. Those who targeted Google in 2003 went after the company's employees over instant messaging. And ransomware attacks, an increasingly common form of scam whereby victims' computers and accounts are frozen until they pay to unlock them, almost always work by getting people to click a dodgy link.
While some hackers use zero-day exploits, previously unrevealed vulnerabilities in key software, or purpose built spying tools to go after their victims, many do not use code much more sophisticated than that seen in the ILOVEYOU attack. They don't need to.
"Humans are always the weak link," Vatis said. "It's almost always easier to exploit a human through some social engineering gambit than it is to crack, you know, some technological defensive measure."
One thing that has changed somewhat since ILOVEYOU is how prepared most companies are for such an incident. Most at least have some kind of anti-virus protection, and back up their data. But all the experts who tackled ILOVEYOU two decades ago agreed that there remains a startling degree of complacency over potentially devastating cyber attacks.
"What's frightening is that 20 years after, there are still plenty of organizations who don't take this seriously until they are hit," said Gazeley, the Hong Kong cybersecurity expert. "So many people still don't plan ahead."
What largely prevents such an attack is that most companies and individuals outsource running email servers to those who know how to do it best — primarily Microsoft and Google — and rely on them to filter incoming messages, cut out spam and warn of potential attacks.
Were a worm like ILOVEYOU to find a way past those filters, and spread fast enough to prevent the companies rolling out a patch, the possibility of it doing major damage remains. There is no reason to expect that the average user has grown any less complacent today. With email providers doing most of the work in spotting dodgy messages, they may actually be more so.
Vatis said that the potential effect on online communications of such a worm could be "devastating," as could the knock on the global economy as companies go offline or lose business all at once. He compared the situation to people who avoid getting vaccinated for the flu every year.
"That's not a problem for society as a whole until the vaccination rate drops below a certain percentage," he said. "And then you have a lot of people getting really sick."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drop in commercial flights due to COVID-19 may affect weather forecasts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- The suspension of commercial flights amid the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting more than just travel plans.
Experts have found that the grounding of thousands of passenger planes has led to a severe decrease in aircraft-based observations, predominantly in Europe and across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which help with weather predictions.
The World Meteorological Organization's Lars Peter Riishojgaard told NewsDay by CTV News, a new show on the streaming app Quibi, that fewer planes in the air means there are less reliable weather forecasts.
"As a matter of routine operations, commercial airliners measure every few seconds the temperature of the wind speed or wherever they happen to be located in flight… They do it for their own avionics, but several of the major airlines have agreed to provide th[is] information to the metrological community, and they are a tremendously valuable source of information for us," Riishojgaard said.
"We get about a million a day of these measurements literally from all over the globe and at the present time, we have lost somewhere around 75 to 80 per cent of that information resource," he added.
Riishojgaard said the data from aircrafts is plugged into three-dimensional weather models of the atmosphere to simulate future weather conditions. After satellites, he says aircrafts are the second-most important airborne element in forecasting.
Riishojgaard said the concern with a lack of data from aircrafts is that weather warnings may come too late if the coronavirus pandemic continues into flood and hurricane season.
"This is a statistical game, so you never really know exactly what you're going to lose until after it has happened. But what can happen is that you will lose some of what we call the lead time. So you may be alerted to a certain phenomena two or three days ahead of time instead of perhaps three or four days or in very rapidly developing situations, perhaps the same day instead of a day [or] thirty six hours before," Riishojgaard said.
Environment Canada's Executive Director of National Prediction Development Richard Hogue told CTV's NewsDay on Quibi on Saturday that meteorologists are relying more on weather balloons while aircrafts are grounded. He said that twice as many weather balloons have been launched across the world's 1,300 balloon sites amid the pandemic.
"They run balloons with little instrument that measures temperature, humidity, winds all the way to the stratosphere. That's really important," Hogue said. "Instead of just sending them twice a day, they sending [them] four times a day. We're actually taking advantage of that data because we use the data globally."
Hogue said forecasters are also leaning more on satellites to make up for the missing data to get the full weather picture. However, he said Canada's commercial flights have been only been reduced by approximately 50 per cent so meteorologists still receive some aircraft-based observations.
"We're going to use more satellite derived data like we call them, winds from satellite information on temperature profile from satellites. These two pieces of information will help us in Canada to, in a sense, mitigate without reduction of aircraft," Hogue said.
Hogue said the data gap is not currently big enough for Canadians to notice less accurate weather reports, but Environment Canada is monitoring the situation.
While data taken from satellites is mostly autonomous, Riishojgaard said some satellites in underdeveloped countries still require human intervention to properly track weather observations.
"We are particularly vulnerable over Africa and parts of South America in the developing world where many, many servers still rely on having [someone] go out every few hours, read an instrument and then go back into their office and call in their mission to some central facility before it gets transmitted into the international networks," Riishojgaard said. He said those areas are most vulnerable because their services have sent those staff home due to COVID-19.
Hogue said ocean observations may also be greatly impacted by travel changes from COVID-19 over a long period of time. He said commercial ships and automated buoys that track long-range weather predictions, including the impact of climate change, are not being repaired as often during the outbreak.
"When [buoys] stop reporting because they're fully automated, we've got to go and repair them. Well, we're not going these days and that's a big issue… If you want to repair a buoy, you have to put someone on a ship [and] who wants to go on a ship these days?" Hogue said.
Riishojgaard said the World Meteorological Organization has only lost about 10 per cent of its ocean observing capabilities but cautioned that could increase as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
While the lack of data may not have instant impacts on forecasts, Riishojgaard said there is still a global threat in preparedness for severe weather events.
"We're not going to lose all capabilities altogether and in many situations, perhaps nothing will happen. The forecast will be just as find as it always has, but it increases your level of risk," Riishojgaard said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reminder: Those who applied in the first wave of CERB must now reapply</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- Canadians who were among the first to receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) must now reapply for another four weeks of benefits.
CERB offers $500 per week for Canadians who’ve lost work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but recipients must confirm their eligibility for the program every four weeks.
The renewal payments are not automatic, meaning anyone who applied for CERB between April 6 and April 10 will now need to reapply for the benefit. 
To qualify for the benefit, Canadians must be at least 15 years of age and have been forced out of work due to the pandemic. They must also have earned at least $5,000 in the previous calendar year and now expect to make less than $1,000 per month while collecting the CERB payments.
Recipients can reapply for the benefit either online or by calling 1 (800) 959-2019.
Those receiving the benefit through Service Canada must fill out their EI Report Card to receive the payment.
A previous version of this story gave an incorrect phone number for reapplying for CERB. The correct phone number is 1 (800) 959-2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Critical Covid-19 patient in Hyderabad administered 'experimental' plasma therapy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A critical coronavirus patient in Hyderabad has been administered an experimental therapy involving injecting convalescent plasma for passive immunisation to treat the disease, it emerged on Sunday.
The development was confirmed by the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) isolation ward's focal person Dr Aftab Hussain Phull.
Does plasma therapy treat Covid? Is it safe? Here's all you need to know about the approach
The plasma — donated by a recovered coronavirus patient to the Diagnostic and Research Laboratory at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences — was administered to a patient under treatment at the isolation ward.
"He was given the plasma after managing his condition as best as possible under the given circumstances," Phull said.
On April 30, the Sindh government had allowed three hospitals in the province to carry out clinical trials for the “experimental use of Covid-19 convalescent plasma for passive immunisation".
The hospitals included the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital in Karachi, the National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD) in Karachi and LUH, a government facility in Hyderabad.
Prior to this, the government had approved clinical trials for plasma therapy in addition to approving locally made ventilators for treating critically ill patients and granting permission for manufacturing sanitisers and producing chloroquine.
The experimental therapy involves collecting blood from someone who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing separated plasma to a critically sick patient; plasma is the clear part of blood that is left when blood cells have been removed and contains antibodies and other proteins.
The transfusion of plasma with its antibodies provides a form of 'passive immunity' to the sick recipient to fight the infection.
The protection offered by passive immunisation, however, is short-lived, usually lasting only a few weeks or months.
The science behind plasma therapy and passive immunisation is not new; the concept has been widely applied for treating different infectious diseases including mumps, measles and polio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lax lockdown fails to contain coronavirus spread in Bangladesh</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rajshahi’s Durgapur Upazila has not recorded a single coronavirus case more than one and a half months since the first COVID-19 patient was found in Bangladesh.
On Apr 30, the Upazila with a population of over 185,000 reported the first case - a traveller from a virus hotspot with record number of patients only behind Dhaka.
It happened amid a nationwide lockdown with offices, educational institutions, workplaces closed and transport system shut down – restrictions imposed over a month ago. The man came from Narayanganj which was on “complete lockdown”.
The same thing happened to many other regions where the coronavirus spread from Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur, the three districts that have most coronavirus patients.
In Cox’s Bazar and Shariatpur, the patients include the returnees from the most affected districts and their close contacts.
Why the lockdown hasn’t work?
The law enforcers, who are struggling to keep people at home or ensuring that they maintain physical distancing while outdoors, say the people are fooling them by travelling from one district to another by mostly vehicles that transport goods.
“Up to 6,000 trucks are entering and leaving the district daily. How can we stop if people travel by these vehicles,” Narayanganj Superintendent of Police Zayedul Alam told bdnews24.com, sounding resigned.
He said hundreds of thousands of workers travel from and to the city as 600 factories, mostly of food, have remained open as emergency services.
“And it has at least 50 points through which people can sneak through. We are guarding 22 key points and sending people back from them,” the SP said.
Narayanganj is also port a city, not only an industrial hub, he pointed out and so, he added, it is “almost impossible” to guard the river banks.
Dhaka SP Maruf Hossain Sarder said many people come up with such excuses that police cannot turn them away.
“We are taking legal action, but people are deceiving us as well,” he said.
A police officer who works at Gabtoli, a key access to Dhaka, said people get off vehicles and get on again after walking past the check post.
“We stop some, but how can we stop them all?” he asked.
The risk has now increased after the garment factories in the three districts reopened.
The situation has worsened following the resumption of RMG production so much so that Savar Upazila Health and Family Planning Officer Sayemul Huda on Thursday asked the government to order the factories shut.
His desperate appeal echoes that of Narayanganj Mayor Salina Hayat Ivy who had urged the government to impose curfew in Narayanganj to stop the spread of the virus, prompting the authorities to announce the “complete lockdown” of the district.
Mushtuq Husain, a former chief scientific officer of the government’s disease control agency IEDCR, said it might be possible to contain the outbreak if the authorities could stop the exodus to and from Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur.
He now recommends strict measures like separating the industrial areas and barring the workers from travelling from one area to another.
“The situation will be horrendous if a single worker conceals their symptoms,” he warned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In odd turn with Israel, Gazans get economic adrenaline shot from virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ziad Qassem’s 25 years as a tailor seemed worthless in the cruel economy of the blockaded Gaza Strip: Unemployed for eight months, piling up debt, he sat idle in his apartment, worried how he would provide for his wife and five children.
The coronavirus came to the rescue.
With demand for masks and protective gear soaring worldwide, Gaza garment factories have been bombarded with new orders since early March by merchants from — of all places — Israel, ordinarily seen by much of Gaza’s Palestinian population as the enemy.
The Zahara clothing company in Gaza offered Qassem, 42, around $12 a day to put his sewing machine mastery to use.
“I can breathe now,” he said. “I can buy things for my family. When I had no work, I felt psychologically depleted. I didn’t have an extra shekel to give to my kids.”
Across the globe, the pandemic has decimated economies and sent unemployment rates skyrocketing. But in the garment industry in Gaza, where joblessness, poverty and dependency on international aid were already at epidemic proportions, the coronavirus has oddly been a boon.
Apparel was once a pillar of the local economy, with 900 factories employing 36,000 Palestinians. But the industry all but collapsed in 2007 when the militant group Hamas seized control of Gaza and Israel banned the export of clothing from Gaza to Israel or the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
“The plants suffered devastating losses. They were practically put out of commission,” said Muhammad Abu Jayyab, editor-in-chief of Al Eqtisadiah, a Gaza-based economic publication.
It was only after the 2014 Gaza war with Israel that Israeli authorities permitted Gazan apparel-makers to resume exports, the basis for a modest revival. By 2019, more than 200 clothing factories employed around 6,000 workers, according to the Palestinian Federation of Garment, Textile and Leather Industries, though workers and owners said daily wages were as little as $8.50.
Now about a dozen factories have begun turning out masks and protective wear, several of them hiring new employees, expanding their hours or even subcontracting excess work to smaller shops.
In Gaza City, Zahara’s all-male factory floor bustled this week as some workers carefully stitched light-blue masks, while others quickly cut nylon fabrics and used old sewing machines to assemble them into protective wear. Most were at least a few feet apart, but only some employees wore masks. The owner, Muhammad Odeh, 42, said he had increased his workforce to 55 from 30 men and stretched their shifts from eight hours a day to 12.
“The virus has brought life into our factory,” he said. “The masks and suits have not only given us more work, they’ve made it possible for us to stay open during this crisis.”
A bigger company, Unipal 2000, which is based in Gaza City’s industrial zone, is producing 50,000 masks and 15,000 protective gowns and suits a day and expanded its workforce from 850 to 1,250, said a co-owner, Bashir Bawab.
“I much prefer that everyone is healthy and that the virus disappears, but making these products has provided us with an important opportunity,” said Bawab, 61.
Rotem Cohanim, 37, a merchant from the West Bank Israeli settlement Beit Horon, said he used factories in Gaza to make the protective gear he sells because “their labour is very good, and they do it quickly and inexpensively.”
Workers at the factories report to their shifts regularly. The virus itself has largely spared Gaza, an enclave of 2 million, because of strict Israeli-enforced controls over border crossings, and Hamas’ decision to isolate all returning residents in quarantine facilities, now for three weeks. Only 17 people are known to have been infected so far, and no fatalities have been reported.
All told, factories in Gaza have produced millions of masks and hundreds of thousands of protective gowns and suits, garment industry leaders say, generally working with raw material from Israel and exporting the finished products there or, to a lesser extent, to the West Bank.
The masks range from inexpensive models costing less than 50 cents to high-quality designs that fetch $50.
Some factories have also quietly filled orders from their Israeli partners with designs that are politically risky in Gaza — to say the least. Some feature Israeli flags, the logo of a popular Israeli soccer team or “Made in Israel” labels.
Several tailors interviewed said they had no compunctions making masks to protect people in Israel, which has fought three bloody wars with militant groups in Gaza over the past 12 years as well as several smaller battles.
“At the end of the day, we are all humans,” said Raed Dahman, 42, at Hassanco in Gaza City. “We should try to make sure everyone is safe, without exceptions.”
Gisha, an Israeli rights group that closely monitors Gaza, said Israel needed to lift its restrictions on movement into and out of the territory to help the economy function.
“Factories in Gaza repurposing their production lines to make personal protective equipment demonstrates what’s possible when the Strip has access to markets and materials,” the group said in a statement. “In the post-coronavirus era, there should be no place for unnecessary restrictions on movement that thwart livelihoods and the health of entire communities.”
As successful as the protective-gear boom has been, apparel industry leaders in Gaza say they fear it will run its course all too soon.
“The coronavirus will be temporary, which means the need for masks and protective suits will be temporary, too,” said Fouad Odeh, an official at the Palestinian Federation of Garment, Textile and Leather Industries. “We will ultimately need to rely on making clothing.”
Some factories have already felt the demand for masks decline, which their owners mainly attributed to the arrival of large Chinese shipments of them in Israel. Hassan Shehada, the owner of Hassanco, said he was still trying to find a buyer for 120,000 masks packed in boxes in his factory. And Bahaa Madhoun, director of Noor al-Bahaa in Gaza City, said his company had outstanding orders for only 20,000 masks, down from hundreds of thousands only weeks ago.
That leaves workers worrying that the happy new normal of gainful employment could give way to the return of hard times — just as the rest of the world is recovering from the pandemic.
“I’m afraid I’ll suddenly be told to go home,” said Raed Attar, a tailor at Hassanco, who had struggled to find steady work for a year before he was hired there recently. “My life would be very complicated again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Rangamati remained unscathed by COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rangamati is the only district in Bangladesh to remain free from coronavirus cases in the massive outbreak that spread to other 63 districts, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 170 of them.
As of May 1, samples collected from 227 people in the district have been sent to Chattogram for tests and 133 of them have returned so far. All of them were negative.
The remote geographical position provides an advantage to the district but the active measures taken by the local administration have prevented the infection from spreading, according to local health officials.
The district has so far successfully prevented the local outbreak, but that does not mean preventive measures can be called off, said Rangamati Deputy Commissioner AKM Mamunur Rashid.
“If you go on the street, you’ll not find a person without wearing a mask. People in Rangamati are quite aware.”
“We all need to be aware and responsible. We should remain indoors and follow social distancing.”
The authorities have made the mobile courts more active and the law enforcement agencies became stricter as few cases of rule-breaking were reported in the past few days, he said.
At least 8,238 coronavirus cases have been reported in all districts, except Rangamati, according to the Directorate General of Health Services.
The Rangamati administration has stayed alert to the risks of contagion since Bangladesh reported its first cases on Mar 8.
Gradually, 1,798 persons were quarantined and 621 of them have completed the quarantine period.
Three persons died in Rajasthali, Baghaichhari and Sadar with virus symptoms and their last rites were done accordingly. Later, the test reports for the dead returned negative for the coronavirus.
A truck driver from Rangamati’s Langdu was infected with COVID-19 in Habiganj and has been receiving treatment there. A young health worker from the Marma community in Betbunia has been infected in Narayanganj and receiving treatment there.
Another resident of Rangamati working as assistant commissioner (land) in Bhairab is also receiving treatment there.
Rangamati, the biggest district sprawling over 6,000 square kilometres, is home to about 625,000 people.
Among them, only 227 people have been tested for the virus.
“We have collected samples from all of those with symptoms or suspected to be infected and sent them for tests. We can’t grab a healthy person and collect a sample from them,” said Dr Mostafa Kamal of Rangamati Civil Surgeon Office, when asked if a small number of test samples were enough.
“Rangamati administration was different from others since the beginning of the outbreak. They closed all entries to the district and forced everyone who travelled in to remain in isolation. They never relaxed the rules for anyone,” the official said.
“People in the districts are quite aware. The geographical position, remoteness and the lakes surrounding it gave the district some added advantage.”
Dr Kamal said the crisis is not over yet. “We should not be complacent.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Historian, author Prof Muntassir Mamoon hospitalised with COVID-19 symptoms</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dhaka University history professor Muntassir Mamoon has been hospitalised in Dhaka with symptoms of COVID-19.
He was admitted to the Mugda General Hospital on Sunday evening, a doctor said.
“He is not in good shape. We’ve called for intensive care support. He will be shifted to the ICU if we can manage a seat tonight,” said Assistant Prof Dr Mahbubur Rahman, who is working as the focal person of the hospital’s COVID-19 response team.
Dr Mahbubur also said Mamoon was infected with the novel coronavirus, but the Dhaka University teacher’s daughter Roya Muntassir said he had tested negative 10 days ago.
The family decided on the hospitalisation as his symptoms came back, she said.
The result of the latest coronavirus test on Mamoon’s sample will be available on Monday morning, she added.
The 69-year-old has penned a number of books on history. He is also involved with Ekattorer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, which was formed to push for punishment for the crimes against humanity committed during the 1971 Liberation War.
The tally of COVID-19 infections in Bangladesh spiralled to 9,455 after another 665 people tested positive from 5,368 samples until Sunday morning in the biggest single-day spike. The death rose by two to 177.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unconvincing explanations cloud dramatic coronavirus recovery figure in Bangladesh</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Confusions have clouded new Health Directorate estimates updated in a matter of 24 hours that show more than 1,000 people have recovered from coronavirus.
The figure for recovery on Saturday was 177 after three more won the battle against the deadly illness in the preceding 24 hours.
In the Sunday brief, DGHS Additional Director General Nasima Sultana put the total number of recovered patients at 1,063, a whopping rise in the past 24 hours. The uplifting statistics, she said, was based on new calculations done following 'revised guidelines'.
But the factors at play in this dramatic leap in the number of people surviving the deadly illness remains unclear.
A total of 624 patients were discharged from hospitals in Dhaka while 272 others recovered outside the capital, according to Nasima.
"There is a clinical management committee for cases of recovery and they have made a new guideline which sets a criteria for when we can say a patient has recovered, when they can leave hospitals. So, 1,063 patients have recovered under this criteria," she said.
bdnews24.com called on DGHS officials for a better understanding of the development, but the explanations remained vague.
According to previous guidelines, the sample of a person who tested positive for coronavirus would be tested again after 14 days. If it came back negative, another test would follow seven days later. If results again return negative, the patient would once again be tested within 72 hours and if the result is still negative, that individual would be put on the list of recoveries and advised to remain in three-week quarantine on discharge from hospital.
"According to the new guidelines, if a patient has clinically recovered, meaning if they do not have fever, cough or respiratory problem for three consecutive days, they would be released and sent back home to remain in isolation for two weeks," virologist Prof Dr Nazrul Islam, who advises the national technical committee, told bdnews24.com.
The tests which were conducted in hospitals previously would be carried out at home, he said.
However, he was tight-lipped when asked how the information of a patient who recovers at home would be collated.
Also, the question as to whether a person would be considered to have recovered if no symptoms show in two-three days went unanswered.
But Md Habibur Rahman Khan, additional secretary to the health ministry, gave bdnews24.com a different explanation.
"We have been providing information on the hospitals in Dhaka all these days. From today, details coming in from all over the country are being added up. This has caused the number of recoveries to surge," he said.
"From today information on patients recovering from hospitals all over the country will be provided. This is what Health Directorate's Additional Director General Nasima Sultana told me," he said.
bdnews24.com failed to reach Nasima Sultana for her comments on the issue.
The DGHS has been subject to criticism in social media about its handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
Bangladesh confirmed two more deaths from the coronavirus in a daily count, taking the total to 177 on Sunday.
The tally of COVID-19 infections spiralled to 9,455 in the same period after another 665 people tested positive from 5,368 samples in the biggest single-day spike.

Of Africa's 54 countries, only one has yet to report a case of the virus: Lesotho.
As of 2 May, the confirmed coronavirus death toll on the continent stood at 1 701, with fatalities including the former president of the Republic of the Congo Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango and Somalia's former Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein.
There are 41 330 confirmed infections and 13 621 recoveries, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
COVID-19 LOCKDOWN | Human rights in Africa at risk as governments take heavy-handed action
On 1 May, South Africa began easing one of the world's strictest lockdowns to Level 4, which means that businesses can now resume limited operations and people can leave their homes for exercise between 06:00 and 09:00. A night curfew from 20:00 until 05:00 is still in place.
Rwanda has also announced a partial lifting of coronavirus restrictions, and said it will allow some people to return to work on 4 May in a bid to revive the economy.
"Public and private businesses will resume work with essential staff while other employees continue working from home. The manufacturing and construction sectors will open with essential workers," said a communiqué issued by Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.
"Markets will open for essential vendors not exceeding 50 percent of registered traders. Hotels and restaurants will open and close by 7pm, but meetings in public spaces and mass gatherings are prohibited," it said.
Experts warn fragile healthcare systems in many African countries could be overwhelmed in the face of a severe outbreak of Covid-19, the highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus surge in Brazil brings coffin shortage, hastily dug trenches</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RIO DE JANEIRO -— In Brazil’s bustling Amazon city of Manaus, so many people have died within days in the coronavirus pandemic that coffins had to be stacked on top of each other in long, hastily dug trenches in a city cemetery. Some despairing relatives reluctantly chose cremation for loved ones to avoid burying them in those common graves.
Now, with Brazil emerging as Latin America’s coronavirus epicenter with more than 6,000 deaths, even the coffins are running out in Manaus. The national funeral home association has pleaded for an urgent airlift of coffins from Sao Paulo, 1,700 miles away, because Manaus has no paved roads connecting it to the rest of the country.
The city of about 2 million people carved from the jungle has been overwhelmed by death in part because it’s the main site where those from remote Amazon communities can get medical services, according to Lourival Panhozzi, president of the Brazilian Association of Funeral Service Providers.
As of April 30, Brazil’s Health Ministry said that there were over 5,200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Amazonas state and 425 deaths, although there are concerns that inadequate testing for the virus has meant that the numbers may be much higher.
Before the outbreak, the city of Manaus, the capital of the state, was recording an average of 20-35 deaths a day, according to the mayor. Now, it is recording at least 130 a day, data from the state’s health secretary show.
People in the region also have been widely ignoring isolation measures.
There also are signs in the much larger cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo that suggest authorities may not be able to handle a huge increase in the death toll. A field of fresh graves that was dismissed in April by President Jair Bolsonaro as excessive has since been filled.
Latin America’s grimmest scenes occurred last month in Ecuador’s city of Guayaquil, where residents said they had to leave bodies on the street after morgues, cemeteries and funeral homes were overwhelmed.
Many in Brazil fear the rising deaths will hit hardest in the favelas, the vast neighborhoods of the poor that are well-known in Rio and Sao Paulo but which also exist in most big Brazilian cities and even in smaller ones.
“There is a great fear that uncontrolled contamination will happen there,” said Panhozzi, whose group represents Brazil’s 13,400 private funeral companies.
In Rio’s Complexo do Alemao cluster of favelas, the body of Luiz Carlos da Rocha, 36, lay untouched for more than 12 hours Tuesday. Relatives didn’t know why he died but said he had epilepsy.
The state’s military police, which normally picks up bodies found outside, no longer does so for nonviolent deaths, said an officer at the scene who would not give his name. He said without elaborating that the policy change was due to the coronavirus. The military police press office did not respond to requests for comment.
The next day at Rio’s Hospital Salgado Filho in a lower-middle class neighborhood, Clovis de Castro, whose ailing sister Genina had just died, found himself helping out in the hospital’s morgue. He waited six hours to sort out death certificate paperwork in what he described as a chaotic scene in the morgue, with grieving relatives arriving to identify bodies and only one worker available to move corpses. At one point, he was asked to lend a hand.
“I had to help a person to put a body in a coffin,” de Castro said, adding that the experience made him “realize that people need help, the hospital needs help, the country needs help.”
De Castro left with a death certificate saying his sister’s cause of death was undetermined. He was angry that no autopsy was conducted that might have confirmed his suspicion she died of COVID-19 or complications from the disease.
“Why hide this stuff?” he asked.
Sao Paulo director of ambulance services Francis Fuji blamed a recent surge of deaths in homes on coronavirus patients who were discharged from hospitals with mild symptoms, only to have their conditions deteriorate rapidly.
Paramedics don’t have the training to identify COVID-19 as a cause of death, he said, and many relatives have lied about their loved ones’ symptoms to avoid the corpses being handled as though they were contagious.
“They think that if they get that diagnosis, then their loved one will be removed in a sealed plastic bag, they’ll never see him or her again, and they won’t even have a funeral,” Fuji said.
Authorities in Sao Paulo dug hundreds of graves last month in anticipation of a rise in deaths. Bolsonaro has likened the coronavirus to “a little flu” and insists that sweeping state measures to close all but essential business are more damaging than the illness. On April 2, he questioned whether photos by The Associated Press of the new graves were “fake news” or “sensationalism.”
By Thursday, all those graves were filled with the dead, as were dozens of other new ones, according to images by the AP photographer who took the original photos and revisited the site on Sao Paulo’s eastern region. Refrigerated trucks to hold overflows of bodies are now seen outside hospitals and cemeteries.
In Manaus early Thursday, Raimundo Costa do Nascimento, 86, died of pneumonia in his home. Funeral workers were so swamped that his relatives had to wait 10 hours for someone to retrieve his body.
A week after Panhozzi’s association appealed for the coffins for Manaus, he said the request is still being considered.
“That won’t work,” he said. “I need it now.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The smarter strategy for the Middle East in a post-coronavirus world</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United States has paid a dear price for its involvement in the Middle East since 9/11. In Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Syria, and conflicts and counterterrorist campaigns from the deserts of North Africa to the Straits of Hormuz, our “all in” effort has cost more than $6.4 trillion, and close to 7,000 servicemen and women have been killed.
There have been sharp political debates as to the wisdom of our Middle Eastern adventures in terms of lives lost and money spent. These arguments will intensify once COVID-19’s impact on the global economy has been calculated.
The pandemic-related shutdowns and social distancing have harmed every facet of the financial universe — the damage is expected to exceed $4.1 trillion, roughly 5 percent of the world’s GDP.
COVID-19 has sparked a “Chernobyl Moment” for the United States and many other countries, where shortcomings in the national emergency infrastructures have become painfully apparent. Once the pandemic passes, it would be natural for us to focus our attention and resources inward, so we can rebuild a devastated economy while moving away from our expensive commitments in the Middle East.
So far, there have been no announcements from the Trump administration, the State Department or the Department of Defense concerning cutting aid to our key allies in the region. Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq receive roughly $8 billion taxpayer dollars in aid a year.
But demands to cut foreign aid will come — and that would be a fatal mistake.
Instead, the US should embark on a Middle Eastern Marshall Plan of sorts to stabilize the economies of the region, avoid a second Arab Spring and ultimately deradicalize a large segment of the population without requiring additional American boots on the ground. A strategic and courageous political plan could force us to pivot into a smaller and smarter presence that will benefit our allies and ourselves.
Yes, it may be necessary to decrease military aid to our Middle Eastern partners, but we should still maintain a steady flow of economic support.
The Arab Spring and the wars that followed all over the region erupted over issues of economic disparity and political corruption. The pandemic has the power to exacerbate economic concerns in the region, with inflation, food costs and unemployment all spiking.
Jordan’s King Abdullah, a moderate voice who nonetheless has always spoken his mind, was quoted as saying that what keeps him up at night is neither al-Qaeda or ISIS but the fact that 300,000 Jordanians are unemployed and over 85 percent of them are between the ages of 18 and 39.
Meanwhile, the American military footprint in the region will have to be adjusted. According to US Central Command, there are some 70,000 American military personnel stationed in eight nations (including 14,000 soldiers in Afghanistan).
Finally ending the conflict in Afghanistan will save lives and money, and allow a streamlined redeployment of US forces to other hot spots in the area. The burden of manning America’s front lines in the Middle East should mostly fall upon the shoulders of the intelligence fraternity and the special operations community.
Fast, nimble and powerful far beyond their small numbers, the special forces — together with their counterparts in the CIA and NSA — should reestablish a presence in northern Syria with our abandoned Kurdish allies to send a message to Iran, Russia, Turkey and others that any attempts to disrupt the current status quo of peace in the pandemic will not be tolerated.
With their language skills and international pedigrees, the special forces are experts in training indigenous forces and the national armies of our allies we need to fight on our side.
One of the reasons that the war against ISIS was so successful was precisely because the United States assembled a regional — and international — alliance that fought and died together. Placing the focus on a special-operations solution will lessen our footprint, yet still allow American forces to achieve our national security objectives.
In a post-pandemic age, the United States will need to do more with less in the Middle East. It will be a daunting exercise for the most powerful nation in the world, but there can be no short-term gains without setting up a well-thought-out and pragmatic long-term plan for the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bees dying of disease eerily similar to coronavirus, British scientists say</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest buzz in the science world: Honeybees are dying of something that is freakishly similar to the coronavirus.
Bee populations around the globe have been decimated by a viral disease that creeps into hives via asymptomatic insects and spreads like wildfire, British researchers discovered. Their research even suggests the insects could benefit from social distancing. 
The scientists found piles of bee carcasses outside hives infected with chronic bee paralysis virus, which causes severe trembling, flightlessness and death within a week, the Guardian reported. 
The infection was once a rarity but has spread rapidly, according to the researchers at Newcastle University, who examined bees in 25 countries. 
In Britain, for example, chronic bee paralysis virus took only a decade to invade 39 of 47 English counties and six of eight Welsh counties. In the US, the infection rate jumped from 0.7% in 2010 to 16% in 2014.
The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggests that the disease is twice as likely to infect commercially harvested bees — and that colonies not confined to the close quarters might fare better. 
“You can’t do social distancing in a hive as easily, but you can manage it by increasing the space in there,” Professor Giles Budge told the website.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stop destroying the environment or face deadlier pandemics, scientists warn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Environmentalists and scientists issued dire warnings this week: Stop environmental destruction and the illegal wildlife trade now — or face another pandemic that could wipe out civilization.
On Monday, Professors Josef Settele, Sandra Díaz and Eduardo Brondizio, along with Dr. Peter Daszak, wrote an article for The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) titled: “COVID-19 Stimulus Measures Must Save Lives, Protect Livelihoods, and Safeguard Nature to Reduce the Risk of Future Pandemics.”
The scientists warned that “Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a ‘perfect storm’ for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people. This often occurs in areas where communities live that are most vulnerable to infectious diseases.”
The scientists then pointed out that animal-to-human diseases that already exist, like Ebola, rabies or avian flu, already “cause an estimated 700,000 deaths each year.” Deaths in 2020 will skyrocket due to COVID-19, but if nature isn’t protected and animals aren’t isolated from humans, the next pandemic, they warn, will be worse.
“Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,” the scientists write.
Peter Knights, the CEO of WildAid, a conservation organization that works to end illegal poaching and consumption of wild animals, agrees. He told the Post: “Sixty percent of infectious diseases originate in animals and are transferred to humans … and the risks are increasing with deforestation and climate change. When someone logs in a rainforest and builds roads into the wild, we come into contact with species we aren’t supposed to. Humans then drive these animals into big cities and sell them at live markets, where the risks increase when you stress these animals or mix these species together.”
Some scientists believe the COVID-19 pandemic started in a wet market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, possibly jumping from humans via bats or perhaps pangolins, the world’s most trafficked animal.
“The way these cross-species jump happened is by mixing species that wouldn’t mix in the wild; they transmit diseases in close contact and under stress,” said Knights, who has started a petition calling for the end of wildlife poaching. “The wildlife trade is associated with disease. SARS [allegedly] came from bats via civets cats; HIV was [allegedly] transferred to humans via the bushmeat trade in monkeys and chimpanzees, and now COVID-19 is believed to come from bats, possibly transferred through pangolins.”
The recent decimation of the tourism industry has led to a huge uptick in poaching, which exacerbates the problem. According to the New York Times: “Heads of poaching gangs in Mozambique are planning to take advantage of reduced ranger patrols and the lack of tourists in Kruger National Park in neighboring South Africa.”
Meanwhile, CNBC reports: “In Botswana, at least six rhinos have been poached since the virus shut down tourism there … In northwest South Africa, at least nine rhinos have been killed since the virus lockdown.”
The killings affect multiple generations, as many of the rhino babies left behind either starve, are killed by other wild animals or end up in a rhino orphanage.
Even more poaching recruits are expected to sign up in the coming months.
“African countries are in dire economic straits,” Knights said. “There are a lot of unemployed people, and without tourists on safari or people working in lodges, you have less surveillance. We’re very concerned that is what is leading to the poaching spike.”
Knights and his team have been working non-stop with the governments of China and Vietnam — the largest procurers of illegally poached animals and animal parts — to try and stop this trade at the source.
“There is a demand from China and Vietnam for these exotic animals as they have traditions of eating wild animals. The size of their economies fuels a large trade,” Knights said. “But the governments are much more ready to act now than they were five years ago.”
In January, China imposed a ban on all farming and consumption of “terrestrial wildlife of important ecological, scientific and social value,” which is expected to be signed into law later this year.
After conservationists sent an open letter to Vietnam’s prime minister recommending action against the wildlife trade as a means of preventing future outbreaks of disease, that country — where wildlife restaurants have bats, civet cats, snakes, bear, monkeys and pangolins on the menu — is also looking to stop importing imperiled animals to eat.
And recently, both China and Vietnam introduced airport detection systems that can help expose someone trying to smuggle in animal parts. It’s already helped in efforts to curb the ivory trade: In early April, 11 large rhino horns were seized in Vietnam after a flight from Hong Kong was diverted from Ho Chi Minh city to Can Tho.
“Many people in China [and Vietnam] find this illegal wildlife trade as abhorrent as everyone in the west,” Knights said. “When the coronavirus broke out there was a tremendous uproar. But in a country of 1.4 billion, you don’t need that many bad actors to have (a huge impact).”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The unavoidable emotions of playing golf in coronavirus age</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This was never going to be an ordinary round of golf.
That was apparent the moment I lay my head on the pillow Friday night, my mind already racing thinking about playing golf at 8 o’clock Saturday morning in what was going to be my first round in the COVID-19 age.
I had a difficult time sleeping, anxious about what I was going to do in the morning — excited to play but at the same time apprehensive about putting myself or anyone else at risk.
With New Jersey golf courses closed by order of Gov. Phil Murphy as the shelter-at-home measures were being pushed in an effort to flatten the curve of the virus, golf has not been a recreational option as the weather has warmed this spring.
Until Saturday morning.
This past week, Murphy lifted the restrictions and allowed for golf course and parks to reopen as of dawn Saturday.
It had been 51 days since I last played golf. The last time I’d played before Saturday, I shot 76 (a rare break of 80 for me) at San Jose Country Club in Jacksonville, Fla., with some golf writer colleagues on the eve of The Players Championship.
The next day, I covered the opening round of The Players at TPC Sawgrass, and by 10 o’clock that night, the tournament was canceled and nothing in the sports world — the entire world for that matter — has seemed normal since.
With all of us craving some sense of normalcy again, I hoped that playing golf Saturday morning would return me three or four hours of that — even with the COVID-19 restrictions on the golf course calling for no rakes in bunkers, no touching of flagsticks and raised cups, so there’s no need to reach into a cup to retrieve a holed putt.
Among the new regulations in place include twosomes, tee time intervals spaced 16 minutes apart and no congregating. We were instructed to wear a face covering at least from the parking lot to the first tee with the option to continue wearing it on the course at your discretion.
Mark McCormick, the head pro at my course, Suburban Golf Club in Union, N.J., looked like a doctor who’d just gotten out of surgery, wearing a face mask and a plastic shield over his face. I didn’t recognize him until he spoke.
My ride to Suburban Saturday morning was as fitful as the sleep I’d gotten the night before. The adrenaline and anticipation of finally playing golf after too long away from it was tempered by some apprehension. I felt a lot of weird mixed emotions.
If we’re being honest with ourselves, most of us look at everyone we encounter in these days assuming that person is carrying the virus. So, everyone looks radioactive to you — even your friends.
Though I was paired with a fellow member who I hadn’t met before but was a terrific guy with a similar sports background and interests to me, I had an overwhelming feeling that I’d have been better off playing by myself — at least for my first round back. This was completely a product of my own apprehension about being around people, certainly not his company.
I felt like I spent more time during the round strategizing how to avoid veering too close to him while conversing than I did strategizing how to play each hole.
I had a quiet freak-out moment on the fifth green when my playing partner inadvertently put his club in my bag and, as a result, touched my bag. I thought about that for the rest of the round.
Playing for the first time during this COVID-19 age, I felt like I was dipping my toe into the icy Atlantic Ocean water for that first swim of the spring, wondering if I was ready to go all the way in.
Was this too soon?
The vibe at the course was notably subdued. The usual chatter and needling that usually takes place was replaced by a whole lot of silence.
Part of the emotions I wrestled with, too, were pangs of guilt. Just two days ago, I got a text from my best friend telling me he’d contracted the virus and was quarantining at his apartment in the city. And here was I was about to enjoy a 70-degree Saturday playing 18 holes on a beautiful golf course.
I did it. I enjoyed it. And I’ll do it again when I can. I shot 83, but would not have given a damn if I shot 103. I was just happy to be playing again.
“How’d you play?’’ a friend asked us as we walked off the 18th green.
“Well,’’ my playing partner responded, “we played.’’
Amen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus’ racially disparate impact is no surprise — pols ignored causes for years</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a display of the worst kind of political catch-up, Mayor Bill de Blasio last Sunday appointed his wife Chirlane as head of a coronavirus racial-inequality task force.
Six years into his tenure, de Blasio seeks to identify the “structural racism” that contributes to the health-care and health-outcomes disparities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as city data shows the virus hitting especially hard at New York’s black and Hispanic communities.
Thing is, this isn’t anything new: In particular, the conditions associated with much higher deaths from the bug, including obesity and hypertension, have long plagued blacks and Hispanics at elevated levels.
But: “The city and state have long been aware of these disparities” fumed Chris Norwood, head of the Bronx-based Health People — after all, treating “chronic disease is practically the entire Medicaid budget.”
Decades of national data show that African Americans are 20 percent are more likely to have asthma and 40 percent more likely to be hypertensive. And black women are three times more likely to have lupus.
Critics like Norwood say the state and city health departments know perfectly well the massive studies showing what works to reduce the toll of chronic disease — yet have been utterly indifferent for years.
Charmaine Ruddock, executive director of Bronx Health REACH, says the city has been slow to address many of the disconcerting perceptions in the black and Hispanic communities about their risk of getting COVID-19 and the precautionary measures needed.
City and state leaders know that health behaviors in these communities need to change, Ruddock also notes — but those leaders have never scaled up programs that could help do that.
Instead, state and city budgets have devoted resources to the needs of special interests. Yet de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo pretend to be blindsided by the higher death tolls in communities of color.
We don’t really need a new panel to examine the health-disparity issue. If anything, the pandemic has revealed to black and Hispanic New Yorkers the indifference of the local progressive leadership when it comes to the chronic diseases decimating their communities.
Maybe they’ll make them pay the price for that indifference once the pandemic recedes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FDA approves coronavirus antibody test that boasts near-perfect accuracy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Food and Drug Administration gave emergency approval to a COVID-19 antibody test that boasts near-perfect accuracy, the company said Sunday.
Swiss drugmaker Roche said the new test, which determines whether someone had a past infection, has proven 100% accurate at detecting antibodies in the blood and 99.8% accurate at ruling out the presence of them.
The company said the test requires intravenous blood draws, with higher accuracy than finger-prick tests.
“If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve … when you take blood from the vein,” said Thomas Schinecker, the company’s head of diagnostics.
“You have to have very, very high specificity. Even 0.1% or 0.2% makes a difference.”
Schinecker said the tests are an important step in determining whether someone may have immunity, but acknowledged that more research is required to determine whether antibodies protect people from being reinfected.
“Since this virus is not well known, one can hypothesize, but the proof will take longer,” Schinecker said. “Testing these people … is key to seeing whether or not people really have developed immunity.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: In Cameroon, chloroquine therapy hailed by French expert becomes state protocol</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite having authorised treatment in a very restricted manner for serious cases, France has shown scepticism regarding a dual therapy combining chloroquine (an antimalarial), or its derivative hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin (an antibiotic used for lung and ENT infections and angina) to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. On April 22, France's Health Minister Olivier Véran said the most recent publications from clinical studies were not in favour of the dual therapy. Six days later, during a speech on France’s strategy for lifting its Covid-19 lockdown, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe clearly reaffirmed the government's position: “To date, no treatment has proven effective.”
The debate surrounding the protocol of Dr Didier Raoult, the director of the University Hospital Institute (IHU) Méditerranée Infection in the southern city of Marseille, continues to divide the country’s medical community. But while some French professionals consider the treatment too toxic and doubt its effectiveness, many African countries, already accustomed to anti-malarial drugs, have decided in favour of the reseacher and professor. This is notably the case in Cameroon, which has adopted Raoult's dual therapy.
Although the country increased its knowledge of epidemics following the appearance of Ebola in the region, its medical capacities remain limited and a European-style scenario, with a multiplication of serious Covid-19 cases, could lead to a catastrophe. In mid-March, as the epidemic began to spread across Cameroon and European countries, already hard hit, launched lockdown plans, the first video of Raoult selling the effectiveness of his protocol was widely shared on Cameroonian social networks, raising great hopes. In a country where part of the population still has major difficulties in accessing healthcare, the prospect of a treatment based on accessible, inexpensive and familiar drugs appeared to be a blessing.
A chloroquine treatment
On March 27, in a memorandum from Cameroon’s Ministry of Health, the country’s scientific council proposed the widespread use of chloroquine treatment. Judged “promising”, the treatment could make it possible to reduce viral load and contagiousness, even if the group of scientists acknowledged a “lack of conclusive data”. Finally, the council wished to combine the treatment, as recommended by Raoult, with azithromycin to avoid the risks of secondary infections. On April 9, the protocol was validated for the management of all types of patients with positive Covid-19 tests, from asymptomatic cases to patients suffering from severe infections.
“With the arrival of the first cases, the clinicians were tempted to try the protocols themselves, and it was necessary to give clear instructions quickly to organise the response,” explained Dr Alain Etoundi, director of the fight against disease, epidemics and pandemics at Cameroon’s Ministry of Health, to FRANCE 24. 
“The question of the supposed toxicity of chloroquine has been addressed and dismissed by the council. So far, the results that are coming to us seem satisfactory, but the evaluation of the treatment is ongoing,” he said.
A ‘national hero’
Professor William Ngatchou is a cardiovascular surgeon at the General Hospital in Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon. When FRANCE 24 asked him if he had heard of Professor Raoult, he responded with amusement: “Everyone knows Professor Raoult in Cameroon! Some even consider him like a national hero.” Like many health professionals in the country, Ngatchou thinks that the effectiveness of dual therapy combining an antimalarial and an antibiotic has been proven: “It’s been almost two months that this protocol has been in use for patients with Covid-19. I myself have noticed significant improvements in patients with its use, and the debate about the side effects of chloroquine seems very exaggerated to me.”
Seven weeks after the detection of the first Covid-19 case on Cameroonian soil, there are more than 2,050 confirmed cases in the country. The progress of the virus seems, as in many African countries, to be much slower than indicated by scientific modelling. Nevertheless, Etoundi asserted that treatment is only one element of a global health policy and it is far too early to claim victory: “We are in a phase where the disease is on the rise and the peak has not yet been reached. Anything is still possible.”
Supply problems and a black market explosion
Beyond a public health resolution, the choice of dual therapy represents a logistical challenge in Cameroon. For while chloroquine was massively used in the country at one time, it has been several decades since it lost its effectiveness in the fight against malaria and was replaced by other, more effective drugs. “Stocks were totally exhausted, we had to place large orders abroad and restart national industrial production," explained Etoundi.
In Cameroon, public hospitals have been selected to centralise Covid-19 patients. In theory, stocks of chloroquine and azithromycin are sufficient there, although a source within medical services, contacted by FRANCE 24, reported occasional shortages. But the situation is more complex in the pharmaceutical sector. Private pharmacies, very important in Cameroon, sometimes play the role of doctor, and they are not authorized to sell chloroquine.
“As soon as we started talking about the disease in March, a lot of people wanted to buy stocks of chloroquine from us, some aggressively. Others came to try to sell us some,” a pharmacist in a working-class neighbourhood in Douala told FRANCE 24. “Here, demand for the Covid treatment is exploding, we quadrupled our sales of azithromycin between March and April. Since we don't have chloroquine, customers have switched to similar antimalarial drugs like Artequin, which is already out of stock at wholesalers,” she said.
The black market for drugs, already flourishing in normal times in Cameroon, is on the rise with the Covid-19 crisis. The authorities have already issued several alerts about the circulation of fake chloroquine within the health network.
Finally, another subject that worries the government is the disappearance of hydroxychloroquine, the chloroquine derivative,  also recommended by Professor Raoult. It was previously sold over the counter in pharmacies and was very little used, because it was reserved for the treatment of specific diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. “The shelves have been robbed very quickly, yet patients depend on these drugs. They now find themselves destitute and we must find solutions to protect them,” Etoundi said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can children spread the coronavirus? It’s complicated.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As most of the world continues to socially distance because of the coronavirus, Switzerland’s infectious disease chief wants to loosen restrictions for children — so they can hug their grandparents.
It’s a poignant move, as it was made in part to benefit older people’s mental health. But it’s also very risky, as it’s unclear whether or not young children, who generally seem to get mild cases of Covid-19, transmit the disease to others at similar rates as adults.
As that scientific debate rages, Daniel Koch, the Swiss infectious disease chief, firmly planted his flag on one side of it Wednesday. “Young children are not infected and do not transmit the virus,” he told reporters, referring to a study released this month as well as his conversations with Swiss health experts.
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, where Koch works, says children under 10 years old rarely get the virus. “When they get sick, they often have only light symptoms,” spokesperson Yann Hulmann told me in an email. “They are apparently not big spreaders and are often infected by adults. So reopening schools does not seem to be a major problem.”
The risk of such a hug “is very low compared to the benefit for the mental health of the grandparents,” Hulmann added.
The views of Swiss officials didn’t come out of nowhere. They come amid a growingnumber of released reports from public health and infectious disease experts suggesting children spread the virus far less than adults. They form part of the justification for why Denmark reopened its schools earlier this month and why Spain this week allowed children 13 years old or younger to play outside.
But the science is far from settled. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says kids “can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.” And other studies show children continue to display similar transmission abilities as adults, leading experts to caution against trusting kids not to spread the disease.
“What we don’t know yet is the degree to which children can transmit the virus,” Dr. Danielle Zerr, an infectious disease expert at Seattle Children’s Hospital, told me.
This isn’t some trivial debate. World leaders face hard choices over which parts of society to reopen, when, and how quickly. Plus, staying home from school could curb children’s educational progress, while disrupting the work-life balance for adults. If children can head back to school with minimal health risks, then that could prove a major benefit for the child, their parents, and society at large.
But at the moment, the only thing that’s clear is that there’s no real clarity on this issue. Still, it’s worth looking into the science for each case, and what the data does and doesn’t say about coronavirus transmissibility from young children.
It’s not entirely clear why, but so far, children don’t seem to be getting Covid-19 as often as adults. As Business Insider pointed out on Thursday:
And there is a growing body of scientific literature showing young children may not be as likely to spread the virus to others as older people.
Take this April 22 study from the government of New South Wales, the Australian state that contains one-third of the country’s population and the city of Sydney. Researchers looked at five primary schools, with kindergarten through seventh grade (in US terms), from March to mid-April of this year. Schools prove a valuable testing case, not only because there are many children to observe, but also because they allow experts to gauge when the right time to restart normal schooling might be.
As the chart below shows, they found that only one person out of 168 in close contact with an infected person got sick with the virus.
Which led to the following conclusion: Covid-19 “transmission in children in schools appears considerably less than seen for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.”
Top Australian officials, including Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, are now citing this report to say social distancing measures don’t need to be followed in schools as the country considers reopening them fully in the near future.
But Dr. Kristine Macartney, the study’s lead author, pushed back on such conclusions. “We did see low transmission, we didn’t see no transmission,” she told me. “I think children can still transmit coronavirus. That’s certainly the case. We’ve seen that.”
Macartney also noted the study is still a preliminary finding — it will go through the peer review process soon — and that more research is required. Her team “didn’t actually evaluate” whether the observed schools followed social distancing guidelines or not, and class attendance dropped considerably in April, meaning new cases of community spread among her study’s population could have emerged after its conclusion. “I don’t think our findings should be used as a single piece of evidence in anybody’s policy,” she said.
What she does emphasize is: “It’s not that transmission can’t happen, it’s just that evidence is suggesting ... that [transmission among children] happens at a lower rate than does transmission between adults.”
Other evidence for that claim includes a March non-peer-reviewed study from experts in China and Australia. Between December 2019 and March 2020, researchers looked at 31 households with coronavirus infections in China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Iran.
What they found was someone 18 years or younger brought the disease into the home in just under 10 percent of cases. That’s remarkable, since previous studies had shown children were responsible for infecting their families with H5N1 bird flu in about 50 percent of cases.
The preliminary evidence for the claim that children don’t transmit the coronavirus at high rates also led the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) to be optimistic about kids and transmission on their website: “Data from population-based and cross-sectional studies indicate that children are unlikely to be primary source cases.”
However, when I followed up with the ECDC, spokesperson Alexandru Niculae told me in an email these and other studies “cannot be considered as ‘enough evidence’, this is still considered limited data; so we need to take this with a pinch of salt for the time being.”
Despite all those studies, multiple experts told me it’s still completely possible that kids could be significant spreaders of the disease. Seattle Children’s Zerr is one of them. “If we document high levels of virus in their nose, I don’t know why they would be less likely to transmit,” she told me.
In other words, a child doesn’t necessarily have to be very ill to spread the virus. As long as a kid is near others with a load of virus in the nose or mouth — symptomatic or not — they could be a carrier and a transmitter.
A study released by Germany’s chief virologist Christian Drosten and others this week backs Zerr’s skepticism. Here’s what they found: “Analysis of variance of viral loads in patients of different age categories found no significant difference between any pair of age categories including children,” the researchers wrote. “In particular, these data indicate that viral loads in the very young do not differ significantly from those of adults.”
“Based on these results, we have to caution against an unlimited re-opening of schools and kindergartens in the present situation,” they concluded. “Children may be as infectious as adults.”
You can see a chart from the report below, which Drosten tweeted out Wednesday. What it makes clear, though, is the study looked at fewer cases of infected children than other age groups, which may have skewed the results. The paper also hasn’t yet been peer reviewed.
All this means there’s no scientific consensus on the infectiousness of children — and that has many health officials urging caution.
The US CDC’s website, for example, says:
And Beth Riggs, a spokesperson for the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told me they continue to ask visitors — including young people — to follow “universal masking policies in place to help limit the potential spread of the virus and protect our patients, their families and our staff.”
Which makes the Swiss case — allowing health children to hug their grandparents — all the more troubling. It’s not that the country’s health officials say kids can roam free, but suggesting they effectively pose no risk is too absolute for experts like Zerr. “We have so much evidence of children with infections,” she told me after I read her the Swiss infection disease chief’s statement to the press. Koch’s statement, she told me, is “just not true.”
Covid-19 is a new disease, and as such, scientists have a lot more replicable research to do before the world can begin to even come close to understanding how children may spread it. And this uncertainty has many still taking necessary precautions until there’s more and confirmed evidence about whether children are actually rare spreaders of the disease.
In times like these, then, the cautious approach might be the best one.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This week, wild roses are blooming in my back yard. Unlike hybrid tea roses, these roses bloom only once a year. And this year, their bright blossoms are all the more precious.
Like the wild rose, life brings us surprises, some welcome, some not. For the past few weeks, people all over the world have been suffering from fear and uncertainty, experiencing the challenge of the COVID-19 Coronavirus. Schools, workplaces, restaurants, theatres, and local shops have closed, familiar routines have been disrupted by lockdowns and social distancing, and each day’s news brings frightening statistics as we worry about how to stay safe. The virus has brought suffering, loss, and mental health challenges as lockdowns and closures have narrowed our lives.
Cut off from our normal routines, family and friends, there is so much we cannot do. Yet although we cannot go out as we used to, what we can do is go within. We can take the time to reflect, get to know ourselves on a deeper level, and live from a more centered space. Here are five simple practices to help you find greater hope and peace of mind.
1. Practicing Nonviolent Communication. We can find greater peace of mind by applying psychologist Marshall Rosenberg’s nonviolent communication (2005) to ourselves. To begin this practice:
2.Moving Forward with Hope.
3. Practicing Self-Compassion. Whenever you’re feeling stressed or anxious, instead of spiraling into worry and self-criticism, you can find greater peace of mind with this simple practice:
4. Finding Greater Peace with Gratitude. Spend a little time at the end of each day to count your blessings, to focus on what you’re grateful for. Research has shown that this practice can improve your physical and emotional health (Emmons, 2008; Hill et al, 2013; Petrocchi & Couyoumdjian, 2016).
5. Sharing Compassion. Even with social distancing, there are still ways to reach out to friends,
family, and the larger community in your heart and your actions. You might:
In this time of challenge and change, may new hope blossom in your heart like the wild rose.
