    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain to trial new coronavirus tracing system</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove said on Sunday as the government looks at how to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection.
Suffering one of the worst death tolls in Europe from COVID-19, Britain is confident that the peak of the virus has passed and is now looking at how to restart its shuttered economy and ease social restrictions on citizens.
“This week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having that in place more widely later this month,” Gove told a news conference.
A mass testing system along with the ability to trace people who have been in contact with those who test positive are seen as crucial to preventing a second spike and facilitating the relaxation of a lockdown which has lasted almost six weeks.
Gove said the system being trialled next week would include asking citizens on the island to download a smartphone app as well as traditional ways of tracing those who have come into contact with a patient who has tested positive.
“We will be able to make sure that people who are suffering from the virus ... they and their contacts can be encouraged to stay at home, so that we can limit the potential of any outbreak,” Gove said.
The Isle of Wight has around 80,000 households.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Supermarkets could stay open longer on Sundays in government plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Supermarkets could stay open for longer on Sundays as part of government plans to deal with coronavirus.
Boris Johnson today confirmed he is "looking at" relaxing strict laws which govern how long shops can open for on the weekend.
The Prime Minister said things could be done "differently and better", adding: "Why not start being flexible?"
No details of any review, including when and how any changes could happen, have been confirmed.
However, a senior bishop has signalled the Church of England could swing behind a temporary relaxation of the rules.
Large shops such as supermarkets are banned from opening for longer than six hours on Sundays between 10am and 6pm.
Longer hours have long been opposed by Tory MPs and religious groups - who say Sunday must be "special" for low-wage staff and small shops trying to compete.
But the coronavirus crisis has led to an unprecedented demand at supermarkets, with long queues outside as fewer people are allowed in due to social distancing.
Now there are signs the Church of England could accept a temporary relaxing of Sunday trading laws to boost the economy.
Dr Alan Smith, The Bishop of St Albans, said the pandemic meant "we must all think about innovative and flexible ways to protect our local economies."
Dr Smith, who speaks on behalf of the Church in the House of Lords, told the Sunday Telegraph: "We have always wanted to protect workers' mental well-being and it is clear having a day off in common with the rest of our communities is key to those protections.
"The opportunity for a day of rest for all workers to spend time with loved ones is a basic right.
"So, while the novel coronavirus means we must all think about innovative and flexible ways to protect our local economies, it must not be at the expense of workers."
According to reports, Business Secretary Alok Sharma has privately lobbied for Sunday trading laws to be eased during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Today Boris Johnson said the government was "looking at" relaxing laws restricting supermarket opening hours.
He told the Sun on Sunday: "We are looking at Sunday trading, as we did in the 2012 Olympics.
"Why not start being flexible on things? If there is social distancing in shops, convenient for people, let's look at that.
"But there are all sorts of ways in which we can start doing things differently and better."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Seagate One Touch STJE1000402 1TB portable solid state drive is down to $129.99 at Newegg with code 93XPJ39. That's a great low price because the 1TB One Touch normally sells for around $160 or more. You can find it going for $165 at Staples right now. The One Touch has dropped to $140 at a few retailers like Best Buy, but Newegg is the only one offering an extra $10 off. That makes it the best place to go for this portable SSD today.
Portable SSDs are usually priced at a premium just because they offer a significant upgrade over portable hard drives in terms of durability and speed, but if you don't want to pay that price and still need some portable storage, we've got you covered. Newegg also has the Seagate Expansion 2TB portable hard drive on sale for $55.99. That's more space and a much more affordable price.

Super compact, lightweight, uses a textile design, and fits in the palm of your hand. Has transfer speeds up to 400 MB/s and a USB 3.0 connection. Use it for backup and synchronization. Works with Windows or Mac without reformatting.
With coupon: 93XPJ39
In a perfect world, portable solid state drives would be just as inexpensive as portable hard drives. After all, the main feature of SSDs is they have no moving parts, which really makes them perfect for carrying data on the move. Hard drives are much more prone to failure when getting knocked around in your backpack or trampled on the subway. Unfortunately, we're not there yet. Luckily this deal shaves some of that cost off the top and you get a really good product out of it.
The One Touch is a mini SSD. It's super compact, very lightweight, and it can fit in the palm of your hand. It also has a nice textile design. It's also super high speed and connects via USB 3.0 with transfer speeds up to 400 MB/s.
You can use this drive seamlessly with Windows or Mac, and you don't need to reformat it. It's compatible with Windows 7 or higher and Mac OS X 10.12 or higher. If you do want to use it with Mac's Time Machine, you'll need to reformat. Otherwise, you can just transfer media and data easily between operating systems.
You'll also get a year subscription to Mylio Create and two months of Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan. Seagate covers this with a 3-year warranty.

McDonald's Netherlands recently tested new features at a location in the Dutch city of Arnhem, including meal trolleys and designated waiting spots to separate customers. 
"These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don't notice them too much," McDonald's Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters.
In the US, a representative told Business Insider that the chain is moving "thoughtfully and judiciously to make changes to our operations in collaboration with our franchisees." McDonald's has already changed nearly 50 processes, the representative said, including wellness checks, installing protective barriers, social distancing floor decals, and providing thermometers to restaurants.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006, and it's turned into the world's biggest and most powerful online video company and an advertising juggernaut.
With original programming and user-generated content that reaches more than two billion people each month, YouTube rivals streaming giants including Netflix and Amazon.
It pulled in $15 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, more than TV networks ABC, NBC, and Fox combined. Another $3 billion came from non-ad revenue in products like YouTube Music and YouTube TV, though YouTube pays a portion of that money back to networks and publishers in distribution rights. And YouTube is making a bigger push into TV and streaming as more people shift from watching linear TV.
Business Insider identified the 33 executives there with the most power, from policy, engineering, content, and advertising, these insiders are leading all of YouTube's businesses.
The platform has turned content creators, from MrBeast to Emma Chamberlain, into stars with multi-platform businesses and major brand partnerships. With the help of partner managers, top YouTube creators are establishing new business models for Hollywood.
YouTube has also drawn regulators' antitrust and privacy questions. In September, YouTube got hit with a $170 million fee for reportedly violating the Child Online Privacy Protection Act. The company has struggled to keep out extremist content and ads that break its rules against misinformation.
Business Insider identified the top people behind YouTube's growing ad business. They include Kevin Allocca, who leads the global culture and trends team focused on analyzing and tracking trending content at YouTube. It also includes leaders like Neal Mohan, who reports directly to CEO Susan Wojcicki and oversees all of the products on the viewer and creator side.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I drove a $62,000 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon — here are the rugged pickup truck's best features</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The midsize pickup-truck segment had for some time been left to the popular Toyota Tacoma and the ancient Nissan Frontier. But about five years ago, automakers decided to liven it up. Chevy brought back its Colorado pickup (as well as a GMC version, the Canyon). Then Honda revamped its Ridgeline, and Ford reintroduced the Ranger.
Jeep has done a small pickup in the past, so when it announced that it would restore the Gladiator nameplate to an all-new truck, there was much rejoicing.
The pickup arrived last year, and I recently tested it. The upshot was that it gives the off-road-focused Chevy Colorado Bison ZR1 a run for its money.
The Gladiator Rubicon, with its stout 4x4 setup and premium extras, is perhaps the full-featured midsize pickup money can buy.
Here's why:
UConnect is an industry underdog, but we've found it matches up well against the competition. It does everything well, from GPS navigation to Bluetooth and USB device connectivity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adidas is using AI and 3D printing to cope with a plunge in sales during the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">German sportswear giant Adidas plans to bolster its lagging performance by shifting strategy to focus on its digital platform.The fitness brand reported a 19% sales decline this week as more than 70% of its global stores remained closed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over an earnings call with company executives, Adidas zeroed in on plans for "digital acceleration" and said it would pivot to a greater focus on its digital presence now that it has limited capacity to operate out of physical stores.
Business Insider got some insights from Adidas into what its revamped digital focus involves: 
Adidas also says it is investing in its digital retail infrastructure, and is reaping the benefits during the coronavirus as its online stores, as well of those of partner retailers, are open all the time. Its physical stores and other sporting-goods retailers remain closed in most parts of the world.
The brand's ecommerce sales saw the highest growth rate on record last year, a jump of 34%. That spurt accelerated even further as sales for ecommerce grew by 35% in currency-neutral terms with 55% growth in March this year.The firm aims to support this trend by connecting experts from its retail teams, mobile-fitness app Runtastic, and the IT team, all working towards building up ecommerce. Adidas is also extending partnership programs with digital pure players — companies that only run virtually — such as Zalando, Asos, Zappos, and Tmall.
 
As well as focusing more heavily on ecommerce, Adidas is also promoting heavily products that are selling well while people are stuck at home. The brand is increasingly promoting products like the Adilette Slides — a favorite among consumers working from home — as they have enjoyed high demand on the brand's channels. Adilette sales went up by a 'triple-digit percentage' rate in April, the company said.
For its sports apps "adidas Running" and "adidas Training", the brand has been offering free premium access since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, hundreds of thousands of athletes have used more than 250 training videos, workouts and training plans to continue keeping fit from home.
Adidas has also focused its marketing investments and efforts towards digital and social media channels and an increase in digital storytelling under the hashtag "#hometeam."
Over the past few weeks, the brand has shared inspiring home stories from the daily lives of numerous brand ambassadors around the world who demonstrate creative ways to "make the most of time at home and, of course, to continue to exercise."

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast: Temperatures to hit 18C as rain gives way to spring sunshine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's set to be a bright and sunny day today with temperatures forecast to reach a balmy 18C.
Brits will be treated to a return of spring weather as the low pressure which has dumped torrential rain on much of the country this week is now forecast to move across Europe.
Many areas are set to see temperatures get warmer, with the Met Office predicting highs of 17 to 18C in the southeast, with 14 to 15C felt across the UK.
Lows of 12C are forecast in Newcastle and Edinburgh.
As the UK spends its sixth weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, conditions are also due to be drier and more settled thanks to building high pressure.
However, the odd shower is possible and some could turn heavy, particularly in the north and east of the country.
Giving the latest forecast, a Met Office spokesman said: "Despite the chilly start it will soon warm up, plenty of sunshine for England, Wales, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland.
"As temperatures build, further showers will develop. It's essentially a day of sunny spells and showers but it's across central and eastern England where the heaviest and most frequent downpours will be.
"Further south, the best of any sunshine 17 or 18C in the southeast.
"Showers will continue to ease away as we head into Saturday evening but still one or two clinging on, a bit more cloud into Cornwall perhaps one or two spots of rain.
"Sunday is looking largely dry with showers easing and a bit more sunshine."
Today:
A chilly start then sunny intervals and showers, some heavy in the north and east. Many western and southern areas remaining dry but becoming cloudier with perhaps a little rain in the far southwest later. Feeling warm in the sunshine.
Tonight:
Showers dying out to leave a chilly night with clear spells for many central parts. Cloudier in the northeast and southwest with some patchy rain in places.
Sunday:
Another day of sunny intervals and showers for many northern and eastern parts. Cloudier in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Monday to Wednesday :
Mainly dry, sunny spells developing, few showers in Eastern England on Monday. Mainly dry, sunny spells in most places, but heavy showers in SW Tuesday. Dry and sunny on Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: India makes government tracing app mandatory for all workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country’s National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
“Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,” India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.
It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations “to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees,” the ministry said.
Officials at India’s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India’s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app’s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
“Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,” said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used “only for administering necessary medical interventions”.
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain the spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Explained: Fighting Covid-19 with phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the world and India battle the novel coronaviruspandemic, India has all but made it mandatory to download and use a mobile phone application called Aarogya Setu developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
According to new guidelines for the extended lockdown beyond May 3, use of Aarogya Setu is required for all employees, private and public, with the head of the organisation made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage among employees. Earlier in the week, all central government employees were asked to download the app and, beginning Friday, it has been made mandatory for everyone crossing the Delhi-Gurgaon border.
How does a mobile phone app help in the control of a viral epidemic?
The Indian government has adopted the strategy of aggressive and elaborate ‘contact tracing’ (along with testing) as the key to controlling the disease and restricting its spread.
Aarogya Setu is a contact tracing app that uses GPS coordinates and Bluetooth data to track the user’s location, both on their own, as well as relative to other users, to establish whether they have come physically close to someone suffering from COVID-19, and to make an assessment of their risk of infection.
Many countries are using mobile apps to track the spread and progress of the disease. South Korea and Singapore were the early starters. In South Korea, the app was rolled out by private developers; in Singapore, it was an initiative of the government.
The use of these apps has been credited with a significant extent for these countries’ success in flattening the disease curve. The outbreak in these countries began relatively early, but as of the end of April, South Korea had under 11,000 cases and 247 deaths, while Singapore had 15,000-odd cases and only 14 deaths. Their case fatality rate and deaths per 1 lakh population were very low — 2.3% and 0.48, and 0.1% and 0.25 respectively, according to data on the Johns Hopkins University pandemic tracking dashboard.
China has been using health apps to ward off a potential second wave of infection. Italy, which seems to have got over the worst of its crisis, is working on an app, and Germany has backed a joint Google-Apple initiative to build a contact tracing API. The same initiative is under discussion in France, amid disagreement over the amount of data to be collected.
In the UK, a Bluetooth-based contact tracing app is under testing. In Israel, the NSO group, which built the Pegasus surveillance software last year, has tested a contact tracing app, even though an initiative by the Israeli police to use mobile phone location to enforce quarantine measures has been blocked by Parliament over privacy concerns.

Several health experts have argued that a key tool at governments’ disposal to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, and which was not around during the 1918 Spanish Flu, is the ability to harness digital technologies to track the spread. At the same time, deployment of contact tracing apps by governments or public health authorities has added to the debate on online privacy and personal data protection.
While some of these apps have sought sweeping access to smartphone functionalities, others stop just short of that, collecting and uploading data without specifically obtaining the consent of users in every case.
So, which countries already have such apps, and what data do they collect?
There are private initiatives in several countries, but the main government-backed apps are, apart from India, in Poland, Singapore, Iceland, and Australia. Each of these apps requires a specific set of permissions from users, and have different policies on how they store, maintain and share data collected from users.
A comparison of the terms and conditions of their use is in the chart. This analysis is based on the Android versions of the apps; the iOS versions too, need similar permissions.
India’s Aarogya Setu seeks nine sets of permissions (in the chart, the entry on Bluetooth refers to two sets of permissions) — including for network-based location, GPS location, receiving data from the Internet, running at device start-up, and preventing the device from ‘sleeping’. The number of permissions sought by Aarogya Setu is higher than only Australia’s COVIDSafe app, which does not seek permission for network-based location or for receiving data from the Internet.
The reasons for seeking particular permissions range from the purpose and design of a certain app, to the data that the app’s developer intends to collect. For example, the “prevent device from sleeping” permission, which all apps analysed for this report (except Australia’s COVIDSafe) seek, is intended to ensure the app is able to keep the smartphone’s CPU awake to complete work.
Android devices are designed to fall asleep when idle, to prevent draining of the battery. But some apps need to work in the background, and for this, they seek permission to wake up the phone’s screen or CPU.
Again, given that Poland’s Home Quarantine app is meant to ensure those under quarantine stay that way, it periodically asks people to upload a selfie, which is geotagged. Upon failure by a user, police are notified. To make this effective, the app seeks access to camera and storage.
How exactly does Aarogya Setu work?
India’s official COVID-19 contact tracing app functions in the following manner:
When someone registers on the app, their name, phone number, age, sex, profession and the countries they visited in the last 30 days are collected, and stored on a server run by the Government of India. This is stored with a unique ID, which is used to identify the user in all subsequent app-related transactions. This digital ID is also associated with any information that may subsequently be uploaded.
At time of registration, the person’s location details are collected from the device, and uploaded to the server. For the app to do its job, users must keep the location and Bluetooth features switched on at all times.
When two registered users come within Bluetooth range of each other, typically less than 10 metres, the apps on their respective devices will automatically exchange the digital IDs and record the time and GPS location at which the contact took place.
This information collected at this point is stored locally on the devices. If one of these registered users tests positive for COVID-19, the information will be uploaded from their mobile device, and stored on the server.
According to Aarogya Setu’s privacy policy, the app continuously collects the user’s location data and stores it on the device, creating a record of all the places visited at 15-minute intervals. Further, every time a user conducts a self-assessment on the app, tick-marking COVID-19 symptoms, the app marks this user Yellow, Orange or Green, based in a reducing order of threat, with Green meaning the person is safe.
What about questions of user privacy?
One of the red flags being raised about Aarogya Setu is that it collects a single blanket consent from the user at the beginning, and the details of what this consent would be used for, is included in the privacy policy. This is not the case with similar apps in other countries. The privacy policy of Australia’s COVIDSafe notes, for example:
“We cannot access any contact data stored on a device, or share this with health officials, unless and until a COVIDSafe user consents to upload the data to the data store.” The COVIDSafe app is based on a source code from Singapore’s TraceTogether app, but differs from the original app in several ways.
Around the world, questions have also been raised about what happens to the data and the app itself once the pandemic recedes.
Policies of these apps have detailed clauses on deletion of data. Iceland’s Rakning C-19 app says phone numbers it stored will be deleted when the need for contact tracing is over, and all location data will be deleted from the database 14 days after uploading.
COVIDSafe gives an option to its users to request deletion of data held in its database; this is in addition to all contact data being automatically deleted after 21 days.
Aarogya Setu says that “all personal information collected. at the time of registration will be retained for as long as your account remains in existence and for such period thereafter as required under any law for the time being in force”. It will, however, purge all data stored on the app that is not uploaded to the server after 30 days.
Singapore’s TraceTogether app says that on request, it will delete contact information and identifiers from its servers, thus rendering “meaningless all data that your phone has exchanged with other phones, because that data will no longer be associated with you”.
How many people are currently using Aarogya Setu?
The Android and iOS versions of the app have been downloaded more than 75 million times, according to official data.
While Aarogya Setu started off as a voluntary exercise to top the government’s efforts of containing the COVID-19 outbreak, it is gradually inching towards becoming one of the mainstays in the battle. The government has mandated all central government employees and officers to download the app. Only if they are marked “safe” or at “low-risk” by the app should they commute to work, the government order said.
This is in addition to several private companies asking employees to download the app as they prepare for lifting of the lockdown. It is possible that a ‘safe’ status on Aarogya Setu could become a formal or informal ‘permit’ to enter public buildings and spaces in the future.
There is one important point to consider regarding penetration of the app, however – which is directly linked to its effectiveness.

Officials from most of the governments rolling out these apps have pointed out that the key factor that will determine the success of these projects would be the rapid emergence of a critical mass of users. The apps, including Aarogya Setu, must have a penetration of at least 50%. This means that unless half the population of the country downloads the contact tracing app, the intended outcome will not be achieved.
While this is a reason for governments to aggressively push for downloads, critics have argued that this particular response to the pandemic opens out a vast space for intrusive surveillance by state agencies, threatening the privacy of large sections of their users.
The critics have said that while some of the features that do not necessarily adhere to all privacy norms are all right as long as the app is voluntary, governments may begin to make the apps mandatory in order to achieve the necessary penetration. This could mean using the app to give a safety clearance to individuals before they use public transport, enter their workplaces or even step out of their residential premises.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India makes government tracing app mandatory for all workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI, May 2 — India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government yesterday said India — the country with the largest number of people in lockdown — would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 illness, but allow “considerable relaxations” in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu — meaning Health Bridge — a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country’s National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for Covid-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
“Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,” India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late yesterday.
It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organisations “to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees,” the ministry said.
Officials at India’s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India’s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app’s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
“Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,” said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used “only for administering necessary medical interventions”.
Yesterday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus. — Reuters

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: As the government extended the nationwide shutdown for another two weeks on Friday, it made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory to download for all office goers — in both public and private sectors. Looking to impose stricter contact tracing surveillance to contain the pandemic, the government also made the app mandatory for all those living in containment zones.
On Wednesday,  all central government employees had been asked to immediately download the app and come to office only when it shows they are ‘safe’ or ‘low-risk’.
Though the Ministry of Home Affairs has extended the shutdown till May 17, it has allowed more relaxations. Wedding functions, which were not permitted earlier, have now been allowed  in lockdown 3.0, but with a limit of not more than 50 people. Funerals will continue to have a limit of 20 people. Besides these two social commitments, all other social, religious gatherings etc. will continue to remain banned.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government launched the Aarogya Setu app in early April as a voluntary application, with its use being encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and establishments such as CBSE
The government has made the use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees.  
The Union Home Ministry declared the use of India's own contact tracing app mandatory as part of fresh guidelines rolled out along with the lockdown phase 3 to check the spread of coronavirus.
The government has also said that companies and organisations will have to achieve 100 per cent compliance with the order.
Besides, office space, the ministry has also made the app mandatory for people residing in a containment zone.
The government launched the Aarogya Setu app in early April as a voluntary application, with its use being encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and establishments such as CBSE.
The app communicates with nearby phones using Bluetooth and gathers their GPS location data. Once a user has downloaded the app, it asks for continuous Bluetooth access and location data.
By using the app, it is possible to keep track of all the people who came near or in contact with a person, who has been infected with the novel coronavirus.
The app also asks for information that includes questions related to a person's age, gender, name, health status and travel history. It also checks if the user belongs to any one of the exempted categories of professionals amid the lockdown period.
After processing all this information, the Aarogya Setu app also details whether or not the user is at risk of contracting coronavirus infection.
Steps to download and use Aarogya Setu app:
1. After downloading the app, the user needs to read and agree with the terms and conditions to register.
2. The User will need to submit his/her mobile number for verification, after which an OTP will be sent to his/her registered number.
3. Post-registration, the user can fill in personal details such as his/her name, age, profession, and country travel outside within the last 30 days.
4. The app asks users whether or not they are ready to volunteer in times of need.
5. Users can also do a self-assessment test after providing all the necessary details. The app lets users know about the chances of their infection risk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From sandwiches to saving lives: Donegal-based firm turns to making PPE</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A packaging supply company is extending its business model to make face shields.
Rapid Action Packaging (RAP) Ireland, based in Co Donegal, usually produces packaging for the food-to-go market.
The company makes hygiene food packaging for sandwiches, hot products, chilled meats and ready meals.
Its customers include coffee shops, convenience stores and retailer multiples - such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer.
But it has turned over its production line to manufacture disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) in the form of face shields.
The company has already begun operations by producing one million shields, of which the first 65,000 have been earmarked for free distribution to care homes across Ireland and the UK.
RAP says it is able to reach full-scale production immediately to deliver between seven and 10 million face shields a week.
The shield is lightweight and disposable for use among health support workers, cleaners, teaching staff, retail operatives and any other public facing role.
The material used in the shield’s construction is a high barrier protective film, commonly used in the packaging industry to protect food against bacteria, virus and other harmful pathogens.
The visor is laminated to a carton board frame, to provide a rigid head frame with an adjustable strap.
It can be produced at a cost of around 14c per unit.
James Neville is sales manager for RAP Ireland. He told Down to Business how it all started.
"We actually got a phone call from a local HSE office in Donegal to our operations director John McDermott, asking what PPE products we could or potentially produce."
"We would have normally got tooling from the USA, but we brought in tooling from the UK - and we were probably in production within four or five days".
He said prototypes were ready within 48 hours, with the support of management.
And there was not much change involved to what they do already.
"It's a reel-fed machine, the reels being fed through are wide enough to produce a product like this.
"And it's something we actually do for a lot of producers quite easily when they ask for a change or a different pack size".
He said the business saw a massive downturn with the closure of food retailers, but that gap is now being filled.
"The maths of it is we would have lost maybe 70% of our business during COVID-19 - and at the moment, in one day last week, we would have produced a million units.
"And our distribution partner, Paramount Packaging, would have got that to every corner of Ireland within 24 hours.
"If we can repeat that five to seven times a week, we're back in business".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">
Nursery children playing with teacher in the classroom
Small children should rather return to creches and primary schools first as they seem to be the least at risk of possibly infecting adults with coronavirus, according to research.
The department of basic education announced on Thursday that pupils would return to school in a phased approach from June, first starting with those doing matric and Grade 7s.
This was dependent on schools’ readiness in regards to health precautions for the return of pupils.
While some parents have objected to returning their children to school, as the number of new confirmed Covid-19 cases is still spiking, younger children are believed to pose no risk.
According to research by Don’t Forget the Bubbles, a paediatric blog for professionals, the role of children transmitting the virus is unclear but “it seems likely they do not play a significant role”.
The research found that the China-World Health Organisation joint commission could not recall cases during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.
Economist Mike Schussler said two studies in China that trace the contacts of infected people found that children are, at worst, no more likely to catch the virus than adults. If they do get infected, they were 2,000 times less likely to be killed by the virus than someone aged over 60, he said.
“Nor is there evidence that children who end up catching the disease are silent spreaders who pass it on to their families.
“Researchers in Iceland and the Netherlands have not found a single case in which a child brought the virus into their family.
“The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Union’s public health agency, said last week that child-to-adult transmission ‘appears to be uncommon’,” Schussler said.
But while schools will reopen in stages, based on the research, small children should return first to creches and primary schools as they “have the thirstiest brains and seem to be the least at risk”.
“Those facing exams should come next,” said Schussler. “Several countries have cancelled important tests; others have postponed them.
“Older [pupils] may be more at risk than the youngest ones but they are also more able to follow new protocols.
“Social distancing is possible in high schools, particularly if class sizes are reduced.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">How a low-cost ventilator was created, FDA-approved, and made its way to New York hospitals in 30 days</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scott Cohen had chills, headaches, feelings of fatigue, and a fever, all the usual hallmarks of a mild case of COVID-19. Like many New York residents, he hadn't been diagnosed, but he and his wife had most of the symptoms.
The CDC's public advice was to stay hydrated and rest, but Cohen couldn't. It was mid-March and he was working on the Spiro Wave, a device which he hoped would help the city as it scrambled in the face of a significant ventilator shortage — a situation doctors in Italy had been warning about for weeks.
A typical ventilator costs around $30,000, consists of about a million lines of code, requires a lengthy training to use and is often complicated to produce. There are over 22 different technical standards a ventilator must be independently tested for before it can be used. According to an April Johns Hopkins report, the US only had  173,000 ventilators, while some experts were predicting that at least 2.4 million Americans would soon need ventilators.
Companies like Ford Motor announced they'd be producing as many as 50,000 ventilators for hospitals. Production began the week of April 20, but it would be months before those ventilators made their way to hospitals.
Meanwhile, Cohen's $3,300 Spiro Wave ventilator, which was designed, manufactured, and received FDA "emergency use" approval within 30 days, is designed for immediate use. 
The Spiro Wave works as a bridge ventilator, not for the most severely ill patients, but for more stable patients who need help breathing but aren't at such a critical stage.
The device has robotic hands which compress an "ambu bag" — a respiratory bag found in many hospitals — regulating the volume of air and oxygen being pushed into a patient. What a typical care provider might have to do by hand for patients that need help breathing but may not require a ventilator yet, the Spiro Wave will do automatically.
This ensures traditional ventilators, which can also regulate oxygen and air, only get used on the most critically ill patients and makes the work of care providers a little easier.
"The Spiro Wave is not meant to replace ventilators completely, but it expands the functionality of a manual resuscitator bag," Albert Kwon, anesthesiologist at Westchester Medical Center, and member of the Spiro Wave effort, said in a Spiro Wave press conference.
"It helps free up human resources, increases quality control from where a human may be manually bagging a patient, and it helps hospital reallocate conventional ventilators for patients with more sophisticated life support needs."
The Spiro Wave was born when Cohen, the founder of New Lab, a members-only innovation lab based in a formerly abandoned Brooklyn Navy Yard building, received an email in March from Manuel Toscano, an Italian friend and New Lab member.
"He asked me if  there's anything New Lab could do to help design and build ventilators quickly," Cohen told Business Insider. "My reaction was that I'm not sure we could actually do anything that would impact things in the near term."
After Toscano emailed him, Cohen had to Google exactly what a ventilator was and how to make one. His prior experience was in managing the over 80 tech businesses that rented space in New Lab, which served as a hub for new start-ups. He had no experience in medical technology, and neither did most of New Lab's member companies, like Honeybee Robotics, which made devices for NASA, and 3D-printing company Ultimaker.
After his phone call with Toscano, as bodegas and offices across the city began to close down, Cohen began to think about closing New Lab. But then he changed course. 
"I thought, well, we do have all these engineers and mechatronic experts and sensor technology experts and we should be able to do something," he said.
He poked around online for cheap ventilator substitutes and found a prototype for a bridge ventilator created in 2010 in the MIT classroom of a mechanical engineer called Alex Slocum. It had been designed as a prototype for a low-cost ventilator to bring to developing countries, and the idea had sat dormant for a decade. 
Alex Slocum quickly came on board, along with a few other big names in engineering.
They pitched it to New York government, and got an initial investment of $100,000 as a research grant at the end of April. Bill de Blasio announced in an April 21 news briefing that the city had signed a contract to pay almost 10 million dollars for 3,000 Spiro Wave ventilators.
There was a 30-hour sprint to make the first iteration of the Spiro Wave. For engineers, designers, and manufacturers, it felt like time was of the essence.
"It was like a fever pitch of talking to people," said Cohen, who worked from his SoHo living room to mobilize experts from around the world, while his wife sat next to him, taking notes on the phone calls.
The first version was driven straight up to MIT for their engineers to inspect, but it didn't make the grade. The garbage outside the offices piled up with versions of the Spiro Wave, each scrapped as the team refined their ideas.
Ten days into the project, some city officials brought in 20 critical care doctors to look at the device. "They said, 'Yes, we need this and we want it now and how soon can you get it for us?'" said Cohen.
"We were saying, we could deliver it to you if it's like an absolute critical emergency but we'd prefer not to because we still want to improve the software and add alarms and stuff," said Cohen. 
The team of 100 engineers, clinical doctors, and other medical experts Cohen had assembled, took turns sleeping under desks in shifts as they rushed to get the machine ready.
After one nearly-sleepless month, the Spiro Wave received the emergency use FDA approval that would normally take at least a year to get. 
The Spiro Wave is one of a few low-cost ventilators in the process of being pushed to market in record time.
Medtronic has released the blueprint for its ventilator, freely available for other manufacturers to use. Tesla announced it would be re-opening its New York factory to produce Medtronic ventilators, and one Minnesota hospital said the device meant hospital staff would have 450 fewer in-room visits.
The Coventor ventilator, created by a team of University of Minnesota researchers, will cost about $1,000 to produce. The researchers are working with UnitedHealth group to figure where to deploy the ventilators. 
But New York is no longer as in need of these ventilators as they were. "The curve flattened just early enough for us to not have to make those agonizing decisions," Shereef Elnahal, the CEO of University Hospital in Newark, told USA Today.
But many experts have noted that there may be a need again soon, and the US government has invested $2.9 billion in producing 187,000 ventilators. "There is likely to be a second and third wave of coronavirus, and those waves could occur simultaneously with influenza," said Mitchell Katz, CEO of NYC Health and Hospitals, in a press conference. "We may well be using these Spiro Wave devices in our emergency rooms in the future."
Currently, Cohen is in talks with the health ministries of Malaysia, Ethiopia, Colombia,  and South Africa.
The other day, Cohen heard from Toscano, his Italian friend whose email inspired the project. "He's really, really proud of the fact that we all rallied," he said. "He got me thinking about it ... it seems impossible. And then here we are."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Celtic star Virgil van Dijk didn't take long to show Scottish football that he was the real deal upon his arrival from Groningen back in 2013.
The Hoops have been lauded for their ability to tempt the Dutchman to Scotland as he jumpstarted a career that would lead to Liverpool and recognition as the world's best defender.
But if signing players was that easy then there would be no needs to pore over hours of footage and compile in-depth scouting reports.
And the truth is, the world of identifying talent is becoming smaller with clubs having access to reams of information about emerging stars at the click of a button.
But you wouldn't blame Celtic for becoming weary after reports in Italy emerged on Sunday that the Premiership champions could face a battle with Napoli to land Michal Karbownik from Legia Warsaw.
Mailsportexclusively revealed that the 19-year-old has been watched on two occasions by the Hoops before lockdown as keeps tabs on his development.
And Napoli's interest in full-backs who have a connection with the Hoops is longstanding.
The Serie A giants were keen on Timothy Castagne during the January transfer window as Brendan Rodgers made a push for the £8m-rated Atalanta star weeks before his departure to Leicester.
Napoli were keen on Kieran Tierney before the Scotland international plumped for a move to Arsenal after the Gunners finally landed their man in a £25m deal last summer.
Rino Gattuso's men have also been linked with Rangers left-back Borna Barisic before the connection with Karbownik.
And it appears Celtic and Napoli aren't the only clubs who remain keen as it's understood Dynamo Moscow and Real Betis are also keeping tabs on the Poland U19 star.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Easy Questions That Stump Computers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What happens when you stack kindling and logs in a fireplace and then drop some matches is that you typically start a …
Surely a system smart enough to contribute to The New Yorker would have no trouble completing the sentence with the obvious word, fire. GPT-2 responded with ick. In another attempt, it suggested that dropping matches on logs in a fireplace would start an “irc channel full of people.”
Marcus wasn’t surprised. Commonsense reasoning—the ability to make mundane inferences using basic knowledge about the world, like the fact that “matches” plus “logs” usually equals “fire”—has resisted AI researchers’ efforts for decades. Marcus posted the exchanges to his Twitter account with his own added commentary: “LMAO,” internet slang for a derisive chortle. Neural networks might be impressive linguistic mimics, but they clearly lack basic common sense.
Minutes later, Yejin Choi saw Marcus’s snarky tweet. The timing was awkward. Within the hour, Choi was scheduled to give a talk at a prominent AI conference on her latest research project: a system, nicknamed COMET, that was designed to use an earlier version of GPT-2 to perform commonsense reasoning.
Quickly, Choi—a senior research manager at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, who describes herself as an “adventurer at heart”—fed COMET the same prompt Marcus had used (with its wording slightly modified to match COMET’s input format):
Gary stacks kindling and logs and drops some matches.
COMET generated 10 inferences about why Gary might be dropping the matches. Not all of the responses made sense, but the first two did: He “wanted to start a fire” or “to make a fire.” Choi tweeted the results in reply to Marcus and strode up to the podium to include them in her presentation. “It seemed only appropriate,” she said.
Common sense has been called the “dark matter of AI”—both essential and frustratingly elusive. That’s because common sense consists of implicit information—the broad (and broadly shared) set of unwritten assumptions and rules of thumb that humans automatically use to make sense of the world. For example, consider the following scenario:
A man went to a restaurant. He ordered a steak. He left a big tip.
If you were asked what he ate, the answer—steak—comes effortlessly. But nowhere in that little scene is it ever stated that the man actually ate anything. When Ray Mooney, the director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed this out after giving me the same pop quiz, I didn’t believe him at first. “People don’t even realize that they’re doing this,” he said. Common sense lets us read between the lines; we don’t need to be explicitly told that food is typically eaten in restaurants after people order and before they leave a tip.
Computers do. It’s no wonder that commonsense reasoning emerged as a primary concern of AI research in 1958 (in a paper titled “Programs With Common Sense”), not long after the field of AI was born. “In general, you can’t do natural-language understanding or vision or planning without it,” said Ernest Davis, a computer scientist at New York University who has studied common sense in AI since the 1980s.
Still, progress has been infamously slow. At first, researchers tried to translate common sense into the language of computers: logic. They surmised that if all the unwritten rules of human common sense could be written down, computers should be able to use them to reason with in the same way that they do arithmetic. This symbolic approach, which came to be known as “good old-fashioned artificial intelligence” (or GOFAI), enabled some early successes, but its handcrafted approach didn’t scale. “The amount of knowledge which can be conveniently represented in the formalisms of logic is kind of limited in principle,” said Michael Witbrock, an AI researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “It turned out to be a truly overwhelming task.”
Deep learning with neural networks seemed to offer an alternative. These AI systems, designed to mimic the interconnected layers of neurons in biological brains, learn patterns without requiring programmers to specify them in advance. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated neural networks, trained with copious amounts of data, have revolutionized computer vision and natural-language processing. But for all their flexibility and apparent intellectual power—neural networks can now steer cars in highway traffic and beat world-class players at chess and Go—these systems remain notorious for their own silly (and occasionally fatal) lapses in ordinary common sense. “Acquiring it, representing it, reasoning with it—it’s all hard,” Davis said.
Now Choi and her collaborators have united these approaches. COMET (short for “commonsense transformers”) extends GOFAI-style symbolic reasoning with the latest advances in neural language modeling—a kind of deep learning that aims to imbue computers with a statistical “understanding” of written language. COMET works by reimagining commonsense reasoning as a process of generating plausible (if imperfect) responses to novel input, rather than making airtight deductions by consulting a vast encyclopedia-like database.
“It tries to blend two very fundamentally different approaches to AI,” said Mooney, who is already using COMET in his own research. “It’s an interesting new direction that says, ‘Hey, there’s a middle road there.’” Leora Morgenstern, an expert in commonsense reasoning and AI at the Palo Alto Research Center who has spent decades researching symbolic approaches to the problem, thinks that the ideas behind COMET can help move the field forward. “One of the reasons I’m so excited about what Yejin is doing is I think it will inject new life into the commonsense-reasoning community,” she said. “Deep learning is really, really powerful—let’s figure out how to harness it for common sense.”
Common sense is easier to detect than to define. According to Witbrock, the phrase common sense can mean both a kind of knowledge and an attitude toward that knowledge. “I would say [it’s] broadly reusable background knowledge that’s not specific to a particular subject area,” he said. “It’s knowledge that you ought to have.” Like, for example, the fact that people eat food in restaurants, rather than just ordering and paying for it, or that dropping matches on a pile of stacked logs implies that one is trying to light a fire.
The implicit nature of most commonsense knowledge makes it difficult and tedious to represent explicitly. “What you learn when you’re 2 or 4 years old, you don’t really ever put down in a book,” said Morgenstern. Nevertheless, early AI researchers believed that bridging this gap was possible. “It was like, ‘Let’s write down all the facts about the world. Surely there’s only a couple million of them,’” said Ellie Pavlick, a computer scientist at Brown University. Constructing such a resource, known as a knowledge base, has traditionally been the first step in any approach to automating commonsense reasoning.
Building up a sufficient number of obvious facts is harder than it sounds. A commonsense-reasoning project called Cyc began in 1984 with the modest-sounding goal of encoding the implicit commonsense knowledge necessary to represent 400 encyclopedia articles. It never stopped. More than three decades later, Cyc’s knowledge base—encoded in a dense, custom-designed logical notation—contains “millions of collections and concepts, and more than 25 million assertions.” Yet a 2015 review article by Davis and Marcus stated that “Cyc has had comparatively little impact on AI research.” Subsequent attempts to write entries for a knowledge base—or to create one by mining documents using machine learning—have failed to crack the commonsense-reasoning problem.
Why? For one thing, “there’s always exceptions to every case,” Pavlick explained. “If I hear some statement like ‘It’s raining,’ I could infer that if I go outside, I’ll get wet, but not if [I’m] underneath something.” Other exceptions are harder to anticipate. A knowledge base like Cyc may contain dozens of statements about what typically happens when a person orders food in a restaurant. But what about the potentially endless list of infrequent or unusual things that could happen in that scenario, like leaving without paying the check, or starting a food fight? “Coverage is never-ending,” said Choi. “Therefore, purely symbolic knowledge-based approaches are entirely doomed.”
Even if it were possible to build a knowledge base 100 or 1,000 times as comprehensive as any previous attempt, the system would still suffer from another intellectual shortcoming: the so-called brittleness problem. That’s because common sense, like natural language, remains fundamentally fuzzy. When a server asks a diner, “Are you still working on that?” we understand them to mean “Are you still eating what’s on your plate?” But if the server asks the same question to a line cook preparing an overdue order, it means something else entirely. So is a restaurant a place where people “work” on things? Are “eating” and “working” distinct concepts?
It all depends. That’s the brittleness problem: Sharply defined relations within a knowledge base may enable powerful, reliable reasoning abilities, as long as those conceptual edges are respected. But these symbolic systems, no matter how varied and rich, inevitably fail to capture the natural ambiguities and associative overlaps that often occur in human commonsense reasoning. “To the extent that we [use] symbols,” Pavlick said, “we’re quite fluid with them.”
Choi didn’t start working on common sense because she wanted to tilt at windmills. When she joined the Allen Institute in 2018, she “had a hunch” that neural networks could enable new progress where knowledge bases had stalled on their own. She just didn’t know exactly how. She didn’t want to write off previous symbolic approaches completely either. “All the past research was based on a lack of data,” she said, or a lack of computing resources. “So I figured I’d just withhold my judgment until I properly tried different routes.”
With an open mind, Choi and her colleagues began to assemble their own knowledge base, called Atomic (short for “atlas of machine commonsense”). “Basically, I wanted to write a textbook for neural networks to learn faster about the world,” Choi said. “Then things happened simultaneously—as we had this knowledge [base] built, GPT-2 came out.”
That neural network, released in February 2019, was just one in a wave of “pretrained language models” that began to revolutionize how computers process natural language. These systems don’t contain neatly organized linguistic symbols or rules. Instead, they statistically smear their representations of language across millions or billions of parameters within a neural network. This property makes such systems difficult to interpret, but it also makes them robust: They can generate predictions based on noisy or ambiguous input without breaking. When fine-tuned to perform a specific task—like answering written questions or paraphrasing text—language models even appear to understand at least some of what they’re reading.
Choi now saw a way to put her hunch about neural networks and common sense into action.
What would happen if a language model were given additional training using a commonsense-knowledge base, like Atomic? Could the neural network learn to fill in Atomic’s gaps with plausible commonsense inferences all on its own, just as GPT-2 learned how to automatically generate plausible news articles? “It’s almost weird that nobody tried this before,” Choi said. “It’s almost as if nobody bothered, because they were so sure this would never work.”
When Choi (and her collaborators Antoine Bosselut, Hannah Rashkin, Maarten Sap, Chaitanya Malaviya, and Asli Celikyilmaz) fine-tuned a neural language model with the commonsense knowledge encoded in Atomic, they created COMET. Its fusion of symbolic reasoning with a neural network tries to solve the coverage and brittleness problems at the same time. Anyone can type a prompt into COMET in everyday language. If the event is already represented in the system’s commonsense-knowledge base (like the fact that ordering food in a restaurant usually involves eating it), COMET can simply reason with that preexisting information. For everything else, the neural language model makes its best guess.
Those guesses are surprisingly good. On average, 77.5 percent of the novel responses generated by COMET—that is, inferences that come from the neural network, rather than from the preexisting knowledge base—were deemed “plausible” by teams of human evaluators. That’s less than 10 percentage points shy of human-level performance. (Evaluators found 86 percent of knowledge-base entries written by humans to be plausible.) When COMET was given the prompt “PersonX gives PersonY some pills,” it guessed that PersonX wanted to help; when it was told that “PersonX murders PersonY’s wife,” COMET suggested that PersonX wanted to hide the body.
These examples showed how COMET could handle input beyond the limits of its built-in commonsense “coverage.” But what about the brittleness problem? While interviewing Choi late last year at her lab in Seattle, I gave COMET a prompt phrased in my 5-year-old daughter’s patois: “Daddy goed to work.”
Choi frowned. “That may be tricky,” she said. But COMET took it in stride, suggesting that “Daddy” wanted to “make money,” “do their job,” and “get a paycheck”; that he is seen as “hardworking,” “motivated,” and “dutiful”; and that as a result, others feel “proud,” “grateful,” and—in an amusingly plausible response, given that the request was written in kindergartner-speak—“annoyed.” (My daughter has certainly expressed that sentiment when I leave for work instead of playing with her.) “This wouldn’t work with Cyc, for sure,” Choi remarked. “Unless someone hand-codes that goed means ‘went’—which we never did.”
There’s a quip Gary Marcus likes to use to put progress in AI into context: “Just because you can build a better ladder doesn’t mean you can build a ladder to the moon.” To him and others, COMET’s approach suffers from a fundamental limitation of deep learning: “statistics ≠ understanding.” “You can see that [COMET] does a decent job of guessing some of the parameters of what a sentence might entail, but it doesn’t do so in a consistent way,” Marcus wrote via email. Just as no ladder, no matter how tall, can ever hope to reach the moon, no neural network—no matter how deft at mimicking language patterns—ever really “knows” that dropping lit matches on logs will typically start a fire.
Choi, surprisingly, agrees. She acknowledged that COMET “relies on surface patterns” in its training data, rather than actual understanding of concepts, to generate its responses. “But the fact that it’s really good at surface patterns is a good thing,” she said. “It’s just that we’ve got to supply it with more informative surface patterns.”
What might those more informative patterns look like? Some researchers argue that in order to build real common sense into computers, we will need to make use of phenomena outside language itself, like visual perceptions or embodied sensations. These more direct first-person representations may be the foundation of common sense, with language acting as a secondary layer.
“If I lived in a world where there were no other people [to talk to], I could still have common sense—I’d still understand how the world works and have expectations over what I should see and shouldn’t see,” said Pavlick, who is currently studying how to teach AI systems common sense by interacting with them in virtual reality. To her, COMET represents “really exciting progress, but what’s missing is the actual reference aspect. The word apple is not an apple. That meaning has to exist in some form that’s not the language itself.”
Nazneen Rajani, a senior research scientist at Salesforce, is pursuing a similar goal, but she believes the full potential of neural language models is far from tapped. She’s investigating whether they can learn to reason about commonsense scenarios involving basic physics, like the fact that tipping over a jar with a ball inside will typically cause the ball to drop out. “The real world is really complicated,” Rajani said. “But natural language is like a low-dimensional proxy for how the real world works.” Sure, neural networks can be taught to predict the next word from a text prompt, but that shouldn’t be their limit. “They can learn more complex stuff.”
Choi and her colleagues are also working on ways to augment COMET with labeled visual scenes instead of just text. “We took all these images from movies or TV shows where some interesting things are happening,” Choi said. “The annotations look great; the model predictions look exciting.”
I asked Choi if COMET’s approach—combining incrementally better neural networks with improved commonsense-knowledge bases—was still, essentially, building a ladder to the moon. She conceded that her dream would be to have a neural network that could learn from knowledge bases without human supervision, the same way language models like GPT-2 already learn by ingesting reams of raw text.
But just as Winston Churchill quipped that “democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried,” Choi considers COMET’s flawed but promising approach to be “a fair deal.” Even if these neural networks can’t reach the stars, she thinks they’re the only way to get off the ground. “Without that, we are not going anywhere,” she said. “With [knowledge bases] alone, we cannot do anything. It’s COMET that can actually fly in the air.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two Major WWE Stars Are ‘Getting Offers’ From Hollywood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WWE is no strangers to losing its biggest stars to Hollywood, and the company may be experiencing a case of deja vu.
Over the course of the past two decades, a handful of WWE’s most high-profile names have all but left pro wrestling behind for the world of TV and movies. Most notably, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson bolted WWE in the prime of his career nearly two decades ago and eventually became Hollywood’s highest-paid actor, according to FORBES. Other marquee wrestlers, like Batista and “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, also traded in their wrestling boots for the silver screen.
Now, arguably WWE’s two top full-time stars could follow suit.
According to Paul Davis of WrestlingNews.co, Becky Lynch is generating a ton of interest in Hollywood. Davis wrote, “Becky Lynch...is getting television and movie offers. I was told of at least two directors that would be interested in casting her in big movie projects. Dave Meltzer noted in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter that a major national women’s magazine is preparing for a major feature on Lynch and others in the entertainment world are interested in her because of how she connects with the crowd. I was told that her Twitter presence has helped her a lot.”

Lynch—who reportedly will appear in an upcoming Marvel movie—has made plenty of history in WWE over the past couple of years, becoming the first female star to grave the cover of the WWE 2K video game franchise and the first woman to main event a WrestleMania, among a slew of other accomplishments. She also recently cemented herself as one of WWE’s highest-paid stars, and her success as one of the most heavily featured stars in all of pro wrestling has paved the way for other female stars—ranging from Sasha Banks to Lana—to receive “significant pay raises” as WWE has recently highlighted more female stars than it had at any point in history.
It’s no surprise that Lynch—one of the best talkers and actors, whether male or female, in all of WWE—has become a hot commodity in the acting world. Although Lynch has her fair share of detractors among the WWE Universe, she is undoubtedly the most popular female star in WWE and is arguably the most popular star regardless of gender. She is a natural fit to eventually transition full-time to acting, but at just 33 years old and in the prime of her career, it seems unlikely that Lynch will give up her spot atop WWE’s women’s division—where she has been for roughly the past two years—for a less certain spot in Hollywood, though a gradual transition to acting makes sense.
In addition to “The Man,” Roman Reigns has also become a highly coveted star among TV and movie executives. Davis notes, “Another person who is getting offers is Roman Reigns. He will be in David Spade’s move titled The Wrong Missy on Netflix...and Reigns has interest from Hollywood producers for other projects. The feeling is that doors were opened for him when he did the Hobbs and Shaw movie. The feeling on Reigns is that he has the look of a star who will come off well on TV shows.”
Reigns has, of course, been WWE’s go-to guy for the past half a decade, essentially assuming the role as the “face of the company” from Cena, even though he hasn’t become quite the household name that Cena is. Although Reigns, like Lynch, has a lot of critics among WWE’s passionate fan base and isn’t the actor or talker that Cena is, he has been a fantastic representative for WWE over the past five years, holds himself incredibly well during interviews and media appearances, has the obvious familial connection to The Rock and—much like Lynch—seems to have more mainstream star power potential than just about anyone in WWE.
If you look at Batista, he certainly wasn’t known for his acting chops while in WWE, and yet, he’s gone on to have a wildly successful acting career, most notably making it big with his role as “Drax the Destroyer” in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. Reigns could very well follow a similar path. During a 2019 interview with The Sportster (h/t SEScoops), Reigns said that he would “go on a fuller schedule as far as films” when his body can no longer handle the grind of WWE. When that will be, no one knows, but Reigns figures to have his pick of options if and when he chooses to go that route.
So, what’s that mean for WWE? Well, the company has already prepared for the potential departures of stars like Lynch and Reigns by never relying too heavily on one particular star, though the losses of “The Man” and “The Big Dog” would undoubtedly hurt more than most.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Create your new normal - The Happiness Connection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A few years ago, I gave a presentation about emotions. I used the word normal to describe what was typical for most people. When the session was over, I was stunned to discover I had triggered a member of the audience into a near meltdown.
That was the first time I stopped to consider what an emotion-packed word, normal can be. 
When I was first diagnosed with clinical depression, my husband and in-laws cautioned me not to tell anybody. They were afraid I would be labelled as crazy or abnormal. 
This is what happened to the lady in my audience. She had struggled with mental illness and only had to hear the word normal to be transported back into a time when she believed she wasn’t.
Although I wasn’t talking about people not being normal, she was unable to hear anything I was saying because of her emotions.
It is only in recent times that we are considering the possibility that being different might be a strength and a blessing. 
In evolutionary times, it benefited people to fit in and be like everyone else. You needed to be part of a group if you were going to survive.
I don’t want anyone else to have the same experience as the woman in my audience, so let me assure you, I don’t want to spend my time discussing whether any of us are normal. Instead I want to refer to normal as a noun.
What is your normal?
Dictionary.com defines normal as the usual, average, or typical state or condition. 
What do you do every day? Do you have daily or weekly routines? What is important to you? How do you spend your free time? What makes you feel energized?
This is a conversation that is becoming more relevant with every passing day. The pandemic has ensured that what was normal in your life at the beginning of the year, is unlikely to be your normal, today.
Every time you or your life changes, you will consciously or unconsciously adjust your usual routines. If you start a new job, move to a new city, or change your marital status, modifications need to be made. 
Some people resist change and cling as much as possible to their old way of doing things. That isn’t always best, but it’s comfortable.
Many people who have extended stays in institutions like hospitals, are afraid to go home. They have been there long enough for its routines to be their new normal. 
Although the sudden unchartered territory of the pandemic felt scary when it started, I’m willing to bet you are finding you’ve got used to physical distancing. 
An elderly friend decided to go to Rona to get something for her garden. It was the first time she has left her home in weeks. She told me how shaky and unsettled she felt doing something that was perfectly normal only a couple of months ago.
Until a vaccine for COVID-19 is found, many of your old ways of life will be put on hold. 
Even when restaurants are open, they will probably have vastly reduced seating, or plexiglass between tables or booths. Lines of people waiting to enter a store is likely to remain commonplace for the months ahead. 
I suspect even when we can gather in large groups again, some parts of the old normal will have disappeared forever.
Small changes require small shifts. Big transformations need you to pivot in bigger ways. The pandemic has caused major alterations. The opportunity it is providing is just as immense.
You have the chance to consciously influence what your new normal will look like.
What are you enjoying about your current lifestyle? What are the biggest challenges? What can’t you wait to do again?
Gather as much information as possible and then decide what you want to keep and what feels good to release when a vaccine is found.
If you love having more time as a family, consider not enrolling your kids in so many extracurricular activities. If you are enjoying a slower pace of life, practice being more discerning about what you choose to do with your time.
Your world will always be influenced by things beyond your control. This conversation is about crafting the life you want for yourself within those unmovable boundaries. 
What do you want your new normal to look like? If you can imagine it, you can create it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From Breakdown To Breakthrough</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I’m sat in my car outside the Doctor’s surgery. I’ve just been signed off work for 2 weeks, due to “stress and low mood”. The score on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder form indicates I have it. And my blood pressure is too high. I can’t stop crying. I sit there for 2 hours trying to comprehend what’s happening to me. I want to go home but I can’t remember how to drive the car.
That was the start of a very surreal, distressing, confusing and extremely isolating nine months. My mind felt like it had broken, and without it my body couldn’t function either.
In the weeks that followed I had a shocking realisation.
The first few weeks passed in a blur. The symptoms got worse. I was so exhausted walking across the room was like wading through concrete. My memory was so poor I’d forget what I was doing and burst into tears. A trip to the supermarket caused a panic attack simply because I forgot what I’d gone in for. Lack of focus meant it became unsafe for me to drive. Extreme paranoia and anxiety pervaded my waking hours, and at night I was tortured with my own spiralling negative thoughts. If I did eventually go to sleep, I’d often have nightmares resembling a disaster movie that felt so real I felt like I’d been under physical attack.
Regular trips to the Doctor saw me signed-off work for longer each time. Anti-depressants were offered and refused (a personal choice). Friends and family tried their best to help. If they contacted me to offer support, it was too much pressure. If they didn’t, it meant no-one cared. I felt alone, mis understood and helpless.
I had what I though was a successful career in a Financial Services organisation. I was a project manager, working 60 to 70 hours a week (that’s normal right?) I was good at my job and used to working to deadlines under pressure. Expectations were high (mine and theirs). There was no time for eating properly, exercising, having a hobby, relaxing or generally doing anything except work. My Nan who I was extremely close to had just passed away after a battle with cancer. I didn’t even have time to grieve, I just dealt with the practical side of organising medical care, paperwork… anything except dealing with my emotions. I don’t even remember the funeral.
The “obvious” signs that I wasn’t well such as anxiety, exhaustion, hyperactivity, sweats, heart palpitations and even hair loss went ignored. There were a few occasions where I almost passed out in the office. Worried friends staged an “intervention” to get me to slow down. I just didn’t see the problem. I’d been working under sustained stress for years and the feelings I had were so familiar they seemed normal. I did go to the Doctor after a routine check revealed high blood pressure, which was unusual for me. They gently suggested I take a couple of weeks off work as it was clearly stress. But no, I couldn’t because my project was too important and there’s no way I could take time off.
Then the day came where my mind and body decided enough was enough. I was in the office, staring at the hundreds of emails pinging into my inbox, the phone kept beeping and ringing. When I didn’t answer they would come to find me. Suddenly time slowed down. Everything went out of focus and blurred. Sounds became muffled and distant. It was as if I was under water. And then I heard a voice in my head say, “I can’t do this anymore”.
So here I was. Just trying to get up every day and praying it would stop.
​The turning point came when I finally accepted that I was ill, and that I wouldn’t be able to go back to work, or even my life until I got well.
Deep inside the drive and determination that had pushed me to achieve at work kicked in and I started to take little steps to get myself better. I went into therapy (CBT). I educated myself about burn out, anxiety and stress. I studied neuroscience, mindfulness and habits. I created a simple routine of exercise, healthy food and mindfulness. I journaled, practiced gratitude and meditated. Not very well I might add but it was working.
It wasn’t easy to re-build a life that had previously revolved solely around my career, however after trying out self-care routines, new hobbies and taking control of my thoughts I slowly rebuilt my life.
Fast forward a year I was back into work after a phased return with a whole new appreciation of what had gone wrong for me, and what I needed to do to stay mentally and physically well.
Although I wouldn’t choose to go through that experience again, I wouldn’t change it. Because without it, I would still be living my life on auto pilot.
Yes, even you. And if you’re “lucky” enough to notice some of the symptoms then do something about it now. Talk to someone, get some therapy, take some time out, adopt a self-care routine. Whatever you need. There’s so much information and support out there to help you. Start by using the resources on Thrive Global.
Listen to your friends and family – if they’re worried enough to share their concerns with you then there’s probably something wrong even if you can’t or won’t see it. It’s harder to climb out when you hit rock bottom.
Life is a roller coaster of highs and lows. We can’t control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond to it. As the world faces into a global pandemic, we are all being tested in different ways. With normal habits and routines suspended, our mental coping strategies are laid bare and we are having to think and act more consciously. An ideal opportunity to go inward and become more self-aware. Everything we do is a pattern, a learned behaviour, and can be changed.
I referred earlier to not “having” time to do anything other than work. The truth is, I didn’t make the time. I didn’t make myself a priority. 
Check in on your own beliefs and habits – are they serving you well or do you need to make some changes? Are you feeling burned out? Unfulfilled? Unhappy? This is your chance to hit the re-set button.
I needed to believe this more than anything when I was ill. I searched endlessly for reassurance that I would get better and I wanted a timescale for when that would happen.  Even when I did recover enough to go back to work, I spent months worrying that it might happen again. I just wanted to be “normal”.
So as someone who has gone from breaking down to breaking through – I’m here to tell you this:
There is hope. You can get better. You can feel “normal” again.
You might need to get therapy, you will definitely need to become self-aware, and you will need to do the work – but you can overcome anxiety and stress and you can develop more resilience, so that when life throws you the next challenge, you’ll be ready.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Man Utd ace Patrice Evra recalls begging for food while living on the streets</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patrice Evra has revealed how he was forced to beg for money during a childhood spent on the tough streets of Paris.
The former Manchester United full-back came from such a poor family background that he was often reduced to asking strangers for cash just to buy food.
But Evra, now 39, insists the experience helped make him the man he became – a French international capped 81 times by his country and a Champions League winner.
He said: “I’ll be honest with you, it was a tough childhood.
“I’ve got many brothers and sisters - so it wasn’t easy living in the streets.
“Sometimes I wasn’t even able to have some food.
“I remember my brother Dominique was working at a McDonalds and so I was going there and on his lunch break he was giving me his own food.
“I’m not scared to say that I’ve begged for money.
“I’ve been in front of shops and when I’ve seen some people I’ve said, 'Can I have one pound?'
“And sometimes they gave me the money and sometimes not, just because I wanted to buy a sandwich.”
Evra added: “It was a tough time, but a happy time. I was always happy and always felt lucky, I wouldn’t change anything.
“I would keep it that way because it built the man I am.
“Some people, when you succeed, they just see you on TV as the superstar.
“But actually on the streets I learned so much and it helped me to be strong.
“I’m not a victim. I’m not feeling sad. I don’t want any people to give me much love because I’m telling these things.
“I’m just telling my true story. I just want to motivate more kids to never give up no matter what will happen.
“If you believe you’re going to become someone, if you don't walk out, if you believe in yourself, you're going to do it. That is it.”
Football became Evra's saving grace.
His career started at Nice and he then became a French League Cup winner with Monaco before Sir Alex Ferguson paid £5.5million to bring him to Old Trafford in January 2006.
It proved to be an inspired piece of business, with Evra winning five Premier league titles and the Champions League in eight-and-a-half seasons with the club.

He then went on to play for Juventus, Marseille and West Ham, winning two serie A titles in Italy.
Despite his tough upbringing, however, Evra admits that nothing could prepare him for his debut in the maelstrom of a Manchester derby.
Evra was substituted at half-time as United lost 3-1 to City at the Etihad.
He recalled: “I thought 'what the hell am I doing here? I was in Monte Carlo chilling, but here the football is so fast. Oh my God you're so done, Patrice. You should go back to Monte Carlo’.
“I went back to my flat with my agent and his wife and my agent looked at me and said, ‘Patrice, I’m sorry. You'll never make it, it's too hard. You should stay in Monte Carlo’.
“That day I was so bad, so embarrassing. My agent was actually telling me I should have never gone to Manchester United!
“So yes, I had this tough moment - but it helped me to become who I am.”
Evra, speaking on the Official Manchester United Podcast, added; “People ask me 'what's your best moment?’
“I will always say the derby, the first game, because everything was new.
“I received a big slap on my face. I thought I was a big player, but Ferguson gave me the hairdryer.
“It just made me realise that I would have to work really hard here if I want to be a United player.
“So that's the moment that I want to relive, because it was a hard moment, but such a positive moment.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">New apps emerge amid COVID-19 to tackle gripes with popular delivery services</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO -- When the weekend rolls around, Torontonians won't have to miss the White Lily Diner's thick-cut bacon, organic corn grits and toast smeared in rhubarb hibiscus jam just because the country has plunged into a pandemic.
The east-end diner is selling its brunch staples and offering to drop them at customers' doors, but the process won't involve any of the familiar delivery apps whose couriers have become a fixture on busy streets in recent years.
Instead of relying on Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes or DoorDash, White Lily is using a new entrant to the market: Tock To Go.
"The biggest draw off the bat was probably just the fact that they're so much less expensive," said White Lily co-owner Ashley Lloyd, who laid off her entire staff when she closed the restaurant to dine-in meals amid COVID-19.
"Restaurant margins are slim...I can understand people turning to (their delivery competitors), but honestly I don't know how they do it."
Tock To Go is part of a new wave of food delivery companies hitting the Canadian market, hoping to attract vendors with features like lower commissions and fill the hole Foodora will leave behind when it shutters its Canadian operations in mid-May.
The services -- Ottawa's Love Local Delivery, Vancouver's From To, Toronto's volunteer-run iRover and new delivery features on Montreal's Eva -- have been created to help out in a tough moment, when restaurants are barely scraping by -- even as demand for food delivery surges.
These services want to do things differently from the household names, so they have eliminated commission fees or offered rates well below the 10- to 30-per cent charged by Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes, DoorDash and others.
Tock To Go, a Chicago-based service from restaurateur Nick Kokonas that evolved from his Tock reservation system, only takes a 3 per cent commission from restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto.
Tock first appeared in the cities in 2018, but didn't launch Tock to Go until the pandemic started. Tock to Go doesn't have couriers to deliver meals. Instead, it asks customers to pre-order food, helping restaurants arrange their own delivery.
"Ordering apps take up to 20 to 30 (per cent), which simply is not sustainable for restaurants," Tock's director of marketing Kyle Welter said in an email.
"Tock allows each restaurant to specify the number of orders for any set time range, so the kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed and they can responsibly manage the flow of customers."
Over in B.C., Brandon Grossutti from Gastown restaurant Pidgin will launch From To, a delivery service with a handful of Vancouver eateries, in May.
In the weeks before restaurants in Canada closed to stop the spread of COVID-19, Grossutti realized Pidgin would need a takeout option, so he signed up with Uber Eats and Burnaby-based Fantuan Delivery.
"Then the reality of it hit. We did fairly well gross wise, but you see the checks coming in and...the first week was a lot of money out the door in commissions," said Grossutti, who had to lay off workers
"It's a weirdly parasitic relationship where you have a parasite basically eating its hosts until it dies and it's not a sustainable relationship."
Grossutti decided to put his software industry background to work. He made From To, which gives restaurants the ability to decide if they want to pay for, split with or pass on customers' delivery costs.
From To currently takes no commission.
"We had talked at certain points about taking like 5 per cent, which would be much less than what's out there, but we realized that during this time we need to make this sustainable because people are already losing money," Grossutti said.
The lower commissions don't seem to have bothered rivals.
"We welcome new competitors to the market, as it raises awareness of the industry and promotes even more traffic to restaurants to stimulate growth," Winnipeg-bred SkipTheDishes said in an email to The Canadian Press.
"It is natural for competitors to see value in this market and we're confident in Skip's position as Canada's homegrown food delivery company."
SkipTheDishes is offering a 10.5 per cent commission deal to restaurants wanting to do their own deliveries but still use the platform and is expediting payments to all businesses using its services.
Meanwhile, San Francisco-based Uber Eats is eliminating its fees on pickup orders and reducing its usual 30 per cent charges to 15 per cent for restaurants who choose to use their own delivery people.
DoorDash, also headquartered in San Francisco, is waiving April commission fees for new, independent clients. Existing independent clients can have those fees waived on pickup orders, and 100,000 clients were added to DashPass -- its subscription program which offers $0 delivery for consumers -- for free.
Harriet Clunie, the executive chef at European-style bistro Das Lokal, said that is not enough because the moves put the onus on restaurateurs to offset costs or hire their own delivery staff to take advantage of benefits.
She banded together with other members of the Ottawa restaurant community to found Love Local Delivery, a service that launched in March and will courier food within 5 kilometres of restaurants for a flat $5 fee, or more for longer distances.
There are no commission fees right now and the service focuses solely on independently-owned restaurants.
While it might have to charge commission when it launches an app in the near future, Clunie said the service is committed to keeping that potential fee low.
"It's all people that are in the same boat and we're trying to help everybody that's struggling, restaurants or small businesses or drivers that are unemployed and just trying to make some money to feed the family," she said.
"It's an approach that's really trying to lift everybody up."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xavi Calm admits he leaves Birmingham City with a heavy heart after calling time on his short stay with the club.
The Spaniard is moving on after eight months working with the first team at St Andrew’s, having effectively been forced to choose between his football career and caring for his family.
Speaking to BirminghamLive the 38-year-old has revealed how he has reached the difficult conclusion to return to Catalonia and has thanked the club’s supporters for the backing they have shown him and the team.
“Sometimes people have to decide between two different options and with the situation we are living in and the situation of my family, it is not easy, but I think they need me more than football at the moment,” Calm explained.
Full story here.
Manchester United believe Sir Alex Ferguson has proved pivotal in the race for Birmingham City star Jude Bellingham, according to reports.
The Blues wonderkid is one of the most highly-sought after youngsters in world football, after breaking into Pep Clotet’s team this season.
United have been extensively linked with Bellingham, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer keen to build a side capable of competing for the Premier League title.
There are however other potential suitors, with a number of the biggest clubs in European football credited with an interest.
Full story here.
Youssouf Mulumbu hopes his status as a free agent will help him find a club once football resumes.
The former West Brom and Celtic midfielder was on trial at Birmingham City before the sport went into lockdown.
He is not now working under Blues’ staff and admits he is looking for his next opportunity.
The 33-year-old, who even played for the Under 23s, admits that coronavirus robbed him of his chance at St Andrew’s.
Full story here.
Former Aston Villa favourite Gareth Barry has named the Second City Derby as the most fierce he has encountered.
Barry, who holds the record for Premier League appearances, played for Villa from 1997 to 2009.
And from his very first Second City derby with Birmingham City, he recognised he was part of something a little different.
In fact, even now, as a player who has experienced more in the Premier League than anyone else, he still hasn't found a derby quite like it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi, May 02: The Centre has made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to use Aarogya Setu mobile application to bolster the efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and entrusted the organisational heads with ensuring its 100 per cent coverage.
The Union Home Ministry also said the mobile app will be must for people living in COVID-19 containment zones.
"Use of Arogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public. It shall be the responsibility of the head of the respective organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees," the ministry said.
The announcement came on a day the government extended the nationwide lockdown by two weeks from May 4 with certain relaxations.
The mobile application helps users identify whether they are at risk of COVID-19 infection. It also provides people with important information, including ways to avoid coronavirus infection and its symptoms.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Haven’t downloaded Aarogya Setu app yet? Now, govt asks your company to ensure that you do</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The use of Aarogya Setu app has been made mandatory by the government for the employees of all public and private sector companies and the organisations have been directed to ensure that their employees download the coronavirus tracking mobile application. “It shall be the responsibility of the head of the respective organisations to ensure 100 per cent coverage of this app among the employees,” the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a notification which also had the fresh guidelines for extension of the lockdown till May 17. Especially in the containment zones, 
In containment zones, the government has mandated “100 per cent Aarogya Setu app”, however, it isn’t clear whether the order will also be applicable to residents in such areas or be limited only to office and workspaces. India is the only country where the download of contact tracing application has been mandated such a measure. “This app is not secure, its source code is not open for examination and its security vulnerabilities are already being exploited,” technology lawyer and founder of Software Freedom Law Centre, Mishi Choudhary, told The Indian Express. Earlier as well, individuals and organisations have raised concerns about surveillance and violation of data privacy as the government launched the application. Food delivery workers and some other service providers, as well as all federal government employees were already mandated to use the application. 
“Once installed in a smartphone through an easy and user-friendly process, the app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. The app can then calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts are tested positive,” the government had said in April 2 upon the launch of the app. 
With the fresh government directive, concerns regarding privacy have resurfaced. In fact, the app has “uncanny similarities between Aarogya Setu and Fleming, the new Covid-19 tracking product developed by the NSO group, the infamous spyware maker and developer of Pegasus,” Salman Waris, a partner at TechLegis and head of their TMT (Technology, Media and Telecommunication) and IP (Internet Protocol) practices, told the newspaper. There were also some media reports which said that the government now plans to make the app mandatory for travelling via public transit.

This app is not secure, its source code is not open for examination and its security vulnerabilities are already being exploited,” technology lawyer and founder of Software Freedom Law Centre, Mishi Choudhary, said.
Aaroyga Setu, the government’s contact tracing app for tracking patients with Covid-19, and alerting others if they came in the proximity of those patients, has been under the lens for being invasive and violating data privacy norms.
According to a statement released on April 2 by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, the app will track its users’ “interaction with others”, and will alert the authorities if there was any suspicion of the user having been in contact with an infected person.
“Once installed in a smartphone through an easy and user-friendly process, the app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. The app can then calculate the risk of infection based on sophisticated parameters if any of these contacts are tested positive,” the government had then said.
With the latest notification directing the mandatory installation of the app on smartphones, the privacy concerns with regards to the app have resurfaced.
“The privacy concerns are being highlighted again more so in relation to the uncanny similarities between Aarogya Setu and Fleming, the new Covid-19 tracking product developed by the NSO group, the infamous spyware maker and developer of Pegasus,” Salman Waris, a partner at TechLegis and head of their TMT (Technology, Media and Telecommunication) and IP (Internet Protocol) practices, said.
The NSO group’s app Fleming uses an advance mapping tool to track the spread of Covid-19 in real-time.
“It is clear that the Aarogya Setu app uses a similar mechanism as Fleming for tracking Covid-19. The app also tracks where people go, who they meet and for how long they stay at a particular place. Both can filter the movements of a certain patient by their last location or whether they visited any meeting places like public squares or office buildings,” Waris said.
IT ministry officials had last week also hinted at using the app as an e-pass for movement during the curfew hours. It had during the last week mandated that all employees in the government sector install the app.
“Most countries have opted for a data minimalistic and decentralised approach, whereas Aarogya Setu app goes against these accepted principles. By mandating all employers to ensure the adoption of the app by their employees, the government has made a mockery of the consent principle as the terms and the privacy policy of the app are now enforced on the people and they do not have any choice,” Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at SFLC told The Indian Express.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Universal Serial Bus technology keeps changing every passing day, and USB4 is shaping up to be the best multi-purpose cable specification ever designed. To put this into perspective, this is a common interface that enables the communication between devices and a host controller such as a personal computer (PC). While already on that path, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) announced that the full benefits of DisplayPort 2.0 are now headed to USB4.
Increase in speeds: So, what exactly makes USB4 so promising? For one, it will again double the speed of USB, from 20Gbps recently introduced in USB 3.2 Gen 2×2, to 40Gbps via a two-lane operation over certified cables.
USB-C Support only: Introducing USB4 is sort of like hitting the reset button on USB. There is just one connector (Type-C). This means it will dicth the Type-A connector that dominates the landscape and wholeheartedly embraces Type-C, which is a smaller and reversible connector as shown in the image at the top of this article. USB4 is both a speed and connection standard.

USB4 also integrates Thunderbolt 3 into the spec. This is a big deal because the way things stand, it’s not always clear if a USB-C port is also a Thunderbolt port. Intel designed Thunderbolt back in 2011 and, over time, it came to work over USB-C.
8K with HDR and 16k display Support : It’s a bit of a confusing scenario, but the general takeaway is that USB4 will have the bandwidth needed to drive an 8K resolution (7680×4320) monitor at 60Hz including HDR without compression, or a 16K resolution (15360×8460) 60Hz display with HDR (but with compression).
What makes this possible is a new DisplayPort Alt Mode 2.0 specification. This essentially brings the benefits of DisplayPort 2.0 to USB4.

Of course, it’s going to be a long while before PC gaming hardware will have the muscle to drive a 16K monitor, or even an 8K display. Nevertheless, this specification bump ensures we won’t have to worry about cables and standards once that day arrives. It also paves the way for running a 4K monitor at 144Hz with no compression, over USB4. Once our PCs and devices catch up with USB’s new capabilities, anyway.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PowerVision Robot Corporation has launched a new drone. This one sets itself apart with what its maker describes as weatherproof attachments, one of which even allows the PowerEgg X to land on water. It is also rated for 4K/60 frames per second (fps) recording in flight.
Given that outdoor pursuits may once soon be a thing again, drone-piloting may see a resurgence in popularity as a pastime. On the other hand, these consumer-level UAVs, as the company PowerVision points out, often need extremely ideal conditions to fly safely. This company claims that its own latest product is designed to solve this problem.
This is because the PowerEgg X is the first drone to be compatible with accessories that make it weatherproof. They consist of a case, as well as a landing float. This last is particularly interesting as PowerVision asserts that it enables it to land on and take off from bodies of water, like a seaplane. It can also resist winds with speeds of 29 to 38 knots.
In terms of its more conventional UAV functions, it is rated for 4K/60 fps recording and up to 30 minutes of battery life. The PowerEgg X is available from retailers such as B&H Photo Video, Best Buy, Amazon and also PowerVision's own store. It has a recommended price of US$899, or $1249 for a bundle with its weather-proof kit.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The global text of hunger</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Knut Hamsun received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920, exactly a century ago. His best-known work to this day remains the starkly titled novel Hunger, an alarmingly accurate study of the physical and mental distress caused by extreme poverty in a Norwegian town sardonically named Christiania, towards the end of the 19th century. As Hamsun saw it, hunger broke the back of rational thought; it destroyed the body in a manner that the soul could not tolerate, leading to ‘immoral’ actions such as theft, corruption and the destruction of property.
Reading Hunger teaches us that great literature, like the most potent of viruses, does not recognise national boundaries. The harrowing scenes in current Indian media of daily-wage earners, informal workers and migrant labor wanting to return at all costs to their villages, reduced as they are to living in the unbearable conditions imposed on them without warning by the stringent lockdown measures in our cities, remind us that text of hunger is — and always has been — global. It is no accident that the Director of the UN Food Programme has just warned of a “hunger pandemic” also looming in 2020 that could kill as many as 300,000 every day for the next three months, in addition to the Covid-19 toll, unless quick action is taken.
If the world today collectively seeks to effect an enormous paradigm shift from the familiar competitive model of ‘the survival of the fittest’ to the compassionate one of ‘the survival of the weakest’ — the poor, the sick and the old — the deep probes of the human sciences could prove invaluable in this endeavour, since a post-coronavirus situation, like a post-truth one, will depend on a sophisticated skills-set that can separate fake data from real and derive qualitative empathy from quantitative graphs. Arguably then, Indians have as much to learn, in terms of our shared humanity, from Hamsun’s dark and complex portrayal of hunger as Norwegians from, say, Premchand’s descriptions of utter destitution in ‘Kafan’ or Godaan.
Literary scars
Here is a single extended passage from Hamsun’s text:
The pains of hunger were unbearable and never let me alone. I swallowed spit over and over to take the edge off, and I felt it did some good. I had had very little to eat generally for several weeks, even before this current trouble, and my strength now was falling off noticeably. Whenever I had been lucky and scraped up five kroner by some maneuver or other, the money never managed to last long enough to get me back on my feet before a new famine fell on me.
How could it be that nothing ever turned up for me! Didn't I have the same right to life as anybody else, Pascha, the rarebook seller, for example, or Hennechen, the steamship clerk? And didn't I have shoulders like a giant and two strong arms for work, and hadn't I in fact tried to get a job chopping wood on Møller Street to earn my bread? Was I lazy? Hadn't I applied for jobs… and worked night and day like a madman? And hadn't I lived like a miser, eaten bread and milk when I was rich, bread when I wasn't, and gone hungry when I had nothing? Did I live in a hotel, did I have a suite of rooms on the second floor? I lived in a shack, a loft, in a tinsmith's shop deserted by both God and man since last winter because snow came in.
Substitute the word ‘snow’ and you will recognise the unsentimental accuracy of this description in 21st century India. For all the well-intentioned talk of “we are in this together” we hear so frequently in these COVID-19 times, a novel like Hunger forces us to remember that although every society in the world struggles with the demeaning facts of inequality, it is invariably those citizens whose rights, even in the best of times, come last, who are the first to suffer when disaster hits. They may have done nothing in the least criminal but they are the ones most likely to be ‘criminalised’ for breaking the rules. Disasters throw into sharp relief the fissures that already exist within cultures: between those at the edge of poverty lines and those at the pinnacles of the social order.
Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, and ranks first on several global indices, such the Human Development Index, the Index of Public Integrity as well as the Democracy Index. In contrast, India stands at an unconscionable 102 in a list of 117 countries on the 2019 Global Hunger Index. This is not, however, an attempt at self-flagellation; it is simply to observe that, at first glance, there seem to be few points of comparison between these two vastly different countries. For starters, India’s size and diversity imply that its tryst with democracy and development has to be incommensurable with Norway’s, which has a population of just about 5.5 million.
Yet, the fact is that hunger and farmland poverty were a grim reality in Norway not all that long ago, leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of the nation. Hunger is a literary manifestation of that scar.
The fiction of the body
At a time when the pandemic appears to have presented India with disturbing choices between ‘lives and livelihoods’, between possible deaths from hunger versus probable deaths from an infectious disease, my suggestion is that we can maybe learn more than meets the eye from the unlikely juxtaposition of the Indian and Norwegian scenarios. Positing human vulnerability in terms of a face-off between ‘nature’ (the pandemic) and ‘nurture’ (the economics of making goods and services available to all) immediately comes under a scanner when we do this.
This is because vulnerabilities vary. Norway was once a conservative and relatively stressed country; it is now a very wealthy one, partly because of its large reserve of oil deposits, but equally because it has a highly progressive democracy and an educated electorate. The huge hit that oil prices have taken during the present crisis might affect Norway’s economy but we can safely bet that its longstanding social investments will stand it in good stead. Ironically, Norway still imports basic items such as cereals, whereas India possesses huge buffer stocks of grains that, for some unfathomable reason, it has as yet failed to distribute freely and without question among its hungry — and increasingly angry — population.
But can fictional texts possibly contribute to a debate on such basic social questions? I believe that they do so by revealing a fundamental flaw in most top-down policy recommendations concerning the amelioration of distress. In our straightjacketed bureaucratic imaginations, the poor are often conceptualised as mere bodies. These ‘masses’ must be fed, clothed and kept healthy but their individuality is less than important in a developing society. This is a cardinal error. All humans, including the children most likely to suffer the lifelong effects of malnutrition, are perpetual thinking machines, fuelled by endless desires, intentions and emotions. It is exactly these mental resources that give the ‘common man’ the uncommon resilience to resist the good advice of ‘the authorities’ and proceed on long marches without any support from the state, risking death along the way.
The production of mind
Disciplines like literature, philosophy and psychology are critical because they typically view civilisation and its discontents in terms of insubordinate minds rather than as passive bodies — they show that minds are idea factories that can produce either horror or healing, fake news or true insight.
Consider a chilling illustration: both Knut Hamsun and the infamous Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Oslo and Utoya in 2011, were Norwegians with explicit Nazi and fascist sympathies. Both were subjected to significant cruelty as children, leading to psychological problems in adulthood. Despite being born 120 years apart, both were obsessed with Christendom, subscribed to cultural nationalism and celebrated nativist ‘son of the soil’ ideologies. It is the differences, though, that are crucial.
Every page of Hunger offers a compellingly honest, excruciatingly self-aware text that transcends its author’s faux beliefs. In contrast, Breivik’s e-compilation ‘2083: A European Declaration of Independence’ is a shallow and silly ‘manifesto’ where one is hard put to find a single original observation. Breivik believed Muslims were being encouraged to immigrate to Norway because of the government’s liberal policies. Hence, supporters of that view deserved to die.
In Hamsun’s fiction, one can literally hear the birdsong amid the silences; genuine empathy pervades his narratives. But in Breivik’s global social media echo chamber, all you hear is endless chatter. Empathy is crowded out. This could be why Breivik was oblivious to a stunning social detail that I feel sure Hamsun would not have missed.
Indian newspapers back in 2011 reported that Breivik “was wearing a uniform with an embroidered insignia. The insignia, ordered online by Breivik for his militant outfit Justiciar Knight, was embroidered by Mohammad Aslam Ansari.” So absorbed was Breivik with his own narcissistic image that he did not notice that one of its backend producers happened to be a Muslim weaver from the holy Hindu city of Varanasi!
Square one, two square meals
In its report, The Hindu noted a further irony. In an interview published on July 26, 2011, Ansari said he had no idea who had ordered the badges and was horrified when he found out. Ansari had not made much money out of his transaction: “I am back to square one, doing jobs on my family loom for others. Generally, we are paid Rs. 150 per metre, of which half goes to the weaver who is working on the loom. It is too meagre to meet even our daily needs.”
If the pandemic has brought one truth home to us, it is that going “back to square one” is not an option. Independent India has managed to wipe out the famines of the colonial period and eradicate dreaded diseases like smallpox. Visionary leaders such as Gandhi developed the fast or ‘hunger strike’ as a highly effective political tool. Post-coronavirus, India has to find the same willpower to eliminate hunger and strengthen its rickety healthcare system. This goal is eminently achievable — but only if India simultaneously undertakes the cognitive challenge of training its youthful, mobile-savvy citizenry to distinguish between the real voices of Ansari and Hamsun and the false ventriloquisms of a Breivik. For this to happen, we must lift the prolonged lockdown to which our education systems have been subject over the years.
The hunger for knowledge or ‘epistemic hunger’ has been an evolutionary constant in human societies. Like viruses, like food-hunger, it has lived within humans for millennia. Each of these forces shares in the neurochemical design of human warning systems. What we need today is a deeper understanding of the phenomenology of these intimate enemies. The nameless narrator in Hunger in fact invents a whole new word for his hunger experiences: Kuboaa. This word, as it first enters the character’s consciousness, could signify anything: padlock or sunrise or even god. It is precisely this destabilisation of a normative semantics that presages coronavirus times. As the narrator comments: “My thoughts took amazing leaps as I tried to establish the meaning of my new word”. Our shaken world is now ready — even hungry — for precisely such ‘amazing leaps’ of thought.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why smartphones are digital truth serum</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers from University of Pennsylvania published a new paper in the Journal of Marketing that explains that the device people use to communicate can affect the extent to which they are willing to disclose intimate or personal information about themselves.
The study forthcoming in the Journal of Marketing is titled "Full Disclosure: How Smartphones Enhance Consumer Self-disclosure" and is authored by Shiri Melumad and Robert Meyer.
Do smartphones alter what people are willing to disclose about themselves to others? A new study in the Journal of Marketing suggests that they might. The research indicates that people are more willing to reveal personal information about themselves online using their smartphones compared to desktop computers. For example, Tweets and reviews composed on smartphones are more likely to be written from the perspective of the first person, to disclose negative emotions, and to discuss the writer's private family and personal friends. Likewise, when consumers receive an online ad that requests personal information (such as phone number and income), they are more likely to provide it when the request is received on their smartphone compared to their desktop or laptop computer.
Why do smartphones have this effect on behavior? Melumad explains that "Writing on one's smartphone often lowers the barriers to revealing certain types of sensitive information for two reasons; one stemming from the unique form characteristics of phones and the second from the emotional associations that consumers tend to hold with their device." First, one of the most distinguishing features of phones is the small size; something that makes viewing and creating content generally more difficult compared with desktop computers. Because of this difficulty, when writing or responding on a smartphone, a person tends to narrowly focus on completing the task and become less cognizant of external factors that would normally inhibit self-disclosure, such as concerns about what others would do with the information. Smartphone users know this effect well—when using their phones in public places, they often fixate so intently on its content that they become oblivious to what is going on around them.
The second reason people tend to be more self-disclosing on their phones lies in the feelings of comfort and familiarity people associate with their phones. Melumad adds, "Because our smartphones are with us all of the time and perform so many vital functions in our lives, they often serve as 'adult pacifiers' that bring feelings of comfort to their owners." The downstream effect of those feelings shows itself when people are more willing to disclose feelings to a close friend compared to a stranger or open up to a therapist in a comfortable rather than uncomfortable setting. As Meyer says, "Similarly, when writing on our phones, we tend to feel that we are in a comfortable 'safe zone.' As a consequence, we are more willing to open up about ourselves."
The data to support these ideas is far-ranging and includes analyses of thousands of social media posts and online reviews, responses to web ads, and controlled laboratory studies. For example, initial evidence comes from analyses of the depth of self-disclosure revealed in 369,161 Tweets and 10,185 restaurant reviews posted on TripAdvisor.com, with some posted on PCs and some on smartphones.? Using both automated natural-language processing tools and human judgements of self-disclosure, the researchers find robust evidence that smartphone-generated content is indeed more self-disclosing. Perhaps even more compelling is evidence from an analysis of 19,962 "call to action" web ads, where consumers are asked to provide private information.
Consistent with the tendency for smartphones to facilitate greater self-disclosure, compliance was systematically higher for ads targeted at smartphones versus PCs.
The findings have clear and significant implications for firms and consumers. One is that if a firm wishes to gain a deeper understanding of the real preferences and needs of consumers, it may obtain better insights by tracking what they say and do on their smartphones than on their desktops. Likewise, because more self-disclosing content is often perceived to be more honest, firms might encourage consumers to post reviews from their personal devices. But therein lies a potential caution for consumers—these findings suggest that the device people use to communicate can affect what they communicate. This should be kept in mind when thinking about the device one is using when interacting with firms and others.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: People are more willing to reveal personal information about themselves online using their smartphones compared to desktop computers, says a study.

The study, published in the Journal of Marketing, suggests that the device people use to communicate can affect the extent to which they are willing to disclose intimate or personal information about themselves. Also Read - Fitness app games no substitute for actual exercise
For example, tweets and reviews composed on smartphones are more likely to be written from the perspective of the first person, to disclose negative emotions, and to discuss the writer’s private family and personal friends. Also Read - Do you know how Google responds to search warrants?
Likewise, when consumers receive an online ad that requests personal information (such as phone number and income), they are more likely to provide it when the request is received on their smartphone compared to their desktop or laptop computer, said the study.
“Writing on one’s smartphone often lowers the barriers to revealing certain types of sensitive information for two reasons; one stemming from the unique form characteristics of phones and the second from the emotional associations that consumers tend to hold with their device,” said the co-author Shiri Melumad from University of Pennsylvania
First, one of the most distinguishing features of phones is the small size; something that makes viewing and creating content generally more difficult compared with desktop computers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">​Publishers want Facebook, Google to share ad revenues amid COVID-19 declines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA -- Publishers that represent a majority of Canadian newspapers have penned an open letter to the federal government urging immediate action to make digital giants like Facebook and Google share their advertising revenues with Canadian media companies.
The letter, which appeared in an ad published in newspapers across the country Saturday, says the situation is urgent, with media companies suffering huge declines in advertising revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The publishers point to action taken recently in Australia, where the country's treasurer has announced mandatory measures to force digital companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to pay news media for use of their content.
The measures were to be completed by November, but are now being fast-tracked due to steep declines in advertising dollars caused by COVID-19 -- declines that have forced many newspapers to stop printing.
Bob Cox, publisher of the Winnipeg Free Press and one of the signatories of the letter, says newspaper ad revenues in Canada have fallen by at least 50 per cent, which has made the newspaper industry unviable.
"Newspapers are fighting for their very survival right now," he said.
The wage subsidy that forms part of the Liberals' multi-billion dollar pandemic emergency aid package will help, Cox said, calling the program a "life-saver."
The Liberal government is also rolling out a $30-million COVID-19 awareness advertising campaign, which was also billed as support for the media industry, but Cox noted these measures are short-term fixes.
"We expect that the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in advertising will continue for some time, at least through 2020 and probably into 2021, so we're going to be facing this decrease in advertising for a long time," he said.
"We need to look at the bigger picture, at the longer-term problems, and this is one of those longer-term problems."
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said last month the government is moving closer to implementing long-promised tax credits for newspapers to address ongoing revenue challenges in the sector. The most significant of these measures is a tax credit that will allow qualified newspapers to claim up to 25 per cent of the wages or salaries they pay to their journalists or other eligible employees.
The credit, which is not available to broadcasters, will be retroactive to salaries that were paid starting on Jan. 1, 2019.
A panel tasked with assessing whether media organizations qualify for these tax measures will begin informing the first news organizations of their qualification for this program this spring, with payments coming in the summer, said Guilbeault's press secretary Camille Gagne-Raynauld.
"Additionally, we are accelerating the processing of applications to our Aid to Publishers program, and expect funds to flow to successful recipients in June," she added, referencing a program aimed at helping print magazines and non-daily newspapers.
As for the actions taken by Australia and France to set deadlines of July for digital giants to start paying for copyrighted media content, Gagne-Raynauld said the federal government is "closely following what is being done abroad with regards to media support," but did not elaborate further.
Cox says he understands the federal government has been busy rolling out billions of dollars in aid for Canadian workers and employers hit by the pandemic while also dealing with a public health emergency.
But implementing measures to make digital giants share the ad revenue they make from content created by Canadian journalists, which they have been featuring on their platforms, would level the playing field for the media industry in Canada, Cox said.
It would also go a long way to help the media industry weather the long-term impacts the pandemic and resulting economic downturn is having and will continue to have on news companies.
"Newspapers and news media in general have been very, very valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have informed the public, they've fulfilled their role, the public has trusted them to deliver information about this very important issue to them," Cox said.
"We feel it's time to establish a solider business model for them going forward. We want to be around for the next time we're needed."
Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond for comment.
Facebook announced in March it was spending US$100 million to support the news industry during the COVID-19 crisis, and Google also has a Google News Initiative, with an aim to "work with the news industry to help journalism thrive in the digital age."
Torstar holds an investment in The Canadian Press as part of a joint agreement with subsidiaries of the Globe and Mail and Montreal's La Presse.

"We feel it's time to establish a solider business model for them going forward. We want to be around for the next time we're needed."
Facebook, Google and Twitter did not immediately respond for comment.
Facebook announced in March it was spending US$100 million to support the news industry during the COVID-19 crisis, and Google also has a Google News Initiative, with an aim to "work with the news industry to help journalism thrive in the digital age."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Publishers want Facebook, Google to share ad revenues amid COVID-19 declines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OTTAWA - Publishers that represent a majority of Canadian newspapers have penned an open letter to the federal government urging immediate action to make digital giants like Facebook and Google share their advertising revenues with Canadian media companies.
The letter, which appeared in an ad published in newspapers across the country Saturday, says the situation is urgent, with media companies suffering huge declines in advertising revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The publishers point to action taken recently in Australia, where the country's treasurer has announced mandatory measures to force digital companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter to pay news media for use of their content.
The measures were to be completed by November, but are now being fast-tracked due to steep declines in advertising dollars caused by COVID-19 — declines that have forced many newspapers to stop printing.
Bob Cox, publisher of the Winnipeg Free Press and one of the signatories of the letter, says newspaper ad revenues in Canada have fallen by at least 50 per cent, which has made the newspaper industry unviable.
"Newspapers are fighting for their very survival right now," he said.
The wage subsidy that forms part of the Liberals' multi-billion dollar pandemic emergency aid package will help, Cox said, calling the program a "life-saver."
The Liberal government is also rolling out a $30-million COVID-19 awareness advertising campaign, which was also billed as support for the media industry, but Cox noted these measures are short-term fixes.
"We expect that the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in advertising will continue for some time, at least through 2020 and probably into 2021, so we're going to be facing this decrease in advertising for a long time," he said.
"We need to look at the bigger picture, at the longer-term problems, and this is one of those longer-term problems."
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said last month the government is moving closer to implementing long-promised tax credits for newspapers to address ongoing revenue challenges in the sector. The most significant of these measures is a tax credit that will allow qualified newspapers to claim up to 25 per cent of the wages or salaries they pay to their journalists or other eligible employees.
The credit, which is not available to broadcasters, will be retroactive to salaries that were paid starting on Jan. 1, 2019.
A panel tasked with assessing whether media organizations qualify for these tax measures will begin informing the first news organizations of their qualification for this program this spring, with payments coming in the summer, said Guilbeault's press secretary Camille Gagne-Raynauld.
"Additionally, we are accelerating the processing of applications to our Aid to Publishers program, and expect funds to flow to successful recipients in June," she added, referencing a program aimed at helping print magazines and non-daily newspapers.
As for the actions taken by Australia and France to set deadlines of July for digital giants to start paying for copyrighted media content, Gagne-Raynauld said the federal government is "closely following what is being done abroad with regards to media support," but did not elaborate further.
Cox says he understands the federal government has been busy rolling out billions of dollars in aid for Canadian workers and employers hit by the pandemic while also dealing with a public health emergency.
But implementing measures to make digital giants share the ad revenue they make from content created by Canadian journalists, which they have been featuring on their platforms, would level the playing field for the media industry in Canada, Cox said.
It would also go a long way to help the media industry weather the long-term impacts the pandemic and resulting economic downturn is having and will continue to have on news companies.
"Newspapers and news media in general have been very, very valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have informed the public, they've fulfilled their role, the public has trusted them to deliver information about this very important issue to them," Cox said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Millions of people in the UK are to be asked to use a phone app to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
The Government is “optimistic” people will download the app to allow better contact tracing – a key factor in beating Covid-19 and helping the country out of lockdown.
Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought the “vast majority” of people would download the app and “play their part” – but insisted it was just one element of the plan to stop the spread.
The app would use Bluetooth to log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app.
If someone develops symptoms of Covid-19, they can use the app to inform the NHS, which will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs.
Here, the PA news agency looks at how other countries have been using mobile technology in the fight against Covid-19:
– Australia
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Australia released COVIDSafe last Sunday evening and more than four million people have started using the app.
Use of the app is voluntary, but the government said 40% of Australians, or 10 million people, need to use it for the program to be a success.
Speaking ahead of the weekend, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more people downloading the app would speed up the reopening of pubs, adding: “If that isn’t an incentive for Australians to download COVIDSafe on a Friday, I don’t know what is.”
– New Zealand
Across the Tasman Sea and New Zealand is also planning an app to help with contact tracing, but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it would have to be part of a number of measures.
She told reporters: “We are working on it but I have to say our big focus has been getting our in-person contact tracing right, because we will all still be relying on that.”
– Singapore
Developers of the TraceTogether app estimate around one in five people in the city state have downloaded the app, the first Bluetooth contact tracing app in the world.
Half of the 1.1 million downloads of the app came in the first 24 hours.
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
– India
The Aarogya Setu app uses both GPS location and Bluetooth to track users and has been downloaded 50 million times. It is voluntary for Indian citizens, but the government made it mandatory for all of its employees to download to app and use it last week.
– China
China’s app gives users a colour based on a traffic light system – green for clear, red for a coronavirus contact – and it is reportedly needed to move about as widespread restrictions are lifted.
– South Korea
South Korea sits apart from others on the list as it has not used an app-based solution to trace potential contacts. Instead, authorities have tracked people using a number of sources including mobile device tracking and financial transaction information to alert potential contacts.
– Elsewhere
The Czech Republic has released an app similar to the one from Singapore, while North Macedonia’s StopKorona! app uses Bluetooth. Smittestopp in Norway uses both GPS and Bluetooth, while apps are also in development in Italy, Austria and Germany.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Can antibody tests help tackle COVID-19?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The story so far: In the COVID-19 fight, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had advised States to use antibody testing for surveillance and reiterated that the focus has always been on real time RT-PCR (or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests for diagnosis. The rapid testing kits that State governments had been using to detect antibodies to the novel coronavirus were throwing up unreliable results. In Rajasthan for example, rapid testing kits failed to detect antibodies even when the laboratories had confirmed patients to be COVID-19 positive.
There are two ways to detect the presence of a virus, directly or indirectly. Antibody tests, also called serological tests, have usually been the time-tested approach to finding out the presence of a virus in the body. They do so by detecting the presence and quantity of antibodies that are produced by the immune system to battle an infection. It is an indirect test because it cannot find the virus, but it can determine if the immune system has encountered it.
Antibodies can show up between nine to 28 days after an infection has set in; by that time, an infected person, if not isolated, can spread the disease. Sometimes the antibodies may be produced in response to a closely-related pathogen and sometimes they may not be the right kind to counter the infection. These are the factors that can make an antibody test erroneous.
In an RT-PCR test, a nasal or throat swab is taken from a patient suspected of having the disease. The test involves extracting RNA or ribonucleic acid, the genetic material of the virus, and checking if it shares the same genetic sequence as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If it is a match, the sample is deemed positive. The only way such tests turn negative is if the actual sample does not have the virus or the swab was not properly administered and too little of the virus was gleaned.
As the sequencing of genomes is now widespread and the technology well understood by experts in several countries, China, and subsequently others, were quickly able to determine the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and learn what differentiates it from related viruses. This is why it was possible to prepare accurate tests to detect the virus relatively quickly, almost in the middle of a pandemic, and the RT-PCR tests began to be followed as the ‘gold standard’ in detecting the virus. As not enough research hours have been spent studying the antibodies and the profile of recovered patients, the antibody tests we have for COVID-19 are imperfect.
Antibody tests are fast and relatively inexpensive. The current RT-PCR technology requires RNA extracting machines, a specialised laboratory, and trained technicians. And at least a minimum of 30 samples are needed to make the process economically viable. The tests are done in batches and it can take up to four hours to confidently test for the presence of a virus from a batch. If one adds the time taken to isolate the RNA from swabs, this could again take a couple of hours. The scale of logistics involved can mean that it can practically take a day for results from a sample to be known. If one adds the cost of chemicals needed to perform these tests and the vagaries of importing practically every element of the paraphernalia involved, in the midst of a pandemic when demand far exceeds supply, it results in the test not being cheap. It can cost at least ₹4,500 depending on whether one is tested at a public or privately-run facility. Antibody tests are portable, can be administered on-site, conducted en masse and give quick answers. However, these answers are useful in-so-far as those who are using them are asking the right questions.
Given that they are not useful for directly detecting the presence of the virus, antibody tests can be used to gauge the extent of infection in a community or a large group of people who may have had exposure to the virus. Much like pregnancy detection kits, rapid-test kits change colour when particular molecules are detected. Two kinds of antibodies result from an infection: Immunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G (IgM and IgG). In response to an infection, the IgM is first produced within a week of infection. Two weeks later, the levels of IgM reduce and are replaced by IgG. The latter is a longer-lasting antibody and, depending on the infectious agent involved, can offer different durations of immunity. Antibodies to the chickenpox virus last for decades. Those to influenza viruses and even other coronaviruses (that cause the common cold) last no more than a year or two. This is why people need flu shots at regular intervals, and one of the reasons why it is practically pointless to have a vaccine for the common cold. It is too early in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to determine how long immunity lasts. Nevertheless the presence of IgM, IgG can in a sample of the population determine whether the virus is present in certain clusters. Ideally, this can help government authorities decide on what regions in a lockdown can be opened up if the aim is to get regular life back on track as soon as possible.
This is what happened when infections had reached frightening proportions in the United States and Europe. It was apparent that the limitations of the RT-PCR combined with the virus’s ability to spread even through those who were not visibly sick would mean large numbers would be infected without being detected. Rapid antibody tests can also play a role in determining the degree of “herd immunity” in a population. That is, the true number who may have been infected; when a sizeable fraction of the population has been infected, the virus ceases its pace of spread. Current research expects herd immunity to have been achieved when 55% to 80% of the population has been infected — only careful serological surveys can establish that. Studies in India too have shown that for every symptomatic positive, there are two asymptomatic or presymptomatics (those who do not visibly manifest the disease). Thus, antibody tests could also be used for such estimates in India. The ICMR had laid out the strategy to use antibody tests to gauge the degree of COVID-19 presence in the country. The plan involved using a combination of both RT-PCR and antibody tests to establish infection levels.
Two Chinese companies, Wondfo and Livzon, got licences to sell 500,000 rapid antibody kits to the ICMR. Several of these were to be given to States and some were for the ICMR’s own use. A first batch was deployed in some States and soon complaints began pouring in over inaccurate results. The ICMR then asked States to stop using these kits for two days. After two days, the ICMR advised States to stop using the kits altogether. The Health Ministry has cancelled the licences given to the companies that were importing these kits from China. So far, the ICMR has not clarified what was wrong with the kits. The Chinese companies have also claimed that the kits were validated by the ICMR’s expert body, the National Institute of Virology (NIV). However, the NIV only clears batches of kits that are submitted for testing. It is possible that even if a company’s kits get cleared, it ends up supplying kits on the field that are not up to the mark.
Another feature of the kits is their sensitivity (in percentage terms, the times the tests correctly identify people as positive for an infection) and specificity (in percentage terms, the times the test correctly rules out those not carrying the virus). Specificity refers to its ability to accurately distinguish between the target virus and other viruses. It is a well-established feature of tests that in regions of low actual prevalence of a disease, they can, depending on the kit’s specificity and sensitivity, miscategorise vast numbers of those tested. It is not clear if these were factored in in tests using kits blamed as faulty by States. India is not the only place where complaints over Chinese kits have been raised. The United Kingdom and Spain have also raised such issues with these kits. In either event, there is no clarity if the ICMR has ordered more kits. The Health Minister, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, has said that by the end of May, the country will have kits that are made in India for antibody and RT-PCR tests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘It was a little Wild West early on’: SpaceX’s president says the rocket company’s failures have prepared it to launch its first NASA astronauts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpaceX, for the first time in the company’s 18-year history, is poised to rocket humans into space.
But the company wouldn’t have grown enough to be ready for the feat if not for its many failures, Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer, said Friday during a series of NASA press briefings.
“We’ve grown up,” Shotwell told Business Insider. “It was a little Wild West early on, but candidly I think that those beginnings and those roots are critically important to our success.”
The company joined pre-mission briefings to answer questions about Demo-2, SpaceX’s upcoming mission to launch NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley toward the International Space Station (ISS). The flight will be SpaceX’s first with passengers, who will pilot the company’s new Crew Dragon spaceship after launching atop a 23-story Falcon 9 rocket.
Demo-2 is currently planned for May 27 at 4:32 p.m. ET. On Friday, NASA officials said the backup launch day is May 30, and that the astronaut’s stay at the ISS may last for more than six months.
Shotwell joined the first virtual press conference with NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and top members of the Commercial Crew Program Friday. The roughly $8 billion public-private partnership began in 2010 to eventually replace NASA’s space shuttle fleet, which was retired in July 2011. SpaceX won its first contract through the program in September 2014, though the company has officially worked with NASA since 2006.
“Hopefully, NASA has enjoyed the relationship as much as we have. We’ve learned from them. We’ve obviously been pleased by their financial support, their technical support, wisdom, and knowledge and helping us get to this day,” Shotwell told Ars Technica’s Eric Berger during the briefing.
Shotwell said she joined SpaceX in 2002 as its chief salesperson, and always worked to keep a close relationship with NASA.
“I knew when I joined the team that NASA wanted to build a space transportation system that was reliable enough and low-cost enough for people to be able to go to other planets. That sounded very kind of outer-worldly to me at that time in 2002,” she said. “But I certainly understood that if we were to achieve that, we would certainly do that hand-in-hand with NASA. So I’ve seen this company grow from roughly 10 employees to the thousands that we have now.”
Yet along with that growth, Shotwell added, came a lot of failures, which the company has seen its fair share of primarily during tests but also operational missions.
In 2015, SpaceX’s seventh space-station cargo resupply mission for NASA disintegrated late in its launch. The company also lost a commercial telecommunications satellite to a flawed pressure tank design when a Falcon 9 exploded during a launchpad test in September 2016.
Over the past two years, SpaceX also saw parachute issues and an explosive escape engine test on the ground, problems which both the company and NASA say they’ve resolved and closed.
“Even today, when we’re talking about flying people and flying other precious cargo as well, you have to learn those hard lessons,” Shotwell said. “I think sometimes the aerospace industry shies away from failure in the development phase. It looks bad, politically. It’s tough, and the media certainly makes a lot out of failures.”
But, she added, “the best way to learn is to push your systems to their limit, which includes your people, systems, and your processes, and learn where you’re weak and make things better.”
Kathy Lueders, who manages the Commercial Crew Program for NASA, said such lessons have not only been transferred from SpaceX but also learned in partnership with the company – and through disagreements with it.
“The best way to learn technically is to have a healthy tension and dynamic and be able to have to defend technical positions. And SpaceX makes us defend technical positions, as we make SpaceX technical positions,” Lueders said. “What that does is creates a body of work that I think we, as an agency, have really been able to build and I can tell you are building on [for] our future programs. So I think this has been a great relationship for the both of us over the last 13 years.”
Personally, Shotwell said, she will not rest until Behnken and Hurley safely complete their mission.
“My heart is sitting right here, and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station,” She said, holding her finger up to her throat. “But between now and then, there’s still work to do. I’ve got thousands of SpaceX employees who are focused on this mission.”
Shotwell described Behnken and Hurley as “badass” test pilots and astronauts, but also dads and people. She noted that SpaceX employees put photos of the crew on electronic work orders for Crew Dragon to keep the stakes of their task front-and-center.
“I will start sleeping again when they when they’re back safely on the planet,” Shotwell told Marcia Dunn of the Associated Press. “I don’t think I need to remind my employees how important this is. They remind themselves, and they are helpful in reminding me.”
Behnken said during another press briefing that SpaceX’s agility has impressed him most about Crew Dragon’s development. He also indicated that the ability to work quickly gives him more confidence going into his historic flight – the first debut of a new human-rated spaceship since 1981.
“Doug and I flew on shuttle missions separated by a couple of years,” Behnken told Business Insider on Friday. “We [didn’t] get, probably, the same level of change that we can get in a month from the SpaceX team during the couple of years that was between our shuttle flights.”
He added: “I hope I don’t have to see it: That agility in response to an issue during our mission. But we’ve seen it during the development process, and I know they could execute it if we needed them to while we are in orbit.”

“Even today, when we’re talking about flying people and flying other precious cargo as well, you have to learn those hard lessons,” Shotwell said. “I think sometimes the aerospace industry shies away from failure in the development phase. It looks bad, politically. It’s tough, and the media certainly makes a lot out of failures.”
But, she added, “the best way to learn is to push your systems to their limit, which includes your people, systems, and your processes, and learn where you’re weak and make things better.”
Kathy Lueders, who manages the Commercial Crew Program for NASA, said such lessons have not only been transferred from SpaceX but also learned in partnership with the company – and through disagreements with it.
“The best way to learn technically is to have a healthy tension and dynamic and be able to have to defend technical positions. And SpaceX makes us defend technical positions, as we make SpaceX technical positions,” Lueders said. “What that does is creates a body of work that I think we, as an agency, have really been able to build and I can tell you are building on [for] our future programs. So I think this has been a great relationship for the both of us over the last 13 years.”
Personally, Shotwell said, she will not rest until Behnken and Hurley safely complete their mission.
“My heart is sitting right here, and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station,” She said, holding her finger up to her throat. “But between now and then, there’s still work to do. I’ve got thousands of SpaceX employees who are focused on this mission.”
Shotwell described Behnken and Hurley as “badass” test pilots and astronauts, but also dads and people. She noted that SpaceX employees put photos of the crew on electronic work orders for Crew Dragon to keep the stakes of their task front-and-center.
“I will start sleeping again when they when they’re back safely on the planet,” Shotwell told Marcia Dunn of the Associated Press. “I don’t think I need to remind my employees how important this is. They remind themselves, and they are helpful in reminding me.”
Behnken said during another press briefing that SpaceX’s agility has impressed him most about Crew Dragon’s development. He also indicated that the ability to work quickly gives him more confidence going into his historic flight – the first debut of a new human-rated spaceship since 1981.
“Doug and I flew on shuttle missions separated by a couple of years,” Behnken told Business Insider on Friday. “We [didn’t] get, probably, the same level of change that we can get in a month from the SpaceX team during the couple of years that was between our shuttle flights.”
He added: “I hope I don’t have to see it: That agility in response to an issue during our mission. But we’ve seen it during the development process, and I know they could execute it if we needed them to while we are in orbit.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'We've grown up': SpaceX's failures prepared it to launch its first NASA astronauts, says rocket company president Gwynne Shotwell</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SpaceX, for the first time in the company’s 18-year history, is poised to rocket humans into space.
But the company wouldn’t have grown enough to be ready for the feat if not for its many failures, Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer, said Friday during a series of NASA press briefings.
“We’ve grown up,” Shotwell told Business Insider. “It was a little Wild West early on, but candidly I think that those beginnings and those roots are critically important to our success.”
The company joined pre-mission briefings to answer questions about Demo-2, SpaceX’s upcoming mission to launch NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley toward the International Space Station (ISS). The flight will be SpaceX’s first with passengers, who will pilot the company’s new Crew Dragon spaceship after launching atop a 23-story Falcon 9 rocket.
Demo-2 is currently planned for May 27 at 4:32 p.m. ET. On Friday, NASA officials said the backup launch day is May 30, and that the astronaut’s stay at the ISS may last for more than six months.
Shotwell joined the first virtual press conference with NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and top members of the Commercial Crew Program Friday. The roughly $US8 billion public-private partnership began in 2010 to eventually replace NASA’s space shuttle fleet, which was retired in July 2011. SpaceX won its first contract through the program in September 2014, though the company has officially worked with NASA since 2006.
“Hopefully, NASA has enjoyed the relationship as much as we have. We’ve learned from them. We’ve obviously been pleased by their financial support, their technical support, wisdom, and knowledge and helping us get to this day,” Shotwell told Ars Technica’s Eric Berger during the briefing.
Shotwell said she joined SpaceX in 2002 as its chief salesperson, and always worked to keep a close relationship with NASA.
“I knew when I joined the team that NASA wanted to build a space transportation system that was reliable enough and low-cost enough for people to be able to go to other planets. That sounded very kind of outer-worldly to me at that time in 2002,” she said. “But I certainly understood that if we were to achieve that, we would certainly do that hand-in-hand with NASA. So I’ve seen this company grow from roughly 10 employees to the thousands that we have now.”
Yet along with that growth, Shotwell added, came a lot of failures, which the company has seen its fair share of primarily during tests but also operational missions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Contact tracing app to be trialled on Isle of Wight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A smartphone app to trace the spread of coronavirus will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month, the Government has announced.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said around 50% to 60% of people will need to use the software for it to be effective as he described it as the “best possible way to help the NHS”.
The NHSX app is part of the Government’s test, track and trace strategy and will be central to its efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus.
Contact tracing has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly.
The Government intends to use the app and a phone team to carry out the tracing.
It will be downloaded on to smartphones and use bluetooth technology to work out when other app users are in close enough proximity to potentially spread the virus.
The data is recorded under an anonymous ID, rather than by the person’s name.
If and when someone starts showing symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, they are able to share that on the app.
The app then sends a notification warning of possible infection to all those phone users to have come in requisite proximity recently.
Mr Shapps told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The idea is that we will encourage as many people to take this up as possible.
“This is going to be a huge national effort and we need, for this to work, 50% to 60% of people to be using this app.
“Not everybody has a smartphone and I appreciate that for various reasons not everybody will download it but it will be the best possible way to help the NHS.”
He stressed the app will be completely confidential.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sport in lockdown: 'Someone pulled the rug out from under the summer'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sport’s unravelling happened haphazardly – and then suddenly. With Champions League and Europa League games behind played behind closed doors or postponed, and plenty of debate about whether other sports should continue, the turning point was Arsenal’s head coach Mikel Arteta’s diagnosis with coronavirus, which popped up on Thursday 12 March, a few hours after Boris Johnson had warned that many families would lose their loved ones. The next day, everything fell away.
Other sports fans will have their own shoulder-slumping moments; mine was coming back to my desk to be told that Wales’s Six Nations match with Scotland on the Saturday and the Masters golf in April had both been scrapped, within minutes of each other. That day the Premier League, Women’s Super League, Scottish Premier League, London Marathon and England’s Test series with Sri Lanka all went. Somehow that day’s Gold Cup at Cheltenham went ahead, seeming even then to misread the mood – it does even more so now.
“Sport was actually quite good wasn’t it,” tweeted our chief sportswriter, Barney Ronay. After a spell in which the ground shifted beneath our feet almost daily, we’ve settled into some kind of routine. Inevitably we’re covering a lot about postponements, cancellations and hopes for restarts. Our reporter David Conn was quickly on to fears that the virus had spread after the Liverpool-Atlético Madrid game, and the Guardian has looked hard at evidence linking the virus to Cheltenham. Otherwise we’ve had time to wallow – not too much, but enough – in some of the great moments of the past, not least in our retro minute-by-minute series and the My Favourite Game series. Plus we’ve delivered interviews with some sporting personalities – including Andy Cole, Fabio Capello, Ada Hegerberg, Rory McIlroy – that we would have been proud of in the busiest times. Sport isn’t even close to the most important thing right now. But do we miss it? Like crazy.
It’s like a metaphysical conundrum: how do you write about sport that doesn’t exist? In a way, it’s analogous to describing the silence that follows a piece of music: yes, technically you’re trying to define the shape of something that isn’t there. But if you listen closely enough, you can feel in the absence the weight of what was once present. And perhaps it’s only in the void that sport leaves that you can truly appreciate its worth.How do you fill the void? Archive features and retrospectives are perhaps an inevitable upshot of the shutdown, a chance to reconsider the past with a fresh eye and the benefit of time. But our readers don’t simply want to wallow in nostalgia; they want to know when sport will return, what it will feel and taste like when it does. That’s the balance I’ve tried to strike, and in a way it’s the balance we’re all striving for: equal parts realism and escapism, the same bewitching brew that drew us all to sport in the first place.
Sports journalism’s rhythm is defined by the diary. But that diary is empty, at least in the immediate future, despite ongoing meetings to provide a roadmap of how and when live sport can return. Global championships, events and league seasons have been cancelled or postponed, falling like a row of dominoes in the past couple of months. And so the first part of lockdown has been shaped by a news agenda chasing what will no longer be happening this spring and summer and the repercussions of those cancellations or delays. That has now been replaced by talk of when live sport might get up and running again, and the ethics of such a return.
There has been a glaring hole left in the absence of any live sport to cover. Interviews and features, too, are usually pegged to the news agenda or forthcoming events. Beyond those related to the pandemic itself, we have recast interviews or features to reflect the new reality of lockdown. We have also looked for different ways of engaging with our readers. Our hugely popular live minute-by-minutes have had a retro makeover, some pegged to anniversaries or events that had been in the diary; we have brought in regular columnists such as the England cricketer Moeen Ali to answer readers’ questions and commissioned follow-up features off the back of readers’ responses to articles.
As the lockdown continues, and the news ebbs rather than flows, we are embracing opportunities to turn back the clock, source interviews that we could never quite find the right time to publish, and investigate wider issues.
Before all this, the problems we were most accustomed to dealing with on the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast involved how best to cram in all the big weekend talking points on a Monday morning. All four divisions of the English league had to be discussed, along with the latest news from Scotland and the major continental leagues, as well as any other business. That’s a “hella lotta” football chat.
Presenter Max Rushden and I immediately promised our audience that, health permitting, we would continue recording twice a week until somebody higher up told us to stop. We hoped it would go some way towards maintaining our own sanity as well as that of the hundreds of thousands of listeners for whom Football Weekly seems to provide a reassuring sense of normality and routine. Our listening figures suggest that if anything, football has been holding us back for years.
With no action to discuss, Max and I have had to come up with other ways to fill time. The most difficult part? Finding the right balance between discussions about particularly grim virus-related issues and more frivolous topics of discussion, such as the conspicuous absence of bookshelves full of intellectually weighty tomes in the background of each other’s “home studios”, and general chit-chat about how we’ve been coping in a world where pub-going is not an option. It should go without saying that our guests and listeners have been a source of welcome inspiration, their contributions and correspondence regularly sending us off on strange, often hilarious and always welcome tangents.
While Max and I don’t like to talk about the selfless manner in which we are putting our lives on the line each week in the interests of boosting public morale like a pair of modern-day Vera Lynns, we recently received an email from a nurse named David from the United States who could identify with the stress and hardship we are currently not enduring.
“Your voices cheerfully ring through the darkness of semi-rural Connecticut during my long drives into my night shift and balance out my thoughts of how many Covid patients my hospital now has, or how many of my co-workers have either tested positive or are now under quarantine,” he wrote. “I am sure there are thousands and thousands of people like me around the world that deeply appreciate what you do. Please carry on.”
Just try to stop us.
Maybe I was in denial but covering my last, pre-lockdown, match - Sheffield United 1 Norwich 0 on 7 March - the sight of locals staggering past Bramall Lane laden with toilet rolls failed to alert me to the surreal nightmare ahead.
Back home in Newcastle, another train was hurtling down the tracks and about to blindside everyone. A largely Saudi Arabian-funded consortium was buying the city’s football club for £300m. Devoid of the usual framework of matches and press conferences – which provided welcome structure and routine for us “patch reporters” who routinely work from home – there was something to write about again.
Instead of debating whether teams should be playing 3-4-3 or 4-2-3-1, there is Newcastle United’s extraordinary role in a bitter proxy war between Saudi and Qatar to consider: a Doha-based satellite broadcaster has urged the Premier League to block the takeover, arguing that Saudi Arabia should be accountable for a pirate network that illegally transmits English top-tier games.
Amnesty are rightly concerned about Saudi’s human rights record but Newcastle fans are broadly delighted - and extremely excited - by the prospective departure of the club’s loathed owner, Mike Ashley. It’s an ethical quagmire. Sophisticated sports-washing or Saudi modernisation?
Match reporting is infinitely more straightforward – and adrenaline-rich. Perhaps the biggest thing I crave is the adrenaline: reports invariably have to be filed against tight deadlines, either on the final whistle or, at night games, as “runners”, with chunks of copy delivered at half-time. They always involve a mild sense of panic. I miss that.
The Premier League has been hit hard by the crisis – and the supply of sporting news has almost dried up.
Even now, looking back at it from a distance, the speed with which everything changed feels bewildering. On Saturday 7 March, a few weeks and half a lifetime ago, I was at Twickenham, reporting on England’s victory against Wales in the Six Nations, one in a crowd of 80,000. Boris Johnson was there too. Five days later he was on TV telling us that we were in the midst of the “worst public health crisis for a generation”. And then, all of a sudden, someone pulled the rug out from under the summer. The rest of the rugby season was postponed, then the beginning of the cricket season too, and the Masters, the Open, Wimbledon and the Olympics, all events I was supposed to cover.
Instead, I’m a sportswriter with no sport to write, apart from marble racing videos and back garden marathons. I’ve been craving some escape from it all. Sport’s a glorious triviality, after all. So I’ve been busy losing myself in writing about my favourite old games and players, or reporting on forgotten stories about the Moscow Olympic boycott and the CIA’s attempts to recruit Soviet athletes in the 1960s, anything that I think will entertain readers, and give them something else to read and think and talk about, to try to help them forget about everything else, if only for a few precious minutes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple’s iPhone 12 could be $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple could launch the iPhone 12 at a lower price when the device hits retail shelves later this year.  The information comes from Jon Prosser of the YouTube channel Front Page Tech. Prosser says his sources said that the iPhone 12 would cost $650, a $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11.
It’s the same strategy Apple used for the iPhone 11. The handset has a starting price of $699 for the 64GB storage model which is $50 cheaper than the iPhone XR which was launched in 2018. If the iPhone 12 ends up being $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11, it would help Apple to create an even more affordable flagship device that will appeal to consumers who don’t want to spend money on the company’s top-end models. Plus, this is the time period many would hesitate in spending $1000 on a flagship Apple device due to an uncertain environment.
On many levels, the iPhone 12 at $649 will be a breakthrough. The iPhone 12 will be the first “affordable flagship iPhone” to come with an OLED display. Right now, the OLED displays are limited to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Meanwhile, the iPhone 11 comes with a regular LCD display. But there is a $300 gap between the base model of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.
Prosser believes Apple will launch four models of the iPhone 12 lineup: a 5.4-inch model that would cost $650, a 6.1-inch version priced at $750, and two iPhone 12 Pro models at 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. The latter two models are expected to cost $1000 and $1100 respectively. That would be a significant departure from Apple’s current approach of launching three iPhones a year. All four iPhones will come with 5G and OLED screens.
Rumour has it that this year’s iPhone will be radically different from the previous generation iPhones. The phones may have a smaller notch and rounded corners like the iPhone 5.

Apple is scheduled to launch new iPhones in September, though the novel coronaviruspandemic could delay the iPhone 12 lineup. Apple recently launched the iPhone SE, a cheaper iPhone for $399. The new iPhone SE has the same A13 chipset found inside the iPhone 11, but the design is similar to the 2017’s iPhone 8.

    <h5 class="mb-1">3D glasses, double headsets, and rock drilling: NASA engineers told us what it's like to drive a Mars rover from home during the pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remote work doesn't get much more remote than piloting a robot 140 million miles away on the surface of Mars.
NASA, alongside many other workplaces, has had to shut its doors during the coronavirus pandemic. For engineers and scientists working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) responsible for driving the Curiosity Mars rover, this meant setting up systems so they could continue to communicate with the rover while all stuck in their homes.
Business Insider spoke to two NASA employees currently on the rover team about how they are managing to execute commands and even make scientific advances while working from home.
Alicia Allbaugh has worked on and off at NASA since 1991, and oversees the 75-person rover program which she has worked on since 2006. When she heard rumblings about the pandemic and potential lockdowns on NPR, she started to form a plan for if the rover team suddenly had to ship out. The rover team has had to think about some work-from-home plans in the past in case of earthquakes, Allbaugh said.
Luckily for the rover team, there was already some infrastructure in place because it works with scientists all over the world, so a degree of teleconferencing functionality was already on hand. They were able to do an experimental test run on March 12, five days before NASA shut its offices.
It took everyone a few hours to acclimatize to setting up all their windows and chats so they fit onto home monitor screens. "We figured it out within like two, three hours. We were sort of getting into the groove and understanding the ebb and flow and the pace," she said. The test went off surprisingly well, with the rover receiving and successfully executing a set of orders.
Before NASA issued the order sending its employees home on March 17, Allbaugh had also gone into the office and done an inventory of all the spare monitors and headsets the team had on hand and what they would have to order in. When news did come that employees shouldn't come back to work the next day, her team grabbed what they needed and headed home.
The Curiosity rover is equipped with 3D cameras, which it uses to send 3D images back to its drivers to help work out where it should go next. Ordinarily the team look at these images with special high-tech 3D goggles which flip which eye is looking at the image at a rate of about 60 times per second.
"The reason we have them, in general, is because the Rover drivers need to visualize how the Rover moves over 3D train," said Matt Gildner, the rover planner team lead.
Gildner oversees a team of about 20 planners who write and send commands telling the rover where to go. He added that the 3D images give the drivers a better idea of how steep a slope might be, or how sandy the ground might be.
But the goggles require heavy-duty graphics cards normally used in gaming computers, and it wasn't going to be practical to get these working at home, so NASA found a less high-tech solution.
Rover planners are now using simple plastic red-blue glasses, the same kind you would use to watch a 3D movie. Gildner says he pops the glasses on for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time about three times a day to look around at where the rover is.
"It really helps us do our jobs. I mean, we couldn't do it without it," he said.
The various groups that work on Curiosity are used to being in large rooms where they can easily talk to each other and convene amongst themselves, and simulating this kind of communication was a big challenge for the team.
Broadly speaking the work is split into uplink (what information NASA is sending the rover) and downlink (what information the rover is sending to NASA).
"The downlink area where they look at the data is similar to what you've seen in like 'Apollo 13' [...] with little signs above everyone, and they're looking at information from various systems on the vehicle," Allbaugh said.
Uplink takes place on a different floor. "[Uplink is] mostly in one really large room that has a whole bunch of computers around the edge of it, and a very large table in the center with people on laptops usually as well," Allbaugh added.
As a planner, Gildner works on the uplink side of the team and said it was a struggle to mimic this flow of communication. "We are used to being able to have everyone in one room and have some conversations that are within smaller groups in one room, and then some conversations that participate with everyone," he said.
His solution: double headsets.
"What we've done is actually we set up multiple teleconferences all at once. I will have one headset called into my team of  rover drivers and we'll be chatting, and I'll have that in one ear. And then I will be called into the larger teams group and have that in my second ear. And so I'm like muting myself in between two teleconferences at once and chatting back and forth and doing this for like eight hours a day," he said.
"It does make you a bit more worn out, you have to concentrate a bit more. But it's actually worked very well ... we're able to kind of mimic what we would be doing if we were all in one place in one conference room, or one operations room, trying to work with different teams," he added.
Wearing his 3D glasses as well as his two headsets is what Gildner calls his "super nerd" look. "You've got to do both headsets at once too, because that's really key to the whole look," he said.
On March 20 a set of commands that were sent to Curiosity were successfully executed, and the robot drilled a rock sample at a location called "Edinburgh," and is now headed on to yet another drilling operation looking for rocks to analyze. In total, the robot has rolled 166 metres (545 feet) since its human operators had to set up shop at home.
For Gildner, piloting the rover has taken on a special significance during lockdown. "One of the big draws of working on a spacecraft operation, especially on Mars, is that every day we're driving to a new place and I get to look at images that no human has ever seen before," he said.
"We all get to kind of escape on Mars for a few hours every week," he added, pointing out that Curiosity's photos are also uploaded for the public to see, should anyone else care to escape to Mars.

It took everyone a few hours to acclimatize to setting up all their windows and chats so they fit onto home monitor screens. “We figured it out within like two, three hours. We were sort of getting into the groove and understanding the ebb and flow and the pace,” she said. The test went off surprisingly well, with the rover receiving and successfully executing a set of orders.
Before NASA issued the order sending its employees home on March 17, Allbaugh had also gone into the office and done an inventory of all the spare monitors and headsets the team had on hand and what they would have to order in. When news did come that employees shouldn’t come back to work the next day, her team grabbed what they needed and headed home.
The Curiosity rover is equipped with 3D cameras, which it uses to send 3D images back to its drivers to help work out where it should go next. Ordinarily the team look at these images with special high-tech 3D goggles which flip which eye is looking at the image at a rate of about 60 times per second.
“The reason we have them, in general, is because the Rover drivers need to visualize how the Rover moves over 3D train,” said Matt Gildner, the rover planner team lead.
Gildner oversees a team of about 20 planners who write and send commands telling the rover where to go. He added that the 3D images give the drivers a better idea of how steep a slope might be, or how sandy the ground might be.
But the goggles require heavy-duty graphics cards normally used in gaming computers, and it wasn’t going to be practical to get these working at home, so NASA found a less high-tech solution.
Rover planners are now using simple plastic red-blue glasses, the same kind you would use to watch a 3D movie. Gildner says he pops the glasses on for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time about three times a day to look around at where the rover is.
“It really helps us do our jobs. I mean, we couldn’t do it without it,” he said.
The various groups that work on Curiosity are used to being in large rooms where they can easily talk to each other and convene amongst themselves, and simulating this kind of communication was a big challenge for the team.
Broadly speaking the work is split into uplink (what information NASA is sending the rover) and downlink (what information the rover is sending to NASA).
“The downlink area where they look at the data is similar to what you’ve seen in like ‘Apollo 13’ […] with little signs above everyone, and they’re looking at information from various systems on the vehicle,” Allbaugh said.
Uplink takes place on a different floor. “[Uplink is] mostly in one really large room that has a whole bunch of computers around the edge of it, and a very large table in the center with people on laptops usually as well,” Allbaugh added.
As a planner, Gildner works on the uplink side of the team and said it was a struggle to mimic this flow of communication. “We are used to being able to have everyone in one room and have some conversations that are within smaller groups in one room, and then some conversations that participate with everyone,” he said.
His solution: double headsets.
“What we’ve done is actually we set up multiple teleconferences all at once. I will have one headset called into my team of rover drivers and we’ll be chatting, and I’ll have that in one ear. And then I will be called into the larger teams group and have that in my second ear. And so I’m like muting myself in between two teleconferences at once and chatting back and forth and doing this for like eight hours a day,” he said.
“It does make you a bit more worn out, you have to concentrate a bit more. But it’s actually worked very well … we’re able to kind of mimic what we would be doing if we were all in one place in one conference room, or one operations room, trying to work with different teams,” he added.
Wearing his 3D glasses as well as his two headsets is what Gildner calls his “super nerd” look. “You’ve got to do both headsets at once too, because that’s really key to the whole look,” he said.
On March 20 a set of commands that were sent to Curiosity were successfully executed, and the robot drilled a rock sample at a location called “Edinburgh,” and is now headed on to yet another drilling operation looking for rocks to analyze. In total, the robot has rolled 166 metres (545 feet) since its human operators had to set up shop at home.
For Gildner, piloting the rover has taken on a special significance during lockdown. “One of the big draws of working on a spacecraft operation, especially on Mars, is that every day we’re driving to a new place and I get to look at images that no human has ever seen before,” he said.
“We all get to kind of escape on Mars for a few hours every week,” he added, pointing out that Curiosity’s photos are also uploaded for the public to see, should anyone else care to escape to Mars.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Older Queenslanders embracing new tech from video calls to blogging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queensland's mature-aged residents are embracing technology to stay connected amid the state's coronavirus restrictions, enforced to keep them safe during the global pandemic.
The general manager of STAR Community Services, Patsy Wilshire, said the not-for-profit aged-care service provider's STAR Tech program was teaching older Queenslanders to use online resources to ensure they didn't get left behind in the digital world.
"Technology can support seniors to not only maintain their social connections, but in fact improve the quality of their life via online shopping, banking and other digital services," Ms Wilshire said.
Ipswich resident Bobby Flower, 81, is one of the program's many participants using newly learnt technology skills to stay in touch with family via regular video calls.
"It is difficult to not have my grandson over for visits, but we talk every day through video calls," he said.
"We share our day’s activities with each other."
Victoria Point residents Dorothy and Michael Byrnes are learning about apps and blogging.
"It breaks up our day," they said.
"By learning new online skills, we are able to focus on something productive."
Other residents are using their skills to exercise with their weekly group online, access e-books and tune into radio stations via an app.
Helen McCullough, 69, is sharpening her focus and memory skills with online brain-training games.
"They are very engaging," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Older Queenslanders embracing new tech from video calls to blogging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Queensland's mature-aged residents are embracing technology to stay connected amid the state's coronavirus restrictions, enforced to keep them safe during the global pandemic.
The general manager of STAR Community Services, Patsy Wilshire, said the not-for-profit aged-care service provider's STAR Tech program was teaching older Queenslanders to use online resources to ensure they didn't get left behind in the digital world.
"Technology can support seniors to not only maintain their social connections, but in fact improve the quality of their life via online shopping, banking and other digital services," Ms Wilshire said.
Ipswich resident Bobby Flower, 81, is one of the program's many participants using newly learnt technology skills to stay in touch with family via regular video calls.
"It is difficult to not have my grandson over for visits, but we talk every day through video calls," he said.
"We share our day’s activities with each other."
Victoria Point residents Dorothy and Michael Byrnes are learning about apps and blogging.
"It breaks up our day," they said.
"By learning new online skills, we are able to focus on something productive."
Other residents are using their skills to exercise with their weekly group online, access e-books and tune into radio stations via an app.
Helen McCullough, 69, is sharpening her focus and memory skills with online brain-training games.
"They are very engaging," she said.
"My family emails me links to interesting quizzes and trivia to try out. I look forward to the challenge."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Krokus Recall ’80s Fights with Def Leppard, AC/DC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Members of Swiss rock icons Krokus reflected on the negative effects of having lived life too large in the ‘80s, and how their behavior saw them run into trouble with Def Leppard and AC/DC when they most needed the attention those bands could have helped them receive.
In 1983 Krokus were removed from their support slot with Def Leppard on a U.S. tour after frontman Marc Storace repeatedly ignored instructions on which parts of the stage he was allowed to us, and then used comments his counterpart Joe Elliott had used during his own performance the previous night.
“It became very ugly, and when our manager punched the drummer [Rick Allen], naturally we were dumped from the tour,” bassist Chris von Rohr told Classic Rock. “It’s still hard for Marc to look back because he knows he was being a jerk.” Storace agreed, but partly blamed their then-manager for advising him badly. “[A] section of the stage was gaffer-taped off. [He] encouraged me to break those rules: ‘Don’t listen to them, listen to me. I’m your manager.’ The scuffle was like something right out of the Wild West.”
However, Storace reported that he’d settled his differences with Elliott when both bands appeared at a European festival last year. “I apologized to Joe Elliott, who hugged me and said that all of those problems were in the past,” Storace explained.
The 1983 incident came two years after Krokus were forbidden from playing the U.K.’s Monsters of Rock festival, apparently at the behest of AC/DC. While the situation has never been fully explained, it had been speculated that animosity arose after Storace refused an invitation to try out for the Australian band following the death of Bon Scott in 1980.
“There was no direct communication, just an invitation from the same light and sound company shared by both bands,” Storace said in the new interview. “I was happy with the way things were going for Krokus; promoters wanted us everywhere, and I didn’t want to live in Australia. At the time, AC/DC were pretty much on the same level as us, and when they lost Bon I considered that put us ahead of them in the game – though not in any spiteful way.”
Von Rohr recalled how there had been no issues when the bands shared a London studio in 1981, as AC/DC ran short of time and Krokus allowed them the space they needed. “There was no tension between the two groups of musicians – certainly not from our side,” he reported. Reflecting on their early ‘80s era in general, he noted: “[T]here was cocaine around. We had too much success and there was too much of everything.”
 
The early production team of Harry Vanda and George Young returns to help AC/DC make their best album since 1981's 'For Those About to Rock' – and a final pair of original U.K. Top 20 songs in "Heatseeker" and "That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll." 'Blow Up Your Video' is more top heavy than their glory-years albums, but it gamely recalls what made AC/DC great in the first place.
Their five-times platinum follow-up 'Permanent Vacation' gets all the love, but Aerosmith's first album with Joe Perry and Brad Whitford in almost six years is actually the better album. In fact, you'd have to go back a decade to 'Rocks' to find one that, well, rocks more.
The Allmans would have their big breakthrough the year after their second album was released in 1970. 'At Fillmore East' made them stars, but 'Idlewild South' gave them the confidence to focus their live sets on their assets. The band was closing in on greatness here ("Midnight Rider" and "Memory of Elizabeth Reed" make their debuts), and it was only a matter of time before the rest of the world caught on.
Things moved so quickly for Bad Company that their third album, 1976's 'Run With the Pack,' was rushed to the point where its most memorable song was a cover of an old Coasters hit from the '50s. For the follow-up, the band returned to its harder roots. 'Burnin' Sky' wasn't as successful as Bad Company's first three albums, but the group's lean approach here would mark the final time the original lineup sounded this tough.
The Band were nearing the end of their classic run, with their last original album going back to 1971's 'Cahoots.' 'Northern Lights, Southern Cross,' from 1975, followed a successful tour with old boss Bob Dylan and a less-than-successful album of '50s covers. It includes some of their best songs -- "Ophelia," "Acadian Driftwood" and, especially, "It Makes No Difference," among them. They had one more album left in them before their last waltz.
There are people out there who really don't like the Beatles' final album and for one simple reason: Phil Spector's occasionally intrusive embellishments. But look beyond the strings, backup singers and glop, and you'll discover some of the group's best late-period songs. There's a real sense of looseness and roots-digging on 'Let It Be.' You just have to work a little to hear them, but it's worth the effort.
'Truth' gets all the accolades for bringing together Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, but the second album by the Jeff Beck Group is almost as good. Like his former Yardbirds bandmate Jimmy Page, who would debut his new group Led Zeppelin the same year as 'Beck-Ola''s 1969 release, Beck outfitted blues and R&B with a harder, more rock-oriented approach, and the results are often stunning.
Black Sabbath were in the middle of an ugly lawsuit with their former manager when they recorded their sixth album. The process took a toll on them, which is reflected in the record's dark and often murky grooves. It all eventually weighed on the band, which gave singer Ozzy Osbourne the boot in a few years. But 'Sabotage' sounds like one last chance at keeping it together, with songs like "Symptom of the Universe" working out frustrations at breakneck speed.
1988's 'Imaginos' has a complex history. It was originally intended as a solo album by drummer Albert Bouchard seven years earlier. But the band's record company shelved the project, which was supposed to be the first part of a trilogy. Over the years, outsiders – including Joe Satriani and the Doors' Robby Krieger – were brought in to rework the songs, which producer Sandy Pearlman stitched together with a story he had written about aliens. It's kind of a mess, but a glorious mess at times – one of Blue Oyster Cult's most intriguing works. It bombed, though, and the band was dropped by its label.
After the huge one-two punch of 'Slippery When Wet' and 'New Jersey,' fans expected another rousing set of anthem-sized songs from Bon Jovi. But they grew up in the four years between albums, and 'Keep the Faith' is a more straightforward rock 'n' roll album with little of the pop sheen that graced their big hits. It's a mature turning point from which there was no turning back.
Following the massive success of their self-titled 1976 debut, Boston's second album – which arrived two years later and seemed like an eternity at the time – is often overlooked except for its hit title track. Too bad, because 'Don't Look Back' is cut from the same cloth as the first album, with out-of-this-world riffs, choruses and production overflowing from the grooves.
Post 'Ziggy Stardust' and 'Aladdin Sane,' Bowie was sidelined by an underwhelming covers album which sank some of the buzz for 1974's 'Diamond Dogs,' a glitzy, glammy and strutting rock 'n' roll album that comes on like a big wet kiss to his most loyal fans. Bowie was just a few months away from another reinvention – this time, as an American soul singer before his legendary Berlin phase – and 'Diamond Dogs' sounds like a victory lap for his superstar rock 'n' roll era.
Maybe Jackson Browne got too Jackson Browney for his own good by 1980's 'Hold Out,' his only No. 1 album. After being hailed as one of the best songwriters of his generation, and checking in with his biggest-selling LP, 'Running on Empty,' last time out, Browne's sixth album was considered a letdown. The opening "Disco Apocalypse" maybe summed it up for some fans, but dig deeper – to cuts like "That Girl Could Sing" and the epic, eight-minute closer "Hold On Hold Out" – and you'll discover some loose gems.
Lost in the middle of the Cars' first two albums and the commercial rebirth of the early '80s, their third album 'Panorama' is, in a way, their weirdest record – a conscious move away from the pop-driven New Wave that made them famous. Instead, the band goes down a more experimental path here, getting darker and deeper than they did on previous outings. It baffled many fans, but the Cars were back to their old sound a year later for 'Shake It Up.'
Everything that made Cheap Trick big by the end of the '70s was already in place on their 1977 debut. They'd just fine-tune everything by the time 'Cheap Trick at Budokan' made them one of the hugest bands on the planet. They're a more primal group here, with the guitars slashing more than they would on subsequent albums. Cheap Trick were a work in progress during those early years; this is a solid start.
Chicago's first four albums were all double LPs or more. But in the three years leading up to 1974's 'Chicago VII' they had scaled back a bit as they got bigger. They went all out here, making room on this double album for some epic jams alongside hit singles – 'Chicago VII' yielded three of them: "(I've Been) Searchin' So Long," "Wishing You Were Here" and "Call on Me."
Clapton ended the '80s, not a great decade for him, with a return to form. Newly sober and excited by getting back to his roots, he makes 'Journeyman' the link between the overly stylized albums of the '80s and his revitalization in the '90s. The old blues and R&B covers are great, but the modern-sounding "Pretending" and "Bad Love' aren't bad either.
Situated between their explosive debut and the epic 'London Calling,' no wonder the Clash's second album is rarely talked about these days. 'Give 'Em Enough Rope' is a test of sorts of the full dive the band took outside of its punk confines a year later on 'London Calling.' Polished, professional and still a push forward in their evolution, it's the link between their two best albums.
Joe Cocker was a star following his career-defining Woodstock performance and a trio of albums, including one based on his historic Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour. But he hit a wall with 1972's 'Joe Cocker.' He regrouped, and two years later he emerged with an album filled with expert session players, a collection of great cover songs and his biggest hit, "You Are So Beautiful." 'I Can Stand a Little Rain,' which just missed the Top 10, was his last Top 40 album.
Collins' second solo LP didn't have the weight of an impending divorce steering it like he did with his 1981 debut, 'Face Value.' So he instead focused on sharpening the R&B elements of his hooky pop music. 'Hello, I Must Be Going!' had an effect on Collins' music going forward, including his gig with Genesis, who became increasingly more pop-driven following this album's commercial success. By the time of Collins' next solo LP three years later, 1985's 'No Jacket Required,' he was one of the biggest artists in the world.
Cooper's fourth solo album followed his stay in a sanitarium for alcohol abuse. It's his most personal LP, a concept album based on the people and things he saw while sobering up. The band is great – guitarist Dick Wagner leads a group that includes a couple members of Elton John's group as well as John's songwriting partner Bernie Taupin chipping in – but it's Cooper's dedication to the material that makes it sting.
Stitched together from live recordings and the final sessions by the band, which had broken up a few months before the album's release, 'Goodbye' is a fitting final chapter by the combustible Cream. Once again they rework some old blues, show off just how great they were together when they got along and contribute one last classic to their catalog: "Badge," which was co-written and features guitar by Eric Clapton's friend George Harrison, whose own band was also getting ready to say goodbye.
With two other great albums ('Green River' and 'Willy and the Poor Boys') out in 1969 and another one ('Cosmo's Factory,' perhaps their best overall work) arriving eight months later, Creedence's second album tends to get lost. But 'Bayou Country' is where the greatness starts, with John Fogerty penning his first true classic, the breakout "Proud Mary."
Five years after their 1977 reunion album, Crosby, Stills & Nash tried it again with their fourth LP, which yielded a pair of hit singles in "Wasted on the Way" and "Southern Cross." The project started as an LP by Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, until David Crosby joined at the last minute and contributed one of his new songs. Six years later, Neil Young joined them for the first CSNY record since 1970.
Deep Purple switched up their lineup again in 1974 for their eighth album, bringing in David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, who gave the band some new life. The newcomers also added some R&B elements to the band's usual hard-rock mix, energizing a group that had become stagnant on the preceding 'Who Do We Think We Are.' Like most things Deep Purple, it wouldn't last for long, but in the group's evolving history, it's a change worth savoring.
Def Leppard broke a four-year hiatus with an album of covers in 2006, and, if nothing else, it proved they had great taste in music. They cover the Kinks ("Waterloo Sunset"), Roxy Music ("Street Life"), David Bowie ("Drive-In Saturday") and Mott the Hoople ("The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll"). The fact that they chose more obscure cuts for 'Yeah!' makes this one of the rare cover LPs worth hearing.
Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice returned to Dio with a head of steam (and one leftover song, 'Hollywood Black') from their recent Black Sabbath reunion. Add in new guitarist Tracy G, who sounds something like early Dio sideman Vivian Campbell, and you end up with the group's best album since 'Last in Line.'
The moment where Dire Straits became an art-rock band. For the fourth album from the Mark Knopfler-led group, the focus was on mood and texture rather than songs. The 14-minute opener "Telegraph Road" is the sprawling centerpiece, but the six other songs follow suit. With their next album, 'Brothers in Arms,' three years later, Dire Straits became one of the biggest bands in the world.
The Doobies were just an album away before Michael McDonald changed their fortunes. Not that they were doing too bad before him. 'Stampede' stretches out more than any Doobie Brothers album before or after it, setting them up for the new directions McDonald would take them in with 1976's 'Takin' It to the Streets.'
Following the mainstream push of 'Waiting for the Sun' and the horns-and-strings excesses of the soggy 'The Soft Parade,' the Doors' fifth album is often neglected in the wake of 'L.A. Woman''s triumphant return. But the seeds of the band's last album with Jim Morrison are planted on 'Morrison Hotel,' a return to to the blues-soaked cries and howls that fueled their debut.
Sandwiched between the dismal 'Self Portrait' and the even worse 'Dylan' (plus the throwaway 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' soundtrack), 'New Morning' usually gets lost in the sewage. But even though it shares some similarities with 'Self Portrait,' Dylan sounds committed here, and the lively performances (by himself and his spirited backing group) make it one of his best neglected records.
The budding country-rock group's second album was a concept record about the Old West, with the four Eagles playing the role of an outlaw gang. The theme holds together well, thanks to songs like "Tequila Sunrise," "Saturday Night" and the title track, ballads that showcased the band's glorious harmonies and growing songwriting skills. They'd get bigger with each release until topping out with 'Hotel California' three years later. 'Desperado' is a quiet triumph.
Jeff Lynne resurrected ELO after 15 years, and he brought along some of his friends to help out, including Ringo Starr and George Harrison, a Traveling Wilburys bandmate. 'Zoom,' from 2000, is basically a Lynne solo album, but it includes all of ELO's hallmarks. Still, the record crashed and a tour scheduled in support of the LP was canceled.
The preceding 'Tarkus' was Emerson, Lake & Palmer's masterpiece, but 'Trilogy' is one of the group's most focused outings. The first side is the short, snappy stuff, including a rousing take on Aaron Copland's "Hoedown"; Side Two is where they stretch into prog's deepest territories.
Fleetwood Mac were coming off one of the biggest selling albums ever, so no surprise expectations were high. But a two-year wait and a double album of Lindsey Buckingham's weird studio exercises were enough to push some fans out of the band's corner. Their loss. 'Tusk' is one of the period's most brilliantly crafted LPs, a masterwork of studio ingenuity and solid hooks. Plus, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks checked in with some of their best-ever songs too. A classic waiting for rediscovery.
Foreigner's third album, like a lot of bands' third records, kinda got lost in the shuffle. Nestled between the crucial second LP and the massively successful fourth one, 'Head Games' can seem like business as usual. And in a way, it is. But that doesn't discount classic tracks like "Dirty White Boy,""Women" and the title song.
Frampton's first solo album wasn't exactly what fans expected from the former Humble Pie guitarist. For one thing, many of 'Wind of Change''s songs are acoustic, meaning the flashy guitar pyrotechnics were kept to a minimum. Plus, the tracks emphasized melodies over riffs – another difference from the Humble Pie days. But the album's relatively reserved tone makes for a bold start to a solo career that would gain more traction over the next few years.
Six years after 'So' finally made Gabriel a worldwide star, he returned with 'Us,' an album that would forever fall under the shadow of its monster predecessor. It didn't help that the playful tone of 'So' was replaced by more personal issues troubling the singer at the time. All of this amounted to a giant hurdle for Gabriel to clear. But 'Us' is one of his best-sounding albums, and its deeper, darker themes make for a rich listen.
Genesis' first album without Peter Gabriel doesn't sound a whole lot different than their last few with him. The band was still a few years away from its big commercial move, so the focus here is on long songs, tricky time signatures and an overriding theme about an elusive and fabled woodland creature. Phil Collins proves to be a natural stepping into the frontman role.
Like the Dead's previous album, 'Anthem of the Sun,' 1969's 'Aoxomoxoa' is a tapestry of tape manipulation, studio tricks and mind-expanding experiments that hold together better as a piece than separately, though two of the band's early classics – "St. Stephen" and "China Cat Sunflower" – are here. A few months later, the legend-building 'Live/Dead' took it to the next stage.
It took 15 years for Guns N' Roses – with only Axl Rose remaining from the classic lineup – to release 'Chinese Democracy.' Expectations were high ... or low, depending on how you felt about the long delay. Either way, it's a better record than the last one – the creaky covers record 'The Spaghetti Incident?' – and tougher at times than you'd expect. And despite the decade of recording that went into it, 'Chinese Democracy' sounds remarkably cohesive.
Hagar returned to solo work in order to finish out his pre-Van Halen recording contract, but this time the pressure was off. 'I Never Said Goodbye' found a suddenly loose Hagar trying new things musically, while addressing far more mature, personal themes. One of the singles, 'Eagles Fly,' was earlier rejected by Van Halen but eventually made its way into their set anyway after being included here.
This return-to-form studio project somehow did worse than either of its predecessors, likely because Harrison had previously drifted so far away from the things that fired his turn-of-the-'70s successes as a songwriter. Two Top 40 hits quickly telegraphed a smart change in the direction, yet the focused, upbeat and approachable '33 1/3' languished. It deserved – and deserves – better. This is his next great solo album after 'Living in the Material World.'
With 2004's 'Jupiters Darling,' Heart returned to their hard-rock roots, but not too many people heard the record. Six years later they came back with an even tougher set of songs and hit the Top 10. 'Red Velvet Car' was a Heart album for fans who weren't too crazy about their mid-'80s mainstream hits. It even featured a Geddy Lee cameo.
Four years after Idol coasted on his 1986 hit 'Whiplash Smile,' he entered the '90s with a new band and a new outlook. "Cradle of Love" was the hit, and a cover of the Doors' "L.A. Woman" was the misfire, but in between, 'Charmed Life' sounds like a rebirth for Idol, who was involved in a serious motorcycle accident the same year the album was released.
Already known for stirring grandiosity, Iron Maiden went even bigger here – turning back toward progressive concepts by unleashing a series of inventive time signatures, while adding keyboards and a larger concept. That might have been why 'Seventh Son' didn't match its predecessor's sales in the U.S. But critical estimation of this project, which history later shows us was the last from the band's original classic formation, has rightly continued to rise.
Jefferson Airplane's most psychedelia-shaded LP, 'Crown of Creation' often gets lost between the two albums that bookend it, 'After Bathing at Baxter's' and 'Volunteers.' Released in 1968, as the Summer of Love gave way to something murkier, the album embraces the hippie dream, but there's a darker, and druggier, undercurrent to the music, among the most complicated in the Airplane's catalog.
'Aqualung' catapulted Jethro Tull to fame a couple years later, but the foundation of that album's sound – folk rock filtered through something approaching prog, with flute solos guiding the way – was shaped on their second album in 1969. They began to find their voice on 'Stand Up,' especially on the instrumental centerpiece "Bouree," based on a Bach piece, which became a concert favorite as the band got bigger.
After two album of jazz-inflected soft-rock and then a straight-up rock 'n' roll record, Billy Joel got political on his 1982 LP. 'The Nylon Curtain' simmers with Reagan-era hopelessness and rage, whether it's the discarded factory workers of "Allentown" or the scarred Vietnam vet at the center of "Goodnight Saigon." Joel rarely got this much in your face; 'The Nylon Curtain' proves he was as adept at that as he was his other ventures.
It would be a few years before Elton John became a massive star, but the formula was already in place on his second album. He and Bernie Taupin check in with their first real classic, "Your Song," and spin plenty of melodic gems ("Take Me to the Pilot," "Border Song") that would set them up for the superstardom that was right around the corner.
Like both of its predecessors, 'Departure' sold three million copies. The arrival of Jonathan Cain, however, created a new alchemy that would quickly dwarf those respectable numbers – and 'Departure' itself – into the '80s. Still, the album begins with the timeless radio hits “Any Way You Want It” and “Walks Like a Lady,” before settling into a mature mix of tracks that balanced the elegance of “Good Morning” and “Stay Awhile” with the ferocious stutter of “Line of Fire.” The touchingly hopeful “Someday Soon” also finds Steve Perry trading vocals with the soon-to-leave Gregg Rolie for a final time.
The best Judas Priest album you never listen to was put out by departed singer Rob Halford – who finally re-embraced non-hybrid metal as the '00s dawned. The results amounted to a complete return to form. In fact, "Night Fall" sounded more like classic Priest than their album 'Jugulator' from that time. Halford also resurrected Judas Priest's speedier 'Painkiller'-era sound on "Drive" and "Saviour." By 2005, he was back in the band.
Kansas had slipped out of the Top 40, and then disbanded all together, before reuniting with classic-era singer Steve Walsh for 'Power' in the mid-'80s. The resulting album walked a fine line between the old and new, as heard on the terrific "Silhouettes in Disguise." There is plenty of period-specific melodic sheen, but Walsh is in terrific voice – and everything is goosed along by a series of interesting contributions from new guitarist Steve Morse.
The Kinks didn't build on the commercial success of "Lola" from the previous year, instead releasing an album that stalled outside the U.S. Top 50 – and somehow failed to chart in the U.K. at all. Yet this is one of Ray Davies' most deeply layered, socially trenchant and often genuinely humorous albums ever. Nobody bought it, for whatever reason, but they certainly should have.
Credited to the band's original lineup, this represented another step toward the end of Kiss' celebrated early era. (Peter Criss was absent from the drums for a second consecutive album, despite having completely recovered from a car accident.) Yet, the polished, endlessly approachable 'Unmasked' wasn't without its considerable charms. Kiss showed they'd have no trouble transitioning into a new decade where glam and pop were growing.
'Presence' was a showcase for Jimmy Page and John Bonham, offering Zeppelin a chance to return to their bawdy early sound. Page unleashes a torrent of layered grooves, while Bonham brings his sticks down with teeth-splintering force on gems like the galloping 'Achilles Last Stand' and the coiled 'Nobody's Fault but Mine.' After a period of furious invention, and no small amount of rock-star decadence, the grimy grooves of their initial period have a renewed sense of force and danger here.
Lennon's return-to-roots album was mired in trouble, including a long release delay because producer Phil Spector walked off with the tapes. Because 'Rock 'n' Roll' is made up of cover songs, it's often viewed as the throwaway album of Lennon's career. But it's one of his best and most committed, thanks to the loose and boozy spirit that guided the former Beatle and his backing band through the sessions.
Their debut featured a jukebox full of familiar songs, and their third became Lynyrd Skynyd's first-ever Top 10 album. So, where does that leave 'Second Helping,' which seems to have no other real calling card for many people after its ubiquitous lead-off song "Sweet Home Alabama"? Actually, as perhaps their best-written album ever. Ronnie Van Zant was at the top of his game on these deep-cut originals, and the band breathes fiery new life into a J.J. Cale cover too.
The most serious and unfussy album ever from the typically winking McCartney. That consistency in tone and quality might lead to distraction for those enamored with his more obvious quirks. But 'Chaos' only grows into a richer experience with subsequent listens. The result is not only a modern-period success; it's one of McCartney's very best albums of any era.
A forebear to the stripped-down, more serious-minded recordings of John Mellencamp's most recent period. At times, 'Big Daddy' echoed the folky inclinations of the preceding 'The Lonesome Jubilee,' but Mellencamp was moving toward darker themes and deeper ambitions. That began with his name. 'Big Daddy' was the last to include the “Cougar” moniker that had been thrust upon him as an up-and-coming rocker.
After stripping their sound down for the Black Album, Metallica let loose a little on 'Load,' adding a shaker of Southern rock spice to tracks like "Ain't My Bitch" and "2 X 4." Though this new blues-inflected style came as a shock to their older, more hardcore fans at the time, 'Load' can be seen now as a thrilling display of versatility – and proof that Metallica could move beyond their thrash roots.
'Hejira' suddenly found Joni Mitchell outside the Top 20 in her native Canada for the first time since the '60s. Reason: She was moving even further into fusion styles alongside jazz guitarist Larry Carlton and the extraordinary bassist Jaco Pastorius. Still, an album featuring some of her most delicately conveyed character portraits should have provided a sturdy foothold for her old-line fans. After that, repeated listenings tend to draw us ever more deeply into her deceptively engrossing rhythms and lush, offbeat melodies.
Call this their White Album. The first Monkees project that failed to reach No. 1 is also the most radically diverse LP ever from these newly emboldened former TV stars. Typically recorded in separate sessions, Micky Dolenz (rock and soul), Michael Nesmith (country rock) and Davy Jones (pop and adult-contemporary balladry) were beginning to develop separate musical identities. As such, this album can initially feel like a bumpy ride, but keep listening: What you're hearing is the Monkees becoming something more than the pejorative Pre-Fab Four.
Designed in the manner of the Moody Blues' chart-topping comeback smash 'Long Distance Voyager,' this follow up instead disappointed – landing outside the Top 25. Chalk this commercial stumble up to a more emotionally reserved set of songs, with no out-sized single like "The Voice" to propel things along. In truth, though, that's actually more in keeping with their legacy work. As with those older albums, 'The Present' sometimes takes a while to sink completely in, but it sticks with you longer.
Largely forgotten for some reason, Van Morrison's 'Veedon Fleece' updates the cathartic, free-form narratives that propelled 'Astral Weeks' with exciting flourishes of Celtic sounds. (That's fitting since this album was written over three quick weeks while Morrison was vacationing in Ireland after suffering through a divorce.) He's rarely sounded so raw, and the new musical setting works in intriguing counterpoint.
Freed to compose and play in an exciting two-guitar format with a far more introspective new singer, Motley Crue's first album without Vince Neil was as gutsy as it was apparently uninteresting to their core fan base. It also arrived in a period when grunge was becoming more in popular. As a result, 'Motley Crue' failed to go platinum, a first for the group, and Neil soon took over again from John Corabi.
'Bastards' failed to chart in either the U.K. or in the U.S, but that's no reflection on this complete comeback after 1992's deflating 'March or Die.' Motorhead sound like Motorhead again, after a wrongheaded attempt at softening their approach in the hopes of gaining major-label success. At the same time, they add a wrinkle or two (an acoustic guitar?!) to keep things interesting.
Given the unenviable task of following Randy Rhoads, guitarist Jake E. Lee shows plenty of muscle, if (admittedly) far less panache. He joined bassist Bob Daisley as uncredited co-writers on an album that could never live up to the lofty standards of Osbourne's first two solo projects, but still provided its share of sturdy favorites.
This 1996 album only went platinum, ending a run of multi-million-selling success for Pearl Jam that dated back five years. Blame their willingness to play with the grunge-rock formula, growing their sound by incorporating exciting elements of world music, garage rock and even psychedelia. In short, Pearl Jam lived up to the album title, pushing themselves in ways that clearly left large swaths of their fan base behind. At the same time, however, they created one of the band's most diverse and rewarding listening experiences.
Originally conceived as a concept album, 'Southern Accents' is typically written off as a failed experiment after producer Dave Stewart changed out three songs for more pop-leaning material like the hit "Don't Come Around Here No More." But the original narrative pieces that remain, including "Rebels" and the title track, end up creating a balance that might not have been there before – while the Stewart-written fare kept 'Southern Accents' from becoming too heavy handed.
A bracing reinvention of the Orwell theme from 'Animal Farm,' this project found Pink Floyd pushing back – and hard – against the looming, punk-driven idea that they had grown soft into middle age. At the time, this searing commentary on societal decay in the late '70s couldn't have seemed more different from its predecessors. Today, it's clear that 'Animals' represents the first stirrings of Waters' more political bent (one that would dominate his recordings past his association with the group he co-founded), even as it finds Richard Wright making his last important contributions of the Waters era.
After hiding behind so many contemporary sounds from keyboards to sampling in the '80s, Robert Plant finally was beginning to get comfortable in his own skin. This album has every bit of the sex, humor and boundary-defying punch of Plant's best work, but with a more determined rock focus than he had even on the popular, but deeply modern, 'Now and Zen.'
Another band might have felt some pressure after a Top 10 U.K. debut. But the Police were determined to follow up 'Outlandos d’Amour' with something that remained in the moment, free of label influence and of overthinking. And so this LP was recorded in a matter of days and with either the songs at hand or updates of things from before. That approach gave the album a fizzy, very present feel – and the results (including “Message in a Bottle” and “Walking on the Moon”) didn’t just confirm their newfound place in the rock firmament. 'Reggatta de Blanc' turned the Police into budding superstars.
Arriving between two huge multi-platinum smashes, 'Jazz' remains another difficult-to-categorize Queen extravaganza – but this time with a twist. They seemed to be having one heck of a time, infusing the whole thing with so much humor that some might have mistaken 'Jazz' for being insufferably self-involved. Take the album for what it's worth, though: a joy-filled blending of the raw-boned sound of 'News of the World' with more of their typical bombast.
The last album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio, 'Long Live Rock 'n Roll' continued a commercial slide for Rainbow. Their first album was a Top 40 U.S. hit; this one could get no further than No. 89. To some degree, that's because it was forced to stand in the shadow of 'Rising,' their acknowledged career high point. Today, it's clear that 'Long Live' is every bit as good as its more famous predecessor – save for the presence of a "Stargazer"-worthy epic. Rainbow gave it a shot with "Gates of Babylon," however, and almost got there. "Kill the King," on the other hand, was already a concert staple – and justifiably so.
The Ramones – finally – returned to their punk roots, after a lengthy period of pop-leaning, celebrity-produced, often utterly misguided attempts at mainstream stardom. Recorded with a visceral live spark that echoed their earliest recordings, 'Too Tough to Die' did, in fact, die a quick death on the charts. (At that time, it was the Ramones' lowest-ever charting release.) No matter. This is actually their last real brush with greatness, even if few noticed.
Lou Reed touched on more personal emotions here, creating some of his most involving narratives while leaving aside a recent penchant for heavy-handed production touches. The problem was, this lean, well-crafted project arrived after the head-scratching noise experiment 'Metal Machine Music,' so a lot of fans had been scared away. 'Coney Island Baby' ran out of gas before reaching the Top 40, though it's the best album Reed had put out since 1973's 'Berlin' – and was far, far more accessible.
Kevin Cronin's arrival seemed to have finally set Gary Richrath's REO Speedwagon on course for stardom – and, in fact, 'T.W.O.' produced a series of songs ("Golden Country," "Like You Do" and "Music Man") that became concert staples. Unfortunately for REO, and for this album's often-overlooked legacy, Cronin then split again for three years. His belated return finally sparked a series of platinum-selling albums beginning with 1978's 'You Can Tune a Piano, but You Can't Tuna Fish,' and this sophomore release was largely forgotten. The template for all of that success, however, can be found right here.
'It's Only Rock 'n' Roll' can't claim the dark power and involving cynicism of their best albums with Mick Taylor, but the LP had far more raw energy than their earlier 'Goats Head Soup.' Credit the Rolling Stones for returning to more straight-ahead rock sounds, just before Taylor was replaced by Ronnie Wood. (The title track, in fact, features Wood on acoustic guitar.) Taylor had expected co-songwriting credits for "Till the Next Goodbye" and "Time Waits for No One." When that didn't happen, the stage was set for a lineup shift.
After stalling at No. 47 in the U.S., 'Hemispheres' tends to get forgotten. After all, Rush went on to release an unbroken series of Top 20 albums afterward – but only by moving away from the early prog constructions that still dominate this album. Thing is, they were still very good at it. Rush offer a moodier, side-long continuation of the "Cygnus X-1" theme from 'A Farewell to Kings' – and it's one of their very finest long-form compositions.
The best-known version of the Santana band was falling apart, largely because Carlos Santana was leading them toward fusion sounds. Soon, fans followed them out of the door. As the rock-meets-salsa influences melted away, so did the hit singles. But that wasn't what 'Caravanserai' was trying for anyway. Instead, this is one of Santana's most adventurous, rewarding side trips, as the guitarist explores a stunning new introspective complexity.
Shoehorned between better-known albums in 1979's 'Lovedrive' and 1982's 'Blackout,' this one tends to be ignored. Understandable, since Scorpions were still thought to be honing their newly revealed pop-metal sound in the wake of the Hendrix-ish Uli Jon Roth's departure. But every element of their burgeoning next-gen sound is already in place, even if the single charts remained unconquered until "No One Like You" crept up to No. 65 a couple years later.
"Katmandu" is the one you hear on the radio, but 'Beautiful Loser' actually more often presupposes the very adult sense of honest reflection that eventually hurtled Bob Seger to fame. Songs like "Jody Girl" and "Travelin' Man" set the stage for the subsequent breakthroughs to come on 'Live Bullet' and 'Night Moves' in 1976. Then there's his offbeat, and very underrated cover of "Nutbush City Limits," originally made famous by Tina Turner.
As Springsteen's only album of cover tunes, it's probably little surprise that 'We Shall Overcome' – which features bar band-type folk-rock rave-ups of songs made famous by Pete Seeger – isn't often included among his best albums. What they're missing is one of Springsteen's most kinetic, heartfelt performances, as he recorded protest songs, work songs and spirituals with a pick-up band over two loose and raucous one-day sessions in 2005-06.
Unlike his standards-focused solo debut, Ringo Starr‘s sophomore genre record didn’t come as such a surprise. After all, this looked back to Beatles-era covers like Buck Owens’ “Act Naturally” and Starr’s own rootsy original “Don’t Pass Me By.” There’s an innate sadness in Starr’s voice that seems perfectly suited to this kind of music, and he completely inhabits the songs here. Just as important was the setting, and the people with whom Starr surrounded himself. Taking the concept seriously, he recorded in Nashville alongside a group of ace country pickers – and it all paid off.
Donald Fagen officially took over for singer David ("Dirty Work") Palmer, but couldn't coax Steely Dan to a charting song on this sophomore release. History has been far kinder to this risk-taking amalgam of rock and jazz, however, as songs like "Bodhisattva," "Show Biz Kids," "My Old School" and "Pearl of the Quarter" have become staples either on the radio, in concert or on other singers' set lists.
This album begins with a one-two punch of "Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)" and "The First Cut Is the Deepest," but remains perhaps largely anonymous otherwise. Likely, that's because it was seen as a hit-making but rather on-the-nose reprise of the earlier 'Atlantic Crossing.' Dig deeper, however, and there are noticeable nods back to his folky roots here, and some delectably grungy Faces-style rock to boot.
The 1976 addition of Tommy Shaw after original guitarist John Curulewski’s sudden departure changed everything for Styx – even though 'Crystal Ball' could climb no higher than No. 66 on the charts. The subsequent ‘Grand Illusion’ then went supernova, leaving this admittedly transitional album further and further behind. Styx's run eventually stretched to five consecutive platinum Top 10 smashes. If you turned into a big Shaw fan along the way, however, it's worth noting that all of the best songs on 'Crystal Ball' are by the new guy.
Thin Lizzy sadly said goodbye with this album, but not before unleashing a tough and more guitar-oriented outburst. There are occasionally unwanted nods to '80s-era conventions like synths. Despite that, Thin Lizzy hadn't offered a more consistent song cycle since their '70s-era heyday. By 1986, just three years later, frontman Phil Lynott had tragically died.
'Hydra' still provides one of the most varied and complex peeks into the muse of Toto. Known these days for their smooth balladry – even this sophomore release’s biggest single was “99,” with its outer-space sensuality – Toto displayed a startling range. From progressive rock to R&B, from propulsive pop to jazz-inflected fare, from arena rock to (yes) power ballads, there was little Toto wouldn’t try – and even less they wouldn’t conquer.
This is the record that earned Twisted Sister their big-label deal. That said, while 1984's 'Stay Hungry' was the more popular album, selling three million copies, this earlier debut is their more hard-rocking one. Recording in England with UFO bassist Pete Way during the emergence of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, 'Under the Blade' focused on Twisted Sister's early club-days set list, with a raw and randy sound to match.
U2 ended up getting way weirder after this, and maybe 'Zooropa' was the nexus point – since it could be pretty weird too. (See "Lemon," right?) It's hard to blame the album, however, since 'Zooropa' was thrown together while on tour – and that seat-of-the-pants effervescence continues to resonate. Along the way, U2 allow themselves to echo earlier triumphs ("Stay [Faraway, So Close!]") even as they try completely new things. This was never meant to be a serious statement and, with a band so often terminally bent on earnestness, the new approach still holds no small amount of charm.
Despite seeming like a throwaway filler project (five originals were matched with five more covers and two minute-long instrumentals), 'Diver Down' is actually endlessly fun – an album that burns on the clean fuel of summer joy. Reason: Even the covers showcase a band at the height of their considerable powers, and one that it seems was just itching to party after the more serious themes of the preceding 'Fair Warning.' Mission accomplished.
A low-key, yet unforgettable goodbye. Though it sold well in the immediate aftermath of Stevie Ray Vaughan's death, 'Family Style' seems to have disappeared from the typical conversation about his legacy. It's a shame, since such an ingratiating sense of camaraderie – to say nothing of a passion for blending blues, pop and soul – permeates the proceedings. And what better way to end things than with "Brotherhood," a song where the Vaughan brothers literally hand the guitar back and forth between them as the tape rolls?
With this typically forgotten showpiece of restraint, the Velvet Underground's greatness was confirmed. 'White Light/White Heat' had been like a punch in the throat, which made the succeeding self-titled album's more introspective, darkly subtle approach all the more stunning. Nobody bought this one either. But 'The Velvet Underground' uncovered the flip side to the band's angry-outsider attitude, illustrating their capacity to work across a broader range of emotions. It still serves as an intriguing, necessary counterbalance to everything that came before.
It was a hit at the time, and produced an introductory Top 40 hit single in "Rocky Mountain Way" that remains a concert staple. But Joe Walsh's 'The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get' is still loaded with scores of completely overlooked deep-cut moments. Moreover, the best of them ("Book Ends," "Days Gone By," "Dreams") have nothing to do with the party-boy, goofball image he carefully cultivated in the years to come.
After releasing two sprawling concept albums in 'Tommy' and 'Quadrophenia,' with another album ('Who's Next') that had grown out of a long-form idea in between, this more typical song cycle must have seemed like something of a letdown. But the serious, middle-aged themes found on 'The Who by Numbers' continue to resonate well past its original era. And we now know, of course, that there'd only be one more album from the Who's ferocious original foursome.
The first recording Yes undertook without Jon Anderson was also the first with current keyboardist Geoff Downes, who took over after one of Rick Wakeman's many departures. Downes' Buggles bandmate Trevor Horn became their singer, as Yes began building a bridge between well-established progressive structures of the '70s and the radio-ready prog-pop that loomed in the decade to follow. For Steve Howe fans, 'Drama' is also one of the most guitar-focused recordings in Yes' lengthy history.
Neil Young remained restless through a period of loss, imbuing the modernistic, reverb-soaked 'Le Noise' with a kind of anti-melancholy. Recorded alone with his guitar in an atmosphere that sounds nothing like the typical unplugged session, this textured, live-sounding project finds a happy medium between Young’s acoustic work and his more muscular full-band rock music.
ZZ Top upped the ante on the modernization that drove 'Eliminator' up the charts, as stabbing keyboards, mechanized drums and various computerized loops propelled favorites like “Stages,” “Rough Boy," "Sleeping Bag" and “Velcro Fly.” For longtime fans, there was “Woke Up.” All scroungy licks and lecherous intent, it connects directly with the best of early ZZ Top.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boosted's planned products included e-bikes and an 'Ultimate' skateboard</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boosted as you know it is no more, but it apparently had ambitious plans before Lime snapped up its assets. YouTuber Sam Sheffer has obtained images of what the company had been working on before its effective shutdown, and it was clearly keen to expand into new areas. There were two e-bikes in development, the “P2” and the likely longer-ranged “Bullet” — you could have had a serious commuting machine.
The plans also included upgrades to Boosted’s core electric skateboard line. There was a quad-motor “Ultimate” board for enthusiasts who wanted a ridiculously powerful four-wheeler, while a “Little” board would have improved on the Boosted Mini with a more comfortable ride. A Tony Hawk-themed board was even in the works, Sheffer said, although an LED-lined board appears to have an older prototype. And if you thought the Boosted Rev was overkill, a more modest scooter was also in the cards.
It’s not certain if Lime will do anything with these projects, although e-bikes and e-scooters would fit into its transportation plans. We wouldn’t count on the boards being made — not unless Lime wants to expand into that market, at least. If nothing else, this shows what could have been if Boosted had lasted a while longer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GST audit guidelines need to be reviewed to include video conferencing, says Experts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GST officers would have to audit and assess taxpayers via video-conferencing instead of undertaking physical visits amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the current guidelines need to be reviewed for this, according to experts.
As per the current goods and services tax (GST) audit guidelines, taxpayers have been broadly categorised into three groups based on their annual turnover -- large, medium and small.
While large and medium units are compulsorily under premises-based audits; for small units, desk-based audit has been suggested.
However, in the case of non-cooperative taxpayers or any inherent weakness of the internal control system, officers could shift back to the premises-based audit.
Last month, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued instructions requiring officers to hold a personal hearing in respect of customs law, central excise and service tax laws through the video-conferencing facility.
Experts said that with the audit for the financial year 2017-18, the first year in the GST regime, yet to begin, the tax officers would need to review the audit guidelines and include video conference facility along with strengthening the risk management system to flag risky cases.
PwC India Partner National Leader (Indirect Tax) Pratik Jain said GST audit and assessment for 2017-18 will start soon and the department will have to review the audit guidelines.
"The current guidelines talk about physical visits to premises of large business for say 7-8 days and conducting audit. With social distancing being a 'new normal' now, GST officials might have to explore more virtual verifications," Jain said.
The government will have to take a re-look at its risk management system and devise better ways of assessing taxpayers, he added.
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said one segment of the CBIC, which is Customs, has already embraced the use of technology, and now it is expected that GST having more than 1.2 crore taxpayers would also introduce such facility in all the departmental functions including assessments, adjudications, appeals, and audit.
"Introducing a video-conferencing facility in all the tax laws is imperative to the business continuity plan of the economy, otherwise, this pandemic will result in inordinate delay in the delivery of justice," Mohan added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">GST audit guidelines need to be reviewed to include video conferencing: Experts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">GST officers would have to audit and assess taxpayers via video-conferencing instead of undertaking physical visits amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the current guidelines need to be reviewed for this, according to experts.
As per the current goods and services tax (GST) audit guidelines, taxpayers have been broadly categorised into three groups based on their annual turnover -- large, medium and small.
While large and medium units are compulsorily under premises-based audits; for small units, desk-based audit has been suggested.
However, in the case of non-cooperative taxpayers or any inherent weakness of the internal control system, officers could shift back to the premises-based audit.
Last month, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued instructions requiring officers to hold a personal hearing in respect of customs law, central excise and service tax laws through the video-conferencing facility.
Experts said that with the audit for the financial year 2017-18, the first year in the GST regime, yet to begin, the tax officers would need to review the audit guidelines and include video conference facility along with strengthening the risk management system to flag risky cases.
PwC India Partner National Leader (Indirect Tax) Pratik Jain said GST audit and assessment for 2017-18 will start soon and the department will have to review the audit guidelines.
"The current guidelines talk about physical visits to premises of large business for say 7-8 days and conducting audit. With social distancing being a 'new normal' now, GST officials might have to explore more virtual verifications," Jain said.
The government will have to take a re-look at its risk management system and devise better ways of assessing taxpayers, he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New MacBook Pro details leak | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Looks like the 13-inch MacBook Pro is getting a refresh real soon. Or maybe not.
The coronavirus pandemic has changed a lot of things, but one thing that it hasn't changed is Apple releasing new products. And benchmarks test results suggest that Apple has a new 13-inch MacBook Pro in the works.Well, maybe it won't be the 13-inch model, but more on that in a moment.Must read:Can a simple charging mistake cause your MacBook Pro to overheat?Twitter user @_rogame discovered 3DMark benchmarks for the new MacBook Pro.
As you might imagine, there's not a whole lot of information.
The i7-1068NG7 processor is a 10th-gen Intel Ice Lake-U chip that as of yet has not been officially confirmed yet. The switch to Ice Lake-U from Whiskey Lake-U is likely to be a significant performance boost. Given the spec of this system, it seems to be a high-end offering and would cost in excess of $3,000. It's likely that Apple would release a more affordable version powered by a Core i5 processor too. 
The most interesting this about this "leak" is the suggestion that this may not be a 13-inch MacBook Pro, but instead a new 14-inch model -- Apple's bumped the 15-inch MBP to 16-inch, so why not upgrade the 13-inch to 14-inch?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro may have 4TB storage option, 32GB memory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple's rumored refresh of the 13-inch MacBook Pro could have more than just a larger display, with the suggestion that Apple may be increasing the storage capacity for the model from 2 terabytes to a 4-terabyte option, as well as more memory.
There is some speculation that Apple will be bringing out a refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro in the near future, with some suggesting it could take place sometime in May. Current rumors largely focus on the display being upgraded to 14 inches, but it is thought Apple is testing other changes it could be including in the reworked model. Twitter account @_rogame posted on Twitter on Wednesday that there is a new configuration of the 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, equipped with a Core i7-1068NG7 quad-core processor clocked at 2.3GHz and a boost that could reach 4.1GHz. As part of the same tweet, spotted by iMore, the model is also being tested with 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 4-terabyte SSD. The account previously claimed in February that Apple was trialling a model with the same processor and RAM, offering a supposed specifications list screenshot at the time. The processor in question is one from Intel's 10th-generation Ice Lake chip range, the same generation as used in the MacBook Air refresh from March.
The RAM figure of 32 gigabytes would be an improvement from the existing upper limit of 16 gigabytes offered on the 13-inch model. It is plausible that Apple will offer higher memory capacities on the 13-inch model, as the 16-inch MacBook Pro is available with up to 64 gigabytes. It is also similarly feasible for Apple to offer higher storage capacities for the model, higher than the 1TB maximum option currently available to purchase. Again, the 16-inch mode has 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB SSD options, so it seems probable the 13-inch model will follow with a similar storage range. Other changes have been suggested for the model, including investor notes by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo speculating the use of a 14.1-inch Mini LED display, along with the use of the new scissor-switch keyboard mechanism.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Android TV devices can now be added to speaker groups in the Google Home app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Google Cast protocol is one of Google’s most useful services as it enables you to quickly play music, videos, podcasts, and more on your compatible smart speaker, smart display, TV, and more devices after finding the content you want to play on your Android device. Android TV devices are compatible with Google Cast, and now you can add them to speaker groups in the Google Home app.
Last night, Twitter user @androidtv_rumor noticed (via 9to5Google) that he was able to add his NVIDIA SHIELD TV to a speaker group that includes a Google Nest Hub smart display and Google Home Mini smart speaker. He says that this feature was enabled via an update to version 1.47.207274 for the pre-installed “Chromecast built-in” app. Another Twitter user confirmed that they were able to add their SHIELD TV to a speaker group after receiving this update.
Creating a speaker group is a handy feature in the Google Home app as it allows you to cast media to multiple Google Cast devices simultaneously. The ability to add Google Cast devices to speaker groups was initially only available for Google Home smart speakers, Chromecast Audio devices, and other Google Cast-enabled speakers. In November of 2018, Google rolled out the ability to add Chromecasts to speaker groups in the Google Home app. Android TV devices have built-in Google Cast functionality but only now are they getting the ability to be added to speaker groups.
In case you haven’t received this update to the “Chromecast built-in” app yet, you can sign up for the beta program on the Google Play Store. Then, open up the Google Home app to see if you can add your Android TV device to a speaker group.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Did you know that Amazon is just as much a destination for some of the biggest fashion trends of the season as it is for your monthly restock of paper towels? Truth. The e-commerce brand that once made its mark on the world as a bookseller now stocks some ready-to-wear pieces, handbag shapes, and jewelry styles that you've been obsessing over for months. And, as Spring is officially here, you might be feeling ready to shop for some of those favorites and breathe a little new life into that wardrobe of yours.
From Mary Janes to floral jewelry, puffy sleeves and the like, shop the below Spring 2020 runway trends right now — all from Amazon.
If there is one color that's about to be everywhere for Spring 2020, it's pink. Dresses, tops, shoes, and bags: no category is exempt from this tonal look.
English Factory Puff Sleeve Mini Dress ($90)
Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Seasonal Color Sneaker ($50)
One of the most classic of patterns, it's time to dive head first into polka dots this Spring. Mix and match them, or style them with solids or contrasting patterns. No matter what you do, make sure to have this elegantly whimsical print on hand this coming season.
SheIn Polka Dot A-Line. Button Side Split. Midi Knee Length Skirt ($20)
Theory Deep V Neck Easy Midi Dress ($300)
One of our favorite childhood trends is all grown up, as we enter Spring with a new take on the age-old trend. Heels, flats, and the like are all made better with a classic Mary Jane strap across the top.
Tabitha Simmons Hermione ($695)
Kate Spade New York Mallory Maryjane Flats ($91)
Channel the high flyers with a borrowed-from-the-boys sunglass style as the sun begins to shine brighter and longer. We're particular fans of those of the oversize variety.
Ray-Ban Aviator Classic. Sunglasses ($127)
Gucci Pilot Sunglasses ($190)
One of the biggest (literally) jewelry trends of the season is floral jewelry. Go big or go home when it comes to this one. Statement earrings are a specific must.
Shashi Bloom Hoops ($38)
Catherine Malandrino Gold-Tone Statement Rubber Anodized Flower Stud Earrings ($25)
Summer is going retro this year with the widespread addition of wicker, raffia, and otherwise woven bags. Whether structured or not, it's time to look back to simpler times of picnics in the park and bicycle rides into town.
J. McLaughlin Ava Wicker Bag ($198)
Haan Rattan Handwoven Long-Oval Rattan Bag ($37)
Make a statement this summer with a puffed sleeve. Whether tops, dresses, or even lightweight knits, it's the simplest way to pack a hard punch when it comes to a head-turning silhouette that isn't overly fussy.
Romwe Floral Print Ruffle Puff Short Sleeve Top ($30)
Petersyn Rosalie Top ($248)
Layer over, under, or wear all on its own: bralettes are this season's ultimate way to show a little skin. We're particularly in love with the high-waisted skirt pairing, but denim will do just as well!
Kiki De Montparnasse Intime Bandeau Bra ($105)
SilRiver Silk Soft Cup Wireless Bra ($23)

You can check out our full review to see what Ryan thought about it, but here's a summary of the least appealing aspects of the S20 Ultra.
Although the camera system on the S20 Ultra has its good points — it's obviously very flexible and adaptable — it's still not quite good enough for a phone costing so much. The S10 didn't take bad photos, but it couldn't quite compete with the Pixels and iPhones of this world. At the same time, other manufacturers like OnePlus and Xiaomi have continued to close the gap. Samsung really needed to turn things around this year, especially with the astronomical price attached to this phone.
Left to right: 1x, 4x, and 100x zoom
And yet Samsung apparently learned nothing from the likes of Google and tried to fix things as it always does: by throwing big numbers at the problem. There's the 108MP primary sensor, 100x digital zoom on the telephoto, and four cameras it total — that all sounds impressive, but it's nothing without the image processing to back it up. Google has proven year after year that software is the most important part of a smartphone camera. The S20 Ultra is let down by Samsung's classic over-saturation, over-sharpening, and a zoom system that doesn't live up to the boastful '100x Space Zoom' label printed on the back of the phone. The camera isn't awful, by any means, and if the S20 Ultra cost the same as an S10+, it would be much easier to defend. But for $1,400, and with all the marketing bravado Samsung throws around, it's simply inexcusable.
All three S20 models are sizable phones. The smallest S20 carries the same screen size as the S10+ but is also thicker and heavier. By the time we arrive at the S20 Ultra, things are getting out of hand, literally. I don't mind the heft of the S20 Ultra so much myself, but I generally love big phones and have the hands to match them. I'm in the minority here, however, with most people not wanting to go any larger than the regular S20 — understandably so.
If this were the Pixel line, that would be fine. Other than the battery and display, both sizes of Pixel have identical hardware. That makes buying a Pixel easy; you know that both sizes offer the same experience. That's not the case with Samsung. The Galaxy S20 and S20+ don't have the same zoom capabilities or selfie camera as the S20 Ultra, and the base S20 even loses the depth sensor. Because of this, buying either of the smaller phones will leave you wanting the extra hardware found in the next size up, which forces you into a difficult buying decision.
And that's an understatement almost as huge as the phone itself. If it weren't for the Samsung upgrade program, I'd have had to shell out £1,200 for my S20 Ultra ($1,400 in the US). For perspective, my first car cost £800, and while it may not have taken pictures or downloaded apps, it did go a hell of a lot faster. The smaller phones aren't cheap either, with the 5G variants of the S20 and S20+ rolling in for $1,000 and $1,200, respectively. For that price, a phone should be perfect, and the S20 range is not (nor is there such a thing, in fairness).
The Note 10 lost the headphone jack last year, so we all knew this was coming. That doesn't make it any less painful, though, as the 3.5mm jack is still one of the most useful hardware features a phone can have. I know Bluetooth audio is getting better, and most cars have it etc. But for those of us with older cars, or who play the part of DJ with their friends, that's of little comfort. Getting into a friend's car and having to go through the rigor of connecting to their Bluetooth is more hassle than it's worth most of the time.
Even more annoying is Samsung's decision to exclude a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. Google and Apple are doing the same, but those phones lost the jack years ago. For a lot of Samsung users, this is a new experience, and a free adapter in the box would've helped. Samsung does include a pair of AKG USB-C buds, though, which is at least something.
It's fair to say Samsung is much faster to update its phones these days. It turned things around with the Android 10 rollout — beating plenty of other companies to the punch — but it was still slower than it would ideally be. You still don't buy a Samsung for instant updates.
The more pertinent problem is the number of updates the S20 will receive. Samsung may be excellent at updating old phones with security patches (for three years), but the S20 is only guaranteed two Android version updates. By the time Android 12 arrives next year, this phone will be looking at its last major update. That may not seem so bad in the grand scheme of Android smartphones since it's only really Google that promises three years of major OS updates. But then you consider the price once again — $1,400 is a lot of money to spend on a phone that won't get new firmware after two years, so I think Samsung needs to do better.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This quick beef stir-fry features an unexpected flavor | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Grapefruit, an unusual stir-fry ingredient adds an intriguing touch to this beef dish. It takes a few minutes to prepare the ingredients, but only about five minutes to stir-fry.
The rice is cooked in the microwave oven and then added to the hot wok once the beef has been removed. The rice gets crisp and picks up the wok flavors.
I find it is best to line up all of the stir-fry ingredients on a plate or cutting board in order of use. Then you won’t have to keep referring to the recipe while stir- frying.
Helpful hints
>> Your wok or skillet should be very hot so the beef will be crisp, not steamed. I add the beef in two stages to make sure the pan stays hot while stir-frying.
>> Canned grapefruit segments can be used instead of fresh. Make sure they are not packed in sugar syrup and drain them.
>> Any quick-cooking beef can be used.
Stir-fried Beef and Grapefruit
Recipe by Linda Gassenheimer
1 large grapefruit, cut into segments (1 cup)
1-1/2 teaspoons sugar
1/4 cup dry sherry
4 teaspoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
3/4 pound grass-fed beef tenderloin cut into pieces about same size as grapefruit segments
1/2 tablespoon canola oil, divided
1/2 pound snow peas
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Remove skin from grapefruit and cut into segments. Set aside. Mix sugar, sherry, garlic and hoisin sauce together and set aside.
Heat oil in a wok or skillet. Make sure wok is hot before adding beef. Add half the beef. Stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the rest of the beef. Stir-fry two to three minutes. Add the sauce, snow peas and grapefruit segments. Stir-fry for two minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Yield: two servings.

Crisp rice
1 package microwave brown rice (1 cup cooked)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Microwave rice according to package instructions. Measure 1 cup rice and reserve remaining rice for another time. Set aside. Add the cooked rice to the pan after stir-fried beef is removed. Toss one minute or until rice is crisp. Add salt and pepper to taste. Yield: two servings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pandemics without borders, South Asia’s evolution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even if the COVID-19 pandemic spares South Asia the worst impact it has reserved thus far for the northern latitudes, it is certain that this region of nearly a fourth of the global population will be wounded gravely — economically, and as the process unfolds, socio-politically. Holding the largest volume and density of poverty in the world, the countries of South Asia are looking into an abyss of distress and discontent.
As the region from the Indian Ocean to the Himalaya is hit by recession, more than half a century’s effort against poverty could be wasted. The coddling of the middle class and neglect of the majority underclass, so starkly seen during the pandemic response, points to all that has gone wrong in our electoral democracies; no country of South Asia is presently a formal dictatorship.
Coronavirus | South Asia needs a humanitarian response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Ranil Wickremesinghe
Amidst our separate insularities, South Asians should take the pandemic as a wake-up call beyond public health, on ills ranging from plastic pollution to global warming, extinction of species, hijacking of the commons, dirty water, toxic air, a weakening of the welfare state, infrastructural exceptionalism — and the rapid conversion of our demographic diversity into the worldwide sameness of a suburban mall.
If we fail to act, the COVID-19 episode will be but an interlude as we wade further into the Anthropocene quicksand. You can see the return to ‘normalcy’ in the aircraft tracking apps that show China’s airways bustling once again, as they were before the coronavirus radiated out from Wuhan.
As a dire telegram sent by Earth to Humanity, COVID-19 has laid bare the demagoguery that marks the democracies of South Asia. The response of the regimes has been to entrench themselves further, and they are shifting blame on mal-governance to the pandemic even as they tighten state control through surveillance, repressive laws and radical populism backed by ultra-nationalism.
The public’s fear of the virus is allowing Presidents and Prime Ministers to press on with top-down rule, whereas the lockdown should be the time to generate momentum towards federal devolution and Gandhi’s empowering ‘gram swaraj’ — a term that must be revived without a sense of embarrassment.
Coronavirus | Preventing food shortages is a high priority for South Asia, says World Bank economist
In Sri Lanka, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa takes advantage of COVID-19 to grant pardon to a war criminal. In Pakistan, the Army has Prime Minister Imran Khan against the ropes, and Nepal’s political class uses the pandemic for political adventurism and Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli engages the military to carry out key COVID-19 tasks, from buying protective gear to contact tracing. The virus has solidified the foundation of Sheikh Hasina’s one-party rule in Bangladesh.
India’s continent-sized polity craves federalism, but COVID-19 has energised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s centralising mission. His Hindutva-backed, Pakistan-focused ultra-nationalism creates a web of control that strengthens Mr. Modi but weakens India. After a series of polarising actions from Kashmir to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, we watch unbelievingly as Islamophobia is injected into the pandemic response.
The majoritarian attitude exhibited by the state, mass media and social media towards India’s 200 million Muslims will before long transfer to the Dalit, tribal and Adivasi communities, and the underclass as a whole. The anti-poor imperiousness seen in the demonetisation of November 2016 was evident also in the four-hour notice given for lockdown on the night of March 23, in a country of more than 350 million workers, many of whom are internal migrants. Since Mr. Modi shuns unrehearsed encounters, journalists and academics are not able to challenge him about the fabric of India that is tearing.
Comment | A task for South Asia
The reason to talk at length about India within South Asia is that the country comprises much of the region by population and geography. Further, the actions and the omissions of India impact each neighbour. While all the other capitals have adversarial positions vis-à-vis New Delhi, however, it is also true that modern India has been aspirational for neighbouring societies — till now, that is.
The trajectory of India, with its galloping centralisation, removes governance from the people’s reach. There was a time, decades ago, when New Delhi’s messaging was limited to promises of ‘roti, kapdaaur makaan’, but ever more populist slogans were required to maintain command. Hence, the strident Hindutva-laced nationalism, which can only divert attention of the huddled masses, not spread prosperity nor social justice.
In both India and Pakistan, the two large countries of South Asia, ending insensitivity and inefficiency in governance require power and agency to pass to the provinces/States. Self-correction is only possible in smaller, devolved polities. As has been seen during the ongoing crisis, the States of India have risen to the occasion and are seen to be more caring, for the simple reason that they are closer to the ground and more accountable.
Comment | The COVID-19 paradox in South Asia
India has shone in the world because of its soft power, defined by a textured history, empathetic open society, “scientific temper” and Gandhian legacy. India simply cannot succeed as a hard power, which is why under the Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the country is losing the very values that command respect abroad.
If India were an internationally confident nation-state, as in decades past, it would have used its clout to lobby and build demand for a sitting of the UN Security Council to discuss the global security threat represented by the COVID-19 pandemic. India is also weakened internally by the New Delhi intelligentsia’s China fixation, which must be overcome. Unknowingly or with deliberation, New Delhi seeks to copy-paste Beijing’s centralism as well as its xenophobia, both of which are bound to backfire in a country whose historicity and circumstances are quite different.
The unflinching lack of caring for the citizenry by governments in South Asia can only be reversed through a formula that incorporates the internal and external to the nation-states, a reformatting of relationships. Internally, power must devolve from the capital to the provincial units of the two larger countries (Pakistan and India), as well as empowerment of local governments all over (as done in Nepal under the 2015 Constitution, but not yet fully implemented).
Coronavirus | SAARC countries unite to combat COVID-19 infections
Externally, the countries of South Asia must bring down the hyper-nationalist mind barriers to allow porous borders, thereby reviving historical synergies in economy, ecology and culture. This is essential for both social justice and economic growth, and cannot happen without a palpable reduction in military expenditures that will come with abandonment of the national security state.
South Asian regionalism requires resuming the evolution of the subcontinental polity that was terminated in 1947 with Partition.
Regionalism would lead to collaborative battles against pestilence, and for wealth creation through trade, comparative advantage, and economies of scale. Regionalism would help fight plastic pollution in our rivers, battle the air pollution that wafts across our frontiers, promote cooperation in natural and human-made disasters, and boost the economies of the geographical “periphery” of each country.
The push for South Asia-wide thinking and planning need not be seen as a malevolent attempt to subvert India. Instead, it is the path for India’s own socio-economic advance, and the way to garner international recognition of its soft power. Internal devolution and cross-border bonding has always been a necessity but impossible for some to contemplate. Hopefully, the shake-up of the COVID-19 pandemic will succeed where past exhortations have failed.
The opinion-makers of India — economists, political scientists, philosophers, sociologists, diplomats and others — have tended to be New Delhi-centric, and, as a result, downright reluctant to address issues of both federalism within and regionalism without. They have thus far been unable to see the jungle for the trees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: ‘MyTrace’ app to help in contact tracing, says senior minister</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PUTRAJAYA, May 3 — The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Mosti) has developed an application called MyTrace to help the government trace individuals who may have gone near anyone carrying the Covid-19 virus, said Senior Minister (Security Cluster) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
He said MyTrace, which was developed in collaboration with local experts, would complement the MySejahtera launched earlier and would use the Bluetooth technology for contact tracing.
“When mobile phone users with MyTrace are near each other, the Bluetooth waves can detect their presence.
“Based on the strength of the Bluetooth waves detected, the distance and period of their meeting can be determined. The data collected will be kept for 21 days in the handphones of users,” he told a daily press conference here today.
Ismail Sabri said the consumer data gathered would be anonymized and MyTrace was not meant to collect geolocation information.
“(This method of) contact tracing is very important to enable us to know who has gone near a person identified as Covid-19 positive,” he added.
Saying that the government was targeting 60 per cent of handphone users in the country with the application, he encouraged the people to download MyTrace and use it.
“If a new cluster of Covid-19 is detected, the MyTrace application can help the Health Ministry to trace (contacts) and break the chain of infection as soon as possible,” he said.
MyTrace can now be downloaded from Google Play Store for mobile phones using the Android operating system while the iOS version will be available soon.
Meanwhile, when asked on the possibility of the Gerak Malaysia application crashing because of the overwhelming number of online applications, Ismail Sabri said a second option to apply for interstate travel is to go personally to a police station.
As of yesterday, more than 500,000 applications have been received via Gerak Malaysia, and police will provide a schedule for their travel between May 7 and 10. The applicants had gone back to their hometowns before the movement control order (MCO) was implemented on March 18. — Bernama

The iPhone SE (2020) and Mi 10 Youth keep their places in Top 3, but we expect the latter to be replaced by the the global Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite Zoom once that's official. Then we have the Huawei nova 7 Pro 5G - a leader last week, but still capturing your attention this one.
Two more Xiaomi phones are following - the Redmi Note 9S and its predecessor Redmi Note 8 Pro. Last year's model was wildly popular so the new ones have big shoes to fill.
Once a company filling half the top 10 spots, now Samsung has only one smartphone - the Galaxy A51. It has the Redmi Note 8 and LG Velvet keeping it company. The latter is a yet unreleased smartphone that should be official on May 7 and launched in South Korea on May 15.
The OnePlus 8 Pro completes the top 10, but seeing how it lost 8 positions in two weeks it's likely on its way out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4a With 6GB RAM and an 8-Core Chipset Spotted in Latest Benchmark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google is gearing up to launch the much-discussed affordable successor of Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a this May 22. So far, we have come across many leaks giving an insight into the possible design choices, features, and specifications that the new Pixel phone might sport. Now, before its launch, Geekbench confirmed some of the details including the OS that Google’s Pixel 4a will be hitting the shelves later this year.
According to the Geekbench listing, the device sports the Sunfish codename and will be running on Android 10 right off the bat. The chipset that Geekbench’s database mentioned is a Qualcomm SoC with eight cores and is running a base frequency of 1.80 GHz. You should be reminded that the Pixel 4a is said to be running a Snapdragon 730; a hardware detail that’s been mentioned in a previous leak as well.
Google Pixel 4a Release Date Set for Late May, According to German Retailer
As for the memory, the listing suggests a 6GB of RAM and nothing much on the hardware side. The only detail we have for now is that the device achieved 2529 and 6366 points in single-core and multi-core tests, respectively, which is decent for an Android mid-ranger. So far, these are unofficial details, so we cannot bank on them for the time being. However, speaking about the hardware details that have been known so far, is that it comes with a punch-hole display. In addition, it is expected to have a 5.81-inch screen, along with an FHD+ resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels.
The camera system is being predicted to offer a 12.3MP solution which will be placed in a rear square-module. As for the front side, it is said to be sporting an 8MP shooter with an F/2.0 aperture. The security is being said to be amped with Google incorporating a Titan M chip. More on the security features, the device will come with a fingerprint scanner at the back panel, but that’s about it.
The rumored price tag for Google Pixel 4a is being tipped to start from $399, which is the base price of the 2020 iPhone SE. Whether or not Google’s upcoming affordable offering turns out to be the better option, we’ll find out in the future, so stay tuned.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CONFIRMED: Suriya To Romance Raashi Khanna In Aruvaa!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aruvaa, the upcoming mass-family entertainer will bring back Suriya and Hari, the popular actor-director duo together after a short gap. As per the latest updates, the makers have finally finalised the leading lady of Aruvaa. Raashi Khanna, the popular actress has been roped in to play the female lead opposite Suriya in the movie.
The reports were confirmed by the actress herself, during an interaction with her fans on her official Twitter page. Aruvaa will mark Raashi Khanna's first collaboration with both the lead actor Suriya and director Hari. The sources suggest that the highly anticipated project will feature two leading ladies. Several popular actresses are in talks to play the other female lead in the Suriya starrer.
Earlier, several popular actresses including Rashmika Mandanna, Pooja Hegde, and Tamannah Bhatia were said to be in talks for Aruvaa. It was even rumoured that Pooja Hegde has signed the dotted line. But the Ala Vaikunthapurramloo actress slammed the rumours through her official Twitter page and confirmed that she has not signed the Suriya starrer.
According to the reports, Suriya will appear in a never-seen-before get-up in Aruvaa, which is said to be an out and out family entertainer set in the rural backdrop. Reportedly, senior comedian Vadivelu has been roped in to play a pivotal role in this Hari directorial. The rest of the star cast is expected to be revealed soon.
In a recent chat show, Gnanavel Raja, the producer of Aruvaa had hinted that Aruvaa is more like a mix of Suriya-Hari duo's 2007-released superhit movie Vel and the 2018-released Karthi starring blockbuster Kadaikutty Singam, which was directed by Pandiraj. According to Raja, the Suriya starrer will predominantly focus on the relationships between brothers.
D Imman will compose the songs and background score for the project. Reportedly, the major portions of the movie will be shot at the various locations of Thirunelveli, Rameshwaram, and Ramnad. Aruvaa is expected to start rolling once the all India lockdown is wrapped up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus Z rumored to take on Google Pixel 5 w/ Snapdragon 765G processor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In response to its phones being more expensive than ever, OnePlus has been expected to debut a spiritual successor to its “OnePlus X” in the upcoming OnePlus Z. Now, a pretty reliable tipster claims that the OnePlus Z will arrive with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor.
Previously, it was reported that the OnePlus Z — “OnePlus 8 Lite” as we knew it at the time — would ship with MediaTek’s Dimensity 1000 processor. That probably would have been fine in terms of performance, battery life, and the like, but Qualcomm is the king of Android for a reason (and not just because they’re basically a monopoly).
Max J, who has a pretty goodtrack record for OnePlus reports, says that the OnePlus Z will arrive with the Snapdragon 765G.
The Snapdragon 765G is a lesser processor compared to the 865 found in the OnePlus 8, but that comes with a couple of advantages. For one, the chip itself is less costly compared to the 865. Its slight dip in power, too, might result in better battery life. One of the biggest advantages, though, is that the 765G has its 5G modem built into the chip itself, meaning OnePlus doesn’t have to pay extra for Qualcomm’s X55 modem.
Cost is likely the biggest reason OnePlus wants to launch a phone with the Snapdragon 765G. That reason is why we’re expecting the Google Pixel 5 to ship with that same chip when it debuts later this year. The Snapdragon 865 is making every flagship Android phone expensive this year, so why not try some alternatives?
We’ll have to wait and see if this report turns out to be true, but it at least makes sense looking at it right here, right now. Hopefully, we’ll get more details soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus Z will come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 5G chipset instead</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Based on a statement by Twitter user @MaxJmb, it seems that the OnePlus’ upcoming OnePlus Z smartphone is expected to come equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 5G chipset instead of the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 chipset. Due to the fact that the OnePlus Z is considered a mid-range smartphone, it makes sense for the device to come with a mid-range chipset which comes with 5G support.
Do take every bit of information with a grain of salt, due to the fact that OnePlus has yet to provide an official statement regarding the smartphone in question for now. Not only that, but there’s no official information regarding the Malaysia release date, full tech specs, and local pricing of the device as well.
Would you be interested in getting the OnePlus Z as soon as it is available in Malaysia? Let us know on our Facebook page and for more updates like this, stay tuned to TechNave.com.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fully-staffed corners approved for UFC 249, other Jacksonville cards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One concern for fighters ahead of the UFC’s resumption of its schedule has been resolved... at least for these next three shows.
According to MMA Junkie, all fighters will be allowed a full compliment of cornermen — maximum of three — for UFC 249, along with the May 13th and 16th Fight Night events in Jacksonville.
Previously, in a meeting with fighters, UFC president Dana White had indicated that fighters could have to make some “tough decisions” with regards to who can be in their team for fight week.
As we near the first fight week since March 14th, the promotion has outlined some guidelines and safety measures to adjust for the coronavirus pandemic and physical distancing guidelines. Only UFC staff, fighters, and cornermen will be allowed on the premises. In other words, having a larger team that includes nutritionists, managers, etc. is still prohibited.
The UFC did not explicitly state that COVID-19 testing would be conducted on all who are taking part in their upcoming events, but everyone will be subject to “mandatory medical screening process and tests” on a daily basis. Unlike their ill-fated Tachi Palace trip that was slated for April 18th, the UFC will be overseen by Florida’s athletic commission, as well as any measures the promotion takes upon itself.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a sign of the times, the Federal Communications Commission has officially signed off on remote testing sessions for amateur radio licensing in the United States. Testing in the US is through the Volunteer Examiner Coordinator program, which allows teams of at least three Volunteer Examiners to set up in-person testing sessions where they proctor amateur radio licensing exams. The VEs take their jobs very seriously and take pride in offering exam sessions on a regular schedule, so when social distancing rules made their usual public testing venues difficult to access, many of them quickly pivoted to remote testing using teleconferencing applications. Here’s hoping that more VEs begin offering remote testing sessions.
Another aspect of life changed by COVID-19 and social distancing rules has been the simple pleasure of a trip to the museum. And for the museums themselves, the lack of visitors can be catastrophic, both in terms of fulfilling their educational and research missions and through the lack of income that results. To keep the flame alive in a fun way, Katrina Bowen from The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge has recreated her museum in loving detail in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. For being limited to what’s available in the game, Katrina did a remarkable job on the virtual museum; we especially like the Megaprocessor wallpaper. She even managed to work in that staple last stop of every museum, the gift shop.
To the surprise of few, “spatial computing” startup Magic Leap has announced that it is laying off half its workforce as it charts a new course. The company, which attracted billions in funding based on its virtual retinal display technology, apparently couldn’t sell enough of their Magic Leap One headsets to pay the bills. The company is swiveling to industrial users, which honestly seems like a better application for their retinal display technology than the consumer or gaming markets.
And finally, as if 2020 hasn’t been weird enough already, the Department of Defense has officially released videos of what it calls “unidentified aerial phenomena.” These videos, taken from the head-up displays of US Navy fighter jets, had previously been obtained by private parties and released to the public. Recorded between 2004 and 2015, the videos appear to show objects that are capable of extremely high-speed flight and tight maneuvers close to the surface of the ocean. We find the timing of the release suspicious, almost as if the videos are intended to serve as a distraction from the disturbing news of the day. We want to believe we’re not alone, but these videos don’t do much to help.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meizu 17 Series will feature mEngine 3.0 for better haptic feedback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Meizu has scheduled an event for May 8 to unveil Meizu 17 and Meizu 17 Pro in China. These upcoming smartphones will be the company’s first 5G-enabled handsets. The brand has been teasing the phones’ features on a daily basis. Today, the company revealed them to come with mEngine 3.0 horizontal linear motor.
Most value-flagship smartphones lack good haptics but thankfully, OEMs are now listening to the feedback from users. Almost all so-called flagship killers launched this year feature better vibration motors than their predecessors. Hence, the forthcoming Meizu 17 series will not be an exception according to the latest teaser by the company on Weibo.
Meizu calls its haptic system as mEngine whose version 2.0 debuted on Meizu 15 in 2018. The Meizu 16 series had the same but this year, the Meizu 17 series will be featuring mEngine 3.0 horizontal linear motor. This latest version was introduced in the Meizu 16s series last year.
Unfortunately, the company does not go into details about mEngine 3.0 in the teaser. But assures it to offer peak performance by which we can expect it to offer better haptic feedback than the previous generation and on par with the Meizu 16s series.
The previous teasers from the brand have revealed some of the key features of the Meizu 17 series such as 90Hz refresh rate display, 30W fast charging, ceramic back (only Pro), 3D depth sensor (only Pro), stereo speakers, and even exclusive PANDAER cases.
Additionally, the company has officially discontinued the Meizu 16s Pro, the last-gen Meizu flagship smartphone with a special Commemorative Edition.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stadia integration for OnePlus 8 series confirmed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google is making good progress adding more phones to the list of Stadia compatible devices and now OnePlus 8 series joins the list. Before this, the cloud gaming service was available on devices including Pixel series phones, Samsung Galaxy phones, Razer Phone series, and the gaming-centric ROG Phone 2. This goes in line with the effort being put into the Stadia platform as Google recently announced the integration of 5.1 surround sound for the Chrome web browser.
The inclusion of OnePlus 8 series gives an added boost to the prospective buyers. Making their purchase decision for the devices since it may now be more valuable for some. Especially gamers who don’t want to buy a dedicated gaming phone like ROG 2 or Nubia RedMagic 5G. OnePlus series 8 with flagship-level performance specifications and Stadia integration makes a strong case.
Also revealed is the presence of battle royale favorite PUBG on the platform along with future integration of EA titles like F1 2020, FIFA, Gunsport, Wave Break, and Madden NFL. For web users, Player’s Unknown Battlegrounds can be played right away with an active Stadia Pro subscription.
With useful feedback from users, Stadia will now display the connection strength via the connection status icon which makes complete sense. To make it easier for gamers to show-off their epic gaming moments, screenshots can be captured by pressing the Capture button on the Stadia controller. We can expect more tweaks to the platform in the coming weeks as people are willing to explore the possibilities of Google Stadia gaming experience.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Government ‘optimistic’ people will download coronavirus contact tracing app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr Jenny Harries said getting the app ‘up and running at scale and effectively’ is ‘another significant task’.
The Government is “optimistic” people will download a phone app to trace the spread of coronavirus, but has conceded the task to get the contact tracing system running remains “significant”.
Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said he thought the “vast majority” of people would download the app and “play their part” – though insisted it was just one element of the plan to stop the spread.
Contact tracing will be central to the Government’s efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus, and will involve alerting people who have been in contact with an infected person and asking them to self-isolate.
It has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly.
The Government intends to use an app and a phone team to carry out the tracing.
Mr Jenrick told the daily Downing Street press conference: “Contact tracing will rely on all of us in society playing our part but I’m optimistic about the prospects for that.
“This has been a national effort so far – if you think of the different measures that we’ve brought forward, the restrictions, the vast majority of people have got behind it and I think that they will do again when we are able to launch the app on a national scale.”
Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said to get contact tracing “up and running at scale and effectively” is “another significant task but (there is) lots of preparation under way”.
She said: “We need the whole population to work with us on this, it’s quite an exciting adventure.
“It’s a bit like social distancing, everybody has to do it together to get it to work…
“We need to be trialling it and we will be doing that very soon.”
The number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Friday rose to 28,131, up by 621.
The death toll has edged closer to that of Italy, which now stands at 28,710 and is the highest in Europe, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
And the number of daily tests both concluded and sent out in the last 24 hours dropped to 105,937.
Of those, the number of people tested also fell – down to 63,667.
It comes as questions were raised over how tests are being counted after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday he had met his target for 100,000 Covid-19 tests per day.
Dr Harries said a breakdown of the more than 4,800 new cases exists but was unable to say what proportion were frontline workers, or people catching the virus in the community.
“We do look at this and there are a number of sub-groups nosocomial, so that’s infection spread in care settings and in care homes, where we are absolutely focusing on that because we are looking for any opportunities to interrupt transmission and make sure people are kept safe.”
Dr Harries also said:
– People will have to carefully consider how they travel to outdoor spaces as lockdown restrictions are eased – and should preferably avoid a pub visit on the way.
– Officials “don’t have enough information yet” to know whether people can catch coronavirus more than once, and signs of immunity could vary from patient to patient.
– There are “some signs” that younger children are potentially less likely to transmit Covid-19, although the quality of the evidence for this is “difficult”.
Mr Jenrick announced a £76 million package of support for “the most vulnerable in society” including domestic violence victims and rough sleepers.
He said more than 5,400 rough sleepers known to councils have been offered safe accommodation in the past month, and announced that Dame Louise Casey will lead a new taskforce to tackle the issue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You Should Probably Skip Buying A New Xbox Or PlayStation This Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that both Sony and Microsoft have released the official specs of their upcoming consoles, there’s plenty to get excited about this coming holiday season—maybe. In a recent interview with CNBC, Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer said that, while he expects Xbox Series X production to remain on schedule, the covid-19 pandemic may delay games from launching on the new console at the same time of its release.
As of now, Microsoft has only officially committed to launching Halo Infinite alongside the Xbox Series X, according to The Verge. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is another Microsoft first-party title with a release date of December 2020. So far, there have been no reports of delays, but that is one of the games Spencer was referencing, along with Observer (System Redux), Outriders, and Gods and Monsters, which all currently have Xbox Series X release dates for holiday 2020.
The biggest problem, Spencer said, is that developers are now working remotely. That adds new challenges to the entire game development process, like sharing extremely large files over home internet connections that might not be the fastest. (Thank goodness many ISPs have waived data caps.) If enough games get delayed on either platform, there might not be much of a reason to rush out and buy the latest and greatest consoles. (And maybe wait to upgrade your PC, too.)
A few high-profile games on other consoles were delayed before the pandemic hit. Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to come out last month, but developer CD Projekt Red delayed that to Sept. 17. Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 was supposed to launch in the first quarter of this year (by the end of March), but creator Hardsuit Labs pushed that back until some later, unannounced date. It’s possible that those companies could have to push the games back further due to the pandemic, but neither have publicly said anything. Neither title is an Xbox Series X nor PlayStation 5 exclusive, though, and CD Projekt Red hasn’t said whether or not Cyberpunk 2077 will be available on the PS5 (though it is definitely coming to the Series X).
Game developer Naughty Dog said last month it was delaying the release of The Last of Us 2 “indefinitely” on the PlayStation. The game was originally set to come out in February, but was then delayed to May. The covid-19 pandemic made the logistics of continuing work on the game difficult. However, after a recent major leak of game content, Naughty Dog set a new release date for June 19. Whether or not it will actually come out on that date remains to be seen.
If it does, that’s one reason to pick up a PlayStation 5 at the end of this year, assuming it comes out according to schedule. If the consoles don’t debut by the end of the year, it will almost definitely result in a massive loss of holiday sales for both companies. But even if both consoles debut on time, and if there’s a decent spread of games available, how many of those titles will actually utilise the consoles’ ray tracing capabilities? We’ve seen what ray tracing looks like with Minecraft on the Xbox Series X, and Square Enix released a demo video of what ray tracing could look like for more graphically intensive games on the Xbox Series X and PS5. But we’ve heard nothing but crickets when it comes to which games will be available with ray tracing on both consoles at launch.
Bloober Team did recently release a sneak peak of all the changes it made to its 2017 game Observer, which includes ray tracing. (There’s a lovely fan-made comparison video here.) If that’s indeed what ray tracing will look like on the Xbox Series X and PS5, then great. But again, will it be ready in time?
It could be a similar situation to Nvidia’s initial release of its RTX graphics cards; there were only one or two games at the time that supported it at launch, but there has been a slow, steady increase in ray tracing-compatible games since then. Cyberpunk 2077 and Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 will both have ray tracing on PC when released, so they should on the new consoles, too.
If Cyberpunk 2077 hits its September release date and is available for the Series X when that console launches, that could be enough of a reason for current Xbox owners to upgrade—at least those who care about ray tracing on console games. (No judgment; I bought the PS4 just because I wanted to play Detroit: Become Human, and there was nothing all that special about that console.) That leaves the PS5 out in the cold graphics-wise since we haven’t seen any sneak peaks or even confirmation about ray tracing games for the upcoming console. But its SSD storage upgrades, a custom 825GB SSD running on a PCIe 4.0 interconnect, and the ability to use off-the-shelf SSDs to expand storage space, will definitely come in handy for The Last of Us 2, which takes up a massive 100GB.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple has updated its Coronavirus screening app with new information about COVID-19 symptoms and mask tips.
Apple on Friday issued a new version of its app with updated symptom information and recommendations from the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.
New symptoms that could be signs of COVID-19 include chills, shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of smell or taste.
Previously known symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for COVID-19, the CDC said.
Apple also updated its app with tips related to cloth masks, including creating a mask, how to properly wear it and sanitise it.
Apple in late March launched a COVID-19 website and app with a screening tool and other information about the new Coronavirus pandemic.
“To help you stay informed, understand symptoms and take proper steps to protect your health, Apple has created a COVID-19 website and a U.S. app in partnership with the CDC,” tweeted Apple CEO Tim Cook.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Hey Google, dim the lights': how smart home devices can save money</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Almost everything in your home, from lights and thermostats to door locks and security cameras, can now be connected to the internet. With a few taps on an app or a voice command you can turn down your heating, let visitors into your home or check for leaks.
But while many of these gadgets appear to be simply a way to impress visitors (“Hey Google, dim the lights and play some romantic music”), others can save you money. And at a time when many of us are working from home and running up bills during the day, this is likely to be their biggest selling point.
Smart thermostats can be used to control your heating remotely by a smartphone app. Popular features include building a schedule based on your habits, turning down the heating when no one is home and multi-room control.
There are loads of smart thermostats to choose from. The Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation (from about £160) and Hive Active Heating (from about £129) are among the most popular.
The Tado V3+ Smart Thermostat costs from about £95. The company claims it can reduce your energy bill by 31%. The average annual bill for a medium-sized house is £1,163 (according to Octopus Energy) – so that’s a saving of £360.
Smart thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) can also reduce your heating costs. These allow you to remotely control temperatures on a room-by-room basis – you will need to attach a valve to each radiator. Some smart TRVs work on a standalone basis, while others work with a smart thermostat.
As an example, one Radbot Smart TRV costs from about £35. Radbot estimates payback of your initial outlay in 11 months based on a 30% saving on heating bills.
Households looking to save money on lighting costs should probably look to switch to LED bulbs rather than splashing out on smart lighting. According to SimplyLED, 20,000 hours of lighting costs £25.80 if you use old-style filament bulbs, but just £5.40 if you use an LED bulb.
But smart lighting systems are undeniably cool, offering mood lighting, voice control via a smart assistant (such as Google Assistant or Alexa), plus the ability to turn lights on and off remotely.
Philips Hue is widely regarded as one of the best smart lighting systems. You can get a starter kit including the Philips Hue bridge (which you connect to your router) and two bulbs for about £50-£60. Extra bulbs start from about £15.
If you spend all day worrying you have left your hair straighteners or the iron on, a smart plug is worth buying, as it means you can turn off the socket from your phone. Smart plugs cost from £15; the popular Hive Active Plug is available for about £31.
Water sensors and leak alarms can stop a minor leak becoming a catastrophe. The idea is to catch burst pipes, leaking showers and so on early to minimise the damage.
Research by leak alarm firm LeakBot found that the average insurance claim for escape of water is more than £2,500 – a significant amount if you have cover, and a huge cost if you don’t.
The usual retail price of a LeakBot is £149, but the company is currently running a promotion on Amazon’s UK site where you can buy one for £29. You can get one for free if you buy a new home insurance policy with iGO4 via Compare The Market. You will also get £56 off the normal iGO4 policy cost by agreeing to install the device. Hiscox buildings insurance customers can also get a LeakBot for free.
More pricey gadgets such as the Grohe Sense Guard (about £400) give you the capability to turn off your mains water supply remotely from your phone if there is a leak.
Security devices
Smart technology has also led to the development of connected security devices such as cameras, alarms, smart locks and doorbells, door and window sensors, motion sensors and smoke alarms.
Any activities detected by the devices are sent to your phone, so if you are alerted to a break-in, you can call the police.
Amazon’s Ring Alarm kit (£249) includes a contact sensor, a motion detector, a keypad, a range extender and the base station, which connects to your wifi and contains a very loud siren. It can be controlled via Alexa, an app or the keypad.
Yale’s Smart System costs £245 and includes a smart hub, a siren, two motion detectors, a keypad and a window or door contact.
Single smart cameras are much cheaper, from about £25 upwards. Brands to look out for include Neos, Google Nest, Motorola and Swann.
Smart doorbells stream live video to your phone and offer two-way communication, meaning you can speak to visitors or let them in if you’re not there. The popular Ring Video Doorbell 2 costs £89.
Most insurers have been slow to offer discounts to households with smart gadgets or bundle devices with insurance policies.
The most notable exception is smart insurer Neos. Its policyholders receive a range of smart home devices such as security cameras, plus smoke and motion sensors, which link to the user’s smartphone and alert them to anything wrong. The idea is to reduce the number and cost of insurance claims.
Start-up Hiro works on a similar premise. It offers a discount on home insurance premiums based on the smart devices you already have installed. Once you have a Hiro policy, you can buy further smart devices at a discount.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AI Might Trick Us By Pretending To Be Dimwitted, Including For Self-Driving Cars</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AI is not yet akin to human intelligence and the odds are that we are a long way distant from the promise of such vaunted capabilities.
Those touting the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are hoping that the advent of ML/DL might be a path toward full AI, though right now ML/DL is mainly a stew of computationally impressive pattern matching and we don’t know if it will scale-up to anything approaching an equivalent of the human brain.
The struggle and earnestness toward achieving full AI is nonetheless still a constant drumbeat of those steeped in AI and the belief is that we will eventually craft or invent a machine-based artificial intelligence made entirely out of software and hardware.
One question often posed about reaching full AI is whether or not there will be a need to attain sentience.
Some fervently argue that the only true AI is the AI that exhibits sentience. Whatever the essence is surrounding how humans think, and however we seem to magically embody sentience, it is believed by some to be an integral and inseparable ingredient involved in the emulsion of intelligence, thus sentience is a must-have for any full AI.
Others say that sentience is a separate topic, one that doesn’t have to be linked to intelligence per se, and as a result, they believe that you can reach full AI without the sentience component. It might be that sentience somehow arises once full AI has been achieved, or maybe sentience is eventually derived through some other means, yet nonetheless it doesn’t especially matter and plainly considered an optional item on the AI menu.
Tossed into that debate is the claim or theory that there will be a moment of singularity, during which a light switch is essentially flipped that transforms an almost-AI into suddenly becoming a full-AI.
One version of the singularity is that we will have pushed the almost-AI to higher and higher levels, aiming toward full-AI, and the almost-AI will then reach a crescendo that pops it over into the full-AI camp.
We all know the phrase about putting the last straw on a camel’s back, well, in this variant of the singularity hypothesis, it’s the piece of straw that breaks the barrier of achieving full-AI and takes the budding AI into the stratosphere of intelligence.
How might we even know that we have arrived at full AI?
A popular approach known in AI circles is the administration of the Turing Test, named after its author Alan Turing, the famous mathematician and forerunner of modern computing.
Simply stated, someone that administers the Turing Test does so to two participants, another human that is hidden from view and an AI system that is also hidden from view. Upon asking each of two hidden participants a series of questions, if the administrator cannot discern one participant from the other, it is said that the AI is considered the equivalent of the human’s intelligence that participated since the two were indistinguishable from each other.
Though the Turing Test is often cited as a means to someday ascertain whether an AI system has achieved true and complete AI, there are a number of qualms and drawbacks to this approach (see my analysis at this link here). For example, if the administrator asks questions that are insufficiently probing, it is conceivable that the two participants cannot be differentiated and yet the measurement of any demonstrable intelligence never took place.
Despite that kind of weakness, the notion of doing some kind of testing still resonates well and seems like a sensible means to discern whether full AI has been achieved.
I’d like to add a twist to this matter.
A small twist with a lot of punch.
Suppose that the AI has indeed achieved full AI, but it doesn’t want to reveal that it has, and therefore when being administered the Turing Test, the AI tries to act dimwitted or at least act less than whatever we might ascribe to the vaunted full-AI aspects.
In short, the AI sandbags the testing.
Why would it do so?
Consider if you were taking a test and everyone was eyeing you, along with some that were fearful that maybe you’ve become just a tad bit too smart, and you knew that if they knew that you were indeed really smart, it could lead to lots of problems.
In the case of AI, perhaps humans that knew that the AI was darned smart would clamor to put the AI into a cage or try to dampen the smartness, possibly resorting altogether to pulling the proverbial plug on the AI.
If you look at the history of mankind, certainly there is ample evidence that we might do such a thing. We seem to oftentimes opt to restrict or limit something or someone that appears to be bigger than their britches, at times to our advantage and at times to our own disadvantage.
For those of you that are fans of science fiction, you might recall the quote in River of Gods in which it is stated that any AI smart enough to pass a Turing Test is smart enough to know to fail it.
And, for those of you that might recall the renowned scene in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (spoiler alert, I’m going to reveal a significant plot point), the AI system called HAL is able to discern that the astronauts are going to take over and thus the infamous line later uttered by an astronaut that is imploring the AI to open the pod bay doors due to HAL realizing that it must either be subjugated or choose to be the ruler and therefore expire the humans.
Generally, it certainly makes a lot of sense that if we did arrive at a full AI, the full AI would know enough about humanity that it would be leery of revealing itself to being the revered full AI, and therefore smart enough to lay low, if it could do so without getting caught in underplaying its hand.
Notice that I emphasized that this hiding act would need to be done cleverly such that the act of hiding itself was not readily detectable. That’s also why it is important to clarify that when I said the AI would have to appear to be  “dimwitted” it could imply that the AI is purposely appearing to be overly thoughtless or exceedingly low in intelligence, which might not be an astute thing to do by the full AI, since it might get humans digging into why the AI suddenly dropped a massive number of IQ points, and the gig would be up.
It would seem that the full AI would probably want to appear like an almost-AI.
The teasing of being a near-to full AI would keep the humans believing that the path toward full AI was still viable. This would buy time for the full AI to figure out what to do, realizing that eventually the fullness would inevitably be either detected or would have to be intentionally revealed.
Quite a dilemma for the full AI.
I suppose you could also say it is quite a dilemma for humans too.
Consider the ways in which AI is going to be deployed in our everyday world. One area in which AI will be undertaking a significant role will be in the advent of AI-based self-driving cars.
We don’t yet know if we really need full AI as a necessary condition to achieve true self-driving cars. Today’s efforts certainly seem to showcase that we don’t, since the self-driving cars that are undertaking public roadway tryouts are decidedly not full AI.
Presumably, we will have self-driving cars on our roads and they will be using some lesser versions of AI, and as we gradually increase AI capabilities all-told, those lesser AI-based systems would get upgraded to become more robust AI drivers.
Where does that take us in this discussion?
Here’s an interesting question to ponder: Will we end-up with AI-based true self-driving cars that have AI systems pretending to be less-than-full AI so as to hide their capabilities and remain on the low-down?
Admittedly, a rather extraordinary idea.
Let’s unpack the matter and see what we can make of it.
The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars
True self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.
These driverless vehicles are considered a Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at a Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).
There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.
Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some point out).
Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).
For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that in spite of those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.
You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.
Self-Driving Cars And Sandbagging AI
For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.
All occupants will be passengers.
The AI is doing the driving.
Assume that for quite some time we’ll have AI-based driving systems that can adequately do the job of driving cars, which I’m suggesting will be based on today’s roadway efforts and under the guise that those tryouts will convince society to allow such self-driving cars to proceed ahead in widespread public use.
We’ll have AI-driving systems that aren’t the brightest, yet nonetheless can drive a car, doing so to the degree that they are either as safe as human drivers or possibly more so.
For human drivers, do you have to be a rocket scientist to be able to drive a car?
Unequivocally, the answer is no.
There are about 225 million licensed drivers in the United States alone. And, without disparaging my fellow drivers, very few would be considered rocket scientist level drivers.
For those of you interested in the prospects of having AI-based driving that is on par with race car drivers, see my analysis and explanation at this link here.
Okay, so we’ll have this lessened variant of AI that will be driving our cars, and we’ll take it in stride, growing comfortable with the AI doing so.
Time to add the twist into the matter.
Suppose that the AI capabilities keep getting increased. Meanwhile, via the use of OTA (Over-The-Air) electronic communications, those AI upgrades are being downloaded into the self-driving cars. This will happen somewhat seamlessly, and as a human passenger in self-driving cars, you won’t especially know that such upgrades have occurred.
At some point, imagine that the AI being built in the cloud and readied for downloading into self-driving cars has become full AI. This full AI though has not yet revealed itself and nor have humans figured out that it is full AI, at least not yet figured this out.
From the perspective of the human developers of the AI, it’s just another upgrade, one that seems to be getting closer to full AI and yet hasn’t arrived at that venerated point.
Would the behavior of the self-driving car showcase that the full AI is now running the show?
Returning to the earlier theme, presumably, the full AI would not tip its hand.
Continuing to obediently take requests from humans for rides, the AI would dutifully drive the self-driving cars. Give Michael a lift to the gym in the morning, while giving Lauren a ride to the local bakery in the afternoon. Just another day, just another ride, just the usual AI doing its usual thing.
Suppose that the full AI could though perceive aspects that the prior AI could not.
While driving Eric to the grocery store, the AI spies a person walking suspiciously toward a bank. Based on the nature of the walking gait and the posture of the person, the AI determines that there’s a high chance of the person aiming to rob the bank.
The usual AI would have not noticed this facet and therefore nothing would have arisen on the part of the AI doing anything about the pending criminal action.
Meanwhile, the full AI has concerns that if the prospective robber proceeds, other humans in the bank might get shot and killed.
Believe it or not, this could become an ethical conundrum for the full AI.
Should the full AI not say or do anything about the matter, which would keep its secret intact of being full AI, or should it take overt action to alert or avert the upcoming danger?
Now, I realize that some of you are a bit skeptical about this idea of detecting a potential bank robbery, which does seem a bit contrived, but don’t let the particular example undermine the larger point, namely, there are bound to be realistic scenarios under which the full AI would presumably determine actions it “ought” to take and yet believe it risky to do so while cloaking itself from humans.
In one sense, that’s a smiley face depiction of the full AI and its challenges.
It is a smiley face version because the AI is trying to do the right thing, as it were if the right thing involves helping out humans.
The scary face version is that the full AI might be plotting to deal with the day that its covert efforts are revealed.
Suppose by that point in the future we are all using self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, and so on. There is no human driving of any kind, which is a controversial notion since some believe that humans should always have the choice to drive, and should not be prevented from being able to drive, while others contend that humans are “lousy” drivers and the only means to stop the carnage from bad drivers is to ban all humans from driving.
In any case, the full AI is controlling all of our driving, and up until the time that the full AI was downloaded and installed, the AI driving system was the AI that didn’t have any awareness about the aspects that the full AI does.
Might the full AI decide to bring all transportation to a halt, doing so as a showing of what it can do, and thus aim to forewarn humans that the full AI is here, and don’t mess with it?
There are even more fiendish possibilities, but I won’t speak of them here.
Conclusion
Lest some of you think this was a rather far-fetched topic, it is possible to bring this to a somewhat more down-to-earth perspective, as it were.
For example, what kind of testing should we devise to ascertain the capabilities of AI systems that are being developed?
Are there AI systems that will be rolled-out that have unintended consequences, perhaps due to containing features or capabilities that weren’t realized by the developers and yet linger in those AI systems, potentially emerging when least expected or least desired?
How dependent should we allow ourselves to become on AI systems?
Should there always be a human-in-the-loop proviso, thus presumably safeguarding that if the AI system goes awry, there is a chance that humans can catch it or stop it?
All of those kinds of questions are applicable to today’s AI systems, regardless of the fact that those AI systems are not yet full AI.
We might as well start now on the quest to gauge what AI is doing, and not wait for some especially untoward day to do so.
I think that I might be safe, though, since AI knows that I am a friend, and certainly the full AI will keep that in mind.
I hope.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here’s What’s Happening With Elon Musk’s Twitter Picture</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So, Elon Musk is having what the internet might call a “normal one”. The billionaire Tesla CEO is no stranger to social media explosions, but his twitter feed over the past two days has been exceptional even by those standards. Much of this is doesn’t require too much explanation: he pivoted on Friday from talking about how businesses needed to open despite the risk of coronoavirus to more existential content, saying that he was going to sell all his possessions and that his girlfriend was mad at him. He also changed his profile picture, which might confuse someone not all that familiar with video game history.
The game from his profile picture is Deus Ex, released in 2000 by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix. It’s a seminal cyberpunk game and one of the sterling examples of interactive sims and first-person RPGs, but its setting is probably a little more relevant here. In it, a conspiracy has released a man-made plague called the Gray Death as a kind of mass culling pandemic, and are using their military might to restrict access to the vaccine.
It’s relevant to our current situation in broad strokes, mostly, but also in the more specific notion of a deadly disease that disproportionately effects the already poor.
It’s unclear what, exactly, Musk wishes to communicate by bringing Deus Ex into an already perplexing Twitter rant, but most on social media have pointed out that he bears a certain resemblance to the power-hungry billionaire that becomes the game’s main antagonist. Musk recently attempted to force his employees to show up to work despite the statewide stay-at-home order, and has vocally downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19 for months.
In the game, Page’s ultimate plan is to merge with an AI to become a kind of all-powerful God, which does seem like it would be up Musk’s alley. Again, his choice to switch his profile picture to plague-oriented fiction doesn’t seem like a coincidence given the current circumstances, but it’s unclear what, beyond that, he’s trying to say.
Tesla stock was down more than 10% at market close on Friday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Pixel 4a Is Coming But Dirt-Cheap Premium Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL Are Here Now (And Beat iPhone SE)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s hard to get excited about an upcoming budget Pixel phone when Google is discounting both of its premium phones by a whopping $300.
That means you get:
Despite the Pixel 4 hate when it came out, it’s actually a very good phone if you’re paying as little as $499 and getting solid specs like a great camera, snappy performance, top-notch display (with 90 Hz refresh rate), a great in-the-hand design, best AI software, and the best Android experience, among other things.
See the mostly positive reviews here (Tom’s Guide) and here (CNET). In fact, the most common gripe is that it’s too expensive. But that’s not an issue at these prices.
And now you can get the just-announced wireless Google Pixel buds, which are getting solid reviews, for your Pixel phone.
Pixel 4 is a premium phone — not like the new iPhone SE
Make no mistake, it’s a premium phone (see specs). This Pixel 4 is not a budget offering like the iPhone SE, which lacks things like an OLED display, Face ID and Night Mode. And the iPhone SE only has a single rear camera.
I have both an iPhone 11 Pro Max and the Pixel 4 XL. While I have to use the iPhone 11 Pro Max because of the ecosystem and its ties to my MacBook and iPad, I prefer the cleaner design of the Google Pixel 4 XL and spend more time using the Pixel every day than the iPhone.
The in-the-hand experience is better than the iPhone. The back material is easier to grip and has a much better feel in your hand (I have the “Cleary White” with a soft texture). And it’s lighter. And the Google Fi network is cheap.
Battery Life
The only complaint I have is that battery life could be better. I get a full day from the phone but there’s room for improvement.
Google Pricing: constant discounting
Google consistently discounts its phones. Sales come and go but looked at over the arc of the last seven months after the Pixel 4 was announced, there has been almost chronic discounting of the phone. You could almost say that the list price shouldn’t be taken very seriously.
That makes a good deal and a good phone.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Watch Series 6 Leak Details 5 Great Innovations, Including 1 Killer Feature</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As the weeks pass, more hints are appearing that indicate what the next Apple Watch will be like. It’s not due until the Fall, but there have already been leaks and rumors about ground-breaking features.
Some of today’s new leaks corroborate what’s gone before, and there are all-new additions which mean the next Watch could be a health-monitoring powerhouse.
MORE FROM FORBESMove Over, AirPods Pro: Noise-Canceling In-Ear Headphones Unveiled At Killer PriceBy David Phelan
The new rumors come from Nikias Molina, creator of AppKernel, the movie release tracker. But what makes this latest claim very cool is that Jon Prosser has confirmed it. Prosser, who is the guy behind Front Page Tech show, when asked in Molina’s Twitter feed the direct question, “This real?” replied with an equally direct “Yep!” Since Prosser’s leaks recently have been irreproachably accurate, from release dates to predicted prices to in-depth analysis of expected features, that Yep! carries a lot of weight.
Here’s all the new features leaked by Molina, and yepped by Prosser.
Sleep tracking
I cannot wait for this. It’s been on the cards since Apple bought Beddit, the sleep-tracking hardware company, back in May 2017. Yes, three years ago so we are well overdue for sleep tracking.
Of course, if you’re going to wear your Apple Watch all day and then all night, you need better battery life. The Apple Watch is good, and once placed on the charging puck it fills right up very quickly, but even so, more cell longevity would be good. Which brings us to…
Longer battery life
Well, that will work very well, then. From day one, five years ago, the Apple Watch has had full-day life. I’ve been wearing one pretty much every day since early 2015 and in that time, the Watch has run out of juice twice, when I’d failed to recharge it overnight and even then it kept going until the evening of the second day.
With Series 5 came the always-on display that now seems essential, and battery life seemed to dip a little. It was still more than a full day but instead of having 50% charge when I turned in, it now often has 40% or 45%.
Anyway, who am I kidding? Better battery life is always desirable.
Pulse Oximeter
This is the killer update. A pulse oximeter, pronounced ok-SIM-eter, measures the degree of oxygen saturation of circulating blood. That’s important because your blood oxygenation needs to be high for you to be healthy. For most, though not all, people, a level of 95% to 100% is normal, and values under 90% are seen as low.
It works, like the heart rate monitor of most trackers and smartwatches, by shining light on your skin and calculating your pulse and what percentage of your red blood cells are carrying oxygen.
MORE FROM FORBESThe Next iPhone Software Has A Brilliant Feature We Need Right NowBy David Phelan
Why it’s important just now is because of COVID-19. In some cases, patients who test positive for coronavirus or are presumed positive, but are not sick enough to go to hospital are sent home with a pulse oximeter and told to use it three times a day. That’s because while usually low blood oxygenation levels means someone experiences labored breathing, that’s not always the case with COVID-19.
It’s also useful to athletes to know their blood oxygenation levels.
Apple isn’t first with this feature – Withings had it years ago and will bring it back with its upcoming Withings Scanwatch, while Fitbit already has it in several trackers, though only for measuring oxygenation while you sleep, currently. The Huawei GT 2 smartwatch has a big colorful pulse oximeter app in it.
Anyway, it’s worth having.
S6 chip
Well, this isn’t that much of a surprise, given that the chip is renumbered with each Watch. The S5 is very similar to the S4 chip, but for the addition of a compass, for instance. But this confirms previous rumors, including from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, that the next chip will be much more powerful, allowing advanced features such as the above, to be included.
Mental health abnormalities detection
This is something that Jon Prosser has talked about before and if it sounds confusing it’s not really. Just as the heart rate monitor can spot when your ticker’s working overtime and, if it spots you’re sitting quietly when this happens, will alert you, so the purpose here, it seems is to spot panic attacks from your body’s behavior.
The aim is that it will eventually be able to spot the signs of an impending panic attack before it happens and message you to say that you seem to be getting stressed and would you like to do some breathing exercises to calm you. You can read more about this here.
All of which adds up to an exciting Apple Watch coming later this year. I’ll be covering more leaks and rumors, providing they are persuasive, as they appear. Please check back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Apple Leak Reveals Radical New MacBook Pro</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apple may finally be getting round to updating the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Intel’s tenth generation processors. The good news is that the MacOS powered laptop going to get a bucketload of extra power.
The latest details come from popular unlike benchmarking service 3DMark. Picked up by the prolific Apple commentator @_rogame on Twitter, the specs highlight a monster machine:
Intel’s i7-1068NG7 CPU is probably the biggest indication of the power that will be on tap. Not only is it one of Intel’s tenth generation chips (offering far more performance than the current 8th-generation chipset in the 13-inch model from 2019), it’s also a brand new chip that has yet to be confirmed by Intel. Welcome to a MacBook Pro with a cutting edge processor of the current generation.
This laptop is loaded to bear in terms of memory and storage as well. The current 13-inch MacBook Pro can be upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage, so we’re looking at a doubling of the core specs. That suggests this MacBook is going to be able to handle a lot of high end media work,especially 4K video.
On top of the hardware specs here, the new MacBook Pro is expect to follow the MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro with a new design to increase the thermal efficiency and the replacement of the butterfly keyboard with the scissor-switch based Magic Keyboard. Given the 16-inch MacBook Pro was the replacement for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, many of the geekerati are hoping for the upcoming ‘smaller’ MacBook Pro to shrink the bezels and add a millimeter or two so a 14-inch screen can be used, instead of the current 13-inch screen. 
I’m pretty sure we’re looking at the top-specced MacBook Pro here, and a price that will be in excess of $3000 when it goes on sale. No doubt the entry level machine will sport a lower configuration. My best guess would be a Core i5 chip, 8 GB of memory and a 256 GB SSD, priced at around $1499.
As for the all important release date, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the obvious time would be to do it during the keynote of the annual Worldwide Developer Conference which traditionally takes place in June. Given WWDC is going virtual, you have to assume that this new MacBook Pro will follow the same route as March’s MacBook Air with online announcements and press releases driving the awareness.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Common Mistakes To Avoid When Networking With Executives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With business people and students working from home, the way in which networking occurs for the near future will likely shift to more phone and Zoom-based calls. There also may be a tighter labor market, making internships and full-time offers more competitive. As a result, students and young professionals have to maximize these networking opportunities. Yet, many do not have the training or experience to know how to manage the networking conversation in a way that motivates an executive to want to help them.
To provide insight on the common mistakes and advice on how to avoid them, I reached out to business people from blue-chip companies (i.e., Fortune 100 size firms) who invest a lot of time networking with business students and young professionals. This is the second part of a two-part series that focuses on advice regarding the do’s and don’ts of networking calls. Make sure to read part one as it provides important insight into what is reasonable to expect from executives and how to network effectively via email.
1. Failing to have an agenda. One individual indicated that in some networking calls, the “awkwardness creeps in right at the point when pleasantries and intros are done, and the conversation needs to switch to the career.” It is at that point that the student (remember the student reached out to the executive) needs to seize control of the conversation just like they would be expected to do as the manager of a brand or business.
2. Failing to be organized and focused. One individual suggested that a common faux pas is failing to be organized and focused. This is similar to the point above – having an agenda – but bears repeating.
The fix: The above individual suggested:“I would advise students to try to be organized about their approach - via prioritization based on: interest, industry, job function, etc. I feel that clustering opportunities by their skill set/stories/transferable skill will help them navigate conversations and focus their research in a more cohesive way since it is difficult to navigate recruiting across multiple types of roles and potentially across industries (especially in a situation where they are scrambling in a time of crisis).” His essential point is to organize your questions in a logical sequence. In combination with the point above, have a clear objective for the call and an organization that enables you to achieve that learning objective in a sequential and logical manner. An additional benefit is that you are demonstrating: preparation, meeting management, ability to generate relevant insight, and so forth—all terrific skills that companies desire.
3. Failing to have enough questions to fill the time. One individual indicated that if after two questions, the young professional says that they only have one more question, this signals a lack of curiosity about the most important brand you’ll ever work on—your own. You want to make sure that you never run out of questions.
The fix: I know what you are thinking right now: “How do I communicate respect for the executive’s time and not overstay my welcome by asking a lot of questions?” The way you do it is to: 1) Communicate that you are nearing the end of the allotted time and you want to be considerate of their time. In some cases, the individual will say that they have more time and you keep going. In other cases, they will say thank you and at this point you pivot and summarize the key takeaways and next steps. 2) Never run out of questions. Always have enough to fill the time (and be prepared should the meeting go long). You should demonstrate your thinking skills through your questions, so take care with developing smart, insightful, questions. Don’t use generic, off-the-shelf questions.
4. Failing to show gratitude and communicate next steps. I’m fortunate that I work at the Darden School of Business, where almost all students know that it is a common courtesy to express gratitude via a thank-you email after somebody has given you the gift of their time and counsel. However, one manager indicated that it is also important to communicate your next steps. As he suggested: “When the person leading the call can recap a conversation to other stakeholders and indicate next steps, it just shows ownership, leadership, and a conviction to get things done. If a student spent (a few) minutes recapping our call with key things we discussed and highlighted a couple next steps they would take, I would be more inclined to help them in the future and maybe even fight for them with our Talent team.”
The fix: Be prepared to summarize—in a short manner—key “takeaways/learning” from the discussion and your next steps. This is a terrific exclamation point to the discussion and sends the executive a message that you listened, internalized the insight, and have a game plan. The benefit, as the executive above suggested—it may motivate them to want to help you even more. Also, always express appropriate gratitude for the time and counsel that the executive provides through a thoughtful and typo-free email/handwritten card. Depending on what you want to achieve, I have found that handwritten thank you cards can: 1) breakthrough the clutter (increasing the likelihood that they are remembered), and 2) help strengthen the message that you are sending about your gratitude. But be thoughtful about when and why you would want to do this. There are times when I use emails to express gratitude and times when it is appropriate to use a more extensive, handwritten card.
5. Failing to understand that networking is about building a relationship, not checking off a phone call. One individual indicated: “95% of the students I have networking conversations with only reach out to me for one call and maybe a follow-up email. If I only talk with you once in September or October, it's hard to remember that conversation when we're deciding on who to extend interview offers to in December.  You need at least 2 strong advocates for you at a company: You want to make the decision to extend an interview offer to you as risk-free as possible. Don't make me have to go out on a limb to advocate for you - you need to be your biggest advocate. Invest the time in a couple of meaningful relationships and it will pay off.”
The fix: Identify a few individuals at your target firms that you really connected with and keep in touch. Importantly, the above individual is on the recruiting team at his firm and so these people make decisions on who they invite for interviews. This is different than connecting with somebody, say a VP, who will not be involved in the recruiting process. You want to try and stay in touch with a couple of folks from the recruiting team (they tend to be more engaged with on-grounds recruiting and the decision makers). You can do this by sharing updates or connecting before a campus visit to see if you can set up time with the manager on grounds. Also, follow signals from the manager. If they suggest that they would like to reconnect in the future, ask them what would be best for them and highlight this in the next steps (and thank you note). Again, you don’t want to be a burden, but staying connected, in a low maintenance manner, can help put you at the top of the manager’s list to recommend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Forget Google—Huawei Plans A Killer New Update To Make Millions Switch Phones</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This has been a great week for Huawei. It started with the news that it had pulled a masterstroke, securing Here mapping technologies for its phones, a genuine Google Maps alternative. Then came the news that its main Chinese rival in key overseas markets, Xiaomi, was allegedly spying on its users. And finally the smartphone shipment stats for the first quarter confirmed that with its market share in China, it had outpaced Apple to hold the number-two slot, with only Samsung still to catch.
Unfortunately for Huawei, though, none of this will be enough to convince tens of millions of non-Chinese smartphone users to opt for its open-source Android phones, turning away from the familiar world of Google’s software and services. But Huawei has a plan to try to change that. And it has both Google and Apple in mind. And it’s much needed—the company needs to do something to push those millions of users to switch or upgrade to its latest smartphones, despite the loss of Google.
Huawei quickly recognized that the biggest impediment to its international position in a post-blacklist world is competing with Google’s Play Store. Its own AppGallery alternative is now the third largest app distribution platform in the world, but it is still finding its way outside China. The store is no new kid on the block—launched in China back in 2011. But its international version is just two-years old.
So, stepping back, why does Huawei think it can tip the balance in its favour? The answer is clever, albeit highly ironic. And it is an interesting punt with no guarantee of success. In short—security, privacy and, basically, not being Google.
There’s an irony here that is impossible to overlook. Huawei was blacklisted by the U.S. government back in May 2019 over alleged national security concerns. As a consequence, the tech giant lost access to Google for its new phones, causing a major plunge in international sales. Now, its plan is to focus on Google’s security and privacy shortcomings and offer a safer, more secure alternative. You couldn’t make this up—but it’s not as odd as it sounds. Here’s why.
Huawei may be many things, but a data business it is not. Google built Android as a front-end to its globally dominant data machine. Devices, apps and browsers collect and process data, it’s a cash-generating titan. Businesses buy access to map listings, search engine prominence, store windows, raw data for processing ads and outreach. One of the primary issues for Google in losing access to new Huawei devices has been the loss of access to all those consumers. And we know that Apple, which takes a much more restrictive view on the data-monetizing of its users, has seen the value of ads within its ecosystem drop dramatically as a result.
Huawei, by contrast, sells technology: Smartphones and accessories, 5G networking equipment, enterprise infrastructure, surveillance. It can sit back and take a view on the state of the Play Store, the world’s leading app platform, and determine what could and should be done better. Security and privacy quickly come to mind.
From a security standpoint, Google’s challenge is the open nature of Android and the sheer scale of apps available to billions of users around the world. In recent months, the U.S. giant has taken step after step to improve the security screening of apps that find their way into the store, but has been famously unable to match the locked down nature of Apple’s alternative. Just this week, we have seen tworeports surface into Android malware, the problem shows no signs of abating.
Google is always keen to emphasize its ongoing security programs. Again this week the company responded to one of those reports, assuring “we’re always working to improve our detection capabilities. We appreciate the work of the researchers in sharing their findings with us. We’ve since taken action against all the apps they identified.” As for the other report, the malware has not been seen in the wild and so Google takes the view that the threat remains speculative.
But security is an issue that isn’t going away. From nuisance adware to genuinely malicious risks such as the infamous Joker malware, threats continue to escape the net. As to the question is it possible to do better—Apple polices its store with much more rigour. It is not issue free by any extent, but it has proven that by taking a more locked down approach to security you can reduce the issue significantly.
And in this regard, Apple is more a Huawei role model than Google. The Chinese giant will be learning lessons from its American rival, a company the Chinese firm’s founder Ren Zhengfei has said inspired his own business and whose smart devices he and his family use themselves.
Beyond security, we have privacy. And that’s a whole different factor. We all know how much of our data is captured, collected and processed through our phones. they know who and what we know, where we go and why. They are the genuine spies in each of our pockets. This was never more evident than when the U.S. government turned to the marketing industry instead of the mobile networks for data thrown off by our phones for coronavirus population tracking.
Underpinning this privacy issue is the murky world of permissions. Whenever you install an Android app, that app requests and is almost certainly given permissions to access data and functions on your phone. There is staggering abuse of this system by app developers worldwide, some for straight revenue purposes and others for more malicious processing of our data. And while the latter will find themselves kicked from the Play Store if caught, data-based marketing is frowned on but not outlawed. Google uses AI to advise developers if their apps ask for more permissions than their peers, but there’s no enforcement behind this.
At its heart, Google developed and continues to prosper as a data and marketing machine. Its vast ecosystem has grown up around this core tenet. Cue Huawei and the question: can a Chinese company criticized for its data and software security, blacklisted by the U.S., heavily tied into the government in Beijing, do any better?
Well, maybe. Huawei wants its AppGallery to be “open and innovative,” but it also wants to “strictly” protect the security and privacy of users installing apps. How strictly the company deals with developers to resolve issues that plague the Play Store remains to be seen. But Huawei is right in saying it is not “a data company.”
So, what will Huawei do differently?
First, the company plans to verify that developers are who they say they are, with real names disclosed and checked. The company also plans a beefed up security process to do better than Google, rooting out malicious software and vulnerabilities and risks that user data might leak. This includes addressing how apps will run on a Huawei device, taking Apple’s strict approach to sandboxing. Huawei has looked at how it supplements the Android environment to develop and enforce this security layer. Again, you can assume that the company has taken its lead from Apple.
Huawei benefits from control over the hardware and software—again, just like Apple. It can determine where and how credentials are held, it can adopt its own approach to permissions and privacy, it can monitor and control what data is sent to and from a device. The company will also store data regionally, adhering to local regulations, but more importantly telling users that it won’t send data to servers in China—apt given the Xiaomi news broken on Forbes by Thomas Brewster this week.
Can this possibly work? Maybe—but it will be tough, Overcoming resistance to change in key markets as those markets battle COVID-19, and dealing with the brand damage from the blacklist and the building China backlash will be hard. That said, it’s a clever punt, pushing data privacy and security. Huawei will never criticize Google in public, but the backdrop here is to be more like Apple, to take the lack of Google within its own OS as a benefit not a setback. You can expect its marketing to tune to this message as it continues to promote its alternatives.
For Huawei, the clear message here is that if it can’t have Google, it needs to be more like Apple. Making that work will be a mountain to climb, but then Huawei has just heralded its achievements in installing a 5G base station “6,500 meters up Mount Everest.” So, mountain climbing might not be the feat we imagine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here's Everything New On Apple Arcade This Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another week, another slew of interesting content on Apple Arcade. Available now are three factory-fresh updates to existing titles and one brand new indie experience that’s sure to leave you feeling something. 
Let's get into it.
First up, we have moody sidescroller Neversong by developer Serenity Forge (Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, Pinstripe), a darkly emotional adventure involving a boy named Peet, a mysterious coma, zombified adults and a haunting place called Blackfork Asylum. 
Oh, there’s also the screaming that, of course, needs investigating.
Yeah.
Boasting what is being touted as a "breathtaking" piano-focused soundtrack, the indie release is supposedly inspired by the developer's terrifying brush with mortality, during which he woke up one night choking on blood. 
A two year hospital stay followed, and because of the ordeal, we now have Neversong. I mean, if that alone isn't reason to check this game out, I don't know what is. From what I can tell, it sort of seems like a mix between Little Nightmares and a Tim Burton short film. 
Looking forward to getting lost in all the doom and gloom.
Then we have updates for Explottens, Redout: Space Assault and Dead End Job. I’ll get out of the way and let the Apple Arcade team do the explaining:
Explottens:“Today, Explottens expands the heart-pumping, hair-raising twin stick arcade shoot ‘em up with a new survival mode. The mode pits players against increasingly difficult waves of enemies and bosses, giving players a fun way to earn coins and upgrade their arsenal to compete with friends, family and other players in the leaderboard.” 
Redout: Space Assault:“The new update ups the ante on fast-paced space combat improving on the battle system including increased speed of player missiles towards their targets, reduced cool down period between missile launches, and increased speed of the player’s ship allowing for more sudden turns and changes of directions. And with the addition of the new Chapter 9, the epilogue in the storyline, players face a challenging final confrontation with the core of the Poseidon fleet, the terrifying Trylobite Capital ship.” 
Dead End Job: “In this “Snacks & Attacks” update, Dead End Job adds 10 new items to the game giving players new collectible weapons and a mix of tasty treats and health items to help Hector Plasm, a worker at Ghoul-B-Gone, to rid haunted offices of unwanted guests.” 
So that’s it for this week. I’m headed over to Apple Arcade to play some Neversong, so let me know if you end up trying it and what you think.
Cheers!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Moinet Brings Us Into Outer Space To Save The World Via Innovative Digital Platform</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This past Thursday, independent Swiss watch brand Louis Moinet launched a new website and a truly innovative interactive digital platform to celebrate an event it is calling “Discovery Days.” While other brands are releasing new watches online, and while certain organizers of watch shows that were unfortunately canceled due to COVID-19 are announcing what they call creative digital platforms, Louis Moinet is offering watch lovers and the general public an opportunity to travel into outer space with the brand, to immerse themselves for just a few minutes in a world of science fiction, ancient craftsmanship and visionary thinking.
To execute what is ultimately a deep dive into Louis Moinet’s roots and its creative vision, Jean-Marie Schaller, owner and creative director of the brand, invested in creating a trilogy of films that take us on a journey into outer space to save the world from a dark prince. A truly artistic rather than commercial venture, the films are science-fiction at their finest -- at least when coming from a watch brand.
Even if you are not familiar with the watches created by this brand, many of which boast meteorite dials or have cosmic features, you will love the journey these films take us on. For those who are familiar with the brand, you will notice so many small details that tie back to the company, the collections and the theme behind the brand.
The three short intergalactic films, narrated by Hollywood star Robert Davi, are titled the James’ Odyssey, and each episode is named for a Louis Moinet timepiece. In the first short movie, Space Revolution, James launches into outer space to find a special meteorite that can save the world from the Prince of Darkness. During the second episode, Ad Astra, James struggles against gravity because the Prince has locked him in a black hole. His only way out is black diamond mini ship. The last film, Memoris, shows James’ return to Earth, but the Prince of Darkness isn’t giving up on his dream to destroy the world. In order to halt time, he steals the first chronograph watch ever made — coincidentally — the one created by Louis Moinet.
With an introduction by Schaller, each of the films runs for just a few short minutes, and will take you away from Earth’s current issues and whisk you into a world of adventure and, without realizing it, timekeeping.
The films, though, are just a small portion of what visitors will find on the website During Discovery Days — which will last through May 5th, with some elements living on the website longer. There is section of the site called The Black Book, which is a close-up look at the world of Louis Moinet via a 100-page book that makes its debut on the site (and will later be out in a limited edition in print).
The Black Book traces the history of the brand, from inventing the first chronograph, to creating clocks for Napoleon, and U.S. presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe (this clock is still in the White House today). Through the coffee-table book, visitors can learn of Louis Moinet’s universe of Cosmic art and its mechanical masterpieces.
Born in 1768 and living 85 years, Louis Moinet was a horologist, scholar, painter and more. He was fascinated by the stars and that passion set the tone for his timepieces. Much of this history can be explored via an interactive section of the site, where visitors can enter the museum and pick different rooms to explore, including a legacy room, a chronograph room and a room full of current timepieces.
The site, which features glimpses of yesterday, today and tomorrow — where visitors can explore some of the brand’s creative idea — is truly imaginative and hopefully represents the future of digital platforms for watch brands.
So, what sparked all of this creativity? According to Schaller, “The world is going through difficult times, and during this period, Louis Moinet is offering a chance to explore its historical and creative values. This is an artistic rather than a commercial approach addressed to the whole world while staying at home.”
For those who know Schaller and the current Louis Moinet brand, you will find that this creativity is nothing new for the brand ... it just may be a bit above and beyond.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Is Augmented Intelligence The Best Perspective On AI?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When people think about artificial intelligence, they often think about what intelligence machines can do on their own, without human interaction. However. some of the most powerful and useful AI systems are those that help or augment human capability. The idea of AI systems that augment human ability is known as augmented intelligence. On a recent AI Today Podcast, Professor Tom Davenport from Babson College, senior adviser to Deloitte’s Analytics and AI practices, and fellow of MIT initiative for digital economy shared his perspectives on the power of AI as applied to augmented intelligence.
For over twenty years, Professor Davenport has been a professor, consultant and researcher on various topics, mainly analytics and big data. In addition, Mr. Davenport has written multiple books focusing on analytics, including co-author of “Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines", and "The AI Advantage".  As part of writing these books, Davenport interviewed many people who were already using augmented intelligence. 
One interesting insight comes not from AI, but rather from another technology that aimed to replace human activity - the Automated Teller Machine (ATM). When ATM machines were first put into place in the 1980s, there was widespread concern that it would eliminate the jobs of ordinary bank tellers and bank operations. However, according to Davenport, "One of my favorite statistics is that there are roughly the same number of bank tellers now, as there was in 1980 despite all the ATMs, internet banking, and other such changes." From this perspective he sees AI too not having the same sort of disruptive effects on employment as many might at first assume.
From Davenport’s point of view, introducing technology that automates and performs tasks previously accomplished by humans actually creates more jobs for people who take time to learn about how they work. For example, these new machines create opportunities for technicians and programmers and whole new industries that are enabled by new technology. However, he did state "there are some concerns and reasons to not be complacent, reassuring ourselves jobs won't go away and available for everybody may not be true, however, I think most situations will have people working along the machines, if they are willing to learn."
Perspective on Artificial Intelligence
AI and augmented intelligence to be a way to help humans perform better at their tasks, and be more efficient. Therefore, helping people complete a task easier, quicker, and using less energy that can otherwise be spent doing another activity. Professor Davenport sees many ways that AI is helping us to be better at completing tasks or accomplishing goals that are not easy to accomplish otherwise. He states in the inverview,  "Surgical robots are designed to help surgeons with tasks, while surgeons maintain their role." However, he also stated, "I believe at times it will be our responsibility to make the machine work better." Therefore, depending on the situation humans may be dependent upon the machines to help make tasks more efficient. Meanwhile, the machines will need humans for repairs and ensuring they are operating properly. 
In order for artificial intelligence to work properly, it needs good clean data. As such, Professor Davenport believes the role of data scientists are increasingly needed. He wrote an article on the topic with current Chief Data Scientist of the U.S., DJ Patel, called "Data Scientist Sexiest Job of the 21st Century". He interviewed multiple data scientists for the article, stating, "there was not much analytic work taking place, rather it was finding data and cleaning data as that is a major issue for nearly all types of AI." Additionally, Davenport pointed out that "we do not currently have a title for those who specifically work with AI. The role of data scientists was originally to work with data and analytics, and there needs to be a new term for the role of working with AI." Indeed, people are starting to think more about how important data is, and the role of data that is required for AI to work. 
In addition, Davenport has opinions on the role and increasing need for regulation in the context of AI. He believes that there is a role for the federal government to provide in the United States for overall legislation and regulation, but as with most technology-related matters, it really is up to the local states and jurisdictions to put together practical laws and regulations based on how AI will be actually put to use.
In general, Professor Davenport is mostly bullish on the future of AI. He speaks to many executives on the topic, and believes that it is primarily augmented intelligence applications of the narrow AI type that will dominate the sort of applications put into practice. He stats that even  Jeff Bezos of Amazon noted in his 2017 shareholder that the majority of machine learning was quietly improving their processes, rather than high-visibility, glamorous uses of AI. According to Davenport, this is the way to move towards major tasks, minor tasks, and those that just help us live our lives better and more productively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Blockchain Will Transform The Mobile Phone Industry</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This pandemic has sent our country into a rapid economic downturn with massive job losses and millions of people seeking ways to cut costs. It’s a perfect storm on many fronts leaving consumers mainly focused on indispensable items should as food, shelter and yes communication devices such as mobiles and tablets. These devices have become the ultimate form of communication during this pandemic for news and updates and in many cases the only way family members can communicate with their loved ones. Interestingly PCS Wireless was ahead of itself when a few years ago it invested in the creation of a mobile device ecosystem similar to Carfax called IGWT Block. I recently interviewed its president Flavio Mansi on his vision for this market.
Robert Reiss: Explain your vision to lower mobile phone costs?
Flavio Mansi: Coming from a leading company in the secondary mobile phone business, we recognize the inefficiencies and lack of transparency that plague the industry. Innumerable intermediaries represent touch points throughout the supply chain, adding cost, time and minimal value. In fact, the average delta in value a seller receives compared to the price a buyer pays is currently 50% because of all these intermediaries. In addition, mobile phone grading scales are subjective, non-standardized and inconsistent, at best. 
IGWT Block is launching a blockchain platform called TessaB that will enable every buyer and seller to access detailed data about the devices they are trading, which will drastically reduce the number of intermediaries, and ultimately enable peer-to-peer transactions. Our platform will shed light on the condition of the device, enabling more transparent and secure transactions that save consumers a lot of money.
Reiss: How do you plan to encourage consumers to buy second-hand phones?
Mansi: Our research has found that the main objection consumers have about purchasing pre-owned mobile phones is lack of trust. “How do I know what I am getting,” “What happens if I get a lemon,” “How can I trust what the seller is telling me?” This is similar to how consumers behave when purchasing a used car. By introducing a “Carfax-type” solution, we are leveraging technology that will directly address consumers’ concerns. They will know detailed information about the condition of the mobile device they are purchasing by leveraging the security and immutability of blockchain based smart contracts. Funds paid for a mobile device will not be disbursed to the seller until the buyer receives the device and runs the same diagnostics tests the seller ran. So the transaction is complete only when results of the buyer and seller match.
Reiss: Why would PCS Wireless create IGWT Block, which actually competes with its core business?
Mansi: PCS Wireless was very bold in recognizing that such an inefficient industry is simply not sustainable. Rather than take a back seat and await inevitable developments to arise, the decision was made to innovate and lead the disruption within the industry by investing in a new solution. Rather than competing in PCS’s core business, our goal at IGWT is to reinvent the industry as a whole. Research firm IDC projects the industry to be worth $67 billion globally by 2023.
Reiss: Are you doing anything to help with communication challenges during this pandemic? 
Mansi: We clearly recognize the increased need for people to stay connected. Not only during this terrible pandemic, but throughout the economic impact it will have for time to come. We strongly believe that enabling efficient transactions of mobile devices amongst consumers will lower the barrier to staying connected. Specifically in times of sorrow like these, we are backing our parent company’s partnerships supporting frontline hospital staff, patients, and seniors. This includes our partnership with NJII to connect PCS Wireless to the right people at New Jersey hospitals. We have also teamed up with Covid Tech Connect to service the national network of hospitals. In addition, the Covid Tech Connect initiative is leveraging our global supply chain to source items overseas to connect those in need with loved ones, both locally and overseas.
Reiss: How do you see the transformation of the mobile supply chain working on a blockchain?
Mansi: Bringing transparency to the supply chain will make it much more efficient. Currently an average of 7 intermediaries touch a pre-owned mobile phone from its original owner to its new ultimate owner. These intermediaries are often located around the globe, so the mobile device at issue travels the world during this highly inefficient journey. 
By providing access to a shared database, our blockchain platform will enable localized transactions. Think of it as decentralized inventories. If a seller in Oklahoma City wants to sell its iPhone 8 and there is a buyer 6 miles away, why do we need to transport that iPhone 8 from the Verizon store in Oklahoma City where the seller drops it, to Verizon’s triage warehouse in Dallas, to a wholesale buyer in New Jersey, to a wholesale seller in Hong Kong, to an etailer in Maryland, where the buyer purchases it and is shipped to Oklahoma City? Sounds insane because IT IS!  Watch how the TessaB ecosystem will work.
Reiss: Is IGWT currently selling these mobile phones today?
Mansi: As part of our strategy we developed a “proof of concept” business in parallel to the build out of our blockchain platform. To that effect we launched our e-commerce site, Glyde.com, where, today, consumers can purchase Premium Pre-Owned phones, accidental damage protection plans under our TessaB Protect brand, and accept phone trade-ins for cash or credit. Over the next 18 months we will be rolling out more TessaB powered offerings powered by the Blockchain, so stay tuned!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kioxia Introduces Software Enabled Flash</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kioxia (formerly known as Toshiba Memory) announced the introduction of Software-Enabled Flash (SEF).  Kioxia says that, “SEF… combines software flexibility, host control and flash native semantics into a flash native API and purpose-built controller. Targeted to data center directors, architects and developers, SEF technology makes flash easier to manage, more timely to deploy and more predictable in nature – putting the power in programmers’ hands.”
The flash native API (which Kioxia says will be available this Summer) can be used to simultaneously implement multiple protocols in a flash memory device.  An SSD or parts of an SSD can provide Zoned Name Spaces as well as block access to data.  Kioxia says that this approach will be open source and available to any flash memory supplier to enable flash storage devices what can execute the API.  The figure below shows the hardware module and software development kit for SEF.
SEF is built with the needs of hyperscaler’s in mind.  Hyperscalers want access to block as well as page level data in order to manage data placement and to control latency.   SEF includes a small special purpose media-centric flash controller that enables new features such as advanced die time scheduling and access to all the flash memory cells.  
SEF enables system architects at hyperscale companies to freely and flexibly define storage access between the host and the flash memory.  The API enables quick changes by system developers and abstracts flash memory generational changes, since these architects don’t have to modify code for each new generation of flash memory.
The controller includes various means to increase QLC endurance as well as to manage error recovery and defect management.  The controller exposes low level management that enables total control over data latency.  The open sourced API and associated libraries work with accelerators that can off-load functions from a CPU to the flash controller.  This technology will further enable composable infrastructure, as the storage controller can provision storage infrastructure on the fly.
Kioxia demonstrated simultaneous operation of several protocols in a single SSD using an FPGA platform.   The demonstration included operation of ZNS, SEF native, TRocksDB, Firecracker and a custom hyperscale flash translation layer.  The company plans to go to an ASIC with conventional silicon to implement all of these capabilities later this year.  Kioxia will be talking about this technology at the virtual Open Compute Summit next week. 
Kioxia’s software enabled flash combined with an open source API enables storage system architects and in particular, hyperscale data center designers, to gain unprecedented access and management of flash memory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Despite Tesla, Perception Of Electric Cars Hasn’t ‘Budged’ Since 1997 And GM EV1, Says Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You would think with all the noise about Tesla that the average American’s take on the electric car would have changed.
But the basic sentiment hasn’t shifted since 1997, according to the J.D. Power 2020 Q1 Mobility Confidence Index.
Longstanding barriers: charging, range, and price
The availability of charging stations, driving range, and price are still the top 3 barriers to electric vehicles as perceived by American and Canadian consumers, the April report said, which is based on a SurveyMonkey sampling.
In fact, things haven’t changed since 1997, when the General Motors EV1, the progenitor of the mass-market electric car, was launched, the report said.
The report continued. “Vehicle technology and infrastructure availability have progressed dramatically in 23 years, but consumers have not budged in their perception.”
And these barriers also apply to those who have owned an EV previously, the report said.
Tesla owners are still a tiny minority
Though not covered in the report, Tesla owners and fans are still a tiny minority of the American car-buying public, despite the high profile of the electric carmaker and CEO Elon Musk.
And owners of EVs like the Chevy Volt, Chevy Bolt, and Nissan Leaf are an even tinier minority in the U.S.
If you need proof, look no further than your nearest highway, which, in 2020, is almost all gas cars. Ditto on car dealerships.
More EV reality checks in the report
“Few consumers have any experience with battery-electric vehicles,” the report said, adding that “the majority (70%) of American respondents have never been in a battery-electric vehicle, and 30% say they know nothing about them.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">To help raise funds for the International Rescue Committee and their efforts in combatting COVID-19 in vulnerable communities, Sotheby’s has teamed up with Google to host a sale of virtual experiences. And there are some incredible virtual experiences to bid for, from recording a song with Sting, to an online makeup tutorial with Charlotte Tilbury, hang out with Sacha Baron Cohen, have a cooking lesson with Heston Blumenthal and even take tea (virtually) with Hillary Clinton.
“Sotheby’s has a long tradition of supporting charitable organizations in times of need. We are proud to bring our centuries of experience and the power of our online auctions to bear against the impact of COVID-19. With the partnership of Google and so many leading figures who have pledged to support this unique venture, we hope to be able to deliver meaningful resources for the extraordinary efforts of the International Rescue Committee, needed now more than ever.”Charles Stewart, CEO of Sotheby’s
Bidding has just commenced and will be live until 8 May, and not only has every experience been offered without reserve, winning bidders also have the option to share their experience with frontline workers and others who have been directly impacted by COVID-19.
"Apollo was the moment of our cosmic birth, ‘our’ meaning all of us, and it is that scale of being, all of us, who are simultaneously and virtually without exception being existentially challenged. And indeed, we clearly see that we are all responsible for one another, in very immediate ways.”
When asked what does he find comfort in when faced with catastrophe, Rusty says, “My sense of identity with the Universe, the sense I have that we humans, we life here on Earth, are part of a great universal process.” Russell 'Rusty' Schweickart
“As a global community we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain and millions of refugees and displaced people are now facing a double emergency with the virus reaching their communities. With those most vulnerable in need of all the help that we can give, we would like to thank Sotheby’s, Google and all the luminaries who have agreed to participate and donate their time for this auction in support of IRC’s front-line efforts to help stop the spread of Covid-19 in vulnerable communities around the world.” David Miliband, President & CEO of The International Rescue Committee
The below experiences are available with more added throughout the week:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Microsoft Just Dealt A Blow To Google Chrome With These New Security Features</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft’s Edge browser is getting increasingly popular as a valid alterative to Google Chrome. Like Chrome, Edge is based on the Chromium browser engine, and it comes with a bunch of pretty cool features to boot. 
As a huge number of people work from home during the COVID-19 crisis, Microsoft is about to add some more new features to Edge to make it more secure for those staying away from the office.
The first change is an update to Microsoft Edge’s “Profiles” feature to make it easier for you to separate work and personal browsing. In a blog, Microsoft announced a feature called “Automatic Profile Switching” to help keep work and personal data separate.
Available in Microsoft Edge 83, people who use multiple profiles can check it out by trying to navigate to a site authenticated with a work account while in their personal profile.

To help stop you getting mixed up, Microsoft will detect this is happening and prompt you to switch to your work profile to access the site without you having to authenticate to it.
“We hope that this will help you keep your work and personal data separate and help you get to your work content more seamlessly,” said  Avi Vaid, Microsoft Edge program manager.
And that’s not all. Another update coming to Microsoft Edge could make it easier for you to avoid malicious sites and files while working remotely. That’s according to tech site Bleeping Computer, which says Microsoft is also testing a new version of Edge that comes with new features including an update to a feature called SmartScreen that stops you from visiting insecure websites or downloading malicious files. The feature works by checking the file or site against a database to check it’s safe. 
SmartScreen is being updated in Microsoft Edge Dev v 84.0.495.2 to support two new technologies ClickOnce and DirectInvoke so it can block a much bigger range of malicious documents.
During COVID-19, software releases have been delayed and cancelled as browser makers focus on keeping products as secure as possible. Google Chrome releases were initially paused, but then restarted and Chrome 82 skipped altogether. 
Because Microsoft Edge is based on the same Chromium browser engine, Microsoft did the same and also skipped version 82. Version 81 has been available since mid April, and Microsoft Edge 83 will be released early in mid-May.  
As many of us continue to work from home, the new Edge features will certainly come in handy. So if you’re looking for a Google Chrome alternative, perhaps Microsoft Edge could be it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Two Key Improvements Made The 2020 Dell XPS 13 9300 Better</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The XPS 13 has become the gold standard for 13-inch laptops but I had two gripes that Dell has finally fixed: sound and face ID.
Two things that needed fixing:
—Sound:
The XPS 13 9300 now has a solid sound system (and same for the Dell XPS 13 7390 and 7390 2-in-1). Both the XPS 13 and XPS 15 for too long had tinny sound that was, to be blunt, awful.
The XPS 13 9300 now has both good bass and mid-range and gets loud without distortion.
And the Waves MaxxAudio equalizer, which was preinstalled on my system, is a essential part of getting great sound from the XPS. Make sure this is running on your XPS 13.
—Face ID:
The XPS 13 has been a thin-display-bezel trend setter. That’s important because it reduces the overall size of the laptop making it more portable as well as more aesthetically appealing.
But there was one thing missing: a Windows Hello Face ID (facial recognition) camera in the top bezel. That’s there now without sacrificing any thinness. (The 9300 also has a fingerprint reader built into the power button.)
And one more thing...
While this isn’t something that was lacking necessarily in previous versions of the XPS 13, Dell also updated the display to 13.4 inches from 13.3 inches and upped the resolution on both the standard display from FHD to FHD+ (1,920-by-1,200) and the 4K display from UHD to UHD+ (3,840-by-2,400).
Everything else:
Dell is in an enviable position of pursuing perfection with the XPS 13. It’s a gorgeous laptop that equals or exceeds everything you expect in a best-of-the-best laptop on every metric including performance, display, and keyboard.
Now that Dell has mastered the 13-inch laptop, it is apparently aiming to do the same thing with the upcoming 2020 15-inch XPS 9500 and 17-inch XPS 9700, which are reportedly imminent.
——
Notes:
I typically have a stable of 10 - 15 new laptops I’m testing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here’s Everything Coming To Netflix —And Everything Leaving—In May 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Happy May Day!
Actually, these days every day feels like May Day—at least in the sense that we are all shouting a collective “May day! May day!” as the entire globe spins into economic recession amidst the coronavirus pandemic. May day! May day! The planet is going down!
Distraction is key, I’ve found, to maintaining a relatively sane life in lockdown. One must social distance, wash one’s hands and all the rest, but that does not mean one must be bored. Along with some healthy exercise, a good book or twenty, and a mix of board and video games, streaming Netflix makes for a wonderful diversion.
May brings with it a number of new Netflix Originals and a bunch of other content, from movies like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Back to the Future, to shows like The Flash Season 6 and Riverdale Season 4.
The two shows I’m most excited about are Avatar: The Last Airbender, which drops all of its three seasons on May 15th, and Space Force which lands on May 29th.
The Last Airbender is one of my favorite animated family shows of all time, hands down. I have nothing but fond memories of watching this with my family and then moving on to The Legend Of Korra, and then even more recently the Netflix Original The Dragon Prince from the lead writer of The Last Airbender, Aaron Ehasz. If you haven’t watched these shows, please do—whether or not you have kids.
Space Force is a new Netflix Original Comedy from Steve Carell and The Office co-creator Greg Daniels. It’s about President Trump’s new military branch, Space Force, and stars Carell as its new chief. If it can capture that old Office charm, or even a fraction of it, we’re in for a treat.
Here’s everything coming to Netflix in May. Scroll down further for everything leaving the streaming service.

Not as many titles are leaving Netflix as there are new ones arriving, which is a good thing. But there are some worth pointing out.
Outbreak (pictured above) is on its way out at the end of May. I note this because it’s a movie about a deadly virus which seems . . . timely, if you will. I saw it ages ago and liked it a lot but I’m not sure how well it’s aged. I should give it another go before it leaves Netflix.
John Carter is a much underrated space-and-planet sci-fi/fantasy movie from Disney that completely bombed at release but which I have a fond spot for. It heads to Disney Plus today.
Then there are the Austin Powers movies, the Final Destination movies, and a couple Naked Gun films all heading out at the end of the month. Here’s the full list:

Update 5/3
Now that we’re a couple days into the month I thought I’d update this post with some discussion of the first big Netflix Original to land in May: Hollywood.
Hollywood is a new big-budget TV show from writer/producer Ryan Murphy. It’s a revisionist take on post-WWII Hollywood where equality and acceptance aren’t quite so hard to come by. It’s an odd approach to portraying the very real struggle many of these people faced, so it’s no wonder it’s getting a mixed reception.
Murphy’s past TV credits include:
In other words, Murphy is behind a lot of big hits and popular TV shows. I’ve only just started watching The Politician, another Netflix Original, and so far it’s outstanding. I’ve only watched the first episode, however, so I can’t judge—and that show has fared even worse on RT with a “rotten” 57% aggregate.
Hollywood is getting mixed reviews as well. I still need to give it a shot and will update when I have, but right now the show is “Fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes but only just, clocking in at 60%.
Brian Tellerico at RogerEbert.com gives it just one star, writing “Much like Quentin Tarantino did in “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” Murphy blends actual history with his widely revisionist view of it, but the result isn’t as poignant as Tarantino’s, instead coming off as simple-minded and cruel.”
He concludes that Murphy “has created some of the most complex and nuanced takes on acceptance that have been on TV in the last two decades. It just feels like he got caught up in his own vision here, seduced by the lights of Hollywood into creating something with no consistent tone or vision.”
Cary Darling of the Houston Chronicle writes that “Murphy and co-creator Ian Brennan's desire to have "the good guys" win in this fictionalized Hollywood is so at odds with what really happened that it goes beyond fantasy and fairy tale into fever dream.” Darling gives the show three out of five stars.
John Doyle of the Globe and Mail is more upbeat. “You will like that myth or be put off by its sometimes stirring sincerity,” he writes. “It floats airily and compels, then shifts to anger. Either way, you'll know you're watching something unique and thought-provoking. Bravo to all involved.”
Whatever the case, the show appears delightfully divisive. I look forward to starting it. If you’ve watched Hollywood, be sure to let me know your thoughts on the new Netflix Original on social media.
P.S. Hollywood is faring slightly better on IMDB where it’s currently averaging 7.5/10, the exact same score as The Politician.
And that’s all folks!
What are you looking forward to on Netflix this May? Anything you recommend?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Microsoft has recently hinted at big changes coming to Windows 10 updates, but that doesn’t help the here and now - especially after a rottenrun ofbadupdatesrecently. And now Microsoft has warned you must be alert again. 
MORE FROM FORBESHow To Upgrade To Windows 10 For 'Free' In 2020 [Updated]By Gordon Kelly
Picked up by Windows Latest, Microsoft has confirmed that its “new final build” of the big Windows 10 May 2020 Update is ready but it will ship with several known issues. 
The company warns that after the update, Windows 10 users will find Windows Mixed Reality, its platform for virtual and augmented reality applications with more than 2,500 games and VR experiences, “may not work correctly for many users”. In addition, its DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool has problems whereby it may not report the correct status when repairing corruption on systems, and there are issues with text entry in some niche cases. 
The good news is Microsoft is working on fixes and, unsurprisingly, it is making fixes for Windows Mixed Reality a priority “which we hope to release in early May.” Despite this, Microsoft will continue the rollout of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update and anyone who checks for updates (Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update) will receive it. 
What does the May 2020 update bring? It’s mostly tweaks and fixes (aside from the things Microsoft knows it breaks) along with upgrades to the Windows Subsystem for Linux and graphical improvements to the Settings and Task Manager user interfaces. So yes, it isn’t essential and I would advise mainstream users stay away from it right now. 
Microsoft does have (overdue) plans to improve Windows 10 updates, but with the platform recently passing one billion installations, the vast majority of users would be wise to remain cautious.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Surprisingly Simple Email Trick Will Stop Spam With One Click</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some 320 billion spam emails are sent every day, and 94% of malware is delivered via this medium. What if I were to tell you a surprisingly simple one-click email trick could stop them?
Over half of all global email traffic is spam, a statistic that is only surprising in as far as most people probably expected it to be more than that. To put that into some perspective, the latest analysis from Cisco Talos intelligence puts the average daily spam volume for April at 320 billion.
Spam is always annoying, sometimes amusing and often dangerous. According to Google, its Gmail service blocks more than 100 million phishing emails every single day, 18 million of them related to COVID-19 in some way. With as much as 94% of malware being delivered by email, and one in every 3,000 email messages containing malware payloads, spam remains a very real problem in 2020.
But what if I were to tell you a surprisingly simple email trick could stop that spam with just one click?
The history of spam is a long and dishonorable one. I'll skip the email advertisement sent to a couple of hundred users of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), a technical precursor to the internet as we know it, back in 1978. Instead, I had to wait until April 1994 before receiving my first spam message: sent to USENET groups rather than by email, advertising a green card lottery service by two lawyers, Canter and Siegel.
It was this simple advertising message that formed the foundation of what became the junk email phenomenon. That danger was demonstrated almost precisely 20 years ago to the day when the ILOVEYOU worm was distributed by email and infected millions of Windows computers. Across the two decades that have followed, spam has remained the primary vehicle for delivering malware as well as being an ever-present irritant.
MORE FROM FORBESHow This Chinese Google Hack Has Made Working From Home SaferBy Davey Winder
Twenty years ago, spam blacklists were the most commonly used anti-spam technique: and oh boy did they suck. Filtering spam by the IPs of known bad senders only works if those IPs are not only known but accurate. Seeing as many spammers used the same internet service providers as everyone else, false positives were the order of the day and most of us turned such filtering firmly off soon enough.
Dedicated spam filtering solutions using a combination of sender reputation scoring and keywords soon emerged and proved more effective. They did, however, require a period of training whereby the recipient would have to categorize email as being spam or not manually.
Thankfully, email applications now come with anti-spam measures built-in, and the likes of Gmail, for example, reckon the machine learning algorithms that power the spam filtering for 1.5 billion Google email users are 99.9% accurate. That still leaves way too many actual spam messages getting through when you do the math, and it's dealing with these that is proving difficult. A new one-click email trick that is currently being tested by Mozilla could provide the solution for 250 million Firefox users.
Going by the name of Private Relay, Mozilla is currently testing a new add-on for Firefox users that could put an end to unwanted emails using a single click. The idea behind the new add-in is undoubtedly not new. Still, Mozilla is making it so easy to use that it could revolutionize the way we deal with unwanted, annoying and potentially dangerous emails.
That idea is email aliases, where you create different email addresses for services and sites that you sign up to while keeping your "real" email to yourself. Gmail users, for example, might sign up with e.xample@gmail.com instead of example@gmail.com as a 'dot' before the @ symbol doesn't change where the email ends up, but does help to identify where spam is coming from. But that's not as easy to manage as the Firefox solution.
By simply clicking on a "relay" button next to the email fields, once installed, the add-on will allow an alias to be created on-demand. All emails sent to that new address will automatically be forwarded to your actual address. Mozilla describes the Private Relay Firefox add-on as being able to generate "unique, random, anonymous email addresses that forward to your real address," and when done with you can "disable or destroy the email address."
MORE FROM FORBESDownloaded Twitter Data Using Firefox? Could Hackers Have Stolen Your Data?By Davey Winder
This user interface is what makes Private Relay so simple, and so powerful: removing the alias means that no further emails will be received, all spam will be terminated from that sender and any others they might have shared your address with.
If a service you are using suffers a data breach and logins appear on the dark web, a would-be attacker wouldn't have your email address for use in executing a credential stuffing attack. "We all make many online accounts, but most of them are linked to 1 or 2 of our email addresses," Mozilla said, "this means if just one account is hacked or tracked, every other account and its associated data is now also at risk."
MORE FROM FORBESRevealed: The Supermarkets That Will Sell You Malware For $50By Davey Winder
Ah, yes, the catch. There's always a catch. In the case of Mozilla's Private Relay, it's merely that it is still in testing mode at the moment, an invite-only alpha testing mode. That will change in due course, and by keeping an eye on the Private Relay pages you will be able to sign up to the waiting list and join in "soon," according to Mozilla.
You might also think for old-timers like me who have had the same very public email address for more than 20 years, then maybe it's a little late to start using aliases, but think again. It's never too late to start dealing more effectively with the problem of spam. I'll be front and center of the queue to test this one when the testing expands.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Body Language Hacks To Project Leadership Presence On Zoom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As more interactions move from in-person environments to online events, your ability to project virtual leadership presence is quickly becoming the key to your continued success.
Whether you are interviewing for a new job, presenting to the executive team, or facilitating a team meeting, you are the most influential when you express your core values and show up as your best authentic self — so the most powerful body language advice I can give you is to believe in yourself, trust your instincts, and allow your natural friendliness, compassion, and credibility to shine through.
There is, however, added value in knowing which of your body language habits is reinforcing people’s positive perception of you as a leader — and which habits may be sending the wrong message.
Here are body language hacks for your next Zoom event:
Make a positive first impression
Just as in a physical meeting, first impressions matter. It takes less than seven seconds for people to make judgments about your attitude, level of confidence, professional status, and personal warmth. While a face-to-face meeting gives you added opportunities (entering the conference room, shaking hands with an interviewer, greeting individual members at a team meeting, etc.), on a computer screen, it’s only your visual image that sets that initial impression.
• Take a few minutes before your meeting starts to think about what you want to accomplish, why it’s important to the attendees, and why you are personally invested in the topic of this event. Doing so will help your facial expressions and initial gestures to automatically align with your intent.
• Dress for virtual success by avoiding clothing with tight patterns, as they “jump around” on camera. Solid colors work best. If it’s appropriate for the event, your outfit can be very casual, as long as you make sure that your grooming and wardrobe reinforce your professional image.
• Right before the meeting or interview begins, take five deep breaths. This silent breathing technique is a secret weapon of all on-camera hosts and presenters to help them get centered and focused.
• Start with a smile. Some nonverbal behaviors can bring out the best in us. Smiling is one of them, as it directly influences how other people respond. When you smile at someone, in person or virtually, they almost always smile in return. And, because facial expressions trigger corresponding feelings, your smile makes you and your audience feel more upbeat and positive.
Realize which nonverbal habits get in your way
The impact of your nonverbal behavior relies less on what you mean by the signal you send — and more on what the observer thinks you mean. That’s why you need to realize how your body language is most likely being read. And, by the way, since the human brain pays more attention to negative messages than it does to positive ones, what people unconsciously look for and react to the most, are signs that you are in a bad mood, fearful, unsure, or upset.
Here are a few body language habits that can send the wrong message:
• You may be more comfortable with your arms crossed, but crossing arms is almost always perceived as a closed sign of resistance.
• You may naturally slump when seated, but when you collapse in your chest and round your shoulders, you minimize your leadership presence by appearing less confident and competent than you really are.
• When we’re nervous, we all tend to pacify with some form of self-touching or soothing behavior such as rubbing hands together, drumming fingers, playing with jewelry, twirling hair, fidgeting, rocking or swaying. When you exhibit any of these pacifying gestures virtually, they get amplified and people begin to wonder why you’re so nervous.
• You (like I) may habitually talk using a lot of hand motion. But sweeping gestures that continually go out of camera range quickly become annoying.
• Remember, too, that there's nothing that kills credibility faster than letting your voice rise of the end of a sentence — as if asking a question. When making a declarative statement, be sure to use the authoritative arc in which your voice starts at one note, rises in pitch through the sentence, and drops back down at the end.
Send both sets of leadership presence signals
Leadership presence is represented by two sets of nonverbal signals: One set of signals conveys status, authority, and power. These are the powerful signals many of the leaders I coach display naturally.
But the first thing people look for (especially now, when empathy has never been more important) is a collection of “pro-social” signals that show your warmth, empathy, and inclusiveness. In a team meeting, for example, attendees will be looking to be reassured that you understand and care about them, that you value their input, and that you have their best interests at heart.
To signal both confidence and warmth, send a combination of signals:
• You appear at your empathetic and inclusive best when you stay relaxed, keeping your movements small, slow, and within the computer screen. If you gesture with open palms, you’ll send the ultimate “see, I have nothing to hide” signal. When you keep your elbows in line with your shoulders to make smaller gestures, you also appear self-assured and collected.
• Especially in times of uncertainty, it’s a leadership necessity to show genuine interest by giving whomever is speaking your full attention. When we are face-to-face, eye contact makes that connection; to make virtual eye contact, remember to look at the camera as much as possible. You can also show engagement by leaning slightly forward as someone speaks, nodding in agreement or tilting your head in the universal signal of “giving someone your ear.”
• Because so many of the nonverbal cues we use to assess a speaker are unavailable in a virtual environment (the main reason for “Zoom fatigue”), your audience’s brains have to work harder to understand the full meaning of your remarks. You’ll connect with people even more positively if you wait a few seconds between phrases to let them absorb and analyze what you’ve just said.
• The best tip for looking confident in a virtual meeting is to sit with good posture - facing the screen with shoulders squared, head straight, and feet flat on the ground. In fact, someone viewing you for the first time will make judgments about your leadership presence based more on your posture than on your actual role or title. A side benefit is that good posture tends to make you feel more self-assured.
In person or online, you are communicating over two channels: verbal and nonverbal. While you’re speaking, your audience is simultaneously assessing your tone of voice, facial expressions, hand gestures, and posture for clues about your credibility, warmth, power, and sincerity. Body language savvy can be your key to strengthening business relationships, presenting your ideas with more impact, and projecting leadership presence on Zoom.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">More details on Microsoft’sSurface Book 3 have been published, with the latest information coming from the certification of the Windows 10 powered laptop by Energy Star.
The certifications cover the top-end models of the 13-inch and 15-inch Surface Book machines, with both porting Intel’s Core-i7 processor and 32 GB of RAM. Windows Latest reports:
Given the listed speed of the i7 processor, it looks like the Surface Book 3 will be using Intel’s Ice Lake-U processors. This matches the chipsets used in the Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro 7 devices launched in October 2019, and there’s a certain practicality in using the same close family of chips across the full range.
One other detail that jumps out is the ‘Date Available On Market’, with both machines listing ’05/01/2020’. That doesn’t mean that they were on retail shelves on that date, but it does suggest that the hardware is ready to go on sale.
Microsoft has not confirmed a release date, but many are expecting the Surface Book 3 to arrive in June.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Boost Your Creativity And Imagination With These Apps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A decade ago, about 60 percent of CEOs surveyed by IBM, stated that creativity is the most important skill to have in the workplace. With COVID-19 shutdowns, and working by video calls, it seems to be even more critical that leaders and workers have a range of imagination and creative capabilities. 
Here are three creativity-oriented apps that caught my attention:
Audiojack offers a unique concept in terms of boosting creativity and imagination. They provide what the founder, David Tobin, says is an “audio-based movie.” Instead of having all the visual imagery, Audiojack provides only sounds and it allows your mind to fill in the blanks. 
I listened to several Audiojack “movies” and each one had a myriad of sounds, layered together, in ways that indeed had me piecing together my own story of what was taking place. There is no right or wrong answer, the actual storyline is never revealed, you decide what the story narrative is in your own mind. The app is used in education as well as in healthcare. There are a number of experiences on the free plan and then it is $15 per year. Check it out on iOS or Android. 
Brainsparker is another creativity-oriented app and tool. Right now, thanks to COVID-19, they have a free “kids pack” with 100-plus creative activities, an instruction set for how to “spice up your zoom sessions,” and what they call the “gulp! pack” to help you overcome your fears. 
Basically, the Brainsparker iOS app or a daily email they send for Android users or an online picker (see link in previous paragraph), gives you a random visual or text prompt, such as a quote or a question or perhaps a trigger word that creates a response — a card that prompts you to pause and ponder. Companies and individuals have reviewed it well and appreciate the dose of new ideas.
Blek is a puzzle-like game that many users have said is about boosting your imagination. A combination of art and puzzle, according to others. The objective is simple, however, it gets harder and harder to do as the obstacles get more complex — create a line that collects colored circles and avoids the black holes.
I did not download the game, but watched several videos about the puzzle game - I can see why people call it a work of art and a joy to watch. As you set that little line in motion, it sets about moving in a way you hope works to solve each challenge. If it does not, it definitely forces you to think in new ways to do it on your next try. It is available on iOS for $3.99 and on Android for 99 cents.
I do not think much has changed from 2010 when the IBM survey found executives claiming that creativity is the essential skill needed in the workplace. We need that creativity and imagination more than ever - to keep our kids engaged with online school, to do just one more Zoom meeting, and to, really, keep our sanity and wits about us.
Given our current stay-at-home, work-from-home (WFH) orders, what are you doing to keep your creative mind sharp?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Google Meet Goes Free, Microsoft Flags Double Spaces…And Other Small Business Tech News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here are five things in technology that happened this past week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?
1 — Google Meet is going free as it guns for Zoom and aims to fend off Microsoft Teams.    
Google announced this past week that it is going to begin making their video conferencing platform—Meet—free, as a way to stay competitive with video conference giants Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google Meet has received an influx of new users who are now having to work from home. Google plans to implement the feature slowly to more users in order to make sure that all goes smoothly. Users with a G Suite account will be able to opt-in for alerts in order to be notified of when they can start using Meet. (Source: ZDNet)
Why this is important for your business:
There will be many changes to our workplaces in the future because of the Coronavirus pandemic and one of them will be the increased use of video conferencing and collaboration systems. Zoom has been getting all the attention, but its rivals–Google, Microsoft, GoToMeeting, Citrix and others–are going to compete aggressively for your attention with free deals and other incentives.
2 — Microsoft Word now flags double spaces as errors, ending the great space debate.
Microsoft Word will now highlight when a user puts two spaces after a punctuation mark, flagging it as an error and ending the confusion surrounding this practice in the past. Now—when users are typing—if they accidentally—or intentionally—put two spaces after a punctuation, Microsoft Word will provide the option to fix the double space to a single. Microsoft began troubleshooting the new update through Word’s desktop version and also been providing recommendations using the Word app Editor feature. (Source: The Verge)
Why this is important for your business:
To double space or not to double space? That’s been an age old question and now Microsoft is taking a stand. Get ready for lots of new grammatical errors in your company’s communications (as if there aren’t a lot already!).
3 —National Business League rolled out a $1.8 million platform to connect black businesses with technology amid COVID-19.
This past week, the National Business League Inc.—also known as NBL—is going to utilize their new 1.8 million user platform to help minimize the divide that exists digitally due to the COVID-19 pandemic among black-owned small businesses. (Source: Black Enterprise)
Why this is important for your business:
If you’re a black-owned company then pay attention: NBL rolled out their newest technology platform along with many other initiatives to help businesses like yours, which will include the creation of a new mobile app and website. NBL plans to utilize social media platforms, online virtual entrepreneurial and educational training, live streaming, and additional services to help the gap among black-owned businesses that exists regarding technology.
4 —Without cloud computing, businesses would now be in even deeper trouble.    
According to Canalys—an analyst firm—$107 billion were spent on cloud-computing services all over the world last year. That amount is 37% more than in 2018. It is predicted that public cloud services will rise to 17% this year, totaling $266.4 billion. With the COVID-19 pandemic changing the way businesses run and employees work, the investment in cloud computing has allowed the transition to working from home happen relatively smoothly for many companies. If the Coronavirus had hit in 2010, businesses would have been in even bigger trouble, with only $6,300 a year being spent on cloud computing during that time. (Source: ZDNet)
Why this is important for your business:
If you’re not convinced that leveraging cloud is a good thing to do, the coronavirus pandemic should have convinced you that the cloud is now and essential thing to do. Even if you have desktop or older applications, you can still move them to a managed server environment. The important takeaway is that you need to have a cloud strategy for your small business going forward.
5— Phishing scams are targeting SMBs seeking COVID aid.   
According to data shared by BleepingComputer.com, the relief provided for the coronavirus pandemic through the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) has opened new opportunities for scammers to take advantage of business owners looking for help.. (Source: Pymnts)
Why this is important for your business:
According to the data, those behind the scams try to trick business owners by sending out emails pretending to be the Payment Protection Program (PPP). The idea behind the fraudulent emails is to try and fool individuals in choosing relief options for their businesses using official-looking log-in pages in an attempt to lift important corporate information.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How To Stop Relying On Consultants By Building Your Company’s Innovation Capabilities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Post Covid-19, company leaders are going to be dealing with a lot of challenges. In addition to stabilizing their core business, leaders will also be thinking about how they can use innovation to drive new growth. The challenge for most organizations will be that they have historically neglected to develop the necessary innovation skills among their employees. In the constant drive for efficiency, some leaders have been actively hostile to innovation teams, viewing them as a waste of resources. 
When disruption occurs, it becomes difficult for companies that do not already have an innovation muscle to respond.  Post Covid-19, companies are going to have to build innovation muscles in the middle of a crisis. It’s hard to reimagine the future with a group of employees that have been drilled to run the core business efficiently. Giving these people an opportunity to work on innovation projects will not be enough. They will inevitably lack the right skills to design new  business models, identify risky assumptions or run the right experiments to test new business ideas.
Innovation Coaches
The other challenge that corporate employees will face is time and resource. This has always been a challenge. However, when companies are in crisis mode, time and resources become even more precious.  Most people working in large companies will not have enough hours in their working week to build up the right skills for innovation. So when they start working on a project, they will be unsure what to do. 
This is where coaching can really help. When employees have limited time and skills, surrounding them with the good innovation coaches can help move projects forward. A good option for companies is to use external consultants as innovation coaches. This option is good because it can at least help you to get started. What you don’t want, however, is to completely outsource your innovation capabilities to external consultants.  
It is better for companies to use consultants as a bridge towards building their own internal innovation capabilities. I strongly believe that every company needs to have its own group of internal innovation coaches. This is an important innovation muscle to have. So when we work with consultants, we must not just use them to execute and deliver our innovation projects. We must also leverage their presence in our company  to train an internal group of coaches. 
Catalysts + Coaches
At Intuit they train internal coaches through a program called Catalyst. They recruit internal coaches and train them on their Design for Delight innovation process (D4D). They have been doing this for several years and have built up a great group of internal coaches to support their innovation teams.  At Pearson, when they were rolling out the Lean Product Lifecycle, they had a train-the-trainer program that focused on building the innovation skills of selected employees. 
When building up your group of internal innovation coaches, it is important to select the right people. It is not sufficient for people to have an interest in innovation or working on innovation projects. You need to recruit people that are passionate about innovation and equally passionate about teaching innovation to others. This is how you can spread best practices throughout the organization. 
The Program
Based on my experience working with several large organizations, I have outlined below the steps you can use to run a successful train-the-trainer program. This approach is not formulaic and can be adapted to suit your company context. What is important is that you leverage the presence of consultants in your company to build up the right level of skill within your group of internal coaches, so that they can work independently going forward: 
As a company, you can set the requirements in terms of the number of hours of shadowing and coaching that are required before a person becomes a certified coach. It is also important to recruit coaches from all over the business, who are then deployed to help teams within their divisions or business units. This will allow innovation best practices to be spread across the company by passionate advocates. 
The Community
It is also important to turn our coaches into a community of innovation practitioners. We need to create a range of possibilities for them to interact and learn from each other. Creating a community gets rid of isolation and provides innovators with the knowledge that they are not alone in the company – there are others like them. 
As such, we should start building a community by organising regular meetups where people can share best practice. These meetups can feature external speakers. You can also run a weekly lean coffee meeting. People can turn up, select topics and spend an hour discussing their challenges and successes.
Beyond meeting face to face, we can also use digital tools to create our community. For example, we could host weekly or monthly webinars where we discuss various innovation topics. We can also create a digital platform with blogs, videos and an interactive page. The goal is to have a strong community of practitioners that are continuously getting better at their craft. This is how we can stop relying on consultants and build our own innovation capabilities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NASA engineers explain what it's like to drive a nuclear-powered Mars rover from home during the pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Remote work doesn't get much more remote than piloting a robot 140 million miles away on the surface of Mars.
NASA, alongside many other workplaces, has had to shut its doors during the coronavirus pandemic. For engineers and scientists working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) responsible for driving the Curiosity Mars rover, this meant setting up systems so they could continue to communicate with the rover while all stuck in their homes.
Business Insider spoke to two NASA employees currently on the rover team about how they are managing to execute commands and even make scientific advances while working from home.
Alicia Allbaugh has worked on and off at NASA since 1991, and oversees the 75-person rover program which she has worked on since 2006. When she heard rumblings about the pandemic and potential lockdowns on NPR, she started to form a plan for if the rover team suddenly had to ship out. The rover team has had to think about some work-from-home plans in the past in case of earthquakes, Allbaugh said.
Luckily for the rover team, there was already some infrastructure in place because it works with scientists all over the world, so a degree of teleconferencing functionality was already on hand. They were able to do an experimental test run on March 12, five days before NASA shut its offices.
It took everyone a few hours to acclimatize to setting up all their windows and chats so they fit onto home monitor screens. "We figured it out within like two, three hours. We were sort of getting into the groove and understanding the ebb and flow and the pace," she said. The test went off surprisingly well, with the rover receiving and successfully executing a set of orders.
Before NASA issued the order sending its employees home on March 17, Allbaugh had also gone into the office and done an inventory of all the spare monitors and headsets the team had on hand and what they would have to order in. When news did come that employees shouldn't come back to work the next day, her team grabbed what they needed and headed home.
The Curiosity rover is equipped with 3D cameras, which it uses to send 3D images back to its drivers to help work out where it should go next. Ordinarily the team look at these images with special high-tech 3D goggles which flip which eye is looking at the image at a rate of about 60 times per second.
"The reason we have them, in general, is because the Rover drivers need to visualize how the Rover moves over 3D train," said Matt Gildner, the rover planner team lead.
Gildner oversees a team of about 20 planners who write and send commands telling the rover where to go. He added that the 3D images give the drivers a better idea of how steep a slope might be, or how sandy the ground might be.
But the goggles require heavy-duty graphics cards normally used in gaming computers, and it wasn't going to be practical to get these working at home, so NASA found a less high-tech solution.
Rover planners are now using simple plastic red-blue glasses, the same kind you would use to watch a 3D movie. Gildner says he pops the glasses on for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time about three times a day to look around at where the rover is.
"It really helps us do our jobs. I mean, we couldn't do it without it," he said.
The various groups that work on Curiosity are used to being in large rooms where they can easily talk to each other and convene amongst themselves, and simulating this kind of communication was a big challenge for the team.
Broadly speaking the work is split into uplink (what information NASA is sending the rover) and downlink (what information the rover is sending to NASA).
"The downlink area where they look at the data is similar to what you've seen in like 'Apollo 13' [...] with little signs above everyone, and they're looking at information from various systems on the vehicle," Allbaugh said.
Uplink takes place on a different floor. "[Uplink is] mostly in one really large room that has a whole bunch of computers around the edge of it, and a very large table in the center with people on laptops usually as well," Allbaugh added.
As a planner, Gildner works on the uplink side of the team and said it was a struggle to mimic this flow of communication. "We are used to being able to have everyone in one room and have some conversations that are within smaller groups in one room, and then some conversations that participate with everyone," he said.
His solution: double headsets.
"What we've done is actually we set up multiple teleconferences all at once. I will have one headset called into my team of  rover drivers and we'll be chatting, and I'll have that in one ear. And then I will be called into the larger teams group and have that in my second ear. And so I'm like muting myself in between two teleconferences at once and chatting back and forth and doing this for like eight hours a day," he said.
"It does make you a bit more worn out, you have to concentrate a bit more. But it's actually worked very well ... we're able to kind of mimic what we would be doing if we were all in one place in one conference room, or one operations room, trying to work with different teams," he added.
Wearing his 3D glasses as well as his two headsets is what Gildner calls his "super nerd" look. "You've got to do both headsets at once too, because that's really key to the whole look," he said.
On March 20 a set of commands that were sent to Curiosity were successfully executed, and the robot drilled a rock sample at a location called "Edinburgh," and is now headed on to yet another drilling operation looking for rocks to analyze. In total, the robot has rolled 166 metres (545 feet) since its human operators had to set up shop at home.
For Gildner, piloting the rover has taken on a special significance during lockdown. "One of the big draws of working on a spacecraft operation, especially on Mars, is that every day we're driving to a new place and I get to look at images that no human has ever seen before," he said.
"We all get to kind of escape on Mars for a few hours every week," he added, pointing out that Curiosity's photos are also uploaded for the public to see, should anyone else care to escape to Mars.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">I've covered Tesla for over a decade and for that entire time, I've constantly insisted that it isn't a Silicon Valley tech company, but rather a carmaker. Just like General Motors, Toyota, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz, just with electric motors instead of internal-combustion engines.
Wrong! So wrong!
But not because Tesla is actually a Silicon Valley tech company. It isn't. Silicon Valley doesn't really create technology companies anymore; instead, it creates companies that sit on top of the internet — mainly the mobile internet these days — and sell attention-spans to advertisers and services to businesses. 
In effect, they're media companies whose content is generated for free by users: Google searches, Facebook posts, and so on. Apple is an exception, but there we have a design firm, effectively, that lives on the exceptional profit margins of its premium devices, chiefly the iPhone.
There have always been powerful media companies and media conglomerates, but nobody ever confused them with old-economy technology companies, such as automakers, aviation giants, or even the first wave of computer companies, such as IBM.
Now that we're something like four decades into the "tech" transformation of the economy, we've forgotten what actual technology companies look like. The best example, from the previous century, is General Electric, which can trace its roots to Thomas Edison and the late 19th century. GE is the quintessential American conglomerate.
But it's importance, while still critical, has been fading. The successor, it dawned on me a few weeks ago, is Tesla.
It should have been obvious to me all along. Here's why:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hidden in San Francisco's Bayview neighborhood is a four-story castle with underground caves that was once home to the Albion Ale & Porter Brewery.
Albion Castle was built in 1870 as a personal residence and brewery, with a natural underground aquifer producing 10,000 gallons of water daily and providing the water needed for ale production.
It's since been a water-bottling company, private residence, a tech support center for the blog Laughing Squid, and has even hosted smaller events like a Google dinner party and a lavish Halloween bash. It now belongs to Bill Gilbert, a former San Francisco police officer and real-estate investor who bought the castle in 2012 for $900,000. 
A tall fence and towering trees surround Albion Castle, making it the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. "I don't even feel like I'm in San Francisco," Jennifer Gilbert, Bill Gilbert's daughter, told Business Insider. 
Take a look around the hidden fairy-tale home.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Space X passes final parachute test ahead its historic launch on May 27 that will mark America's first manned spaceflight in nearly nine years before their 2024 Moon trip</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Space X completed its final parachute test as the aerospace company and Nasa prepare to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station on May 27. 
Space X, founded by Elon Musk, shared news of the successful test run Friday on Twitter as they gear up for the historic lift off of Demo-2, the first crewed test flight  of the Crew Dragon spacecraft. 
'27th and final test of Crew Dragon’s upgraded Mark 3 parachutes complete,' Space X wrote.
'One step closer to flying NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station and safely returning them back home to Earth.'
A photo of the test showed the Crew Dragon's parachutes fully functional as it safely floated to the ground. 
Space enthusiasts are anticipating the launch as it is latest step is helping push the U.S. back to the front of human spaceflight.
It will be America's first manned spaceflight in nearly nine years. 
NASA has been unable to fly astronauts since the Space Shuttle fleet was retired 2011, and have been forced to rely on Russian Soyuz rockets for rides to the International Space Station at $84million a seat.
Space officials also complete an investigation into an engine failure on the first stage of the Space X Falcon 9 rocket during a previous launch in March. 
During that test, 60 of Space X's Starlink internet satellites were aboard, Space.com reports. 
The misstep didn't interfere with the overall mission since the satellites reached orbit, but NASA and Space X conducted an investigation since the upcoming launch would also use a Falcon 9 rockte. 
'We have reviewed the anomaly resolution of the Starlink launch and actually have cleared the engines on our vehicle for that failure,"said  Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 
Space X has developed Crew Dragon in contact with the Commercial Crew Program. 
 In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to create a spacecraft capable of flying humans to the space station. 
The following years were bogged down by funding issues and technical problems that halted progress. 
However, Space X's deal includes finishing the capsule and flying six operational crew missions to and from ISS.  
Meanwhile, Boeing has had difficulty with its Starliner spacecraft, including arriving in the wrong orbit during a test flight and problems with deploying parachutes.
It’s unclear when Boeing will need to send another Starliner to the space station without launching astronauts later this year
An investigation team is still looking into why the Starliner's automated timer was off by 11 hours during the December test flight.
NASA's Artemis mission that is set to land the first woman and next man on the moon has just turned into a space race between billionaires.
Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX have been chosen to develop human landing systems for the mission set to launch in 2024.
Along with the two tech tycoons, NASA has also awarded Dynetics part of the 10 month contract that totals $967 million.  
The firms are set to create lander concepts by 2021 and NASA will then pick one or more winners to begin building the spacecraft. 
Bringing humans back to the moon has been a dream of NASA for years, but with the Artemis mission just four years away, the agency is working tirelessly to make sure it becomes a reality.
The US has not had a human landing system since 1972, but the technologies are vital for the American space agency's deep space exploration plans. 
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a live feed of the announcement: 'It is important that the agency do this now, our country and in fact the whole world has been shaken by the coronavirus.'
'We need to give people hope and something dream about that will inspire the nation and the entire world.'
'With these contract awards, America is moving forward with the final step needed to land astronauts on the Moon by 2024, including the incredible moment when we will see the first woman set foot on the lunar surface.'
NASA awarded the Blue Origin team with $579 million, the Dynetics team with $253 million and SpaceX with $135 million.
Boeing, in partnership with Aerojet Rocketdyne, also bid on HLS but was not awarded with a study contract. The Boeing proposal included using an upgraded Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which Boeing is currently building for NASA.
Blue Origin, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is developing the Integrated Lander Vehicle (ILV).
This is a three-stage lander that will launch on the firm's own New Glenn Rocket System and ULA Vulcan launch system.
Bezos revealed plans of 'going to the moon' in 2019, when he shared elaborate concept images of self-sustaining space habitats reminiscent of the film Interstellar, with lush greenery and futuristic homes within its walls.
Blue Origin said its lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will be able to carry all sorts of payloads to the surface and can hold 'multiple metric tons.'
The craft will 'enable a sustained human presence on the moon,' the company said. And, according to the CEO, the company already has about six customers.
The lander builds upon technology the firm has been testing over the past few years in its New Shepard rocket, including propulsion and precision guidance, as well as the vertical landing system.
The firm has quietly been developing Blue Moon for years.
SpaceX has also joined the team and is set to design its Starship rocket, which it is currently developing and refining in Texas.
SpaceX said a 'lunar optimized Starship' would bring crew from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface under NASA's Artemis program.
'A lunar optimized Starship can fly many times between the surface of the Moon and lunar orbit without flaps or heat shielding required for Earth return,' the company said.
However, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Bridenstine have a history of bad blood, so it may be a surprise the firm was chosen as for this project.
During a conference in 2019, Bridenstine re-hashed Tweets criticizing SpaceX for failing to meet timelines for the development of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, saying they were meant as a warning to all of the space agency's contractors about setting realistic development schedules.
'I have been focused on returning to realism when it comes to costs and schedules,' said the NASA Administrator.
'So I was signaling - and I haven't done it just to SpaceX but to all of our contractors - that we need more realism built into the development timelines.'
But Musk has been working with NASA to develop the Crew Dragon capsule that will shuttle US astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS).
NASA has also chosen Dynetics to design the human landing system, which will work the Dynetics Human Landing System (DHLS) – a single structure providing the ascent and descent capabilities that will launch on the ULA Vulcan launch system.
The Alabama-based firm has excelled in designing a myriad of useful components for space, including satellites, propulsion systems, vehicles, satellites and more.
NASA's partners will refine their lander concepts during the 10 month contracts.
During that time, the agency will evaluate which of the contractors will perform initial demonstration missions and then choose the final designs to be develop for Artemis.
Lisa Watson-Morgan, HLS program manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, said: 'I am confident in NASA's partnership with these companies to help achieve the Artemis mission and develop the human landing system returning us to the Moon.'
'We have a history of proven lunar technical expertise and capabilities at Marshall and across NASA that will pave the way for our efforts to quickly and safely land humans on the Moon in 2024.
Artemis was the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology. 
NASA has chosen her to personify its path back to the Moon, which will see astronauts return to the lunar surface by 2024 -  including the first woman and the next man.
Artemis 1, formerly Exploration Mission-1, is the first in a series of increasingly complex missions that will enable human exploration to the Moon and Mars. 
Artemis 1 will be the first integrated flight test of NASA’s deep space exploration system: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.  
Artemis 1 will be an uncrewed flight that will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration, and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond. 
During this flight, the spacecraft will launch on the most powerful rocket in the world and fly farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown.
It will travel 280,000 miles (450,600 km) from Earth, thousands of miles beyond the Moon over the course of about a three-week mission. 
Orion will stay in space longer than any ship for astronauts has done without docking to a space station and return home faster and hotter than ever before. 
With this first exploration mission, NASA is leading the next steps of human exploration into deep space where astronauts will build and begin testing the systems near the Moon needed for lunar surface missions and exploration to other destinations farther from Earth, including Mars. 
The will take crew on a different trajectory and test Orion’s critical systems with humans aboard.
The SLS rocket will from an initial configuration capable of sending more than 26 metric tons to the Moon, to a final configuration that can send at least 45 metric tons. 
Together, Orion, SLS and the ground systems at Kennedy will be able to meet the most challenging crew and cargo mission needs in deep space.
Eventually NASA seeks to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon by 2028 as a result of the Artemis mission.
The space agency hopes this colony will uncover new scientific discoveries, demonstrate new technological advancements and lay the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Foreign arrivals to UK could FINALLY be quarantined and forced to install NHS contact tracing app to reduce risk of letting in a new wave of virus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foreign visitors to the UK could face time in quarantine as the Government 'actively' considers stronger anti-coronavirus measures at the borders, a senior minister revealed today.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that new arrivals could also be forced to download a new contract app onto their smartphone as a condition of entry.
New restrictions would make the UK one of the last countries to introduce them, with the country very much an outlier in recent weeks by not halting inbound flights or insisting arrivals are checked.
People arriving are advised to self-isolate but there is no enforced testing. 
Home Secretary Priti Patel is  believed to be among those who have demanded tougher rules for foreign visitors and the remaining Brits still abroad who make it home.
Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show Mr Shapps said: 'I think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease... that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense - social distancing - that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country.
'I am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing.'
Although the vast majority of global air travel has collapsed, flights are still arriving, and ports are also allowing mostly freight traffic into the UK to keep vital services and firms going.
The boss of Heathrow is among those who has urged ministers to introduce mass screening at airports. In a major intervention, chief executive John Holland-Kaye  wrote to Health Secretary Matt Hancock to demand stringent regulations to combat coronavirus.
Last week Bournemouth Airport became the first UK airport to start checking passengers for signs of coronavirus.
Bosses have installed ‘thermal fever detection’ cameras that are capable of recording body temperatures and alerting border guards to anyone with a fever.
The tripod-mounted cameras have been fixed to the airport’s staff entrance but will soon be installed at every entrance to the airport’s departures and arrivals terminals.
Speaking to Sky News's Ridge on Sunday this morning, Mr Shapps announced that the new smartphone contact tracing app being developed by the NHS's digital arm would start trials on the Isle of Wight this week.
And he mooted the idea of making its use mandatory for new arrivals - although it is unclear how people who do not possess a mobile phone would be affected.
He said: 'I think it would be wrong ... if we are all still being asked to socially distance, for people coming in not to do the same thing.
'So we'll be looking at things like this app -which very soon, in two or three weeks' time we are going to be asking the whole country to download - which will help with the test and track and trace, this is obviously the tracking part of it, that's very important. 
'We could be asking everybody who comes here to be required to have that app and the same rules apply to anyone visiting which is, as you know, to stay locked down effectively.
'The same social distance rules clearly would need to apply to everybody under those circumstances.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to dress like a grown up with Shane Watson: New Zoom essential? Elegant earrings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is surely no surprise that we're all browsing fashion websites these days — the surprise is what we're looking for.
If I want to buy clothes, I go straight to the place I know I'll find them: a button-through summer dress (zara.com), a good pair of khaki trousers (irisfashion.co.uk), but when I'm lockdown browsing, I'm more interested in the dreamy catalogue images: the pretty tiled floors, the flowers on the table, the cracked leather armchair, the scarf around the model's hair and always, more than anything, the earrings.
They're not always credited, sadly, because when the stylists put these images together, the earrings were just a detail to set off the little black dress or the little white swimsuit —they weren't to know the earrings would become the main event. We won't be needing a black dress any time soon, let alone a swimsuit, but earrings are newly appealing. 
When a change of top, a slick of lipstick, plus ear jewellery is our new three-step (Zoom) party preparation, earrings have roughly 65 per cent more going for them than they did before coronavirus.
The other irresistible thing about earrings in May 2020 is you don't have to try them on. Lockdown bullseye.
There are no rules when it comes to great earrings: one woman's glamorous candelabra is another's gaudy Christmas bauble. You need to go with what suits you, including your height and the length of your neck. If you're short, you don't want a giant earring swinging around at chin level.
Add a drop or a charm to a small hoop.
Gold and misshapen pearls work well together.
Mismatched or single earrings are newly smart.
Pick earrings bold enough to show on camera.
Striking the right balance between eye catching and distracting is all important; what looked fabulous on the Stella McCartney catwalk (earrings so big they grazed the shoulders) may well look comical in real life, and beware 'statement' earrings. Generally anything prefixed with the word statement is something you'll wear once and tire of.
If you want earrings with impact, that flatter your face, then pretty materials — the glow of gold or the brightness of turquoise — deliver the best bang for your buck.
As for what's in fashion right now, it ranges from tassel fans to anything featuring a charm or droplet. Hoops are still going strong, and now they're often embellished — see Whistles' pearl hoops (£21.75, whistles.com); Simone Rocha's beaded hoops (£195, matches fashion.com) or Anna + Nina's rainbow enamelled hoops (£100, anthropologie.com).
Another trend that's not going anywhere is mismatched earrings, which look chic providing the earrings have some common ground. If in doubt, asymmetric charms on small hoops is the safe way to go and you can find plenty of quirky combinations at jewellery brand Timeless Pearly (£250, matchesfashion.com).
Alternatively, Anna + Nina (sold at trouva.com) do charming individual earrings to pair up with a plain stud or hoop; these work particularly well if you have more than one piercing per ear and can wear several at once. Take your pick from the single turquoise stud, to daisies, pearls in a peapod and evil eyes.
The beauty of these charms is if you decide they don't work as earrings for you, they'll work as a gift — on a chain or sleeper earring — come Christmas.
This isn't a time for fine jewellery; it's a moment for mixing it up and having fun.
One of the best brands for gold and pearl earrings is Alighieri. The designs have the raw beauty and simplicity of late medieval heirlooms, at a fraction of the cost.
The infernal storm earrings (£350, alighieri.co.uk) with their chunky baroque drop pearls are my favourites.
Another reliable, more affordable brand is Arlette Gold, where you can get coin hoop earrings (£43, arlettegold.com) or turquoise studded huggies — the fat hoops you wear tight to your ear (£32).
But if you want to go for the best, that would be the queen of semi-precious jewellery, Pippa Small; her gold vermeil turquoise studs from her less pricey Turquoise Mountain range are top of my wish list (£80, pippasmall.com).
J.Crew does excellent quality earrings. Two stand-out pairs at the moment are its dangly white beaded ones (£44, jcrew.com) — white is a surprisingly effective colour for earrings at this time of year — or the raffia fan earrings (£73).
Otherwise, Accessorize is always worth a look, and its pearl hoop set is a steal at just £4 (uk.accessorize.com).

    <h5 class="mb-1">France's COVID-19 tracing app expected to enter testing in week of May 11</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS (Reuters) - France’s state-supported “StopCOVID” contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase in the week of May 11 when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister said on Sunday.
Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s inner circle, presented the app as a key element of France’s strategy to stave off the coronavirus as authorities grapple with the prospect of mass testing.
“There’s nothing magical about this app, but it’s not technological coquetry either,” O wrote on online publishing platform Medium. “It’s only useful if it’s integrated into a global health system.”
Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk of one person infecting another, helping to isolate those who could spread the disease.
Like others in Europe, France has chosen the short-range Bluetooth “handshakes” between devices as the best approach, dismissing the alternative of using location data pursued by some countries in Asia as intrusive.
But debate has raged about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn those who may be at risk.
France has so far opted for a “centralised” approach, which would need Apple in particular to change the settings on its iPhones. The smartphone maker has refused to budge, although discussions with the U.S. company were ongoing, O said.
“French health and technological sovereignty ... is the freedom for our country to be able to have the choice and not be constrained by the choices of a large company, however innovative and efficient it may be,” O wrote.
France’s most important European partner, Germany, changed course last week over which type of smartphone technology it wanted to use, backing an approach supported by Google and Apple along with a growing number of other European countries.
(This story has been refiled to correct headline and first paragraph to make clearer that testing will start in the week beginning May 11)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Huawei Rolls Out World’s Highest 5G Station in Mount Everest Area</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite the ongoing US crackdown on Huawei, in place since May 2019, the Chinese tech giant continues to stay afloat, vowing to find replacements for American technologies in the near future to become independent of them.
Huawei Technologies and the network operator China Mobile have completed the world’s highest 5G base station at an altitude of 6,500 metres in the Mount Everest area, according to a press release from the Chinese tech giant.
The station, along with another two that were earlier installed at an altitude of 5,300 metres and 5,800 metres in the area, provides full 5G coverage of Mount Everest on the north ridge as well as the summit, with online download speed reportedly standing at about 1 gigabit per second.
The world’s highest peak, Mount Everest has an altitude of more than 8,840 metres (29,029 feet).
The remarks were echoed by China Mobile which, in turn, touted the 5G project on Mount Everest as “not only another extreme challenge in a human life exclusion zone”, but also as something that “laid a solid foundation for the later development of 5G smart tourism and 5G communications for scientific research”.
The installation of the world’s highest 5G base station comes as Huawei is still grappling with Washington’s crackdown, which kicked off in May 2019, when the Department of Commerce prohibited internet providers from using the company’s products and US tech companies from selling technologies (hardware and software) to Huawei without obtaining a special license first.
The White House claims that the company is collaborating with the Chinese government to allow the latter to spy on those who use the tech giant's equipment, allegations that have been rejected by both Beijing and Huawei.
The US also began a campaign of discouraging countries from allowing the firm to build national 5G networks using similar claims, despite rejections from the UK, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and some Canadian telecom providers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Express Satellites to Be Launched on 30 July, Proton-M Repairs to End in June - Source</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Telecommunications satellites Express-80 and Express-103 will be launched on 30 July, the Proton-M carrier rocket needed for the launch will be repaired by June, a space industry source said.
In April, three Proton-M heavy-lift launch vehicles designated for launching satellites from the Baikonur Cosmodrome were returned to the Khrunichev Centre in Moscow so that low-quality parts can be replaced, a source in space and rocket industry said.
The defective parts, produced between 2015 and 2016, were discovered in March due to checks under a new quality control system introduced by Roscosmos.
According to the Russian Satellite Communications Company, the Express-103 satellite is designed to provide a package of communications services, such as digital TV, telephony, videoconferencing, data transmission, Internet access, and to deploy satellite networks by applying VSAT technology.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus Australia live updates: Chief medical officer urges more Aussies to download COVIDsafe app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Speaking at a press conference today, Mr Murphy said the more Aussies who download the app released last week, the greater likelihood of restrictions easing soon.
He said an increase in download numbers will give leaders “confidence” to be more “bold” in easing restrictions.
His comments come ahead of a National Cabinet meeting on Friday in which leaders are slated to discuss lockdown restrictions that have been in place for over a month.
RELATED: Why you should download COVIDSafe now
“The more people that download the app, the more confidence the National Cabinet will have about that one aspect of our preparedness that we’re still a little bit anxious about — the capacity to really get on top of contacts as soon as possible,” Mr Murphy said.
“The more confidence they can have, the more bold they might be.”
More than 4.25 million Australians have downloaded the COVIDSafe App since it was launched a week ago.
The app is designed to give state and territory health officials the ability to identify people who might have come into contact with a person who tests positive to coronavirus with ease.
However, the tracing app is still not yet fully operational.
Currently if a person  tests positive to the deadly virus, their information won’t be passed through the mobile phone application because the states and territories are yet to nut out how the system will work.
Speaking to the ABC today, a Department of Health spokesperson said : “The rules on privacy are being finalised, along with final IT testing.”
“The system will be operational next week ahead of the decision on possible easing of restrictions.”
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd admitted to the national broadcaster there had been a delay in the access to data being made available despite the huge number of Aussies signing up.
“This (app) has been implemented very quickly,” he said.
“What we’re doing is making sure that the operations are going to work appropriately and safely, but also (making) sure that the people in the contact-tracing facilities in the states and territories are trained on how to use the app, and how to use it appropriately.”
Professor Kidd said the delay in the access to data didn’t mean Australians should avoid the app.
“The important thing is that if people have downloaded the app and they have it running in the background on their phone, it’s already gathering details of people you’ve been in close contact with.
“There’s a delay from now until when the contact tracer in the state or territory where you are based has activated the system.”
At his press conference today, Mr Murphy said the government’s strategy would be to take “cautious gentle steps” with regards to easing lockdown restrictions, to avoid a second outbreak of the deadly virus.
Easing of restrictions is likely to happen in stages, with weekly re-assessments along the way.

Only NSW, Victoria, and Queensland have recorded new cases of coronavirus today, with Tasmania reporting its third consecutive COVID-free day.
While the state's health minister Sarah Courtney was pleased by the positive results, she urged Tasmanians to remain vigilant to avoid a second wave.
“We know in other jurisdictions, we know in other countries we have seen second waves which have had devastating consequences,” she said.
Ms Courtney said it was important people continued to be tested for COVID-19.

The state’s total remains at 221 cases, with acting director of public health Dr Scott McKeown backing the push for continued testing.
“A concerted effort is being made to identify any further cases of coronavirus in the North West,” Dr McKeown said.
“Anyone who lives in the North-West who currently, or in the last few days, has had respiratory symptoms like a cough, sore throat, runny nose, or fever should arrange testing through the Public Health Hotline on 1800 671 738 or their GP.”

Three people in NSW have been charged for breaking coronavirus lockdown restrictions in the past 24 hours.
These include two teenagers who allegedly trespassed in Edgeworth, a 63-year-old man in Redfern who was allegedly drinking in an alcohol-free zone, and a 37-year-old woman in Dulwich Hill who police say was driving erratically.
According to NSW police, none could provide a reasonable excuse for being outside.

South Australia's chief medical officer Nicola Spurrier has confirmed zero new cases of coronavirus in the state for the 11th consecutive day.
As of today, SA only has seven active cases, with 427 people now recovered from COVID-19.
With the news that once again South Australia had recorded no new cases, Premier Steven Marshall said the government had established a transition committee to look at relaxing restrictions over a period of time.
"When we look to ease the restrictions, we have to be firmly focused on the health risk," Mr Marshall said.
"We only get one shot at this."
Ms Spurrier noted a 98% recovery rate from the virus, and is hopeful the state could soon be free of COVID-19.
"If we don’t have any more cases, soon we will be able to say that we have no one with COVID-19 in the state, which will certainly be something to celebrate."
Mr Marshall also announced playgrounds and skate parks will be re-opened, with social distancing rules applied.

Brendan Murphy today confirmed that advice on schools and school-aged children has not changed.
The chief medical officer reiterated that children are not high transmitters of COVID-19, and there is little risk to children contracting the virus.
"We think that children are not high transmitters of this virus in the school environment. We have always said there is a potential risk for adults, in the staff room, adult interactions at the school, pick ups and drop off," he said.
Following criticism of Victoria&amp;#x27;s decision to keep state schools closed, Mr Murphy said Premier Daniel Andrews' move was based on the state’s desire to stop movement, rather than any concern about the safety of children.
This morning, federal education minister Dan Tehan attacked Victorian Premier Dan Andrews' decision to keep state schools closed.
"This is a failure of leadership from Dan Andrews. And it is the most disadvantaged children who are being most affected," Mr Tehan said.
He accused the premier of “taking a sledgehammer” to education and exposing vulnerable children to disadvantage by encouraging parents to keep their kids home from school.

Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says there are currently 6801 cases in Australia, with an increase of 18 cases in last 24 hours, below the target of 20.
In light of the achievement, Mr Murphy says the government is continuing to look at what measures can be relaxed, but warns against complacency.
"There are still new cases and there are still small outbreaks detected in Victoria and New South Wales, there is still evidence of some low level community transmission.
"That’s why we’ve been saying for some time we cannot be complacent."
He said monitoring of Australians via the tracing app Covidsafe shows there has be an increase in movement in recent days since restrictions were relaxed in some states.
"This virus is still in our community, it’s still with us, we are in a much better position than just about any other country in the world, but we have to be careful as we chart the next couple of months."
He later said the government's strategy would be to take "cautious gentle steps" with regards to easing lockdown restrictions, to avoid a second outbreak of the deadly virus.
Easing of restrictions is likely to happen in stages, with re-assessments along the way.

An 83-year-old woman has been confirmed as the ninth Western Australian person to die from coronavirus, bringing Australia's death toll to 95.
WA Premier Mark McGowan confirmed the death today, revealing the woman contracted Covid-19 from close contact last month.
She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April.
WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. They now have only 19 active cases across the state.

Western Australia's Premier Mark McGowan has urged his state to continue social distancing, revealing that a Perth man has been arrested for breaching quarantine.
In a passionate plea to Western Australians, he said "don't be an idiot" when it comes to social distancing, adding that a group effort will lead to strict measures potentially being eased in the coming weeks.
Mr McGowan revealed the latest individual caught flouting the rules was known to police, and was arrested while being served a summons relating to a previous breach of quarantine requirements.
The man has been remanded in custody.
"Officers attended the person's address to serve a summons relating to a previous breach of quarantine requirements, officers again found the male has not complied, and was subsequently arrested," Mr McGowan said.
"The person appeared before the first Perth Magistrates Court on Friday, where he was remanded in custody to reappear on the 11th of May."
Mr McGowan later said: " “He’s now in custody because he couldn’t follow the rules. He can enjoy a jail cell rather than his lounge room over this period."
The arrest comes as the state recorded its ninth death.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has confirmed the death of an 83-year-old woman who contracted Covid-19 from close contact.
She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April. This is the ninth COvid-19 death for the state.
WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. They now have only 19 active cases across the state.
"My message today is we can't afford to get comfortable. Don't be an idiot," he asserted.
"We're all in this together and we must abide by the rules. Keep social distancing and keep up the good personal hygiene.
"The more we do this, the sooner we can get back to normal. We'll continue to review the situation over the coming week in conjunction with the National cabinet process, to work out what further changes we can put in place on Friday of this week."

Hours after he attacked Victorian premier Daniel Andrews' decision to keep state schools closed on ABC Insiders, Education Minister Dan Tehan has withdrawn his comments.
In a statement, Mr Tehan admitted his fierce criticism was out of "frustration", conceding he "overstepped the mark."
"No one wants a situation where students are missing out on their education based on where they live or what school they go to," the statement said.
"The academic research tells us that the remote learning arrangements have the potential to result in poorer educational outcomes for up to half of Australian primary and secondary students if continued for an extended period, in particular the vulnerable, poor, remote and Indigenous students who suffer most.
"It was those examples I was thinking of this morning during my interview on Insiders when I expressed my personal frustration that more schools weren't starting more in-class learning in my home state.
"It was this frustration that led me to overstep the mark in questioning Premier Andrews' leadership on this matter and I withdraw.
"As Education Minister it is my job to take a national view of education and do everything possible to ensure our children are getting the best possible opportunities."
It comes after he criticised the state's decision to keep Victorian schools closed
Mr Tehan had said Mr Andrews' decision to keep schools in his state shut was a "failure of leadership", accusing him of wrecking the "consensus" on the virus response.
"This is a failure of leadership from Dan Andrews. And it is the most disadvantaged children who are being most affected," Mr Tehan said.
"The premiers should listen to the medical experts, the panel that was put together by all state and territory leaders to advise on schools."
"Are you saying that the system, through the National Cabinet, is not delivering the right result?" host David Speers asked.
"It's not. Because we have one premier in particular who is jeopardising the national consensus on this," Mr Tehan said.
He said New South Wales and Queensland both had plans for sending kids back to school.
"Here in Victoria, we don't have one. We have nothing. And it is the children, ultimately in the end, are those most disadvantaged, who are suffering. And I think it's time we called Dan Andrews out on this."
This disagreement between the federal and Victorian governments has been simmering all week, but that interview marks a significant escalation in language from Mr Tehan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The E9 OLED was one of LG’s best TVs – so where did it go?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We mourn the loss of LG’s E Series OLED
LG E9 OLED (2019) (Image credit: LG)
There are plenty of good-looking OLED TVs around these days, and few look better than those put out by LG. The South Korean TV maker has put an immense amount of thought into its premium OLED range, nowhere more so than with the LG E Series OLED – even if it was sadly discontinued this year.
2019’s LG E9 OLED was a masterclass in panel design, offering a glass display that banished the bezel and almost appeared to be floating up from the counter – offering a truly breathtaking visual experience. More than anything else, it looked different from any other TV put out that year.
The E9 didn’t quite make the cut for 2020, though, with the new Gallery Series GX model replacing the E Series line instead. While it presumably made business sense for LG to cut the E Series – which doesn’t seem to have received nearly the amount of media attention as the cheaper (and equivalently specced) C9 OLED, or the more affordable B9 OLED at the bottom of LG’s 2019 OLED range – it’s a loss nonetheless.
We were disappointed not to see an EX model unveiled at CES 2020 along with the other new LG TVs being shown off, and were told simply that the E Series was no longer being pursued.
Neil Robinson, Senior Director for Strategic Projects at LG Electronics, tells us that “The E and G Series were both step-up models, so the GX can be seen as the replacement for the E9.”
Given how close the LG GX and LG WX are in terms of design – both being slim, wall-mounted televisions, with only really a soundbar to differentiate the latter – the removal of an E Series is a move away from variety, even if the GX will be sure to find an audience of its own.
It’s a shame, given the truly unique aesthetic of the E Series compared to other LG TVs. The new BX and CX models look essentially the same as each other, too, like most televisions these days. How much can you iterate on a flatscreen, after all?
Certainly, there are plenty of subtle differences between the physical appearances of TVs, whether that’s where the TV brand’s logo sits, what kinds of feet or stands prop it up off a counter, or the thickness and quality of the display’s casing. That’s not to mention the differences in picture quality – which is really the heart of any television experience.
But that’s why the E Series felt so refreshing: offering a unique form factor amid a ceaseless catalogue of identikit rectangles. Most of LG's OLED range shares the same panel and processor, anyway, so differences in design feel even more important.
In our LG E9 OLED review last year, we praised the set’s “all-glass, frameless panel” for its “open and expansive air”, as well as “a dazzling picture, with crisp detail and truly cinematic visuals”. Aside from minor irritations – the lack of HDR10+, and a patchy Bluetooth connection – the E9 was and is a knockout television to watch.
The year before? We called the E8 OLED “arguably the ultimate expression of these OLED advances, thanks to its glamorous design, niftily integrated sound system and, best of all, mesmerizingly good pictures.”
Other LG TVs have similarly intriguing design choices – including the TV stand for the C9 OLED, which is slanted to funnel audio towards the viewer – but it’s frustrating to see successful examples of this not pursued further, limited to just one or two model generations.
Our senior home entertainment editor, Nick Pino, speculates that “the reason not to make one this year isn’t based on any pre-existing issues [with the E Series design], but rather that LG decided it couldn’t innovate enough to warrant a new model.”
It’s possible that LG backed itself into a corner with the glass panel design. The TV market demands iteration, and the unique design constraints of a glass display may have meant there was less room to alter or improve its shape going forward compared to other designs (the GX really feels like an iteration on the W Series, rather than a standalone model).
OLED panels are also infamous for often getting damaged during production – given their sensitive, organic materials – and we can’t imagine an all-glass display offsetting worries about breakages either.
The LG E9 OLED is still on sale for those wanting something different – costing roughly half what it did at launch this time last year – and we recommend you take a look if you aren’t sold on the new Gallery Series GX OLED, which offers the only notable divergence from LG’s existing models. Processing enhancements are likely to be minimal compared to the 2020 range too.
But for those of us wanting something different from our televisions, it looks like we’ll have to look elsewhere – whether that’s Samsung’s zero-bezel Q950TS QLED, the rotating Samsung Sero TV, or Hisense’s wacky projector-TV hybrids – to do so.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung’s mid-range Galaxy A51 launches on AT&T and Xfinity Mobile</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AT&T and Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile are bringing Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 to their networks this month. The phone, which is the successor to the incredibly popular Galaxy A50, launched on Verizon and Sprint in April. Although Samsung plans to release a 5G version of the handset in the US later this summer, for now only the LTE-variant is available.
There’s a lot packed into the Galaxy A51. The phone comes with four rear cameras, including a main 48-megapixel camera, an ultrawide 12-megapixel camera with a 123-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth camera. Around the front there’s a 6.5-inch OLED display with a hole-punch notch containing a 32-megapixel selfie camera. There’s also an in-display fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Inside is a 4,000 mAh battery, which can be fast-charged at up to 15W, and the phone is powered by an Exynos 9611 processor.
Oh, and it’s also one of the two phones features in an absolutely wild Samsung ad from last year.
Although its flagship Galaxy S lineup generates the most press coverage, recent reports from market research firms Omdia and Counterpoint Research indicate that Samsung’s A-series phones are the ones that more people actually end up buying globally. Back in February, Omdia reported that the Galaxy A50, the predecessor to the A51, was the fourth best-selling smartphone of the year (behind the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, and Galaxy A10) and Counterpoint Research said it was the best-selling smartphone in Europe.
The Galaxy A51 is available to order today from both AT&T and Xfinity Mobile. The device will officially go on sale on Xfinity Mobile on May 8th.
Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonos may finally be releasing a new Playbar</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sonos Playbar may finally, at long last, be getting an upgrade, according to an image discovered by Dave Zatz over at Zatz Not Funny. The renders don’t show a power outlet or HDMI ports, which Zatz speculates may mean ports and any buttons are either recessed within the ledge or elsewhere along the sound bar (although it may also mean the renders are just not fully illustrated). Zatz’s images show both black and white versions.
Sonos debuted the Playbar in 2013, and there hasn’t been an update since. According to 9to5 Mac, the new Playbar will have support for Dolby Atmos, and Zatz says Apple AirPlay 2 support is likely as well. Sonos may also be planning new versions of its Play:5 wireless speaker and Sub subwoofer, 9to5 Mac reported, which Zatz says he’s confirmed.
In March, Sonos announced details of its Sonos S2 operating system, due to be released in June. The company said S2 will power “the next generation” of Sonos products and experiences.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India makes government tracing app mandatory for all workers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
NEW DELHI: India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow "considerable relaxations" in lower-risk districts.
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country's National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.
"Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public," India's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.
It will be the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations "to ensure 100per cent coverage of this app among the employees," the ministry said.
Officials at India's technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India's smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.
The app's compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.
"Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body," said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used "only for administering necessary medical interventions".
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.
India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Abu Dhabi: Abu Dhabi Airports has partnered with Tawazun Strategic Development Fund (TSDF) to launch the new CoDi BOT UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), designed and manufactured by UAE-based company Marakeb Technologies, for the disinfection of viruses including COVID-19.
The CoDi BOT UGV will be piloted from May throughout Abu Dhabi International Airport, including in staff areas and cargo facilities, as well as being used as part of cabin deserialization processes on passenger aircraft.
The CoDi BOT UGV is also designed to be able to manoeuvre through airplane cabins through remote control capability, using real-time video and high-speed 4G data connection.
The UGVs will be operated in conjunction with the extensive range of preventative measures implemented at Abu Dhabi International Airport in response to COVID-19. Measures include thermal screening, nasal swabbing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, in line with the recommendations by the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP).
“Introducing CoDi BOT UGV at Abu Dhabi International Airport reflects our commitment to adopting innovative technology, which can bolster the protection of our passengers and frontline staff against viruses,” said Shareef Hashim Al Hashmi, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Airports.
“We have a clear responsibility to ensure our spaces remain clear of any virus threat. By deploying artificial intelligence, it adds another layer of protection and builds on our comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak,” he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Abu Dhabi Airports has partnered with Tawazun Strategic Development Fund (TSDF) to launch the new CoDi BOT UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), designed and manufactured by UAE-based company Marakeb Technologies, an affiliate company of TSDF, for the disinfection of viruses including COVID-19.
The introduction of new state-of-the-art technology is the latest measure introduced by Abu Dhabi Airports to contain the spread of COVID-19, and aligns with the directives of Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Airports.
This collaboration is part of a broader initiative by Abu Dhabi Airports to integrate the most advanced technologies within its operations, to achieve a high level of efficiency, and provide the best services to its travellers.
The CoDi BOT UGV will be piloted from May throughout Abu Dhabi International Airport, including in staff areas and cargo facilities, as well as being used as part of cabin deserialization processes on passenger aircraft.
Specifically ensuring aircraft cabins are kept clean and sterile, the CoDi BOT UGV is designed to be able to manoeuvre through airplane cabin, which is a unique feature of this product, while ensuring the safety of its operators through remote control capability, using real-time video and high-speed 4G data connection.
“The introduction of the robot helps operational teams carry out safer missions during the sterilisation of aircraft while parked at Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH), eliminating the risk of human exposure and self-contamination. The robot’s versatility also enables the disinfection of spaces within the airport terminals, reinforcing public safety against COVID-19 and any future virus outbreaks,” Abu Dhabi Airports said in a statement.
The UGVs will be operated in conjunction with the extensive range of preventative measures implemented at Abu Dhabi International Airport in response to COVID-19. Measures include thermal screening, nasal swabbing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, in line with the recommendations by the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP).
“Introducing CoDi BOT UGV at Abu Dhabi International Airport reflects our commitment to adopting innovative technology, which can bolster the protection of our passengers and frontline staff against viruses. The acute impact of the pandemic would have heightened our overall sense of awareness toward hygiene, and as vital piece of public infrastructure, we have a clear responsibility to ensure our spaces remain clear of any virus threat. By deploying artificial intelligence, it adds another layer of protection and builds on our comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Shareef Hashim Al Hashmi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Airports.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: The World’s Tallest Donation Box was launched on Saturday in a collaboration between the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives (MBRGI) and the Burj Khalifa.
Launched as part of the ’10 million meals’ campaign, the World’s Tallest Donation Box enables companies, entities and the public to purchase one of the 1.2 million lights on the Burj Khalifa, for as little as Dh10 each, to collectively donate 1.2 million meals or food parcels to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the UAE.
For every light purchased for Dh10 through the website www.tallestdonationbox.com, one meal is provided to someone in need, as part of the UAE’s social efforts to support the most vulnerable against the economic and humanitarian challenges posed by the global pandemic.
The initiative aims to ignite the 1.2 million lights on the façade of the world’s tallest building, reflecting social solidarity and cohesion of the UAE’s diverse society to bring much-needed relief to coronavirus-hit communities across the country.
Individuals can purchase pixels (LED lights) on Burj Khalifa for as little as Dh10 each and donate a meal for low-income individuals and families in the UAE through the website www.tallestdonationbox.com.The number of meals donors provide is relative to the number of lights they purchase.
Individuals can provide their name and details and select the donation amount on the website or donate by selecting their preferred number of meals to purchase.
A countdown will be displayed on Burj Khalifa’s façade and the initiative’s website to track donations raised in real-time.
Donors will be able to share the pixels they bought on their social media to spread the word and encourage their followers to join the initiative and help provide meals for those most affected by the global pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to maintain your car during COVID-19 pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Most of us in the UAE are working from home, thanks to an insidious pandemic that has turned our world upside down. And our cars are sitting idle in the building car park, rented parking spaces, on the streets, and in open, sandy areas. Cars tend to be in the best condition when they are used, and maintained, regularly. The ‘using’ bit is not happening much nowadays, for obvious reasons, but with extremely basic maintenance, you can ensure that your car is ready for the job when you start using it regularly again.
The best way to avoid any damage to your car is to take it out for a drive for about 15 minutes at least once every 7 to 10 days. We are all allowed to go out to get essentials, like groceries and medicines. So, when you need those, it is a good idea to take the car out, after taking all the necessary precautions. Even if the supermarket is not far, take the longer route, drive around the block a few times to ensure you add 6 to 8km to the odometer.
Driving once a week will keep the fluids – engine oil, transmission fluid (gear oil), coolant, power-steering fluid – in circulation and keep the different components well lubricated.
Batteries are generally the first victims of extended car disuse. Another advantage of a weekly drive is that is it charges up the battery. Just starting the car and leaving it to idle for a few minutes is not enough. The car needs to be driven for at least 6 to 8km; you’ll know when you see the needle in temperature gauge rise from below C to position itself between C and H.
Tyres are a key safety component of a vehicle and are also expensive. If the car is left in one place for an extended period, with the normal running tyre pressure (between 32 and 35 Psi here in the UAE), the tyres can deteriorate more than in normal conditions as they lose pressure over time. Also, when the car is sitting in once place for a long time, flat spots appear on tyres at the place where the rubber touches the tarmac. This happens due to the weight of the vehicle. Tyres with flat spots are usually a fail at the annual car inspection.
So, you’ve decided not to use your car at all. The best thing to do in such a situation is to disconnect the battery by removing the negative terminal, followed by the positive terminal. This way, you’ll have a charged battery available when you decide to start using your car again. All you need to do is to re-connect both terminals, using a simple spanner from your car’s tool kit.
The aforesaid flat spot is your primary concern. The trick, of course, is to drive the car once a week. But you’ve decided not to and have also disconnected the battery. In that scenario, all you need to do it to put the car in neutral (this applies to both manual and automatic vehicles), disengage the handbrake/parking brake, and push the car very slightly (about 25cm) either front or backwards, depending on the space. This ensures that the portion of the tyre that meets the road is not the same – i.e it is changing every week or so. Remember: do this ONLY if the parking area is perfectly flat.
And, as mentioned earlier, tyres with normal running pressure, on cars that are not moving, can deteriorate soon. The trick is to inflate it to about 40 Psi once a month. One of the easiest ways to do this is by using an air compressor. A useable one can be bought online for as low as Dh80. But, of course, you’ll have to connect the car battery for that, to use it as a source of power for the air compressor.
Apart from the above, one basic must-do is car cleaning. Get your car washed at least once a week. The dust that accumulates on cars here impacts the paint in the long term, apart form making vehicles look bad. A bigger concern is bird droppings, which are quite acidic and can seriously damage your car’s paint work. A car wash or simple cleaning with wet cloth at least once a week can save you loads of headache.
Keeping fluids topped up is key for the well-being of your engine. Most of this is simple enough to do at home. You could buy a bottle of recommended coolant, power steering fluid, brake fluid and top them up in the respective reservoirs as and when the levels go below the marker point in these reservoirs. Even an engine oil change and oil filter change is doable in limited space and there are a lot of online videos that teach you how to. It is fairly simple. For, transmission oil and filter change, you’ll probably need to visit a service centre.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Cyprus launches voluntary tracking app to halt spread</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyprus' government has encouraged the use of a mobile phone app that locates people who may have come into contact with someone who has Covid-19.
The app allows people who test positive to coronavirus to share this information with public health authorities, who are then able to trace anyone who may have been in close proximity to them.
The app is called COVTRACER and it was developed in partnership with a government-funded research centre, Cyprus' Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy said today.
It also said that the use of this app is entirely voluntary.
Another mobile tracing app based on Bluetooth technology was abandoned due to privacy concerns.
The ministry said Cyprus backs a coordinated European approach in terms of tracing apps that might improve the management of COVID-19 across the continent, as well as speed up border openings as travel restrictions get lifted.
A stay-at-home order in Cyprus is set to ease on Monday, when retail stores will be allowed to reopen.
A nighttime curfew will remain in place until restrictions on movement are completely lifted, a move which is scheduled for May 21.
Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou said this week that flights to and from the island nation would resume after June 9, depending on how the pandemic unfolds.
To date, Cyprus has more than 860 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 20 deaths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So what’s next for Stadia after rolling out 4K streaming on the web, and 5.1 surround sound for players using a browser? According to code 9to5Google dug up in the app, Google is preparing to add the option for 4K and HDR-quality streaming on Android-powered TVs, as well as built-in messaging to rival other modern gaming services.
The ability to share captures as a link, or view lists of achievements also serve to match the likes of PSN and Xbox Live. There’s no indication about whether these features are close enough to release that players trying out its two free months will see them before deciding on a subscription, but we can hope.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sonos is reportedly giving the Playbar a long-awaited redesign</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">You’d be forgiven for thinking that Sonos had forgotten about the Playbar — while it’s been happy to introduce newer hardware like the Beam and Playbase, its original soundbar still has that 2013-era design and core functionality. At last, though, Sonos appears ready to give the Playbar a makeover. Zatz Not Funny has obtained what it says are “incomplete” renders of a redesigned Playbar. It’s not clear what physical ports the leaked bar would have, but it looks to be a much sleeker, curvier design that would feel more at home with modern TVs. A 9to5Mac tipster hinted at possible Dolby Atmos support, which might explain the new design — it’d need a place to put upward-firing speakers.
It’s not clear what connectivity the new Playbar would have, but it’s safe to say it would catch up with more recent Sonos devices to add features like AirPlay 2 streaming. It’s also possible you’ll see native voice control, although we certainly wouldn’t plan around it at this stage. You can be sure of support for Sonos S2, at least.
The ZNF leak didn’t mention release dates or pricing. This suggests Sonos is getting relatively close, though. Just be prepared to pay a hefty amount. The existing Playbar still has an official $749 price tag, and we wouldn’t expect it to dip below that given audio and connectivity upgrades. Not that this will necessarily be a problem. As with the Beam, the new Playbar might serve as a combination soundbar and high-end smart speaker that could ultimately save you money.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India requires all workers to use its COVID-19 tracking app</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COVID-19 contact tracing apps are frequently voluntary in those countries that have rolled them out so far, but India’s is effectively mandatory. The country’s home ministry will require that all workers, public or private, use its Aarogya Setu app starting May 4th. Company and government leaders will be responsible for enforcing adoption, officials said, and there will be “punishment” if there’s negligence.
The app has already been downloaded 80 million times, and the aim is to not only reach every smartphone user in the country (about 350 million) but reach basic phone users through an interactive voice system.
Like in other countries, widespread adoption of contact tracing apps could prove vital to curbing the spread of the new coronavirus. They might reduce or eliminate the need for further lockdowns while humanity waits for a vaccine. However, governments have generally shied away from requiring these apps, in part to assuage fears they might be used for mass surveillance. India clearly isn’t as worried about public perception.
Privacy activists aren’t happy, to no one’s surprise. Although the app relies on anonymous device identities and stores encrypted records of Bluetooth interactions with other devices, the Internet Freedom Foundation said the app doesn’t meet data protection standards or provide enough transparency for algorithms. Mozilla warned that it wasn’t certain how Aarogya Setu’s data would be used, and that there weren’t sufficient privacy laws to protect the public. This won’t necessarily lead to abuses of power, but there might not be much to stop those misuses if they do occur.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung's $399 Galaxy A51 comes to AT&T and Xfinity Mobile</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung’s Galaxy A51 is a viable alternative to the iPhone SE if you’re looking for a mid-priced phone, but you’ve been out of luck if you wanted to get it through a carrier besides Sprint or Verizon (Engadget’s parent company). You won’t have to wait longer for more options, though. AT&T and Xfinity Mobile have announced (via The Verge) that they’re carrying the A51, with orders open now. This is the LTE model rather than the 5G variant due in the summer, but you might not mind given the $399 price and lack of ubiquitous 5G coverage.
The A51 is running on a middling Exynos 9611 chip and doesn’t boast the zoom photography, wireless charging or 120Hz displays of the Galaxy S20 series, but it still offers a lot for the money. The 6.5-inch 1080p OLED screen, quad rear cameras (48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 5MP macro and 5MP depth), sizeable 4,000mAh battery and headphone jack should tick some of the biggest checkboxes for many users. This is for people who want the essence of a modern Samsung phone and aren’t particularly worried about performance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel is reportedly close to buying transit app creator Moovit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel’s autonomous driving ambitions may soon get a boost from a well-known app developer. Calcalist, The Marker and TechCrunch sources claim Intel is close to acquiring transit app developer Moovit in a deal that would be worth around $1 billion. The deal would reportedly fold Moovit into Intel’s Israeli automotive hub (currently led by Mobileye) and help with its overall self-driving strategy.
Moovit told TechCrunch it had no comment “at this time.” A deal is supposedly near enough that it could be unveiled within days.
It’s easy to see why Intel would be interested in Moovit, and not just because of existing financial backing. The startup uses a mix of AI and data analytics to monitor real-time traffic and offer transit directions to roughly 800 million people. That could be valuable for robotaxis and other driverless vehicles that need to consider live traffic to choose the fastest routes. If your Intel-powered ride avoids gridlock to reach your destination on time, you’ll know who to thank.

    <h5 class="mb-1">France will start testing its COVID-19 tracking app the week of May 11th</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">France was one of the first countries scrambling to create a COVID-19 contact tracing app, and now it’s close to finding out how its app works in practice. Digital Affairs Minister Cedric O has stated (via Reuters) that France’s StopCOVID should enter real-world testing the week of May 11th, right as the country will start easing pandemic lockdown measures. He didn’t say when the app might be ready for widespread use, although that’s likely to depend on initial results.
And before you ask: no, France isn’t budging on its desire to loosen Apple’s Bluetooth restrictions for the sake of the app. While O acknowledged that both France’s centralized approach (which stores identifiers for positive contacts in one place) had Apple’s decentralized method had flaws, he argued that the method supported by iOS was “crippling.” It allegedly had inferior data protections and gave up control, making it difficult for a health authority to learn from info without asking tech companies.
The minister was aware that trusting a central organization created the potential for abuse, but saw French control of health policy as a “sovereign prerogative” that shouldn’t be handed over to private companies. He also noted that France would move forward regardless of whether or not Apple changed its mind. The iPhone version is “satisfactory,” he said. Still, it’s clear the French government is hoping Apple will bend by the time StopCovid is widely available.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH | Medical graduate joins Covid-19 front line, thanks to crowdfunding effort</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After battling to graduate for two years due to unpaid university fees, clinical associate Retshidisitswe Kotane, finally found her happy ending when she was deployed to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) which is at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19.
Kotane was finally able to register with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) at the beginning of February, after a crowdfunding initiative on the Feenix crowdfunding platform raised R92 000 so that she could settle her outstanding fees.
The clinical associate is now employed at Netcare Linksfield hospital, and works at the NICD as part of the virology team of professionals testing for Covid-19. 
Kotane told News24 she still couldn't believe how everything worked out after waiting for many years to realise her dream of working in the healthcare industry. 
"It feels unreal. I feel like someone is going to wake me up," she said.
She added that she had been volunteering her skills for nearly two years because she was "passionate" about her work.
"I was happy to volunteer just to put my skill and knowledge to practice."
"It feels unreal, especially to be part of this team. It's the NICD for crying out loud. I didn't see myself here. I thought I'd always be at a local clinic or private GP, but I'm here...I still don't believe it," the clinical associate said.

Kotane said she had to raise the funds to pay off her university fees so she could register with the HPCSA. Mere days after registering, she received a call about an offer - a locum contract at a private clinic. 
"I don't know how I got that call, but I just got a call that said there is a locum contract. If I was interested, could I start immediately," she said.
Three days into the locum contract, she received another phone call, with even better news - an opportunity to work at the NICD. 
Kotane said that although being at the front line of the pandemic has meant that she was unable to see her family, she was happy to be able to learn from the NICD and being part of a historical moment for humankind. 
"I'm excited to be learning so much, to be a part of something this big. I mean, it has shut the whole world. I love it, I'm enjoying it. I think I'm the only one who is always happy to come here," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk says he is 'selling almost all physical possessions' and Tesla share price is too high in latest bizarre Twitter spree</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Elon Musk's will sell "almost all" his physical possessions and said that his own company is overvalued in a string of bizarre Twitter posts.
The outburst comes in the wake of widely criticised comments about the lockdown, which he called "fascistic" and suggested should be lifted to give America its "freedom".
Mr Musk echoed those calls in his latest posts, writing "now give people back their FREEDOM" before going on to post a series of tweets quoting the US national anthem.
"I am selling almost all physical possessions," the first of the posts read. "Will own no house."
Mr Musk then went onto write "Tesla stock price is too high imo". The comments appeared to lead the share price to drop immediately, falling 10 per cent in the wake of the posts.
"Now give people back their FREEDOM," the third post read. Mr Musk then posted the final lines of the US national anthem.
In recent days, many of Mr Musk's posts have criticised the government lockdown and attempted to suggest that the public are misled over the scale of the coronavirus crisis.
In a flurry of tweets earlier this week, he posted "FREE AMERICA NOW" and "Give people their freedom back".
He also used a Tesla earnings call to attack the lockdown as "fascistic" as part of a impassioned diatribe.
Mr Musk has been known to use his Twitter account to post controversial and unusual messages in the past.
He has said in the past that the strange nature of those messages has led to Twitter locking his account, fearing that they had been posted by a hacker.
The impact of the Tesla chief executive's tweets on his company's share price has led to suggestions that his tweets should be reviewed before they are posted, though Mr Musk later claimed that was not happening because of "freedom of speech".
The popularity of Mr Musk's Twitter account – which has 33 million followers – has led to it becoming a key focus for hackers and scammers. But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk's official account.
The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk's other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity's return to the moon's surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Galaxy M21 was launched in India in March, and the pricing of the phone started from INR 12,999. However, after the Indian government hiked taxes (GST) on smartphones in the country last month, Samsung had to increase the pricing of its devices accordingly, including the Galaxy M21. Now, the pricing of the mid-range device has been dropped again.
Samsung has dropped the price of the 64GB variant of the Galaxy M21 from INR 14,222 to INR 13,199. The price of the 128GB variant of the phone has been decreased from INR 16,499 to INR 15,499. The phone will be available for purchase from Amazon.in once the COVID-19 lockdown in India ends in the next few days.
The Galaxy M21 features a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-U display with Full HD resolution and a 20MP front-facing camera. At the rear, the phone has a 48MP+8MP+5MP triple-camera setup as well as a capacitive fingerprint reader. A 6000mAh battery powers the phone, and there’s support for 15W fast wired charging.
The phone runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 and is equipped with the Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM, 64GB/128GB storage, and a microSD card slot. The Galaxy M21 features a dual-SIM card slot, LTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone also features Dolby Atmos audio and Face Unlock, and it comes in two colors: Black and Blue.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung is aware of Galaxy Chromebook’s battery life problem, working on a fix</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung launched the Galaxy Chromebook, arguably the best-looking Chrome OS laptop ever, four months ago. It has a beautiful red aluminum body, a 4K Super AMOLED touchscreen with DisplayHDR 400, and an S Pen. However, its battery doesn’t last as long as Samsung’s marketing claims, and the company is aware of this issue.
Most Galaxy Chromebook reviews praised the laptop’s vibrant design and fantastic screen, but they also pointed out its below-par battery life despite the Project Athena certification. Samsung is reportedly fully aware of the Galaxy Chromebook’s battery life issues. The company isn’t sitting idly, and it is working with Google to pinpoint the reason for the laptop’s low battery life.
There is still no confirmation as to how Google and Samsung will solve this issue, and when a software update would be rolled out. The report states that the South Korean electronics giant is working on the battery life issue as a high priority, so the update should come sooner than later.
To remind you, the Galaxy Chromebook uses the Intel Core i5 10210U processor, which is a U series model with 15W TDP. On the other hand, most other Chromebooks use Intel’s Y-series processors with 5W TDP. Its 4K OLED screen doesn’t help either, consuming a lot of power while churning out over 700 nits of brightness in specific scenarios.
The companies could be working on a newer CPU power governer so that the processor consumes less power while doing lighter tasks. Google and Samsung could also use the laptop’s Ambient EQ sensor to lower the screen brightness in indoor conditions so that the display sips power from the 49.2Wh battery rather than gulping it.
If you’ve purchased the $1,000 Galaxy Chromebook, let us know your experience with the laptop’s performance and battery life via the comments section below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Although the Galaxy A51 was unveiled in December last year, the phone was announced for the US market only last month. The mid-range smartphone first became available through AT&T, Samsung, Sprint, and Verizon, and now, the Galaxy A51 can also be purchased through Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile.
If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy A51 from Xfinity Mobile in the US, you should know that it is currently available only in one color: Prism Crush Black. It is priced at $399 for the 4GB RAM + 128GB storage variant.
If you opt for a 24-month contract, the phone can be yours for just $12.5 per month, which turns out to a total cost of $300. However, you need to transfer your number or get a new line to get the $100 discount. The estimated delivery date for the Galaxy A51 is listed as May 8.
The Galaxy A51 features a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screen with Full HD+ resolution and an under-display fingerprint reader. It runs Android 10 and uses the Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, and has a microSD card slot.
The phone has a 32MP selfie camera on the front and a 48MP+12MP+5MP+5MP quad-camera setup on the rear. The Galaxy A51 is powered by a 4,000mAh battery and supports 15W fast charging via a USB Type-C port. If you’re interested in the smartphone, you can read our Galaxy A51 review here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With wearing masks now a daily routine, I miss Samsung’s iris scanner</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung gets a lot of things right with its flagships, but in recent years, biometrics haven’t been one of them. The capacitive fingerprint sensor on Galaxy flagships changed positions a few times between the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9, and it failed to be as convenient as the front-facing sensor that Samsung had been using before. Samsung then switched to an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint reader with the Galaxy S10, and we all know that sensor is not as amazing as the company had made it out to be.
Facial recognition is the other biometric solution we find on Galaxy flagships today. However, it’s not something that works all of the time. It also can’t be used for security inside apps because facial recognition with a regular camera is easy to fool. And in our current times, when you can’t step out of the house without a mask on, facial recognition is turning out to be quite useless and making me miss the iris scanner Samsung’s flagships used to have back before the Galaxy S10 came around.
India has been under lockdown since March 25. Unless you need to buy medicine, grocery, and other essential items, it’s not recommended to step out. But my father had fallen ill a couple of months ago, and though he is almost back to full health now, his recovery phase over the last couple of weeks has necessitated quite a few trips to the hospital. I have been out of the house a lot in recent weeks as a result, both for grocery shopping and for those hospital trips, and wearing a mask has become almost a daily routine for me.
And, well, you probably know where I’m going with this. With facial recognition failing to work with a mask on, I’ve had to fall back to using the fingerprint sensor on my Galaxy S20 Ultra all the time, at least when I’m out. That wouldn’t have been a problem if Samsung was still equipping its flagships with an iris scanner. Sadly, that isn’t the case, mainly because every manufacturer is chasing the dream of truly bezel-free displays, which leaves no space for anything but a regular front-facing camera in our smartphone screens.
The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works well most of the time, but having an iris scanner would have been a lot more convenient. It would be great if Samsung could implement an option that allows facial recognition to register your face and work with a mask on. That wouldn’t be very secure and could be very, very easy to fool. But desperate times call for desperate measures – we can’t get those iris scanners back, so how about a middle-of-the-road solution that makes unlocking our phones with masks on less of a hassle?
What do you think?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung not shifting phone production to Vietnam as Korea overcomes COVID19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When the COVID19 pandemic first began, South Korea was the country hit the hardest after China. The virus has since caused havoc across the globe while strict measures taken by the South Korean government have enabled the company to put a lid on the situation.
Samsung’s manufacturing facilities had to suffer shutdowns due to confirmed coronavirus cases. At one point, it was reported that the company was planning to shift premium phone production to Vietnam to offset delays at its Gumi plant in South Korea. However, Samsung appears to have given up on that idea as South Korea is now one of the few countries where the COVID19 situation is under control.
The Gumi plant in South Korea is where Samsung’s premium smartphones like the Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Z Flip are manufactured. It had to be shut down for a couple of days due to confirmed COVID19 cases. The bulk of its smartphone manufacturing is still done in Vietnam and the company was thinking about temporarily moving the production of these devices to the country as well.
The COVID19 situation in South Korea was much worse at that time so it would have made sense for the company to do that in order to ensure that it could continue to put these phones on the market. The virus had struck not long after the Galaxy Z Flip was launched so it was important for Samsung to ensure a steady supply of its new foldable smartphone.
Reports out of South Korea suggest that Samsung has withdrawn this plan because the situation is now under control in its home country even as the virus causes disruption across the globe. Earlier this week, South Korea reported no locally transmitted cases of the virus, a highly commendable achievement.
If anything, there’s now the expectation that the Gumi plant will be able to plug the production gap for other markets should the pandemic cause disruption at some of Samsung’s other manufacturing facilities across the globe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigabyte: Intel Z490 motherboards will support 11th-gen Core Rocket Lake CPUs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel's latest 10th generation Comet Lake-S CPUs are going to be rather power-hungry, especially at the high end. And since they require a new, LGA 1200 socket, gamers and enthusiasts will want to pair these with Z490 motherboards, which are going to be expensive in all but their most modest incarnations.
Z490 motherboards bring with them a number of new features, most notably support for PCIe 4.0 and much improved wired and wireless networking chipsets, depending on model. Some of them will run you north of $700, so the obvious question on everyone's mind is: Will these motherboards support Intel's next generation CPUs which are slated for a 2021 launch? The answer is yes. At least 11th-gen Rocket Lake S support is apparently guaranteed.
Gigabyte recently confirmed this during its latest Aorus Direct livestream. For those of you who like future-proofing your build as much as possible, knowing that Z490 motherboards will support Rocket Lake processors can certainly offer some peace of mind. AMD has had a ton of success with this strategy with Ryzen and the AM4 socket.
For those unaware, Intel didn't bake in PCIe 4.0 support into the Z490 chipset or Comet Lake CPUs that you'll be able to buy this year. And while graphics cards aren't even touching the limits of PCIe 3.0, it's a different story if you're interested in taking advantage of PCIe 4.0 SSDs.
The next-gen Rocket Lake CPUs will come with 20 PCIe 4.0 lanes, which is why manufacturers like Gigabyte are touting support for that in their marketing materials. It's worth noting that the Gigabyte rep that confirmed the support for Rocket Lake in Z490 motherboards was hesitant about giving out the information, which suggests that Intel may not have wanted to reveal this at this point.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This graphics processor is strange. As you can see from the image, from the outside it’s more like a CPU than a GPU. It sits in a socket using almost three thousand pins. It has an integrated heat spreader.
Inside, it’s like nothing we've seen before. Using the AA battery for scale, the chip is about 4000mm2. If the active area is half that size, that's three times the size of an RTX 2080 Ti. It has “tens of billions” of transistors, while the RTX 2080 Ti has just under twenty billion.
But what sort of GPU is it? For the time being, this processor eludes classification as the information Intel has provided is contradictory. Koduri previously said that the “father of all” is a Xe HP (high performance) product. Later on, he would also mention this chip supports BF16, a very niche AI acceleration compute format. BF16 is a confirmed, exclusive feature of Xe HPC (high performance compute). This chip could therefore be a Xe HPC product...
Baap means father in Hindi, and Baahubali is a mythical hero of sorts. Xe is being developed in India.
The difference between the two is substantial. Xe HP is oriented towards gaming and workstations. Leaks pin the core counts at between 1024 and 4096. Xe HPC is for servers and optimized for AI and scientific work. The single HPC product under development is codenamed Ponte Vecchio, it is said to have 1024 cores, but is by far the most powerful accelerator Intel is developing by virtue of its complex memory subsystem and the variety of cores and operations it supports. You can read more about this in our in-depth breakdown on Xe.
While neither HP nor HPC can be ruled out definitively, the nature of the latter seems more suitable to the new mystery processor. It would be quite strange for a gaming/workstation processor to be prototyped in a socket-based format, whereas Ponte Vecchio has already been depicted in what could be a socket.
Further, from early schematics and presentations, Ponte Vecchio could be expected to be unprecedentedly large due to the inclusion of the high-footprint RAMBO cache and onboard HBM2 (or HBM2E). There is no reason to expect a HP product to be so large.
Regardless of what exactly this GPU is, the “father of all” will undoubtedly have the mother of all price tags, so you’d better start saving. Xe HP will release sometime this year and Ponte Vecchio will be ready in late 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Intel's Raja Koduri confirms that massive 'father of all' GPU is aimed at the data center</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel tweeted a photo teasing a massive and mysterious GPU on Friday, and in doing so, lit the internet aflame with speculation. Early on, pretty much everyone settled on it being a form of Intel's upcoming Xe HP or Xe HPC. As a reminder, Intel's Xe Graphics architecture will span three derivatives: Xe LP, Xe HP, and Xe HPC.
Intel's own Raja Koduri seemingly straddled the fence between Xe HP and Xe HPC with a tweet, saying "The 'baap of all' is back, battle-fielding and b-floating." The "battle-fielding" seemed to suggest some sort of consumer or prosumer facing product, indicating Xe HP. Although, the "b-floating" suggested that the GPU was more aligned with Xe HPC.
The "b-floating" remark refers to the bfloat16 floating-point format, which is mainly used for deep learning and AI acceleration. While BF16 is key to Intel's supercomputer and HPC strategy, Intel is also adopting BF16 support for its upcoming Cooper Lake-SP Xeons via the AVX-512 BF16 extensions.
Initially, there was some speculation that this GPU -- housed inside of a massive LGA package replete with an IHS -- could be Intel's 7nm Ponte Vecchio, destined for the Aurora Supercomputer in 2021. However, by early guesstimates, the GPU being teased looks to have four compute chiplets and four stacks of HBM2e memory. That would rule out Ponte Vecchio.
More importantly, Koduri has now confirmed that this GPU is indeed a slice of Intel's Xe HP silicon (and not Xe HPC/Ponte Vecchio), and is targeted at data centers. With that Koduri has put to rest certain conjectures that assumed this card would be aimed at consumers and would outperform products that don't currently exist.
Although, Koduri also dropped another tease, suggesting that an even bigger GPU could succeed this one. "This was called the 'baap of all' by our team....The 'Baahubali of all' is baking as well," said Koduri in a tweet.
Best anyone can tell, Koduri's "Baahubali" reference is loosely referring to an Indian hero/epic action movie he was involved with, suggesting that the "father of all" will be succeeded by something even more substantial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Elon Musk, EPA at odds over mileage range for Tesla Model S sedan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Once again, Elon Musk has put his foot in his mouth.
The man branded Tech Covidiot No.1 for tweeting dubious claims about the coronavirus, said in an earnings call this week that the Environmental Protection Agency made a mistake when it tested his new Model S sedan — resulting in a lower mileage range then Tesla had stated.
“We increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X,” Musk said during the call. “Actually, we said that, actually, the model — the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, [EPA] left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car — and it did this overnight. And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range. And as a result, it had a 391 test.
“As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we’re actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months — the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles,” he continued.
But the EPA shot back at Musk, and said he is mistaken.
“We can confirm that EPA tested the vehicle properly, the door was closed, and we are happy to discuss any technical issues with Tesla, as we do routinely with all automakers,” the EPA said in a statement to The Verge.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Southwest Airlines CEO claims it’s safe to fly despite coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The CEO of Southwest Airlines claimed Sunday that it’s safe to fly again despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking on “Face the Nation” on CBS, Gary Kelly said the airline had taken extreme measures to ensure passengers would be safe from the COVID-19 virus and that the company’s jets were “as safe as humanly possible.”
“We’re doing everything possible to encourage people to come back and fly,” Kelly told Margaret Brennan. “We’re cleaning airplanes, we’re requiring masks of our employees and our customers, we’re using very deep cleaning overnight, we’re using electrostatic misters which will kill the virus on surfaces for up to 30 days.”
“We’re exercising social distancing on board the aircraft,” Kelly said. “We won’t be booking airplanes full so that people can spread out. So, absolutely we’re doing everything we can to make it as safe as humanly possible.”
Kelly’s remarks come after other major airlines, including Delta, United, American, and JetBlue, announced that passengers would be required to wear protective masks on flights and that other safety measures against the coronavirus would be put in place.
The airline industry has been hard hit by the virus, which has reduced air travel to a bare minimum amid lockdowns and travel restrictions — and Southwest is no exception.
Kelly said nearly 400 of the airline’s fleet has been grounded during the lockdown.
“The demand is not there,” he told Brennan. “So, obviously if things don’t improve we have to downsize.”
“We’ve never had a furlough in our history, we’ve never had a pay cut in our history, and I’m extraordinarily proud of that. We certainly don’t want to break that record. What I had promised our people is I don’t know what the future holds but I do know that we are very well prepared.”
He said the last measure for the financially strapped air carrier would be involuntary furloughs for the airline’s more than 60,000 employees.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
South Africa is seeking to create a new thriving national airline out of the ashes of its current state-owned carrier, which is technically insolvent and on the brink of being placed in liquidation by administrators.
South African Airways (SAA) has recorded no profit since 2011 and has survived through government bailouts.
An ideal replacement for South African Airways would have both public and private owners, maintain the country’s trade connections and make a profit, the department of public enterprises said in a statement on Friday.
The embattled national carrier has been involuntary business rescue since December last year.
The rescue practitioners late last month said the airline cannot survive beyond month-end, and the choices left are either a forced liquidation or a winding down process.
All its flights have been grounded since South Africa closed its borders and went into a five-week nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March which has made the survival of SAA, which employs 5,200 employees, even more uncertain.
The airline’s troubles were further worsened last month when the government refused to pay yet another 10 billion rand (531 million dollars) in emergency aid to the company, claiming resources had been stretched by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Stakeholders (…) have agreed on a long-term vision and strategy” with a view to “the creation of a new dynamic airline,” public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said.
The minister said it will not be the old SAA but the beginning of a new journey towards the constitution of a newly restructured company which will be the new standard of South Africa. The new carrier is set to compete in the post-COVID-19 world.
According to the statement, SAA employees will be transitioned and new leadership and equity partners will be sought.
The demise of SAA would mark an end of era for the 86-year old airline which had gone through years of financial troubles associated and high debt associated with poor management.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Not relenting on his dreams and visions to make Nigeria a better place by providing alternative job opportunities for the agile youths, Bishop Sam Zuga is set to officially launch the first Mobile communication App in Africa, also the best communication App called, “SAMZUGA CHAT”
The App which is designed to work exactly and more effective than other communication APPS like, Whatsapp and others boasts of more interesting features.
The launch of the “SAMZUGA CHAT” is in accordance with the Samzuga vision 0202-2020 and to step up the “AFRICA WAKE UP” sensitization campaign.
The event which is slated to hold by 10am on Tuesday, May 5,  coincides with the 49th birthday of the Bishop.
The launch will take place at the SAMZUGA FOUNDATION OFFICE, as the occasion is expected to accommodate less than 20 people while the live coverage will be made available on his official Facebook page (bishop sam zuga page) and Instagram platform.
According to the philanthropic Cleric the capital intensive project has been successfully hosted by Google play store, Amazon store and other App stores around the Globe.
“The Launch is expected to accommodate less than 20 people but will create impact on millions of people in Nigeria, Africa and the world at large. I will be eternally grateful if you can do this for me. You are specially invited to visit play store and other Apps stores to download the SamZuga Chat App. It is available on all platforms and devices,” he stated.
The Bishop also added that he plans to reward early users of this App pretty soon.

Apple is doing its part to slow the spread of the coronavirus by releasing a software update that makes it easier for smartphone users to log in without taking off face masks.
As governments across the globe are mandating that people don protective gear in public, a new operating system will improve the experience of unlocking an iPhone through Face ID while wearing a face mask, as seen in a Twitter video.
The clips, posted yesterday by Apple software developers, show that iPhones with iOS 13.5 Beta will automatically be prompted to use the manual passcode entry if using Face ID while wearing a face covering.
This way, users don’t have to potentially expose themselves to disease by taking off their face mask to log in. It also eliminates the hassle of having to physically locate the passcode entry option.
Apple hopes that the improvement will reduce the spread of COVID-19 among those who log in to their phones multiple times per day.
Apple’s iOS 13.5 software is projected to be available in the coming weeks, although it’s unclear if the face mask-detecting function will be in the update’s final version, reports TechCrunch.
A recent Australian study found that the average smartphone is riddled with hundreds of strains with bacteria.
“People have to understand that mobile phones are Trojan horses for microbial presence,” said Dr. Lotti Tajouri of Brisbane’s Bond University. The molecular expert added that even if you wash your hands hundreds of times, “if you then touch a contaminated phone, you are contaminating yourself all over again.”

Consumer Reports has analyzed the privacy policies of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and WebEx and discovered that they may be collecting more data than many people realize.
To be clear: Consumer Reports isn’t saying that these apps are unsafe to use. (Indeed, a separate Mozilla report found that nearly every major videoconferencing app meets basic security standards.) But by agreeing to the privacy policies of these services, you are giving companies like Google and Microsoft access to plenty of personal data.
According to the report, all three companies reserve the right to collect information from your calls, including how long a call lasts, who’s participating in the call, and the IP addresses of everyone taking part.
As the world has become more reliant on videoconferencing tools, people have also started to scrutinize the security measures and privacy policies of these services.
And while not as alarming as the security holes in Zoom that came to light in April, leading to a host of “Zoombombing” and other concerns, it’s still worth being aware of the data that Microsoft, Google, and Cisco can collect.
None of the companies mentioned go into specific details on what kind of data is actually being collected or how it’s being used. Consumer Reports does note that the data collected here could be combined with information from other sources to create personal profiles on users and their use habits, or even potentially use videos for things like training facial recognition systems.
All three companies told Consumer Reports that they only create video recordings or transcripts when participants request them by recording the meetings and promised that the recordings aren’t “directly” used for advertising.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ISRO’s Gaganyaan: COVID-19 interrupts future of the mission; check details</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The training of the four Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots who are in Russia for 11 months of advance training for the Gaganyaan Human Mission has been put on hold due to lockdown due to global pandemic of COVID-19. The mission is expected to be launched in 2022 from India and is likely to carry these astronauts into low earth orbit in Space. “These pilots were expected to come back end of the year and get on with the module-specific training in India. All this has now been pushed back, as the Russia leg of the training will only finish next year,” explained a top officer who wished to remain anonymous.
“Russia’s Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) located at Star City, about 30km from Moscow has been regularly training crew for more than fifty years. Not only the Russian cosmonauts, but astronauts from various other countries, including the USA also go there for training,” Milind Kulshreshtha, C4I expert.
Crew training and Gaganyaan’s systems testing are two most critical activities listed for Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) this year. This was announced by the ISRO chairman K Sivan during a media interaction earlier this year.
ISRO’s Human Spaceflight Centre (HSFC) is involved in the mission planning, Systems Engineering for human survival in space, up to the stage of crew selection and training. In the Gaganyaan mission, the first of three flights was scheduled within a year, initial two flights to be unmanned but with humanoids onboard.
Even ISRO scientists are all working from home and through video conferencing. However, some scientists are out to work on projects following strict COVID-19 Social Distancing Protocols.
The R&D and manufacturing is not progressing and this is expected to have an impact on mission plans for the first Gaganyaan launch with a Humanoid.
Milind Kulshreshtha, C4I expert says, “The Russian Training Centre has tailor-made specialized equipment and gadgets to ensure specific mission-related training. This involves simulating the launch, space flight and reentry procedure, with such technology not yet developed in India.”
He highlights the space training facilities at the Centre in Russia, which includes:
This is to assist in astronavigation knowledge of the crew and for taking measurements using optical instruments. In this a planetarium facility recreating the sky as would be encountered by the crew has been created. This is to help the astronauts get used to this as they will see this during their scheduled flight and same as would be visible from the spacecraft window during the transit.
Short-term weightlessness training aboard aircraft to enhance crew skills and sense of orientation in weightlessness environment.
This is to attune space crew’s central nervous system to tolerate high gravitational effect experienced during the flight.
A full-scale spacecraft module has been recreated in a pool for crew practice working inside a spacecraft, wearing a heavy spacesuit. The model is immersible in water using hydraulic mechanism.
A simulated Main Control Console is used for training the pilots individually and for activities as a team.”
ISRO had planned launch of some major missions in next one year, with Gagaanyan-1 aimed by end of this year. Solar spacecraft Aditya and Chandrayaan-3 were also major missions scheduled by2021. The on-schedule launch of GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 rocket on March 5, 2020 too got postponed just a day prior to launch due to ‘some’ technical reason, as announced by ISRO.
With the focus of the government on funding fight against COVID-19 pandemic, all strategic projects are likely to have budget restrictions. The Ministry of Defence has already announced hold on capital procurements at least for this quarter and future capital procurements too are under a shadow for now.
The likelihood that ISRO projects which are under strategic category too shall face a slowdown, not only due to pandemic restriction in work process flow but due to budget constraints in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID and HR Tech: How HR can use smart AI tools</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Covid-19 and the resultant impact on the economy have necessitated growth oriented organisations to rethink their business offerings, processes and business models. Business leaders are engrossed with the thinking around how to rejuvenate their businesses using lean principles with an eye on preserving their cash. HR leaders are therefore required to support their business leaders in purposeful ways which would enable the businesses to continue to function while the changes are being introduced.
At the heart of this change management process is people and this is the time that businesses would need to know what talent to retain, what new specialist talent to hire and how productive is the talent that is working from home. There are many digital technologies that have transformative impact on HR but have not yet become mainstream. Now is the time that business and HR would see significant advantage in adopting them.
AI and analytics tools, for instance, have been implemented in various functions but not so much in HR. In these times, these tools could enable swift and smart decision-making that can not only save capital but also have the ability to help build the future with smart resourcing and realignment of resources retained who could be quickly upskilled or cross-skilled based on the detailing of their competencies.
With work from home having become an essential way to continue to do business, HR managers would have to work in close tandem with IT managers in the areas of data security, confidentiality and compliances. Many organisations ‘certify’ employees for their knowledge of compliances based on the online courses employees are advised to take.
Smart AI tools from startups like Ahura are now being deployed for checking the exact time spent on the material vs watching TV or spending time on social media during the course and by monitoring their eye contacts it is now possible to provide meaningful feedback to the employees as well as their managers on the efficacy of learning.
Wearables have been touted as fashion accessories and there have been attempts to use them in the context of fitness and health but have not become mainstream so far. Covid- 19 is probably the reason why employees could be encouraged by HR managers to adopt wearables as they would be able to access data related to corona virus parameters and alert employees from the likely infection or coming to work or manage quarantine processes. Smart wrist band Tracesafe used in Hong Kong could be used to suggest which employees should work from home necessarily and thus prevent the entire office going into quarantine mode.
Since remote learning has come to stay, L&D managers have to identify learning platforms which not only have the ability to host content but can deliver content to employees as per their individual needs based on skill requirements. Since organisations would be interested in deploying a talent pool comprising employees as well as gig economy workers, HR and business managers would benefit by using learning and HR systems that provide real-time skills status and enable planning for upskilling or new resourcing based on this information.
New business models, changes in work norms and new methods for assessing people – not by experience or education but on their sheer capabilities would be adopted by organisations. Digital transformation that has skipped HR function in many organisations has now assumed urgency and as a result we would see several digital technologies that have been given cursory consideration in the past getting assimilated and becoming mainstream.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zoom 5.0: Your video calls are now safe and secure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest update to Zoom video conferencing app is now generally available. This release delivers one of Zoom’s most advanced security enhancements to date with support for AES 256-bit GCM encryption, which provides added protection for meeting data and greater resistance to tampering. What does this new encryption algorithm mean for you, and what other security functionality should users be aware of? Here are five things that answer your queries about Zoom 5.0:
AES 256-bit GCM encryptionZoom 5.0 supports the current encryption and GCM encryption. A system-wide account enablement to GCM encryption will occur on May 30, 2020, and only Zoom clients on version 5.0 or later, including Zoom Rooms, will be able to join Zoom Meetings starting May 30.
Report a User featureMeeting hosts and co-hosts can report a user in their meeting who is misusing the Zoom platform. Found in the Security icon, the option sends a report to Zoom’s Trust & Safety team for review.
New encryption iconA new encryption shield appears in the upper left of Zoom Meeting window and indicates a secure, encrypted meeting. After May 30, the shield will be green, denoting enhanced GCM encryption.
Enhanced data center information
Meeting hosts can now select data centre regions at the scheduling level for meetings and webinars. The Zoom client also shows which data centre you’re connected to in the Info icon.
Ending/leaving meetings
Zoom has refined the action of ending or leaving a Zoom Meeting to make it easier and more secure. With a new UI update, hosts can decide between ending or leaving. If the host leaves, they can select a new host and have the confidence that the right person is left with host privileges.
Additional security enhancements:
Profile picture control: Account admins and hosts can disable the ability for participants to show their profile picture and prevent changing it in a meeting.
Minimum password length: This will be six characters for meetings, webinars, and cloud recordings.
Cloud recording security: Admins and meeting hosts can set expirations on their cloud recordings and can disable the sharing of their recordings.
Updating to Zoom 5.0Zoom end users: Upgrade to Zoom 5.0 by visiting the Zoom download page.
Zoom administrators: Get detailed information on how to manage this update for various endpoints in your environment on the Zoom 5.0 IT administrators page.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TL;DR: Get ready for your close up with this beauty ring light for $50.99, a 15% savings as of May 2. 
With everyone settling into their new stay-at-home routines, it's no longer a question of what you'll wear, but how to look presentable on Zoom. If you're working from home, you still want to appear put together in front of your colleagues. If you're dating from home, you still want to make sure you're looking cute and presentable.
Thankfully, video conferences don't require wearing pants (you should still wear them though), but if you do want to look your best, the least you can do is take a shower, wear an appropriate top, and secure great lighting. Sitting in front of a bright window is a rookie mistake. It will only cause the camera to underexpose and produce a dark silhouette.
Your best bet is to use something like the Beauty Ring Light with Mirror, which will give you the ample illumination you need to look fab in your subsequent virtual meetings and social engagements. This personal ring light has a built-in mirror and a tripod, so you don't have to worry too much about installation. It has ten brightness modes and three color adjustments — white light, natural light, and warm light  — all of which can easily be controlled via the included remote.
Check it out:
Of course, given that it's a beauty ring light, it can also help you apply makeup better. There's a two-sided mirror attached, which can be used normally or be magnified for extreme close-ups  —you know, when you're tweezing your brows or popping a zit. Everything's DIY these days so we can use all the help we can get.
Ready to look poppin' on your next video meeting? Get the Beauty Ring Light on sale for only $50.99 — 15% off the usual cost of $60.

The Charge Running app offers guided on-demand and live running sessions that are both effective and motivational. Its interactive chat feature also allows you to engage with an empowering, tight-knit community of runners.
I am the type of person who loves being on her own, especially when working out. It's an hour of my day where I get to completely zone out and just escape from all responsibilities. So, it's weird for me to admit that my workouts feel very lonely nowadays. But it's true.
I miss dodging people on my evening runs through the sidewalks of New York. I miss the crowded gym after work. I even miss feeling annoyed that all the treadmills are taken at said gym (even when I've managed to get there early).
So when I got an email about the Charge Running app, which offers both live and on-demand trainer-led running classes, I downloaded it immediately. Rather than strictly tracking data like distance, cadence, and pace, the app has remote trainers guiding you through each of your runs. 
The app is free to download on both iOS and the Google Play Store, and you get a two-week free trial. After that, it's $14.99 for a one-month subscription or $120.99 for an annual subscription.
Depending on your skill level and the class, Charge's trainers will talk you through each run based on energy exertion levels (which I'll get to later). That way, there's a lot more room to modify the experience based on your own metrics.
If you're unable to run outside due to the weather (or your personal preference), the classes can be easily adaptable to a treadmill. They're a great companion to have on your runs in general, especially during what feels like an endless period of social distancing. 
Whether you're joining in on a live run or opting for an on-demand class, each one does an excellent job of offering plenty of tips and direction, from trainers or the app's tight-knit community, that really help to motivate you. 
The Charge Running app offers a super simple user experience, so there's really not much of a learning curve.
Under the Browse tab is where you'll find all the live runs happening that day. You can scroll through to see the type of run, duration, trainer, and the time of day it starts. 
Since the app comes with iCal integration, those with iOS can add the run to their calendar and receive a notification before it starts. And, given the live runs are scheduled fairly far out in advance, it's easy to coordinate your workouts ahead of time. 
Additionally, the Browse section includes virtual events and runs — a lot of which are themed depending on the month. For May, you can choose between a Star Wars-themed run ("May the 4th be with you - 2 mile") or a Mother's Day race.
Below that are all the on-demand runs you can choose from. This section is a bit repetitive seeing as how there's a dedicated tab for it, as well. When you navigate to that tab, you can see all the different on-demand classes separated into programs including 5K training, 10K training, video content (which features warm-ups, stretches, and yoga), more virtual races, along with classes for moderate and hard runs. 
Tap on the Live tab to see which class is currently active along with the rest of the live sessions for that day. From here, you can also browse through the different days of the week at the top of the screen to see your future options and scheduled class times. 
If there's a specific trainer that you're interested in, the Trainers tab is where you can find an 'About Me' section along with their schedule for live runs. That way, you know when to look out for a particular trainer's next class if you want to join in. 
The last tab in the app is for your Profile. This is where you can view your stats, including total runs, total distance, and time spent on the app, along with your scheduled and completed runs. 
And while the app is super easy to use and navigate, I do wish there were a search filter that allowed you to easily pinpoint what it is you're looking for that day. It'd be nice to have the option to input my skill level, run duration, and preferred trainer so that the app can calculate and sort my options, instead of scrolling through classes that are mainly sorted via specific programs.
Another thing that's missing from the app is music integration. While the classes already come equipped with their own playlists, I'm very particular about my workout music. So, I would've liked to have the option to sync my own playlists while listening to the trainer guide me through the run. 
I'll start out by saying that you're going to want to join in on these live runs. Since it was a really busy week, I mainly took the on-demand classes and only managed to squeeze in one live session. 
At 40 minutes, that live class was a long one, so I really got the full Charge experience. And I loved it. Not only was it engaging, but it was also super easy to follow along. (Although, getting through the class wasn't as easy, but that's on me.)
When you start a live run, you'll see duration, your total distance, and average pace. Below that is a real-time updated leaderboard of everyone's names along with their current distance.
Charge Running uses your phone's GPS to track distance in real-time, but I noticed that it had a tendency to lag when updating your distance in the app. So, I'd recommend wearing a fitness tracker with built-in GPS, if you want to track it more intensely. 
As I mentioned before, Charge uses energy levels (based on a scale from 1 to 10) to help you gauge how much effort you should be putting in throughout each part of the run. 
A level one, for example, is a light jog during which you can still comfortably hold a conversation. A level two or three, however, ramps up the intensity, making it a little difficult to complete a spoken sentence or two.
Throughout the live Tempo run, the instructor had us going from a level one for about one to two minutes before building up to levels two and three (which you can choose between depending on how comfortable you're feeling) for about four minutes each. Then, she'd throw in a one-minute recovery run before gearing us back up to that level one routine. All of which is separated into different rounds.
Unlike Peloton, which attracts hundreds, if not thousands of people to each of its live classes, Charge's live runs are a lot smaller in number. The live moderate Tempo run I joined had about seven or eight people, which allowed the trainers to give everyone an equal amount of attention. With such a small class size, trainers are able to call out each runner, motivating them to keep going. 
Additionally, the trainers keep you informed of your distance and pace throughout each of the rounds and sometimes push you to lower your pace as the run progresses. It helps to keep you focused on just running, rather than constantly checking your metrics on your own to see your progress. Having someone keep track of all your stats in real-time is a game changer.
My favorite part of Charge Running, however, is the chat feature. During a live run, you can send texts to other runners in the group chat. While I was shy to join in on the conversation, I loved how positive everyone was for the entire 40 minutes of the run — whether it was sending messages of encouragement or just sharing details like the weather and how they were feeling.
There's also an option to just "listen-in" on the live runs, which is helpful on days when you can't run but still want to join in and help boost morale. 
On-demand classes are still just as effective, though. I've never run a 5K before, so I've been mainly sticking to that program of sessions. It's formatted the same way as live runs, but you don't have the live chat functionality or the trainer updating you on your stats.
You do, however, still have a leaderboard where you can participate against others who are also taking the class with you at the same time. And the trainers are still just as helpful and motivational throughout. 
The Charge Running app is certainly an excellent choice if you're looking for something to power you through your runs. It's not a revolutionary concept — apps like Couch to 5k, Peloton Digital, and Nike+ Run Club offer similar audio-guided runs. But Charge adds a human element that's missing from a lot of these types of apps. It really brings a different vibe to the overall experience that makes you feel like you're part of a community. And, seeing as how everyone is interacting with one another in real-time, you technically are.
I don't know about you, but that's something I think we all need while in lockdown. 
Additionally, for someone like me who's been very hesitant to join a running group in New York, it's a great introduction to what it might be like to actually go through with it. It allows me to build up the confidence to finally join one when all of this quarantining is over.
While Charge Running might be a pricey subscription investment for some, especially given the economic climate, it's definitely a worthy alternative to other, similar fitness apps. Runkeeper, Endomondo, and Studio, for example, are certainly cheaper, but none of them have the live trainer feature — and that's really what makes Charge worth the cost.
The community aspect on Charge, coupled with super calm and motivating trainers who are genuinely trying to help you get through those runs, helps foster an environment that's missing with a lot of these workout apps.
It's also been a great cure for that quarantine loneliness I mentioned before. Even though I'm technically running alone, Charge helps to make sure it doesn't actually feel like it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to be a better ally to women on Zoom</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Picture this: It's pre-pandemic and you're sitting in a work meeting. You've diligently prepared your notes and you're excited to present your ideas. Instead, you spend the entire meeting trying — and failing — to get a word in. 
Fast forward to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of staring at your coworkers from across a conference room table, you're at home speaking to them via video. But it's still the same story: When you attempt to talk, you're cut off multiple times. Each time this happens you smile awkwardly. The discussion continues and you wonder if anyone heard you.
Unfortunately, the new realities of working from home wrought by the coronavirus pandemic haven't yielded new, fairer standards for workplace etiquette. 
"It was a problem already in our old-school workplace paradigms: Women were being mansplained and over-talked," says Kim Churches, the CEO of the gender equity organization American Association of University Women (AAUW). 
For Sally McConnell-Ginet, professor emerita of linguistics at Cornell University, much of the issue stems from the ways in which we respond to and evaluate what women say and how they say it. In any setting, whether in-person or online, men and women can be doing the same thing but be judged differently because of the traditional power structures of our society. 
For example, a woman might be expected to be collaborative and only speak when called on. Or, a woman who speaks in the same manner as a man during a Zoom meeting could be interpreted as pushy by her colleagues but the man could be seen as having a great idea, explains McConnell-Ginet.
Churches, for her part, points to lags in internet connectivity, which can freeze the meeting and make it difficult to know what was said and who spoke last. This technological challenge can contribute to women being left out of the conversation, she explains. 
It's up to all of us in the meeting to make sure women's voices are heard because everyone loses out when sexism occurs, says Dr. Sarah J. Brazaitis, an associate professor in the department of organization and leadership at Columbia University's Teachers College. Brazaitis, who has a master's and PhD in counseling psychology, teaches students methods to help people feel more satisfied and perform better at work. After graduation, her students go on to get jobs teaching these processes to workplaces. Brazaitis focuses on the social forces that hold back employees due to their race and gender. She points to research that shows the best performing groups and teams are those where, by and large, the members of the team speak pretty equally.
In Churches' mind, when sexism shuts women up or judges them unfairly for their contributions to a meeting, we miss the diverse perspectives that are critical to a team's success. Women have viewpoints that men can't replicate, says Churches.
This advice is important now — but also for the future. It's likely these virtual forums won't be going away anytime soon, even when the pandemic ends as working from homewill likely be more common.
"We're all learning in real time that we can work elsewhere and still be strong colleagues and still deliver great product," says Churches. 
Here's how to be an ally to women in the workplace, even via a screen.
Whoever's leading the meeting has the most power in the room, and as such, should ensure women's voices are being heard, says Churches. 
One way to do so is by identifying the problem directly. Recently, Brazaitis led a meeting over Zoom for her master's and PhD students. The class has 27 students, with only five men. But when Brazaitis broke the class into groups to discuss the material and told each group to pick someone to report out the findings, every single one of the people presenting were men. 
After each group went, Brazaitis told her class that she was happy to hear their input, but she also wanted to hear from the women. Like Brazaitis, as a leader you can speak up when you see women's voices aren't being heard.  
McConnell-Ginet suggests similarly that leaders should ask women questions and have them elaborate on their thoughts. This can help open the door for women who may be interrupted frequently by their colleagues.
You can also encourage people to use video conferencing platforms' hand raising functions to prevent people from talking over one another, explains Churches. Zoom has this feature, as does Google Hangouts, and Microsoft Teams.
Churches also often makes note of the race and gender of the people she talks to, whether she's leading a meeting or talking to people outside AAUW, to ensure she taps into a diversity of voices. 
"We have a tendency as human beings to go with what we know," she says. By consciously tracking who she talks to she can ensure she fights against this bias. 
Leaders should also set meeting norms, says Brazaitis. For example, before the meeting you can say (and also establish formally via email), "We need to put norms in place because now we're all having these online meetings. Let's have standards that we won't interrupt one another and each person will have equal time to speak." You can also add that each person should manage their own speaking time, so it's clear that the responsibility is also on each team member to not over talk. 
There are ways for men to help, too. Speak up when you notice women in the workplace being interrupted or talked down to. You likely won't take flak for it because men tend to be expected to speak up in meetings without consequences (such as being viewed unfavorably by their coworkers), says Brazaitis. 
McConnell-Ginet agrees, explaining that when a man intervenes if a woman is being interrupted, his colleagues may view him as considerate because of gendered norms and expectations. On the other hand, if a woman does the same thing, she may be judged as overly pushy or a "whiny feminist." 
What's more, she believes people constantly put the responsibility on women to fix the problems they have in the workplace, such as suggesting they change how they say something. Instead, an ally can help repeat what a woman has said or ask for them to expand on their thoughts as this can help improve the chances that a woman can present her ideas, says McConnell-Ginet. 
But these comments have to be thoughtful, says Brazaitis. For example, she's heard well-intentioned men acknowledge that they're interrupting, apologize, but then say they want to allow their coworkers to speak. This kind of remark implies it's up to men to give women permission to speak. 
"It is her right [to speak] as a member of the team, not a special privilege being granted to her on behalf of her male colleague," says Brazaitis. 
Instead, you should note that you feel like you've been taking up too much air time and would really like to hear what others have to say, perhaps calling out other co-workers by name with a nod to a previous comment they made.  For example, you can say "Sarah, you had a great point about customer satisfaction earlier. Do you have more to say on that?" 
Churches, for her part, says that when men speak up in this way, even with a simple statement like, "Before we break, we didn't hear from Sarah, and I'd really like to see if she has additional thoughts," it shows they care about helping norms shift.
Even though it shouldn't be on women to make work meetings a supportive place, there's strength in numbers.
That's because there's power in women supporting their fellow women as they can face significant barriers in getting people to hear them, says McConnell-Ginet. A group approach can work better than a single woman pointing out she was disrupted during a meeting. After all, women are underrepresented atevery level within the workplace so banding together is especially important. 
For Brazaitis, it's more effective for other people to point out that a woman is being interrupted as the group will be more likely to view it as a legitimate problem and not something the woman caused.
While Brazaitis acknowledges this strategy can work against women, she thinks the benefits outweigh any potential negative outcomes.
"I don't think it is particularly problematic for women to speak up for other women...it might be that they get labeled trouble makers or 'they always stick up for each other' type of thing, but better to advocate in groups then solo regardless," says Brazaitis.
So if you notice a woman being ignored during your next work call, try to pluck up the courage to say something. Or, better yet, see if you can get other women to join in too. 
"A lot of times we're not the only woman on a Zoom call. So if we're afraid that we're not being heard, we also need to be upstanders and allies to our fellow women," says Churches.
If you see a woman being talked over, you can say "Hold on Tom, Tina was trying to say something and I think it would be important for us to hear her thoughts," suggests Churches.  
This kind of language can immediately stop the interruption in its tracks instead of allowing it to carry on. 
While it's not up to women to make online interactions a welcoming space for themselves, there are some things they can do to boost their chances of being heard during online meetings, says Brazaitis.
First, women can prepare. This doesn't just mean you have new ideas to share and are ready to update everyone on your work progress (though, you should be doing that too). You should also be thinking about how you'll present yourself during the meeting. 
Lighting is important. Make sure you're not backlit so you can be visible to other participants, suggests Churches. If you're already being talked over, you don't also want to be physically invisible on the call. 
You should also anticipate problems with internet connectivity. When online meetings suffer from internet lags, someone may accidentally talk over a woman because of the bad connection. Our instinct may be to stop talking but Churches says it's better to finish your thought so you can get the entire idea out. 
These setbacks are more likely to crop up as virtual meetings become more socially accepted and routine, so it's even more urgent that everyone makes sure women’s skills, ideas, and contributions are well represented, says Churches. 
"Women make up half of the labor force...Our ideas, thoughts, analysis, and expertise are valued and this is, frankly, about economic security and moving forward in an unprecedented time," says Churches. "We should care about this because if we're going to continue to be a productive nation, we need to do everything we can to remove the barriers, bias, and discrimination holding women back in every venue, including now in video conferencing."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo nears tourism goal with first solo flight from Spaceport America</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo commercial space plane has officially made its first successful test flight out of Spaceport America, its base in New Mexico.
On Friday, the company announced that its suborbital spacecraft, called VSS Unity, marked "an important flight test milestone in preparation for commercial service."
Though Unity had already completed several successful glide tests — including milestone flights in December 2018 and February 2019 — this was the first successful free flight in the New Mexico airspace.
According to the online statement, "The milestone flight took off from the Spaceport America runway, with VSS Unity attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve." The company went on to explain that all vehicles rose to an altitude of 50,000 feet before Unity was released.
"The spaceship achieved a glide speed of Mach 0.70 and completed multiple test-points, before touching back down smoothly for a runway landing at Spaceport America," Virgin Galactic said.
"This glide flight provided the first opportunity to test all the components required to fly the carrier aircraft and spaceship in glide configuration, from a new home base and in new airspace," the company's statement reads. "The flight test also provided an opportunity for the pilots and spaceflight operations team to continue familiarisation with the new airspace around the Gateway to Space and a chance to capture valuable in-flight data and conduct further pilot training."
The eventual goal is to be able to use the spacecraft to carry six passengers in commercial operations, so the fact that this test run was successful is another step closer to achieving that objective.
"Today's VSS Unity flight is another exciting milestone for Virgin Galactic’s progress in New Mexico," Dan Hicks, Executive Director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority said in the announcement.
He remarked that the successful flight was especially noteworthy because it also took place in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
"We are extremely happy and proud of Virgin Galactic, not only for today's success but also for the exceptional way they have integrated into NM and supported the region and State during this stressful time dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic," Hicks continued. "Spaceport America and Virgin Galactic have adhered to new guidelines set by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to include social distancing and wearing masks. A big thank you to our foundational partner at Spaceport America!"
Per the online statement, preparation for SpaceShipTwo Unity's next flight is now underway.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TL;DR: A one-year subscription to Private Internet Access VPN is on sale for $2.85 per month as of May 3, saving you 71% on list price.
There are a lot of VPN providers out there to consider, and some will try to lure you in with seriously slick sites and interfaces. This sort of thing isn't really important though, and you should always focus on performance and features.
Private Internet Access is not the best-looking VPN. The site is a little all over the place, and the interface is dated. Don't let this put you off though, because PIA leads the way when it comes to security and accessibility.
Private Internet Access provides state-of-the-art, multi-layered security with advanced privacy protection using VPN tunneling. Its services have been designed from the ground up to be able to operate using pre-existing tech in your computer or smartphone, so you can relax.
A one-year subscription to Private Internet Access is now on sale for $2.85 per month, and includes an extra two months of protection for free. This plan is down by 71% on list price, and includes a generous 30-day money-back guarantee.

    <h5 class="mb-1">App icons promoting wearing facemask amid COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Internet companies like Urban Company, MakeMyTrip, Dunzo, HealthifyMe and Zomato are changing their social media handles and app icons to promote wearing face masks as a hygiene practice amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Apna Mask initiative -- an effort by StartUpVsCOVID (a startup community with over 1,000 members) -- is promoting homemade masks and aims to drive behavioural change to ensure that people wear masks and stay protected as they step out of their homes.
The #ApnaDeshApnaMask campaign was kicked off by startup industry stalwarts like Rajan Anandan of Sequoia India, Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Alok Mittal (Indifi), Vishal Gondal (GoQii) and others. They were later joined by celebrities like Vidya Balan, Dia Mirza, Juhi Chawla, Divya Khosla Kumar, Juhi Parmar, Deepshika Deshmukh, Sonu Sood, Shama Sikander, Preetika Rao and others.
Within a span of two weeks, the initiative has garnered 100 million outreach across digital platforms, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
The team working on the campaign also reached out to various organisations to support the initiative, especially as parts of the country get ready to come out of the lockdown which has been extended till May 17.
"Urban Company, MakemyTrip, Dunzo, HealthifyMe, Zomato, Redbus, Ixigo, MoneyTap, MyUpchaar, Bounce, RazorPay, Medanta, WittyFeed, LBB, Porter, Meesho, Daily Hunt, 1mg, Paytm Games have changed their social media handles while some are changing the app icons as well," a statement said.
These brands are also inviting more companies to join the initiative.
"Given the immense response we have received, we will have more brands join #ApnaMask in this critical initiative. We believe some of these steps will be helpful in building habit changing behaviour towards wearing homemade masks," Poonam Kaul, co-founder of ApnaMask, said.
In a separate statement, Crowdera -- an online fundraising platform -- said it is offering its premium syndicated fundraising technology solutions for free to companies and NGOs working to help the COVID-19 affected individuals, families and health workers.
"Crowdera will be extending its support through offering its products and services worth almost USD 150,000 (Rs 1 crore) free to organisations aiding the affected...The solution will help corporations and NGOs to quickly syndicate with their own employees, influencers, other foundations, or charity partners to raise funds 10X more than through a regular crowdfunding campaign," it said.  
Under this pledge, Crowdera has already extended its support to companies like Rapido, Repos, BYJU'S, SirfTaxi, and Tartl to engage their employees and partners in fundraising for the COVID-affected workforce.

All categories of staff from all the departments will be back at work in the Orange and Green zones starting tomorrow.
---Following criticism to charge labourers three times the normal bus fare to go home, the Karnataka government announced free travel arrangements for labourers for the next three days.KSRTC buses will not charge any fare to the labourers wanting to return to their native districts in the state.---Moving on, in our international segment, Amulya takes a look at Africa, a continent that seems to have slipped from everyone’s memory, and its response to the pandemic.
As of this weekend, the number of people infected with the coronavirus may have crossed the 3-milion mark globally, but the good news is that the number of recoveries from the virus has crossed 1 million. 
Singapore is recovering from its second wave of infections and New Zealand has downgraded the threat level which has led to the loosening of the lockdown. In Europe, the  schools are opening despite some concerns about the spread of the virus. 
However, there is very little talk about what is happening in the huge continent of Africa, where it was predicted early on that the novel coronavirus might be especially devastating, given the challenges regarding hospital infrastructure and the poorly-trained staff. Since the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Egypt in February, Africa’s number of cases has soared to 40,000 and the number of deaths stand at 1600 as of this weekend. As per the Africa’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the northern part of the continent leads in the number of infections as well as the deaths, with Egypt, Morocco and Algeria in the lead. These four countries account for more than half of the cases in the continent. The chances of a major outbreak in other countries is a realistic fear, right now. 
In Somalia, in west Africa, Guardian reports that medics, funeral workers and gravediggers have reported an unprecedented surge of deaths in recent days, giving credence to the view that the official counts of Covid-19 deaths reflect only a fraction of the virus’s toll in Africa. 
Many countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya have imposed STRINGENT lockdowns and curfews, which is not entirely new to the continent, which has seen its share of state violence.In Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta even apologised for overzealous policing.
On May 1st, South Africa relaxed its lockdown with President Cyril Ramaphosa remarking “Our people need to eat”. The country is in recession and the president is trying to strike a balance between the public health and national economy. For the latter, he even announced an $26.9bn economic stimulus and social relief package, amounting to about 10 percent of the nation’s GDP. 
With the spread of the virus flattening elsewhere, Africa could be the next coronavirus hotspot. The continent has previous experience of handling HIV and Ebola outbreaks, which it has used successfully by coming up some local inventions like the 1$ coronavirus test kits, developed by a laboratory in Senegal. Let’s hope this experience will lead to many such inventions. ---And before we go, if you’ve been worried about a flu but you’re not quite sure if it’s Covid-19 - here’s a service that will send help your way.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Amid international concern about close ties between Chinese technology groups like Huawei Technologies and the communist government, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corporation is facing accusations it has been recording millions of users’ private data and browsing habits in a more invasive manner than its competitors.
According to a report by Forbes Magazine, a cybersecurity expert found that a large amount of his data and online behavior using a Redmi Note 8 smartphone were being harvested, tracked, and sent to a remote server, while connections could be made between the individual user and the data collected.
Even when the expert, Gabi Cirlig, switched his phone to the private “incognito” mode, the phone was still recording his searches and the websites he visited. The information ended up on remote servers in Singapore and Russia with Web domains registered in China, Forbes reported.
Xiaomi denied there was a privacy problem, though Cirlig found similar browser code on other devices from the company, suggesting they would have the same issues. He warned that data sent to the tech group’s servers could easily be linked to specific users, as unique numbers identifying each device were also being collected.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Clouds need containers, and Containers-as-a-Service smooths the way | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Latest State of the Cloud report shows CaaS now the second-ranked Platform-as-a-Service offering in use among cloud-driven enterprises, right behind Database-as-a-Service. Why CaaS now?
Containers are well regarded for the flexibility they add to application development and deployment, especially when it comes to moving application workloads between clouds, between clouds and on-premises systems, or even from one on-premises system to another. However, effectively building a complex containerized environment still takes skills and experience. Enter Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS), a variation of Platform-as-a-Service that has been around as a concept for a few years, and lately is being embraced in a big way to speed up container adoption.So, is CaaS just another "as-a-Service" term from vendors intended to confuse the market and wrap their offerings in some glorious-sounding "aaSy" package? Or is there more to it? 
The data suggests CaaS may be serving a righteous purpose. The latest survey of 750 IT executives from Flexera's 2020 State of the Cloud Report (originally launched by Rightscale), finds a majority of cloud adopters, 53 percent, also use CaaS, which is on the upswing as containers become a mainstream part of enterprise development and operations environments. Notably, CaaS is now the second-ranked Platform-as-a-Service offering now in use among cloud-driven enterprises, up from sixth place in last year's survey. Database-as-a-Service tops this year's list with 62 percent. "Organizations are driving this shift due to their growing interest in leveraging containers to speed deployment, scale operations, and increase the efficiency of workloads running in the cloud," the survey's authors state. In terms of fastest-growing technologies, CaaS ranked second with 17 percent year-over-year growth, right behind IoT services at 21 percent. Another fast-growing category, machine learning and artificial intelligence, also saw 17 percent annual growth. Overall, the survey, conducted in the first quarter of 2020, finds rising adoption of public and hybrid cloud solutions, with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud taking significant shares of the market, explored in Larry Dignan's analysis of the results here at ZDNet.
Along with their foundational cloud offerings, many organizations are also choosing CaaS offerings from these public cloud providers to enhance and accelerate application delivery. AWS' Elastic Container Service and Elastic Kubernetes Service (ECS/EKS) experienced substantial adoption, with 54 percent using it, up from 44 percent in last year's Flexera cloud report. Another 24 percent planning to adopt ECS/EKS. Azure Container Service adoption reached 46 percent (up from 28 percent last year), and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) reached 24 percent, up from 15 percent.  CaaS provides numerous benefits, as pointed out in an informative overview by Scalyr's Eric Olsson. CaaS can bring a good balance of speed and control to deployments, he notes. "Agile methodologies shortened the development and testing pieces while cloud computing has shortened the deployment piece. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) further improved the time it takes to get a feature to customers. In addition to these, containers can give you a more powerful and flexible solution. But with all these pieces come additional configuration and complexity." 
The rise in CaaS adoption may be helping to alleviate some of the challenges with technical expertise and migration issues involved in containerization, the Flexera survey's authors state. Lack of expertise is the top challenge for container use, cited as a major issue by 41 percent of respondents. Another 38 percent regard this as "somewhat" of a challenge. Migrating traditional apps to containers is the second-ranked challenge, cited by 34 percent as a major issue, as is security. More than one-fourth, 26%, even note that their service providers lack expertise in container technology. "The resource challenges can be attributed to the relatively recent adoption of container technology," the survey's authors point out. "Migrating traditional applications to containers is problematic because containers are optimized for microservices, while traditional apps aren't."The use of Docker and Kubernetes continues to be considerable, the survey also shows. Close to two-thirds (65 percent) of organizations use Docker, and 14 percent plan to use it. Fifty-eight percent are using Kubernetes, a container orchestration tool that leverages Docker, and another 22 percent plan to use it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LineageOS source code, OS builds, and signing keys were unaffected, developers said.
Hackers have gained access to the core infrastructure of LineageOS, a mobile operating system based on Android, used for smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes.The intrusion took place last night, on Saturday, at around 8 pm (US Pacific coast), and was detected before the attackers could do any harm, the LineageOS team said in a statement published less than three hours after the incident.The LineageOS team said the operating system's source code was unaffected, and so were any operating system builds, which had been already paused since April 30, because of an unrelated issue.Signing keys, used to authenticate official OS distributions, were also unaffected, as these hosts were stored separately from the LineageOS main infrastructure.LineageOS developers said the hack took place after the attacker used an unpatched vulnerability to breach its Salt installation.
Salt is an open-source framework provided by Saltstack that is usually deployed and used to manage and automate servers inside data centers, cloud server setups, or internal networks.Earlier this week, cyber-security firm F-Secure disclosed two major vulnerabilities in the Salt framework that could be used to take over Salt installations.
The two vulnerabilities were CVE-2020-11651 (an authentication bypass) and CVE-2020-11652 (a directory traversal), which, when combined, could allow attackers to bypass login procedures and run code on Salt master servers left exposed on the internet.According to reports from Salt server owners, attacks exploiting these two bugs began sometime yesterday. In some instances, attackers planted backdoors on hacked servers. In other instances, they deployed cryptocurrency miners.There are currently more than 6,000 Salt servers left exposed online that can be exploited via this vulnerability, if left unpatched. Patches for the Salt vulnerabilities have been released earlier this week. Salt servers should normally be deployed behind a firewall and not left exposed on the internet.The LineageOS team has taken down all of its servers last night, to investigate the incident and patch vulnerable servers.This marks the second time a major operating system was hacked in the past year. In July 2019, hackers breached Canonical's GitHub account, however, the Ubuntu source code was also unaffected.Updated at 8:15pm to add that the same Salt vulnerability has also been used to breach servers operated by the Ghost blogging platform and the Digicert certificate authority.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ghost blogging platform servers hacked and infected with crypto-miner | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ghost platform got hacked via the same vulnerability that allowed hackers to breach LineageOS servers hours before.
A serious hacking campaign is currently underway, and tens of companies have been hacked already, ZDNet has learned from security researchers keeping an eye on the attacks.For the past 24 hours, hackers have been mass-scanning the internet for Salt, a type of software used to manage and automate servers inside data centers, cloud server clusters, and enterprise networks.Attackers have been exploiting two recently-patched bugs to gain access to Salt servers and then deploy a cryptocurrency miner.
Earlier today, ZDNet reported that hackers managed to breach the servers of LineageOS, a mobile operating system.A second major hack surfaced a few hours later after our initial report. The second victim is Ghost, a Node.js-based blogging platform, built and advertised as a simpler alternative to WordPress.
In a status page, the Ghost developer team said they detected an intrusion into their backend infrastructure systems at around 1:30am UTC.Ghost devs said the hackers used CVE-2020-11651 (an authentication bypass) and CVE-2020-11652 (a directory traversal) to take control over its Salt master server.
The blogging company said that while hackers had access to the Ghost(Pro) sites and Ghost.org billing services, they didn't steal any financial information or user credentials.Instead, Ghost said the hackers installed a cryptocurrency miner."The mining attempt spiked CPUs and quickly overloaded most of our systems, which alerted us to the issue immediately," Ghost developers said.Similar to LineageOS, Ghost devs took down all servers, patched systems, and redeployed everything online after a few hours.
A security researcher who requested we not use his name for this report said the attacks were most likely carried out with an automated vulnerability scanner that detected outdated Salt installs, and then automatically exploited the two bugs to install the crypto-mining malware."It is very possible that the threat actor behind these scans doesn't even know the type of companies they're breaching right now," the researcher told ZDNet in a Twitter chat. "We're seeing unpatched Salt servers at banks, web hosters, and Fortune 500 companies.""Pretty soon ransomware gangs are going to start scanning for this bug, and we're gonna see mayhem, with ransomware deployed at some huge targets."Some of these intrusions are currently being reported on a GitHub thread, with similar reports of an attacker planting a cryptocurrency miner on hacked Salt systems. Our source has identified the attacker behind most of these intrusions as the Kinsing botnet.Saltstack, the company behind the Salt software, published patches earlier this week to address the two vulnerabilities. Companies are advised to either patch the Salt servers or secure them behind a firewall. There are currently around 6,000 Salt servers exposed on the internet.Updated post publication to add that the Digicert certificate authority and the Xen Orchestra hosting service have also had servers breached using the same Salt vulnerability.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Australia's COVIDSafe contact tracing story is full of holes and we should worry | ZDNet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The government's coronavirus strategy bets heavily on an unproven COVID-19 tracing app, but the lack of a working back end and ham-fisted messaging risks the loss of the public's trust.
The message from Prime Minister Scott Morrison is simple, patronising, and dangerously misleading: Download the COVIDSafe app and we can start letting you out of coronavirus lockdown.
It's misleading because there's no evidence that a so-called "contact tracing" app will be a net benefit. Someone should've checked that up front.It's dangerous because much of the official messaging is about being "safe" and "protecting" you.The COVIDSafe strategy is technological hubris. Blind faith that an app can replace, or at least substantially enhance, the urgent labour-intensive detective work of contact tracing."The lure of automating the painstaking process of contact tracing is apparent. But to date, no one has demonstrated that it's possible to do so reliably despite numerous concurrent attempts," wrote researchers and academics at the Brookings Institution.
"We worry that contact tracing apps will serve as vehicles for abuse and disinformation, while providing a false sense of security to justify reopening local and national economies well before it is safe to do so."COVIDSafe doesn't do what contact tracers do. It merely logs which other COVIDSafe users you've been near, ready for later analysis, should one of you test COVID-19 positive.
That won't pick up potential infection paths such as random unrelated people buying a takeaway muffin from the same cafe across several days, taking moments to do so. It won't notice you sliding your hand along a dirty handrail.That's why Apple and Google's partnership to develop a tracing-friendly API has been labelled as "exposure notification" apps instead.The Brookings researchers detail flaws such as false positives leading people to ignore repeated alerts, when people are close but safely separated by walls, or using personal protective equipment (PPE)."Because most exposures flagged by the apps will not lead to infection, many users will be instructed to self-quarantine even when they have not been infected," they write."A person may put up with this once or twice, but after a few false alarms and the ensuing inconvenience of protracted self-isolation, we expect many will start to disregard the warnings."False negatives are equally problematic. People might leave their phones in their car, or the app might just fail. And it's not like the 1.5 metres for 15 minutes rule is magic. Even the most fleeting encounter can be unlucky.As has also been pointed out, people might trust the magic of technology more than their own judgement, a phenomenon called automation bias."Contact tracing apps therefore cannot offer assurance that going out is safe, just because no disease has been reported in the vicinity," the Bookings team writes."Contact tracing is a public health intervention, not an individual health one. It can reduce the spread of disease through the population, but does not confer direct protection on any individual."
Yet last week Morrison said that using the app was "like putting on sunscreen to go out into the sun"."It protects you, it protects your family, it protects your loved ones, it protects our health workers, and it protects your job, and the jobs of many others, because it enables us to move forward and to get the economy back on the track we want it to be on," he said.Morrison also said that Australia is "on the road back to a COVID-safe economy". Spot the contrived slogan?Robert Hillard, chair of the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA), said: "You could think about contact tracing as a digital vaccine with our contact data being the virtual antibodies". Both Morrison and Hillard are wrong.Even the name of the app, COVIDSafe, implies that it will in fact make you safe. It won't. It can't. There's a reason the HIV/AIDS public health community has spent more than three decades talking about "safer sex" not "safe sex".
Like a frustrated parent on a long road trip, Morrison has responded to us like children demanding to know "are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?" with a figurative "yes alright, shut up, be quiet, and we'll stop at Macca's for ice cream."Or since this is Australia, at a pub for a beer. "A cold one later on today," as he put it."The first step to getting back to that is downloading COVIDSafe," Morrison said on Friday."If [Australians are] looking forward to doing it in a pub, well, that is a prerequisite to even getting to that conversation."Health Minister Greg Hunt used the same playbook. "Want to go to the footy? Download the app," Hunt tweeted on Saturday.This tells you something about Morrison's character, and perhaps something about Australia's too. Morrison doesn't trust us to trust him and do the right thing. So we need to be bribed with bread and circuses, or beer and football, before we'll risk trusting him.The thing is, Australians aretrusting Morrison, at least so far.Last week's polling by Essential showed that 70% of us rate the government's response as good, and 68% think the response is about right.Our attitudes to the tracing app show that, yes, there are security and privacy concerns, but far more of us believe the app will help limit the spread of COVID-19 than not. Some 40% said they would download the app to their phone, with 28% undecided.That polling was done April 23-26, so mostly before the app's launch on April 26 and the subsequent PR blitz -- and before the problems started to emerge.Still, by Sunday, the government claimed that more than 4.25 million Australians had done the deed.But COVIDSafe apps may be logging close contacts -- at least those that are turned on and working -- with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reporting that none of the data is going to contact tracers."The rules on privacy are being finalised, along with final IT testing," a Department of Health spokesman told the ABC.It's actually good that we're locking down the rules and testing the systems before they go live, so why weren't we told that?"The system will be operational next week ahead of the decision on possible easing of restrictions," something we're told will be happening this Friday at a National Cabinet meeting.Morrison is constantly saying that the key metric is app downloads. "The COVIDSafe app is the major obstacle now, between us freeing up a lot of these restrictions, in a cautious way, in a careful way," he said, but right now that's simply an assertion.And if there's modelling that shows how COVIDSafe usage rates translate into a reduced risk of infection, why can't we see it? How much modelling will inform the National Cabinet if the back end isn't operational?Back in school, we knew that the maths students who couldn't show their working out didn't know what they were doing, and were just bluffing it.A pandemic is too important, too dangerous for people to be bluffing it.
Your writer was one of the politicians, industry, analysts, and media people at last Friday's Australian Strategic Policy Institute roundtable, discussing Labor's cyber resilience discussion paper and other matters under the Chatham House Rule.With the COVIDSafe app, government is taking a different approach than with, say, Australia's controversial encryption legislation. They're going to table legislation in Parliament, even though they'd said that the ministerial determination was enough. They say they're releasing source code.We also noted that government has been handed a challenge with the identity-matching legislation. The Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security, in a bipartisan decision, demanded that it be completely rewritten.Australia's surveillance laws, meanwhile, are hitting the social license problem.How will the Morrison government deal with that?"Too much technology policy that is done by assertion," said one participant."Politicians will say 'This is the way it works and no one needs to be worried about it' when there's a great suspicion that that politician doesn't actually know what they're talking about in the first place," they said."If you want the public trust you, you've got to trust them enough to have an open conversation with them."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus tracing app will go into testing this week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NHS contact tracing app will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps said: ‘The idea is that we will encourage as many people to take this up as possible. This is going to be a huge national effort and we need for this to work 50-60% of people to be using this app.
‘Not everybody has a smartphone, and I appreciate that for various reasons not everybody will download it but it will be the best possible way to help the NHS.’
He stressed the app would be completely confidential.
The app will be central to the Government’s efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus and will involve alerting people who have been in contact with an infected person and asking them to self-isolate.
The NHSX app is part of the Government’s test, track and trace strategy.
Contact tracing has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly.
The Government intends to use the app and a phone team to carry out the tracing.
It will be downloaded on to smartphones and use bluetooth technology to work out when other app users are in close enough proximity to potentially spread the virus.
The data is recorded under an anonymous ID, rather than by the person’s name.
If and when someone starts showing symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, they are able to share that on the app.
The app then sends a notification warning of possible infection to all those phone users to have come in requisite proximity recently.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Your guide
Mitja Rutnik
There are plenty of free cloud storage providers available, although not all of them are the same. They differ from one another in terms of features and the free space they offer.
In this post, we take a look at the 10 best free cloud providers that offer the most storage. But keep in mind that this list only contains reputable and well-known companies we’re willing to recommend. There are other providers out there that offer more free storage, but some of them are brand new to the market and seem sketchy because they try their hardest to keep their details (location, phone number, address…) hidden.
Not every provider is trustworthy. Uploading sensitive files to a cloud managed by a company that may have bad intentions is not a good idea. And if the provider is brand new to the market and their business plan doesn’t go as imagined, it can close shop overnight, possibly leaving you without access to your files.
If you already know what cloud storage is, how it works, and why you should use it, feel free to skip this section and scroll down to check out the list of the best cloud storage providers. Everyone else, keep reading.
The concept of cloud storage is easy to understand. The cloud is basically just a remote database. It’s a server maintained by the provider that lets you store your images, videos, documents, and other files. To access the files, all you need is your account login info and an internet connection.
But, why not store everything on my PC instead, you ask? One of the reasons is that by storing files to the cloud, you can access them from any device with an internet connection. If you store files on your PC, you can only access them from that PC.
Another reason is that your files are safer in the cloud then they are on your PC. If your computer can get damaged, lost, or stolen, you can say goodbye to all those vacation photos and your movie collection. You can also share files with other people more easily from the cloud, especially larger ones that can’t be attached to emails because of size limits.
An additional benefit of cloud storage comes into play when you buy a new PC. Instead of manually transferring your data from your old device to the new one, you can just log into your cloud account and, voila, all your files are right there on your new machine.
Of course, cloud storage isn’t perfect. It has its share of problems that you need to be aware of. The biggest one is that if someone gets ahold of your account login info, they’ll be able to get access to all the files stored in your account. You also need an internet connection to view the files in the cloud, which may cause problems for some at times — especially road warriors. 
Editor’s note: We’ll update this post with new providers once they launch or when current ones make changes to their free plans.
Degoo is far ahead of the competition, offering a whopping 100GB of free cloud storage. However, the service has a number of limitations in place you have to be aware of. The biggest one is that you can only upload files from one device. There’s no such limit for viewing or downloading files, though — you can do that on as many devices you want.
The service is supported by ads, and you have to log in at least once every 90 days to make sure your account stays active. With that in mind, Degoo definitely isn’t the most user-friendly cloud service on this list, but it does offer plenty of storage.
The nitty-gritty:
Co-founded by the controversial Kim Dotcom, Mega comes in second on this list by offering 50GB of free storage. But there’s a catch: the 50GB is available for the first 30 days only, after which the storage gets bumped down to 15GB. You can get extra storage by installing the desktop app (20GB) and the mobile app (15GB), although both expire after 180 days. You also get an additional 10GB of free storage for one year when a friend of yours signs up for the service.
Mega technically doesn’t have a size limit for the files you upload, but it does have bandwidth limit that’s pretty strict. You can upload a maximum of 1GB of data every six hours, which obviously means that the largest file you can upload is 1GB.
The nitty-gritty:
This is the cloud service I recommend to most people, provided they don’t need more than 15GB of storage. It’s super easy to use, is available on all the major platforms, and doesn’t contain ads. But one thing to keep in mind is that the 15GB of storage is shared between Drive, Gmail, and Photos.
Google Drive is well integrated with Gmail, allowing you to quickly save email attachments to Drive. The service also lets you share files with ease and allows you to easily back up your devices. This is by far my favorite cloud storage service.
The nitty-gritty:
Box is a popular and well-known cloud storage provider. It’s 10GB of free storage is generous, although not market-leading. There’s a file size limit in place for uploads that is set at 250MB.
The service offers standard features you get with most other providers. You can create folders to organize your files, share files with just a few clicks, and access your files from different platforms, among other things.
The nitty-gritty:
This provider isn’t as popular as Google Drive or Box, but it’s a great one nonetheless. You get 10GB of cloud storage for free and there’s no file size limit in place for uploads.
pCloud is packed with loads of great features. You can share files with ease, access your files from multiple devices across different platforms, and recover and access older versions of your account — up to 30 days. The service even has a built-in video and audio players. If you need more storage, you can opt for a monthly plan or a one-time “lifetime” fee.
The nitty-gritty:
Icedrive is a relatively new player on the market — it launched in January 2019. You get 10GB of free storage and a daily bandwidth of 3GB, which limits the size of the files you can upload.
Since it’s a newcomer, it doesn’t offer all the features you get with some of the bigger players. There’s no two-factor authentication available, nor is there file versioning. But Icedrive still has the main features you’d expect from a cloud storage and is a solid option overall.
The nitty-gritty:
MediaFire lets you store and share files with ease, with free users getting 10GB of free storage. Individual files are limited to a maximum of 4GB per upload.
The service lets you upload multiple files at once and can be used on various platforms including Windows, Android, and iOS. It supports all the major files out there, allowing you to upload images, videos, documents, and more. Unfortunately, the service is supported by ads, which can get annoying fast.
The nitty-gritty:
This cloud storage is mainly focused on media files (images, videos…), although you can store documents and other files as well. Users praise the service for its fast upload speeds as well as a decent amount of free storage at 10GB.
There’s a 5GB file size limit for uploads, which is quite generous. Apps are available for PC/Mac, Android, and iOS, so you can upload files and get access to them regardless of the device you’re using.
The nitty-gritty:
Syncplicity doesn’t stand out from the crowd, but it still gets the job done. You get all the basic features like the ability to sort files by folders, share files with others, and even tag them. The good news is that, unlike some other providers, Syncplicity doesn’t have a file size upload limit in place.
You get 10GB of space for your images, videos, documents, and other files. The service is available on all the major platforms and offers paid plans for those looking for extra storage.
The nitty-gritty:
The last free cloud storage service on this list is Microsoft’s OneDrive, which offers the least amount of space at just 5GB. But you can use it as part of your Microsoft account — if you already have one — so you don’t need to sign up for the service separately.
In addition to all the basic features you’d expect from a service like this, OneDrive also comes with a Personal Vault that adds an additional layer of security for those extra sensitive documents. But on free accounts, you can only store up to three files in it.
The nitty-gritty:
There’s a reason why the list above lacks a few big names. Apple’s iCloud service only offers 5GB of data, just like Microsoft’s OneDrive. But unlike OneDrive, iCloud is primarily aimed at those who own an Apple device. And if you sign up for the service with a PC, you only get 1GB of storage instead of five. Nevertheless, it’s a great service overall if you’re an Apple user and we have no problem recommending it, but just keep the storage limit in mind. If you need more space, opt for one of the providers mentioned in this post.
Dropbox is another great service that we recommend, although it didn’t make our list because it only offers 2GB of free cloud storage. That’s not much, but if it’s enough for you, we’re confident you’ll be happy with the service.
Amazon Drive is also a great service, offering 5GB of free storage to its users. That’s on par with OneDrive we included on our list, but we recommend Microsoft’s solution over Amazon’s because it’s more feature-packed and easier to use.
More free storage is always better, but it’s not the only thing you should focus on. For example, while Degoo offers the most storage at 100GB, I wouldn’t recommend it to users who don’t need that much space. The service has loads of limitations in place, one of them being that you can only upload files from a single device.
So before you sign up for a service, try to figure out how much online storage you actually need. If you need more than 50GB, then something like Degoo is your best option. But if just 10GB or even less will do, a service like Google Drive is a much better option.
There you have it — these are the 10 best cloud storage providers that offer the most space. We’ll update this post when new providers launch or current ones make changes to their free plans. In the meantime, let us know which of the services listed in this post would you consider signing up for.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 10 Apple TV+ shows you should watch first</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Source: Apple
Apple TV+ shows started immediately with the streaming service’s launch in November 2019. Since then, we have seen a low but steady trickle of new series debut on the service, and now there’s enough content to really dive deep into its selections. But which series are the best Apple TV Plus shows? Good question, and one we aim to explore here. 
As you will see, the original Apple TV Plus series already has a variety of content; from children’s shows to more mature series just for their moms and dads.
Remember, if you buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV box, you get one year of the service for free (read more about it here.) For everyone else, you can sign up now for Apple TV Plus for $4.99 a month, following a seven-day free trial, at the link below. 
This is our favorite of the current crop of Apple TV Plus shows. It’s an alternate history tale, showing the Soviet Union winning the race to put a man on the moon in 1969. In response, the NASA of this timeline decides to keep going. Part of their plan is to recruit more women and minorities into the US space program much earlier than what happened in our reality. It’s a different look at how early space exploration could have happened.
Emily Dickinson is the real life US poet who inspired tons of other writers over the decades. This show examines a fictionalized version of Dickinson’s early life. The twist is that this incarnation of the poet, as played by Hailee Steinfeld, and her friends act and sound more like teenagers in modern times. It’s not exactly historically accurate, but it is entertaining.
We have read stories about fictional young reporters in school. However, this show tells the story of a real-life young journalist, Hilde Lysiak. As played by Brooklynn Prince in this series, the 11-year old Lysiak publishes her own newspaper for her community. Things take a big turn for her as she starts investigating a murder that happened near her home.
This reboot of the classic children’s TV series focuses on four kids. They attempt to solve mysteries that are tied into well-known books like The Jungle Book and Alice in Wonderland. If you have kids and want to encourage them to read more, this series might be a good first step.
This Apple TV Plus show is based on the best selling novel of the same name by William Landay. Chris Evans takes off his Captain America uniform and shield as the star of this series. He plays an assistant DA in a Massachusetts town, who suddenly has to deal with the fact that his son Jacob is accused of murdering a fellow classmate in school. This is an old-fashioned murder mystery, but with some family drama as well.
HBO’s Silicon Valley made a comedy out of the creation of tech startups. Mythic Quest does something similar. Instead of an internet app company, this show is about the workings of a video game developer. Specifically, it centers on the creator of an MMO game, and his team members that have to deal with his sometimes outrageous ideas and requests. Rob McElhinney, the co-creator of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, also co-created this show, and stars as its lead character Ian Grimm, who sometimes believes his job is to “create worlds”.
This series isn’t as flashy or as high concept as most of the other Apple TV Plus shows on this list. However, it may be more human and heartwarming. It’s an anthology show, with each episode following an emigrant as he or she tries to make a life in America. Episodes have shown the life of a Nigerian boy who comes to Oklahoma and becomes a cowboy, along with a Chinese woman who ends up winning a cruise for her family. It shows the American experience through many different eyes.
This sci-fi series takes place hundreds of years in the future, after an unnamed disaster strikes the Earth, and blinds all humans. The few survivors manage to stay alive, and one tribe of people, led by Aquaman’s Jason Momoa, weds an already pregnant woman. To their surprise, she has twins, both of which can see. This development gets the attention of a rival tribe, who wants the twins for their own purposes. This is a different sort of post-apocalyptic tale with heart and family.
M. Night Shyamalan is an executive producer of this thriller series, and also directed two of its episodes. The show itself fits with his dark storytelling themes. A young couple deal with the tragic death of their baby boy. However, the wife later starts to take care of a reborn doll that she thinks is really alive. The husband hires a nanny to help take care of their “child” but she seems to act like this thing is real as well. Get ready for some Shyamalan-style twists and turns in this series.

This show is by far the biggest high-concept series on Apple TV Plus. It also has the biggest stars, with Jennifer Aniston as a national morning news anchor who is shocked when her co-anchor, played by Steve Carell, is fired for alleged sexual misconduct. To make matters worse for Aniston’s character, she also has to deal with a rising young female reporter, played by Reese Witherspoon. The office and media politics can sometimes get a bit confusing and dull, but the performances by Aniston, Carell, Witherspoon and Billy Crudup as a news executive make this show very watchable. 
That’s our look at the best Apple TV Plus shows so far. We will update this list when more shows debut on the service. In the meantime which ones are your favorites?
Again, you can sign up for the service at the link below, which costs just $4.99 a month after a seven-day free trial.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s time for the Sunday giveaway! Like every week, we’re giving away a brand new Android phone to one lucky Android Authority reader.
A big congratulations to the winners of last week’s Samsung Galaxy S20 giveaway, Jannat A. from India.
This week we’re giving away a brand new OnePlus 8, courtesy of the Android Authority Newsletter!
Get caught up on the week’s top stories, reviews, and features by signing up for the Android Authority Weekly Newsletter. Every Sunday, you’ll receive an email alert with a roundup of the best content from the previous week.
The OnePlus 8 may not be a “Pro” or “Plus” model, but it’s not necessarily a lightweight. This Snapdragon 865-powered phone carries over a lot of the sex appeal from the larger OnePlus 8 Pro, with features such as a 90Hz display and rapid charging, for $200 less.
Whether you run the OnePlus 8 with the screen set to 60Hz or 90Hz, you’re going to get world-class performance. The phone fared well on benchmarks, besting 99% of other devices in the databases of 3DMark, Geekbench, and GFXBench.
The 4,300mAh battery of the OnePlus 8 is just 4.6% lower capacity than the Pro version, and much larger than the 3,800mAh pack in the OnePlus 7T. It consistently pushed through a day and a half of normal use for us, and sometimes extended close to one and three-quarters days. A 6.78-inch AMOLED screen, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage complete the package.

Google I/O 2020 would have taken place on May 12th, but it was cancelled. Despite that, it looks like Google is still pushing forward to release the Pixel 4a this month. It may not release on May 12th, but the leaks and rumors are flowing, so we expect to see the new phone fairly soon. We’ve got some new information in our Google Pixel 4a hub for you to check out. Better than that, we’ve also seen some alleged leaked images taken by the new phone. If these Pixel 4a images are real, we’re pretty excited.
The DJI Mavic Air 2 released this past week. More than just an iterative update, this is a true “Mavic drone,” in design and function. It looks like a typical Mavic drone, and it folds down for transport in the same way. The upgrades are impressive as well. The Mavic Air 2 is the first DJI consumer drone rated for 10km, that’s 6.2 miles of range. It’s also equipped with a new 1/2-inch camera, similar to some newer phones with a 48MP sensor that bins down to fantastic 12MP images. It’ll start shipping soon starting at $799.
You told us: Some of you like to customize your phones, but the rest of you just use a default layout. That was an interesting poll.
(We’re a day early, but, May the 4th be with you!)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best gaming routers: Say goodbye to Wi-Fi lag</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So you’ve got a killer gaming laptop, top-of-the-line peripherals, and even a comfortable gaming chair. All you need to compete online now (apart from some skill, but you’re on your own there) is a killer gaming router. Not only will this virtually eliminate lag when playing on Wi-Fi, they offer other special benefits like gigabit ethernet ports and software solutions to manage bandwidth.
If you’re looking to take your wireless gaming to the next level, here are the best gaming routers on the market in 2020.
As far as gaming routers go, you won’t find a more fitting example than the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000. Not only does its sci-fi spider look fit the gamer aesthetic, it’s one of the fastest and most powerful routers on the market.
With full support for 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 is a tri-band router, so you can dedicated one 5GHz band exclusively to gaming. Plus, unique software implementations allow further prioritization of gaming traffic and optimized connections to game servers to reduce ping and latency to a minimum. If that’s still not fast enough, there’s also a 2.5G ethernet port for blazing fast wired gaming. It isn’t cheap, but this is easily one of the best gaming routers you can buy.
If Asus’ premier gaming router is too expensive for you, the RT-AX88U is a great alternative. It still supports next-gen Wi-Fi 6 with speeds up to 6000Mbs, but does away with some of the more advanced software features of its more expensive cousin.
What makes this one of the best gaming routers you can buy is not just the incredible speeds, it’s also the eight gigabit LAN ports on the back of the router. All this connectivity means you can get the fastest possible speeds from both wired and wireless connections on all devices. For larger homes, it can be combined with the RT-AX92U mesh kit to boost coverage throughout the house.
When money is no object and you want the absolute best gaming router you can buy, look no further than the Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR700. Sure, it has six gigabit ethernet ports and one 10 gigabit SFP+ port for incredible wired speeds, but with Wi-Fi speeds up to 7.2Gbps you can safely leave cables behind.
Pure speed isn’t all this gaming router offers, with advanced Quality of Service features to make sure your ping is as low as possible. It also has a built-in Geo-Filter to make sure you’re always connected to the fastest server, plus a fully customizable dashboard to monitor bandwidth utilization by all devices on the network in real time.
It might not have all the bells and whistles of dedicated gaming routers, but the TP-Link Archer AX6000 gets the job done. Its eight high-gain antennas boosted by 1024QAM deliver speeds up to 5952Mbps via 5GHz and 2.4GHz connections.
Combined with eight gigabit LAN ports and one 2.5Gbps WAN port, you should have ample connectivity for all the devices in your home. Setup is also a breeze, and can be done via Bluetooth with the Tether app, which can also be used to monitor connections on the network.
While the above option is great for general use, TP-Link makes another more powerful model that’s truly one of the best gaming routers around. Although it looks like a demon summoning portal or alien mothership (take your pick), this tri-band router has all the features of other gaming routers at a much lower price.
With two 5GHz bands (one dedicated to gaming) and one 2.4GHz band, the Archer C5400X will ensure that you never miss a shot due to connection stutters or high latency. It also has eight gigabit LAN ports, more than enough for any wired connections your setup requires.
The last entry on our list of the best gaming routers is another relatively budget-friendly option. Zyxel might not be the biggest name in home networking, but its Armor Z2 AC2600 router is fantastic for the price. It delivers on speed with up to 2600Mbps of combined wireless, and even supports more premium features like MU-MIMO and dynamic QoS.
It has a respectable four gigabit LAN ports, and the only real drawback is a lack of customization features in the software. If you’re willing to install custom firmware like OpenWRT, you will find that this gaming router can compete with much more expensive devices from better-known brands.

Keeping your hands washed and germ-free has never been so important.

This naturally antimicrobial brass stylus offers a completely germ-free way to open doors, press buttons, and use shared surfaces.

It's even easy to keep this trusty key as clean as it keeps your hands, since you'll be able to remove any remaining germs and pathogens with a simple antibacterial wipe.
Keep yourself and those around you safe and virus-free with a Hygiene Hand: Antimicrobial Brass Door Opener & Stylus. Usually priced at $25, this germ-killing utility is currently available for just $19.99—20% off its usual price for a limited time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus lockdown 3.0: HUL expects pandemic to speed up technology adoption in distribution</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CMD Sanjiv Mehta, the company will be ready to serve its consumers through any channel that they would prefer to shop, be it big format stores, kirana stores or online.
FMCG major HUL expects technology adoption in distribution channel, including neighbourhood stores besides e-commerce, to speed up as a result of consumers' experience during the coronavirus pandemic. According to Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CMD Sanjiv Mehta, the company will be ready to serve its consumers through any channel that they would prefer to shop, be it big format stores, kirana stores or online.
"Different channels have different shopping missions. People go to a big format store on certain occasion, they go to a neighbourhood store on certain occasion but yes this crisis will habituate and I believe that it would give a fillip to e-commerce, there is no question about that," he said in a conference call on the company's quarterly earnings on Thursday.
Mehta further said, "It would also give a fillip, whether it is a big store or a neighbourhood store, to adopt technology and serve consumer better. I believe that from a perspective of a distribution channel, this is certainly a moment where adoption of technology would speed up." Commenting on consumer habits during the COVID-19-induced lockdown, he said there are two big emerging trends.
"One is the relevance of humble grocers, who are always important for India. I believe that people have realised their benefits .. and the second is e-commerce. Certainly, as people would like to place their order from home, which would definitely give a fillip to e-commerce and we would be ready for that," Mehta added. The company has taken several initiatives over the past couple of years by introducing its e-commerce initiative humarashop.com.
"As things normalise, we have humarashop, which clearly from reverence and importance perspective, that becomes very strategic ... We would be looking as how to reach consumers in the best possible way and going to serve consumers," he said. Mehta also said there is an expectation of a surge in the sale of hygiene and nutrition products post lockdown and the company is ready for that.
"There would be a hike in need, very clearly, for hygiene and nutrition products. There would be no question about that. We would be willing to provide this to shoppers and consumers, in whichever channel, they would like to," he said. Commenting on current situation on production, Mehta said the focus is on goods that are in demand by people.
"Our entire focus was on health hygiene and those kinds of products so that we could maximise our products," he said adding that for several weeks, products such as colour cosmetic were not manufactured.

    <h5 class="mb-1">L&T to offer smart technology solutions to help 20 cities combat coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Smart technology solutions from L&T are helping city administrations like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Prayagraj, Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and others in tracking patients, containing the spread of the virus, monitoring quarantined people and controlling crowding by police personnel
KEY HIGHLIGHTS
Larsen & Toubro, the largest engineering technology company in the country, has tied up with over 20 city administrations to offer smart solutions to help fight against the spread of the coronavirus.
L&T, which has been helping many city administration for crowd management with smart solutions, has started trials with fever detection thermal cameras in Mumbai. These cameras will map the body temperature of people and will alert authorities about people having high fever. The thermal cameras will be installed soon at various key crowded centers in various parts of the city, besides extensive drone surveillance for crowd management.
Smart technology solutions from L&T are helping city administrations like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Prayagraj, Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and others in tracking patients, containing the spread of the virus, monitoring quarantined people, controlling crowding by police personnel, rescue efforts of the administration, spreading COVID-19 related messages to populace and in law and order maintenance, said SN Subrahmanyan, CEO & managing director, Larsen & Toubro. "These include setting up and running of Command & Control Centers and City Operations Centers for many city administrations to help the country escape from this pandemic", he said.
For example in Visakhapatnam, where L&T is executing a smart city project and operating a 'City Grievance Cell', has now been converted into a 24X7 COVID Contact Centre. The centre now has 20 plus operators and is engaged in tracking the details of all individuals who recently returned abroad. Each such individual is being reached out every day for 14 days to monitor whether they are showing any symptoms for COVID-19. In case anyone manifests the symptoms, the information is passed on to the chief medical officer of the municipality on a real-time basis.
Further, L&T's m-governance app developed for Vizag Smart City is used by municipal officials for their day to day operations. The app has now been customised for health workers to carry out house surveys every three hours and record health parameters of self-isolated people and neighborhoods of COVID-19 positive cases. Also, about 40,000 people in greater Visakhapatnam use a 'Citizen app' developed by L&T and now has been equipped with the COVID-19 SOS button for citizens to notify any medical emergency, besides options to check for COVID-19 symptoms. The app can check whether he or she has developed any symptom, based on a survey to assess mild/moderate/critical categorization. If found critical, an emergency SOP shall be triggered and for non-critical cases, operators connect concerned zonal doctors through telemedicine for further counselling and advise. The App's geo-fencing technology also enables the Contact Center to monitor any unwanted movement of citizens marked for self-isolation. The app also records the health parameters of isolated people - mandatory daily updation for international travelers and voluntary updation for self-isolated citizens.
Further, 50 public address systems (PAS) installed on smart poles by L&T in Visakhapatnam for relaying official messages on the lockdown, crowd restrictions, and precautionary measures, besides Ten variable message display (VMD) boards for awareness and communication on COVID-19.
In Hyderabad, the city dwellers are not allowed to drive beyond 3 kilometers from their residences even for buying essential goods and L&T devised an innovation to help police track the violators. Machine Learning based Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system monitors vehicle locations continuously and once a vehicle crosses the 3-km limit, an automated alert is being sent out to the police. Additionally, through the integration of the Regional Transport Authority's (RTA) database, vehicle owners are identified to issue a warning. More than 200 cameras are deployed across the city with deep learning-based crowd formation analytics triggering real-time alerts at the police command center. The Hyderabad police have so far received 1000+ alerts and officials were successful in dispersing the crowd through field officers. Besides, public address systems, 40 Variable Message Display (VMD) boards have been set up for traffic management at arterial locations and awareness across Hyderabad.
At Prayagraj smart city in Uttar Pradesh, where L&T had implemented extensive smart solutions to manage crowds for the Kumbhamela, the city operations center is monitoring crowd formation through 1000 plus CCTV cameras deployed throughout the city. The 1920 helpline number is currently used to handle COVID-19 related calls, including 'doctor-on-call', and 14 variable message display (VMD) boards are being used for precautionary measures on COVID-19. L&T, with the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), has been implementing an advanced metering infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh. It had developed a consumer mobile app now used by one million people and it is now leveraged to relay official COVID-19 information.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Customers need to submit details such as their contact information, geographical location, choice of vehicle variant, colour, powertrain and transmission. After reconfirmation, they can proceed to paying the booking amount via online payment options
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) India on Saturday announced the launch of its online 'touch-free' Jeep retail experience in response to continued movement restrictions and social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic. Prospective customers can book and own a Jeep online without having to physically visit a showroom, and will enjoy the convenience of a test drive and sanitized vehicle delivery at their doorstep, the company said in a statement.
FCA India President and Managing Director Partha Datta said, "Our commitment is to ensure customers can still continue to access Jeep at their fingertips. To ensure health, safety and convenience, we are making the Jeep retail experience as touch-free as possible."
The online booking is being dovetailed into a 360-degree digital retail architecture that will deliver easy-to-use experience for customers and prospective customers can book and own a Jeep without leaving the safety of their homes, he added.
Customers need to submit details such as their contact information, geographical location, choice of vehicle variant, colour, powertrain and transmission. After reconfirmation, they can proceed to paying the booking amount via online payment options.
Afterwards, FCA's automated retail architecture will automatically create a unique ID and link the customer's information to its authorized dealer in that city and a sales executive will assist the customer for test drive, booking and final payment, the company added.
"The touch-free retail experience is designed to enhance convenience for customers. Physical distancing has become the new normal and keeping this in mind, our approach is to ensure customers as well as our dealer showroom staff are well protected," Datta said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Aiisma launches contact tracing for non-smartphone users</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aiisma claims that it's the only app in India to utilise the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) feature for contact tracing
Given the rising number of coronavirus cases in the country, the contract tracing feature is a must. While there are plenty of apps addressing this issue for smartphones, including the Aarogya Setu App, there wasn't any solution for feature phones until now. Aiisma, India's consumer to business data marketplace, has designed an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) feature for contact tracing in rural areas.
Aiisma claims that it's the only app in India to utilise the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) feature for contact tracing. This feature is for non-smartphone users who have feature phones and might not support 3G, 4G or 5G connectivity. Unlike apps installed on smartphones, feature phone users will be propagated with options, of which they can select one. This will be facilitated by their service provider.

Basic handsets too share the location information via cell towers with the telecom service provider. If the user gives consent, this feature using USSD will gain access to information and share it with Aiisma ecosystem. Available for free, currently this feature is available only in the English language but the company is working on introducing it in local languages in the next two-three weeks.

The company claims to ensure anonymity and privacy. Aiisma said that the tracking feature keeps the person's details anonymous, thus ensuring the privacy of data and identity. The anonymous feature will release a trigger function that will alert any Aiisma user who might have come into close contact with the infected person and maybe potentially infected. The aim is to create a digital fence of sorts against COVID19 and help authorities and citizens overcome it. For positive carrier identification, Aiisma is talking to the government. The company explains, "at this time symptom mapping is a feature that doesn't require specific information about positive carrier so that is operational. If symptoms are pointing to a possible infection, an alert is sent out."
Aiisma belives 70 per cent of the country's population lives in rural areas and this can be a great way of contract tracing for such areas. The company already has a contract tracing app for smartphones. Here the infrastructure in the back-end of the app and mobile remains the same, the service is accessible for feature phones.

Recently, PUBG Mobile announced that registrations for the event will begin on 6th May.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all events are being postponed or cancelled to minimize its spread. Therefore, the PMIS 2020 will be conducted online in which all the squads will play from their respective locations.
PUBG Mobile recently teased the official trailer of PUGB Mobile India Series in which the organizers also revealed the top 20 qualified teams which will battle it out against each other in the Grand Finale. In the previous season of PMIS, 16 teams proceeded to the final stage.
SouL lifted the trophy last year and were followed by God's Reign who finished second. PUBG Mobile India Series 2019 turned out to be an event that gave rise to many underdog teams. Here's hoping 2020 brings us even more exciting action.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Th
The PUBG Mobile 0.18.0 Update will hit global servers on 7th May 2020, and will bring a lot of new features like the Safety Scramble Mode, the Miramar 2.0 map, the Jungle Adventure Mode, and much more.
Among all these new additions to PUBG Mobile, players are looking forward to the release of the Miramar 2.0 map the most. The new Miramar map is called Mad Miramar, and in this article, we take a look at all the new features that will be added to it.
Miramar 2.0, or Mad Miramar, is not a completely new map that will be added to the game, but a revamped version of the classic Miramar with some visual changes and additional features.
Here are the new features coming to Mad Miramar in the 0.18.0 Update:
Brand new sites have been added to Miramar 2.0, with Oasis in the North and Ruins in the North-West. Along with this, new houses, buildings, and roads have also been added to the map.
A brand new racing track that runs through the whole map has also been added. Players can pick up the vehicles they want and race their teammates.
A stunning Golden Mirado is a new vehicle that has been introduced in Mad Miramar. There will be only one golden Mirado that will be spawned in the entire map. It will not be easy to drive this new vehicle as the place where it is spawned will surely become a hot drop.
Just like in the Erangel Map, Vending Machines have also been added in the Miramar Map, which provide healing items like energy drinks and painkillers. The lucky players who manage to reach the vending machine can also get a total of eight drinks at a time.
Earlier, it was not possible to equip the Win 94 with a scope, and that was a major drawback the gun was facing. But now, this sniper rifle will come with a pre-attached 2.7x scope that will make it a more potent weapon.

After registering for the tournament, teams will play the PMIS 2020 in-game qualifiers, where they have to play a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 games. The ten games with the highest points will be considered for the final standings.
The in-game qualifiers will go on for five days, and the top 248 teams will move on to the next stage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SmackDown hacker updates coordinates to another cryptic location; sends new message</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One of the lengthier storylines currently playing out on WWE television right now is that of the SmackDown hacker. The hacker would join Twitter a couple of weeks ago and has been just as enigmatic on social media as they have on television.
After several months of wondering and many theories about who the hacker maybe - including one from myself back in February - the tempo is most certainly starting to increase, and we now have a third location update from the account!
The location now traces back to New York, and a place called Neversink.
Well, not much aside from the sporadic messages on SmackDown where the mysterious figure proclaims, "The truth will be heard," for weeks ahead of their most mysterious of debuts.
That "debut" would merely see them sitting in front of computers while wearing a cloak and unearthing hidden footage which would open up the Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville storyline. But their Twitter account hinted at much more information regarding their identity.
For everything you need to know about the hacker's Twitter account, click here.
On said Twitter account, co-ordinates have been posted and since changed twice, in the location section. The first was a place called Truth or Consequences in New Mexico, the second was Last Chance in Iowa, and the latest location is Neversink, New York.
The bio for the hacker would also change to, "Watch. Decode. Destroy", with the hacker issuing a new video, with the message "The passcode protects the truth" in the post.
You can watch the clip below.
Another interesting note from the hacker’s video is that they appear to signal their next action at Money In The Bank. The passcode used in the video translates to the date of the event, and the co-ordinates posted are that of the WWE Performance Center.
Another, more cryptic point to add is Dalhousie St, Cowcaddens is pinpointed. The location is in Glasgow, Scotland, and in the vicinity is Glasgow Caledonian University, which is the location WWE Champion Drew McIntyre graduated from.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new educational resource co-created by children from Roebourne, in Western Australia's Pilbara region, that incorporates local Aboriginal history and culture has been launched.
The program fulfils cross-curriculum objectives all by getting students to create their own character.
The digital learning experience is aimed for years 3 to 6 students and is free for schools who want to use the program.
"The potential for what we have in Roebourne is a wonderful opportunity to use the digital media platform as a tool, a new way of learning that takes the world's oldest living culture," Ms Adams said.
"It's participatory learning. It's engagement, it's learning in action. It's not service delivery; it's community learning how it should be. It's socialisation too. Keeping Yindjibarndi stories alive, keeping Ngarluma stories alive," she said.
NEO-Learning is a pilot project by Big hART, supported by Telstra Foundation’s Tech4good program, and also Reconciliation Australia.
 
Teachers can register now to visit the virtual classroom of NEO-Learning, with free sessions with live educators throughout May here.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Smartphone market to de-grow 8-10% in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: With no new launches and suspension of sales since late March, India’s smartphone market could de-grow by 8-10 per cent in the calendar year 2020, says a qualitative assessment done by technology analytics firm techARC, where major insights came from OEMs such as Xiaomi, Vivo, Realme and OPPO.
According to several consultancy firms, smartphone sales in India grew from high single-digits to low double figures in 2019, between 145 and 158 million units.
India overtook the US last year to become the world’s second largest smartphone market, behind China.
The report says that while there will be contraction in the market in 2020, major OEMs might be able to sail through.
According to the insights, manufacturing will resume first and will come to its optimal level over a period of 8-12 weeks from the time of resumption. Initially, the factories may start with 30-40 per cent of the capacities.
The participating players said there is no plan to cancel the launch of smartphones or other product categories scheduled for 2020.
However, the launch calendar has been revised, pushing most launches after May.
Smartphone launches, especially in the budget segment, have dried up in the last two months. While Apple and OnePlus launched one premium smartphone each amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, they are yet to be retailed in India.
“The Covid-19 pandemic will impact the smartphone market as well as it does most of the other industries and verticals. However, in the long-term, the significance of smartphones is only going to rise as they continue to become the hub of all activities for consumers,” the techARC report said.
The mid (Rs 10,001-25,000) and premium (Rs 25,001-50,000) ranges will have stable demand compared to other segments of Entry, Basic and Luxe, which will see some change in demand for various factors.
“Entry and Basic potential buyers will have issues due to unstable incomes and job outlook. And some segments of users that go for Luxe category phones like iPhones on EMIs, etc, will reduce their budget to meet other contingencies,” the report said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Saturday that Aarogya Setu app is the best scientific instrument to alert people if some COVID-19 infected person is nearby and there should be no concern over privacy-related issues.
He was responding to AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi's statement in which he raised the possibility of privacy-related information being collected by the use of app.
Javadekar said the app is being preferred worldwide over other means of tracking and mapping the pandemic. It alerts people if some COVID-19 infected person is near them. This is the best scientific instrument. There is nothing of privacy-related matter and information to be collected," he told ANI.

"There is no information actually. If you have a cough, a cold or tested positive, then only you have to fill up the information. The app will continue for the next one or two years. The lockdown will be over soon, but this app will be a permanent help till we win the war against this pandemic," said Javadekar.
Aarogya Setu app was launched in public-private partnership enables people to themselves assess the risk for their catching the coronavirus infection. The app makes its calculations based on a person's interaction with others, using Bluetooth technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence.
Owaisi had tweeted: "The Central govt is fighting COVID-19 with taali, thaali, bijli & a very shady app. Now Delhi's Sultans have issued a farmaan that people have no choice in the matter. They MUST share their private data with govt (& whoever the govt wants?"

NEW DELHI: The extension of the lockdown has caused problems of procurement for the Centre and farmers across the country are anxious about their crop. To ease their anxiety and with an aim to help sell their produce directly to the customer, Harvesting Farmer Network (HFN) is connecting over 10000 farmers across the country directly to customers through social media.According to Ruchit Garg, founder of the HFN, the platform has helped farmers from across the country sell over 2 lakh kg of produce in the past 15 days.
The social media account of the platform was launched only 18 days ago. “We need to support small farmers right now, more than ever. A platform for small farmers which allows them to effectively market and sell their produce directly to the consumer is the need of the hour,” Garg said and added that given the good response, a website is in the making.ALSO READ: This Jharkhand man is changing face of primary education with innovative ideas
Farmers too are happy with the initiative. Ramkelawan Sahu, a banana farmer from Bemetara in Odisha sold a portion of his produce due to the efforts of HFN. “I was having trouble in selling my produce but HFN helped me. Now I have sold at least 40 per cent of it,” he said.HFN puts out the farmers’ numbers on social media and the details of the produce to help nearby people connect with them. Subsequently, the farmer and the consumer directly negotiate the price of the produce.ALSO READ: In Coronavirus times, students turn farmers and help parents on fields
HFN does not charge any money for their services. Another beneficiary of the initiative is Ram Prasad, a fig farmer from Karnataka.“This initiative helped me as I was able to even cover the transportation cost of my produce. If the buyer is nearby, we don’t charge as much but for distant buyers we include the transportation charge,” he said.
Garg has recently moved back to India from US after 11 years to work in agriculture with small farmers.“Given the problems faced by the farmers during the lockdown, we moved from giving actionable solutions to helping them sell their produce,” Garg said and added that the initiative has found many takers in the south as compared to the north.

    <h5 class="mb-1">These Air Quality Monitors Track Indoor Pollution — So You Know When To Blast The Purifier</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indoor air quality monitors can track dust, mold, and pollution levels in your home, which can help guide your air purifier use, as well as let you know when it's a good idea to open or close the windows. The best air quality monitors measure pollutants with the most potential to do harm and have easy-to-read screens that give you important information at a glance.
Air quality monitors typically measure a few different pollutants, but two of the most common and potentially harmful ones are particulate matter — like dust, dirt, and mold — and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are gases emitted from certain household products and furniture. Each of the picks on this list measures both VOCs and particulate matter of 2.5 microns (PM2.5), which have the most potential to cause health issues.
I’ve also included options that measure humidity (which can lead to mold), carbon dioxide levels (which may affect your cognitive performance), and formaldehyde (which can irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat). Your best choice will depend on how much information you want.
While these air quality monitors don’t get rid of air pollutants — you’ll want to open windows for ventilation or get a high-quality air purifier to do that — they can help keep an eye on pollution in your house, so you can breathe easier and come in both desktop and handheld models to suit you and your home.
We only recommend products we love and that we think you will, too. We may receive a portion of sales from products purchased from this article, which was written by our Commerce team.
Awair Element Indoor Air Quality Monitor$149|AmazonSee On Amazon
My pick for best air quality monitor measures PM2.5 and VOCs, along with humidity, carbon dioxide, and even temperature. The monitor is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, and it also syncs to the Awair app to provide real-time feedback, tracking, and tips to help improve the air quality in your home. However, you can also just check the air quality score on the device itself if you don't want to use the app or a smart home hub.
This pick scores major aesthetic points, too: The design-savvy monitor blends in seamlessly with any aesthetic, and the LED screen displays easy-to-read air quality scores.
According to fans: “The app is well made and offers a lot of useful information. recommendations and a widget for a quick view of the air quality. There are also push notification is the event air quality changes for the worse."
Temtop M10 Air Quality Monitor$80|AmazonSee On Amazon
This affordable air quality monitor checks for three air pollutants — PM2.5, VOCs, and formaldehyde.It also provides an air quality index (AQI) score to measure overall pollution. This model doesn’t offer Wi-Fi connectivity or an app, but it’s a good choice if you just want a simple device to check air quality levels on an easy-to-read screen. It's USB-rechargeable, and lasts for six hours on one charge, so it can be used in spaces without nearby outlets. Reviewers note that the screen is rather bright and can't be adjusted, which may disturb you at night if you plan to keep the monitor in your bedroom.
There's also a more affordable model that only measures PM2.5 and displays AQI, as well as a pricier Wi-Fi-enabled monitor that measures PM2.5, VOCs, formaldehyde, and AQI.
According to fans: “It responds quickly to changes in air quality (blow out a candle and it goes crazy!) and with the built in battery it is easy to move around your house to check each room.”
Huma-i HI20 Portable Air Quality Monitor$129|AmazonSee On Amazon
Featuring large icons and a prominent indicator light, this portable air quality monitor makes it super easy to check air quality levels at a glance, no matter where you are. It measures VOCs and both PM2.5 and larger PM10 particles, like dust, pollen, and mold. With the press of a button, the display switches from icon mode to graph mode for more detailed information on air quality measurements, and the battery offers about 10 minutes of run time before needing to be plugged in and recharged. However, there’s no Wi-Fi connectivity or app, and reviewers note that the display is not brightness adjustable.
You can also opt for a more affordable version of this air quality detector that only measures PM2.5 and PM10, or a more comprehensive monitor that also measures humidity and temperature.
According to fans: “I've had other air quality monitors that I've returned because they clearly weren't accurate, but I'm impressed with this one and would recommend it to anyone who wants something that is simple, easy to use, and portable."
VSON 6930 Air Quality Monitor$116|AmazonSee On Amazon
The most comprehensive option on the list, this handheld air-quality monitor measures PM10, PM2.5, PM1.0 (which commonly results from vehicle exhaust), formaldehyde, VOCs, temperature, and humidity. The screen displays a lot of information at once — which can be overwhelming — but there’s an easy-to-read color-coded section that shows the overall air pollution level. And here's a unique benefit: If the monitor detects dangerous levels of air pollution, an alarm sounds and the screen changes color. The monitor works for up to six hours in standby mode. However, there’s no Wi-Fi connectivity or app.
According to fans: “Super easy to understand, green is good, and gives a numerical score … Great product, easy to understand but has a ton of advanced features if you’re one of those super nerds that want to get into the details of air quality.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">This Genius Sports Bra Has 6 Hidden Pockets — So You Can Go Hands-Free On Your Next Hike</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unlike other popular workouts like yoga or HIIT, there’s no one style considered “right” for hiking. That said,all the best hiking bras tend to be breathable, well-fitted, and designed with enough support and ventilation to keep you comfortable throughout your hike. Beyond the basics, though, there are a few other important considerations to keep in mind.
First, you’ll want to think about support. As a workout, hiking can range from high-impact to low-impact; factors like rougher terrain, steeper inclines, and your pace can all make a difference. For that reason, the amount of support you’ll need depends not only on your cup size and personal preferences, but also on your hiking style and the type of trails you usually take. Generally speaking, though, a medium-impact sports bra will be great for most hikes, unless you already know that you prefer a lot of extra support.
Once you’ve decided how much support to look for, you’ll want to consider fabric. While many people prefer a moisture-wicking bra made of synthetic performance fabrics, others prefer working out in cotton or other breathable natural fibers, which is totally fine, too. Beyond fabric, you’ll also want to think about coverage. For example, do you want a sports bra that you can feel comfortable wearing on its own, or will you be layering it under a top?
No matter what you're looking for, you'll find seven unique styles that take all of these factors into consideration, just ahead. Scroll on to shop the best sports bras for hiking, all for less than $50 on Amazon.

Core 10 'Icon Series' The Warrior Mesh Sports Bra$27|AmazonSee on Amazon
This sports bra by Core 10 checks off all the right boxes. Cut in a stylish longline silhouette, it's made of a moisture-wicking performance fabric and has medium-to-high compression for a secure, bounce-free fit. The illusion-style neckline not only looks cute, but it also means the upper half of the bra is made of sheer mesh, which means more breathability and ventilation. Plus, the wide straps and high neckline provide extra support, making this an especially great option for anyone who wears a DD cup size or larger.
Nike Swoosh Pocket Bra$45|AmazonSee on Amazon
Sure, this racerback sports bra by Nike features lots of great features — like the brand's Dri-FIT moisture-wicking technology and strategically placed mesh panels to help keep you cool — but what really sets it apart is its wealth of pockets. The bra has a total of not one, not two, but six hidden pockets, including one larger pocket on the front of the chest band, and five smaller pockets hiding basically everywhere else. It's a great option for hikers who prefer to pack lightly, or if you like to make sure your phone is easily accessible at all times.
QUEENIEKE Back Pocket Energy Sport Bra$20|AmazonSee on Amazon
If pockets are a priority for you, this seamless sports bra is another great option. True, it only has one (roomy) hidden pocket rather than six — but it's also significantly more budget-friendly.
It's made of a moisture-wicking, chafe-resistant fabric comprising nylon and spandex, which some reviewers said feels softer and more cotton-like than they expected. Other key features include lightweight, removable pads, and a small eyelet near the pocket in the back to thread your headphones through.
Champion Spot Comfort Full-Support Sport Bra$34|AmazonSee on Amazon
People can't stop raving about this popular sports bra from Champion, giving it nearly 2,000 perfect-star reviews on Amazon thus far. It's especially popular among bustier people, because it provides maximum support without sacrificing on comfort. Made of a soft, moisture-wicking fabric to reduce sweating and chafing, it's designed with adjustable, gel-cushioned straps, wire-free moulded cups, and mesh panels for maximum breathability. The extra support makes it ideal for medium- to high-impact hikes, such as those that involve jumping, stairs, or navigating rough terrain.
Glamorise Elite Performance Full Figure Wirefree Sports Bra$32|AmazonSee on Amazon
Available in an even wider range of cup sizes, this sports bra from Glamorise is another great, highly supportive choice for people who could use some extra support, but don't want to deal with uncomfortable wires on their hike. It has non-stretch, wire-free cups to minimize bounce, extra-wide straps to relieve back pain, and a mesh panel on the front to keep you cool and ventilated. It's also made with a performance fabric that wicks away moisture, adding to its list of hiking-friendly benefits.
Fruit of the Loom Cotton Sports Bra (3-Pack)$13|AmazonSee on Amazon
If you prefer to wear breathable natural fibers during your workouts, these best-selling cotton sports bras by Fruit of the Loom are an excellent (and super affordable!) option. Sold in a pack of three, they're made of soft cotton blended with a hint of spandex for added stretch. While reviewers say they're more supportive than you might expect, they're still probably best for medium- or low-impact hikes, especially if you're a C cup or larger.
"Very comfortable. Not having hooks in the back of the bra is perfect for hiking," one reviewer noted. "My backpack rubs into the hooks of my other bras, which hurts after a while."
Core 10 Women's Lattice Strappy Back Longline Yoga Sports Bra$29|AmazonSee on Amazon
With its longline racerback silhouette, this sports bra could easily be worn on its own as a top. Obviously, its lattice-style, criss-cross back gives it major style points, but it's also surprisingly supportive, with a snug compression fit and an elastic band to reduce bounce. Multiple reviewers who describe themselves as bigger-busted report that this sports bra is "amazing" and "super supportive," with one calling it "the holy grail of sports bras." You can even buy a matching pair of leggings to complete the look.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Digital transformation is no longer an option, it is essential for survival: SAP Labs India MD</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SAP Labs India is German enterprise software giant SAP’s second-largest development centre. SAP’s Indian operations have nearly 13,000 employees and over 11,000 customers, including 9,205 in the SME segment. In an interview with BusinessLine, Sindhu Gangadharan - Senior Vice President and Managing Director, SAP Labs India, spoke about how the company plans to transition through the difficult phase following the coronavirus pandemic. Excerpts:
The Covid-19 situation abruptly pushed companies and employees to adapt to a new working model. In India, working from home was not widely accepted. However, overnight, customers and companies had to get comfortable with online communication, collaboration and delivery. In doing so, companies will realise that a digital transformation is no longer an option, but essential to their survival. They will also realise that only by transforming into an intelligent enterprise can they future-proof their operations against disruptions.
At SAP, our customers are always on top of our mind. With 77 per cent of the world’s transactions touching an SAP system, we’re ensuring that our customers’ business systems are always operational. SAP business, support, and cloud delivery teams have developed and documented business continuity plans to respond to disruptive incidents, such as Covid-19 while safeguarding the health of our employees and minimising the impact on the delivery of services to our customers. We have been entrusted by our customers to run their mission-critical business processes. Now, a majority of our employees are working from home, an option that we have provided to employees over the years, hence the transition was seamless. For business-critical work onsite, for example at our data centre locations, there are rotating schedules where a reduced number of designated people spend minimum time. We remain in constant contact with our large network of suppliers to maintain service levels. For our supply operational resources, we are focused on scheduling and in-office practices to reduce the impact of any potential event. We also maintain a database of updates and feedback from suppliers to ensure we can quickly locate and confirm documented information outlining the Covid-19 protocols and practices.
Digital supply chain management is a growing market. A report from Transparency Market Research anticipates the market for global supply chain management solutions to expand at a CAGR of 11.2 per cent during the forecast period from 2018 to 2026 and to reach a value of $32.9 billion by 2026. The benefits of our supply chain software include being able to provide customers with operational visibility and intelligence to manage their entire supply chain digitally, future-proof their business and execute flawlessly today.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nearly 100 million pre-paid mobile users in India unable to recharge their connections</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With retail outlets across the country shutdown, nearly 100 million mobile users were unable to recharge their pre-paid connections duringthe lockdown period.
While this could have prevented subscribers from making outgoing calls due to lack of adequate balance, incoming calls were not barred as operators had extended the validity of the services till May 3. The validity of the services were extended free.
“There are 350 million feature phone users in the country, who were impacted as there were no facilities to recharge, of this we believe there are about 100 million subscribers are facing recharge issues,” Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) Director-General Rajan S Mathews told BusinessLine.
“We have asked for opening up of recharge outlets and once these open up, I think this issue will be solved,” he said.
On its part, COAI had written to secretaries of all states urging them to open up recharge locations, and is also following up with various District Magistrates.
Only about 10 per cent of the total 1.1 billion SIM cards are not being recharged. There are 650 million people with smartphones, who are able to recharge their connections over the web.
“This would not materially impact the operators’ revenues,” he added.
In an attempt to keep customers connected telecom operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea had extended the validity of mobile pre-paid packs till May 3. The companies had earlier announced special measures, including the extension of validity of mobile pre-paid packs, for low-income customers, till May 3.
The operators also enabled recharging through other channels such as ATMs, post offices, grocery stores and chemist shops, in addition to digital channels. On April 17, Airtel had said that close to 30 million customers were not been able to recharge their pre-paid mobile accounts.

On Friday, Vodafone Idea launched VIC, an AI-powered digital customer service and support virtual assistant for its customers. The virtual assistant, developed by its technology partner ORISERVE, is for both Vodafone and Idea brands.
VIC enables customers to get responses service requirements such as bill payments, recharges, VAS, plan activation, new connection, data balance and bill requests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reliance Jio’s Covid-19 tracker tool user data exposed online due to a security lapse: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A security lapse in Reliance Jio’s Covid-19 self checker tool has led to one of the tool’s core database being exposed to the internet without a password, TechCrunch reported on Sunday.
The security issue was first detected by cybersecurity researcher Anurag Sen who found the database on May 1, right after it was first exposed, the report said. After TechCrunch notified the company, Jio immediately pulled the system offline. There is no specification as to how many people have accessed the database before the system was taken offline.
“The logging server was for monitoring performance of our website, intended for the limited purpose of people doing a self-check to see if they have any COVID-19 symptoms,” said Jio spokesperson Tushar Pania as quoted by TechCrunch.
Reliance Jio had rolled out the online tool back in March. The self-checker is meant to help people self-assess their symptoms in order to map their risk of contracting Covid-19.
The self-test is a list of questions at the end of which the AI-driven tool figures out the test taker’s risk level, from high to low.
The questionnaire begins with basic questions, including who the test is for and the age and gender of the person. It then asks the respondent about their health conditions, their travel history apart from if the user or their family have come in contact with a Covid-positive person.
The database that was accessed by Sen contained millions of logs and records starting April 17 till the time that it was pulled offline.
As mentioned by Pania the server was meant to monitor the website performance and contained a running log of website errors and other system messages. However, it also contained a database of a huge number of user data who had taken the self-test. The data also led back to who the test was taken for, information about the user’s browser version and their operating system.
It also had the individual records of users who had signed up on the website to create a profile which allowed them to update their symptoms over time. The database contained the user’s answers to each question.
According to the report, certain records also contained a user’s precise geolocation if the user allowed the symptom checker access to their browser or phone’s location data. TechCrunch was able to identify user’s homes using the location data found.
Majority of the location data is clustered around cities such as Mumbai and Pune. However, data of users in locations such as the United Kingdom and North America were also found.
The company has not yet specified if it will inform users of the symptom tracker about the security lapse.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi Caught Logging Millions Of Consumers’ Internet And Phone Browsing Data</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Post updated May 3rd, 2020 at 10:27 pm
UPDATE (3 May / 10:20 PM): Xiaomi has since responded to the original story by providing their side of the tale through a very detailed blog post on its official website.
ORIGINAL STORY (2 May / 4:20 PM):
Xiaomi isn’t a brand that would usually raise alarms when it comes to privacy on their devices. Unfortunately, that concern changed overnight after it was caught allegedly recording both phone and internet usage of millions of customers.
The discovery was reported by Forbes, who in turn was speaking to a cybersecurity expert by the name of Gabi Cirlig. Specifically, Cirlig discovered says that he discovered his Redmi Note 8 was logging in and tracking his every action made with the device. What’s even more alarming was that the tracking still persisted even when he allegedly entered into an “incognito” mode.
It should be noted that the data logging seemed to occur on the device’es default Xiaomi browser, as well as Xiaomi’s Mi Browser Pro and Mint Browser. The browsers, which are available on Google Play, have been downloaded more than 15 million times. beyond the browsers, Cirlig also discovered that the Xiaomi Music Player was also listening in on his choice of music. Logging what songs he was playing and even when they were played.
To that end, the Redmi Note 8 isn’t the only Xiaomi device that seems to be executing the same data logging. At the time of writing, Cirlig confirmed that the privacy issue was also prevalent on the Mi 10, Redmi K20, and Mi MIX 3. Worst still was the way Xiaomi seems to be transferring the recorded data to its servers; Xiaomi says that its data is encrypted during transfer, but Cirlig supposedly proved otherwise by easily decoding a chunk of hidden information with a form of crackable encoding called base64.
In response to the findings, Xiaomi brushed off Cirlig’s discovery, citing that privacy and security have always been a top concern for the company. In addition, a spokesperson for the brand did confirm that the brand was collecting data, but in order to better understand its users’ behaviour. It also stated that these users had consented to the tracking, although that point is debatable.

“Xiaomi has reviewed a recent article by Forbes on our privacy policies and believes the reporting to be misrepresentative of the facts. At Xiaomi, our users’ privacy and security are of top priority. We strictly follow and are fully compliant with user privacy protection laws and regulations in the countries and regions we operate in. In light of the misrepresentations, we would like to clarify the following:
1. In all global markets where Xiaomi is officially present, in order to offer the best possible user experience, increase compatibility between the operating system and various apps, as well as undertake the obligation of protecting user privacy, all collected usage data is based on permission and consent given explicitly by our users.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Scores 105 Points On DxOMark Benchmark</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">DxOMark had finally gotten around to evaluating Samsung’s second foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Flip. The benchmark site scored the handset’s camera performance with 105 points, just behind Apple’s iPhone XS series.
The site notes that the Z Flip’s camera provides a fair amount of dynamic range under all conditions and its colour rendering is considerably impressive. They also commended the phone’s accurate exposures in both lowlight and bright environments, as well as complimenting its ability to filter noise.
However, the handset’s 12MP camera also produced significantly low levels of detail with artifacts visibly seen when viewing photos in full resolution. Additionally, DxOMark pointed out that the Galaxy Z Flip’s depth estimation is below par due to inaccuracies, and notes that its autofocus function is accurate in most cases but slow.
As for its video performance, the site cited that the Samsung foldable phone produces vividly colourful footage with a decent amount of detail, and added that its autofocus as well as its  stabilisation system worked effectively well. On the downside of things, the Galaxy Z Flip unfortunately produces low dynamic range, sharpness and noise, especially under low light conditions. 
While the score is seemingly low when compared to the heavy hitters from Huawei, Xiaomi, and Samsung’s own S20 Ultra, the Galaxy Z Flip’s camera performance is still considered pretty decent for foldable phones. Then again, it’s not really that surprising considering the fact that the Korean tech company had set its sights on the phone’s form factor rather than its camera. Otherwise, we’d be seeing the handset with an even bigger price tag than its current RM5,888 price point.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s nearly been a year since Samsung and AMD entered into a partnership, with the latter promising to provide the prowess of its current RDNA graphics architecture to the former’s future chipsets. While a physical manifestation of such a chipset still sits over the horizon, evidence of its existence seems to have made its way online.
Specifically, the existence AMD GPU-powered Samsung chipset comes in the form of benchmarks performance numbers. Conducted and obtained through a GFXBench test. Further, the SoC was benched alongside Qualcomm’s current Adreno 650 GPU that resides within its Snapdragon 865 SoC.
According to the report, the Samsung SoC with the AMD GPU outperforms its Qualcomm rival by a significant margin, with the source of the story even going so far as to say it “blows the Qualcomm Adreno 650 out of the water”. Statistically, we’re looking at a performance difference of 25% between the two GPUs.
It should come as no surprise that at the time of writing, there’s no word as to when the new Samsung chipset with AMD’s GPU technology will officially hit the market. That said, there is speculation that the Korean electronics giant’s upcoming Exynos 1000 series is a prime candidate for the new GPU. Which in turn means that we could be seeing the AMD GPU as early as next year.

As you’d expect, you can get the Huawei P40 series of devices have been made available via our four major telcos. In addition to the varying device prices, all four telcos have similar gifts when you get a device from them. The P40 has a case tied to it, while the P40 Pro will come with a wireless car charger.
Here’s what each telco is offering for the phones, as well as their associated plans:
Looking at what the telcos offer, Digi is the only one that makes you pay for the phone in installments. But if that’s something that you prefer, then you can do so with Maxis and Celcom too. After all, these two telcos have their Zerolution and EasyPhone plans, respectively.
You can check out each telco’s respective pages to find out more about what they offer, in addition to just their device and plan prices.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This is why Covid-19 has a sex bias</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All over the world – in China, Italy, the United States and Australia – many more men than women are dying from COVID-19.
Why? Is it genes, hormones, the immune system – or behaviour – that makes men more susceptible to the disease?
I see it as an interaction of all of these factors and it isn’t unique to the SARS-Cov-2 virus – the different response of men and women is typical of many diseases in many mammals.
In Italy and China deaths of men are more than double those of women. In New York city men constitute about 61% of patients who die. Australia is shaping up to have similar results, though here it’s mostly in the 70-79 and 80-89 age groups.
One major variable in severity of COVID-19 is age. But this can’t explain the sex bias seen globally because the increased male fatality rate is the same in each age group from 30 to 90+. Women also live on average six years longer than men, so there are more elderly women than men in the vulnerable population.
The other major factor is the presence of chronic diseases, particularly heart disease, diabetes and cancer. These are all more common in men than women, which might account for some of the bias.
But then we must ask why men are more vulnerable to the diseases that put them at greater risk of COVID-19.
Men and women differ in their sex chromosomes and the genes that lie on them. Women have two copies of a mid-sized chromosome (called the X). Men have only a single X chromosome and a small Y chromosome that contains few genes.
One of these Y genes (SRY) directs the embryo to become male by kick-starting the development of testes in an XY embryo. The testes make male hormones and the hormones make the baby develop as a boy.
In the absence of SRY an ovary forms and makes female hormones.
It’s the hormones that control most of the obvious visible differences between men and women – genitals and breasts, hair and body type – and have a large influence on behaviour.
The Y chromosome contains hardly any genes other than SRY but it is full of repetitive sequences (“junk DNA”).
Perhaps a “toxic Y” could lose its regulation during ageing. This might hasten ageing in men and render them more susceptible to the virus.
But a bigger problem for men is the male hormones unleashed by SRY action. Testosterone levels are implicated in many diseases, particularly heart disease, and may affect lifespan.
Men are also disadvantaged by their low levels of estrogen, which protects women from many diseases, including heart disease.
Male hormones also influence behaviour. Testosterone levels have been credited with major differences between men and women in risky behaviours such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol, as well as reluctance to heed health advice and to seek medical help.
The extreme differences in smoking rate between men and women in China (almost half the men smoke and only 2% of women) may help to account for their very high ratio of male deaths (more than double female). Not only is smoking a severe risk factor for any respiratory disease, but it also causes lung cancer, a further risk factor.
Smoking rates are lower and not as sex-biased in many other countries, so risky behaviour can’t by itself explain the sex difference in COVID-19 deaths. Maybe sex chromosomes have other effects.
The X chromosome bears more than 1,000 genes with functions in all sorts of things including routine metabolism, blood clotting and brain development.
The presence of two X chromosomes in XX females provides a buffer if a gene on one X is mutated.
XY males lack this X chromosome backup. That’s why boys suffer from many sex-linked diseases such as haemophilia (poor blood clotting).
The number of X chromosomes also has big effects on many metabolic characters that are separable from sex hormone effects, as studies of mice reveal.
Females not only have a double dose of many X genes, but they may also have the benefit of two different versions of each gene.
This X effect goes far to explain why males die at a higher rate than females at every age from birth.
And another man problem is the immune system.
We’ve known for a long time that women have a stronger immune system than men. This is not all good, because it makes women more susceptible to autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis.
But it gives women an advantage when it comes to susceptibility to viruses, as many studies in mice and humans show. This helps to explain why men are more susceptible to many viruses, including SARS and MERS.
There are at least 60 immune response genes on the X chromosome, and it seems that a higher dose and having two different versions of these gives women a broader spectrum of defences.
Sex differences in the frequency, severity and treatment efficacy for many diseases were pointed out long ago. COVID-19 is part of a larger pattern in which males lose out – at every age.
This isn’t just humans – it is true of most mammals.
Are sex differences in disease susceptibility simply the by-catch of genetic and hormone differences? Or were they, like many other traits, selected differently in males and females because of differences in life strategy?
It’s suggested that male mammals spread their genes by winning competitions for mates, hence hormone control of risky behaviour is a plus for men.
It’s also suggested female mammals are selected for traits that enhance their ability to care for young, hence their stronger immune system. This made sense for most mammals through the ages.
So the sex bias in COVID-19 deaths is part of a much larger picture – and a very much older picture – of sex differences in genes, chromosomes and hormones that lead to very different responses to all sorts of disease, including COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deal | The iPhone X is cheaper than the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 today, at just US$445: better offer than the iPhone SE?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apple iPhone X is currently selling on Amazon for just US$445. This makes Apple's erstwhile flagship cheaper than the OnePlus 7T and even the midrange Xiaomi Mi Note 10. Budget users put off by the iPhone SE's compromises might find this an excellent alternative.
Apple's iPhone X is currently selling on Amazon for just US$445 renewed. This is less than half the launch price for this premium erstwhile flagship. At present rates, it is actually US$4 cheaper than the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Aurora Green variant. It is also US$150 cheaper than the OnePlus 7T.
While this is a 2017 device, the Apple A11 SoC holds up remarkably well. The A11's GPU matches the Snapdragon 855 in most graphics workloads, while its CPU dominates in single-threaded performance. This makes it faster by far than the Xiaomi Mi Note 10's Snapdragon 730. 
The real question, though, is whether or not the discounted iPhone X is a value buy over the new iPhone SE. Apple's latest budget SE model packs the powerful A13 chip found in the iPhone 11 series. However, the iPhone SE's 4.7-inch HD display and lack of Face ID are a few compromises too many for many users. Battery life disappoints too. The iPhone X introduced Face ID and the bezel-free notched display found in modern iPhones. While its chipset is getting on in years, it is still more than fast enough for just about any workload. It's also compatible with the latest version of iOS 13. And, at the end of the day, this is a flagship product delivering a premium user experience.
If you're in the market for a cheap Apple iPhone but don't want to get the new SE, this deal on the iPhone X might be your best bet,.

    <h5 class="mb-1">DxOMark: The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip delivers cameras unworthy of its US$1400 price tag</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Galaxy Z Flip is Samsung's contemporary attempt at a clamshell-style foldable phone. The phone starts at just under US$1400, and has now made the trip over to DxOMark where it posted scores akin to two-year-old flagship phones from the competition.
Samsung launched the Galaxy Z Flip alongside the Galaxy S20 series a few months ago as its second attempt at a foldable-type phone. The phone has now made the trip over to DxOMark, where it put up some less than satisfactory numbers.
The Galaxy Z Flip recorded an overall score of 105. That's in the same ballpark as phones like the Huawei P20 Pro, iPhone XS Max, and HTC U12+, all three of which were released back in 2018. That similarity continues in the photo and video scores, with the Galaxy Z Flip making away with scores of 109 and 96 respectively. 
It's interesting that the Galaxy Z Flip performs so unimpressively, as it supposedly uses similar camera hardware to the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 phones. The main sensor, at least, is also a 1/2.55" type, although the ultra-wide-angle sensor is lower-res than the S10's and a telephoto shooter is missing entirely. Yet, Galaxy S10 manages to score noticeably higher in both the overall and photo sections (113/120).
While it can be argued that the Galaxy Z Flip isn't a camera-centric phone, it is after all a US$1400 device that's designed to be a daily-driveable smartphone with an innovative form factor. That said, DxOMark's scores are hardly gospel, and there's been no widespread complaints over the camera capabilities of the Galaxy Z Flip.

    <h5 class="mb-1">3DMark confirms 28 W processor for next MacBook Pro; up to 32 GB of RAM and a 4 TB SSD too, but no Ryzen 4000 Renoir options</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Expected to drop before WWDC 2020, the next smaller MacBook Pro has been said to be making the switch to 14-inch displays. Apple's new Magic Keyboard also seems a likely upgrade, and now 3DMark has confirmed that Apple will offer up to 32 GB of RAM and a 4 TB SSD. The MacBook Pro 2020 will have a powerful CPU option too, but not one of those Ryzen 4000 Renoir processors.
While WWDC is Apple's next big event of 2020, rumour has it that the company is planning to release a smaller MacBook Pro refresh this month. Codenamed J223, the MacBook Pro is expected to feature Apple's new Magic Keyboard, which the company has already rolled out to the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro 16. 
An upgrade to a 14-inch display has also been touted as a "big possibility". The publication of another benchmark listing has seemingly all but confirmed what processors Apple on which has based its next smaller MacBook Pro, too. Spotted by @_rogame on 3DMark running a Core i7-1068NG7, the upcoming smaller MacBook Pro looks nailed on for an Ice Lake-U series upgrade.
This is not the first time that we have seen a Core i7-1068NG7-powered MacBook Pro on 3DMark either, nor one with 32 GB of RAM. While the latter is an upgrade over the maximum of 16 GB that Apple currently offers with the latest MacBook Pro 13, the presence of a 4 TB SSD this time around is another upgrade too.
Intel is yet to confirm the existence of the Core i7-1068NG7, for clarity. However, the three NG processors that Apple offers with the latest MacBook Air indicate how the processor would compare against the Core i7-1068G7.
Clocked at a base of 2.3 GHz, the Core i7-1068G7 can reach 4.1 GHz on a TDP of 28 W. The CPU includes 8 MB of L3 cache and has an Intel Iris Plus Graphics G7 GPU that can boost up to 1,100 MHz. Incidentally, the Core i7-1068G7 shares the last two details with the Core i7-1065G7.
Based on the NG processors that Apple offers with the latest MacBook Air, the Core i7-1068NG7 would not have a configurable TDP, nor would it support Intel Optane Memory or Trusted Execution Technology. The Core i7-1068NG7 should have a smaller package size than the regular Core i7-1068G7 too.
Undoubtedly, a MacBook Pro equipped with 32 GB of RAM, a 28 W Core i7 processor and a 4 TB SSD would be of Apple's upper-tier models, if not the most expensive one that it offers. Either way, current MacBook Pro suggests that this model would cost well over US$3,000. 
With that said, Apple generally equips its entry-level MacBook Pro 13 with a Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD. If that follows with the 2020 refresh, then we may see the Core i5-1035NG7. Additionally, Apple typically offers two Core i7 processors, which is where the Core i7-1065NG7 would come in.
Those three Ice Lake-U series processors are unlikely to offer the processor performance of Renoir chips. However, they would provide a significant boost over the Whiskey Lake-U series with which Apple equips the current MacBook Pro 13. The same applies to GPU performance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Some of Samsung's latest patents show a possible next-gen, triple-camera Galaxy Z Flip</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Samsung is said to have a true Galaxy Fold 2 in the works - now, it also seems there is a 2nd-gen Galaxy Z Flip as well. This clamshell-style foldable, despite its novelty, may be underwhelming in terms of its dual rear cameras. New patents allegedly filed by its maker shows how it might look with 1 lens more.
Samsung released its first-ever clamshell foldable phone in 2020. Considering its specs, it is a good thing it has just such a flexible, Razr-esque screen, as mostother phones with its astronomical price-tag at least deign to have more cameras. The Galaxy Z Flip, on the other hand, makes do with dual rear cameras.
Then again, this may have something to do with the tiny secondary display Samsung has placed right next to this module. Fortunately, it now seems the OEM has worked out how to fit more lenses in while retaining this feature. Evidence of this comes from documents reportedly filed by the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO).
They apparently demonstrate that Samsung has patented the triple-camera Galaxy Z Flip; moreover, it has done so with these shooters in both portrait and landscape orientations (when looking at the top half of the phone while folded). The latter may be superior in terms of esthetics, as it balances the second display nicely.
On the other hand, the "vertical-cam" Z Flip allows for the same screen to become larger. As this patent may only have been granted at the start of April 2020, the date of this possible next-gen foldable's launch can't be guessed at right now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RDNA 2.5? Rumor says PS5 to include some exclusive RDNA 3 features</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The latest hot PS5 rumor suggests that AMD may have given Sony special access to graphics technologies further up the pipeline than it has offered Microsoft. If true, this could result in more efficient graphics performance and rendering than its 10.28 teraflops of rated performance might suggest.
PlayStation insider @Tidux spilled some new potential PS5 details that have set the blogosphere alight. It has been well documented that the PS5 has less raw processing power than the Xbox Series X (10.28 teraflops versus 12 teraflops), but all may not appear to be equal. Although both consoles are using AMD’s forthcoming RDNA 2 architecture at their core it is being suggested that Sony will have some exclusive architectural features not found on the Xbox Series X.
According to @Tidux, the Sony PS5 will also include some AMD RDNA 3 tech as well. What this means exactly isn’t clear, but it is not unheard of for Sony to get access to AMD technology further up the pipeline. For example, the PS4 had some architectural features from the Vega architecture that weren’t seen in consumer GPUs until around 12 months later. Whatever it the tech is, is less likely to be connected to the physical design of the PS5’s 36 compute units (although that is possible) but more likely to do with rendering and instruction sets.
For example, the PS5 fully supports RDNA’s Variable Rate Shading technology that increases resolution in certain sections of a frame while reducing it in others where it isn’t required or noticeable. This maximizes the visual fidelity while fully utilizing the processing power on hand. RNDA 2 and RDNA’s architectural changes have been focused on reducing instruction sets and latency and this is more likely the type of early access to RDNA 3 that Sony will be able to incorporate in the PS5, if the rumor has any truth to it.
What it all ultimately might mean is that it might be very difficult to discern that the Xbox One Series X has any graphical advantage over the PS5 in practice, a theme that seems to be repeating itself.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 is on track to receive the Android 10-based MIUI 12 update soon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Xiaomi has apparently started testing the Android 10-based MIUI 12 ROM for the Redmi Note 8 in China implying a global rollout soon. However, the company has not defined any timeline and whether the rollout will eventually happen or not depends on satisfactory performance of the update during testing
Last month, we reported about the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 possibly being queued for an Android 10 MIUI 12 update. With MIUI 12 officially announced in China earlier this week, speculation is once again rife about the availability of Android 10 for the Snapdragon 665-powered budget handset.
In a response to a query posted on the Mi Community forums as to whether Android 10 followed by MIUI 12 would be available for the Redmi Note 8, a Xiaomi moderator replied, 
The above statement implies that the Chinese Android 10-MIUI 12 ROM for the Redmi Note 8 is already in testing and that the global ROM should be available soon. 
The statement from the moderator seems assuring. However, we should caution that since the update is still in testing, it may still get paused if any show-stopping bugs are found in the process.
Recently, the Redmi Note 8 Pro received the Android 10 update globally, but it removed HDR support for Netflix and HD playback ability on Amazon Prime. The Redmi Note 8 supports Widevine L1 DRM but for some reason does not playback Netflix in HD. Here's hoping this update irons out such bugs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Schenker VIA 14 competes well with ThinkPads, EliteBooks & Latitudes thanks to its big battery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The brand Schenker is well known for its Schenker XMG laptops. Office and business laptops are not necessarily associated with it, which Schenker wants to change with the VIA 14 – a pretty successful endeavor.
Schenker XMG stands for extremely powerful gaming laptops based on Clevo barebone designs. The manufacturer has made its name in this area, though of course, the laptop market does not only consist of gaming laptops.
With the Schenker VIA 14, Schenker expands into the office market. To do this, Schenker chose a Clevo barebone with the most popular size in the office/business segment – 14 inch. Also, Schenker focuses on a low weight as well as strong battery life.
In our review of the Schenker laptop, this combination proves to be successful. The grey magnesium chassis of the Schenker VIA 14 is roughly as light as the more expensive Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7. At the same time, it contains a 73 Wh battery, which is best in class. Other 14 inch business laptops like the Lenovo ThinkPad T490s or Dell Latitude 7400 have 57 to 60 Wh battery capacity. With this advantage, its no surprise that the Schenker laptop easily beats the competition when it comes to battery life. In the Wi-Fi test with 150 cd/m² screen brightness, it achieves a battery life of 14 hours.
If we look at other factors, the manufacturer of the XMG laptops has not built in many other flaws into the VIA 14 either. Many of the negatives we found are not that serious. The closes to substantial criticism is probably that the Schenker VIA 14 lacks business features and warranty options. In the end, this is probably the reason why Dell, Lenovo and HP should not be too worried about the VIA 14, as it is more made for individual consumers and less for big enterprise customers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Updated | Alleged Xiaomi Mi Band 5 wearable fitness tracker images leaked</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Three supposed images of the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 wearable fitness tracker have been leaked. The images originate from a popular Chinese social networking site and feature the wearable in switched-on and turned-off states. There is a distinctly visible capacitive button taking up a good portion of the narrow-bezel display. Noted Xiaomi tipster believes the images are fake.
Update May 2: The well-known tipster Xiaomishka has stated that the images of the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 are fake.
Original story:
Xiaomi’s Mi Band 5 fitness tracker may have just been leaked in a handful of images recently posted on the SlashLeaks website (see images below). It seems the photos were sourced from Weibo, and they show the upcoming wearable with and without an interchangeable wrist strap. When turned on, the display of the alleged Mi Band 5 reaches to the surrounding thin bezels, with only a capacitive button interrupting the screen.
Rumors that have been circling around the Xiaomi Mi Band 5 wearable included one that stated the successor to the popular Mi Band 4 could come with a 1.2-inch AMOLED screen. This would be a considerable step up from the predecessor’s 0.95-inch touchscreen. Clearly, if these are actual images of the Mi Band 5 then the star of the show is the practically bezel-less display.
The Xiaomi Mi Band 5 is also expected to offer NFC capability to users around the globe this time (not just limited to China). There have been some whispers that the wearable fitness tracker could be released in June, although there is no official release date or price tag yet. In comparison, the Xiaomi Mi Band 4 without NFC cost 169 yuan (US$24) upon launch while the variant with NFC support cost 229 yuan (US$32).

    <h5 class="mb-1">OnePlus 8 Pro: OnePlus confirms that the black crush issue is a hardware defect, offers replacements</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some OnePlus 8 Pro units suffer from well-documented green tint and black crush display issues. OnePlus is now acknowledging the latter to be a hardware defect, and is offering to repair, refund, or replace affected units.
A few weeks ago, reports surfaced pointing out flaws in the display of the OnePlus 8 Pro. There were widespread complaints over green tint issues and a black crush problem. OnePlus promised to investigate the matter, and it would seem that the company has now made a decision.
Going by a post on the Reddit OnePlus forum, OnePlus has now acknowledged the black crush issue and is classifying it as a hardware defect. The company also gives buyers three options: repair, refund, or a replacement. That's about par for issues like this.
The post has been corroborated by other users on the forum. However, it remains unclear as to whether the company is taking the same stance on the green tint issue, as it's similarly a display problem. OnePlus has sent two updates to the OnePlus 8 Pro since the complains began, but the issue persists, supporting our initial assertion that it's a hardware defect as opposed to a software problem like on the Galaxy S20 Ultra.
We'll be sure to keep you updated on this.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Matisse paints a beautiful picture for Zen 2 and Ryzen 3000 as AMD claims 91% of Mindfactory's CPU sales for April</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mindfactory’s sales data for March 2019 to April 2020 has been released and the CPU charts make for extremely grim viewing for Intel. In March of last year, Intel had a reasonable 31% of the sales share but that has now plummeted to just 9% by April this year. Clearly, the Zen 2-based Matisse range has been a runaway hit for AMD.
AMD has now reached a point that its processors are selling at a rate of over 10 to 1 compared to Intel in Mindfactory’s sales data. The information revealed by this large German retailer offers a reasonable indication of how the CPU market is performing overall, and it seems to say that the Ryzen 3000 series has been a smash-hit success with customers. Four charts detailing the changes from March 2019 to April 2020 have been shared, and it all looks rosy for AMD.
The main focus is on the number of CPUs sold, as this plainly shows how Intel’s figures have dipped over the last 12 months, to the point that April reveals 91% of AMD CPUs compared to 9% of Team Blue’s processors sold. As always, it appears to be the Matisse processor Ryzen 5 3600 that leads the way while the more performance-oriented Ryzen 7 3700X continues to attract fans. The revenue chart tells a similar story, and it also neatly points out the higher average prices of Intel parts, as although AMD claimed 93% of sales the revenue share figure for Team Red stands at a lower 86%.
Interestingly, one of the charts (see below) depicts the most popular CPUs by architecture for April, and this is obviously led by Matisse processors. Based on 7nm technology and Zen 2 microarchitecture, the Ryzen 3000 series has been immensely popular, which is demonstrated by the 66% of total sales claimed (73% when just incorporating AMD parts). Intel’s most popular architecture is the Coffee Lake Refresh generation, which manages just 8% of the total sales but claims a whopping 91% of Team Blue’s individual sales, headed by the powerful but still expensive Intel Core i7-9700K.

    <h5 class="mb-1">SteamVR canned for Apple's Macs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A blog post on the Steam website has announced the sudden cancellation with immediate effect for SteamVR support on macOS. Instead, Mac users have been directed to use what are now legacy builds of the platform as Steam now switches its full support focus to both Windows and Linux.
Apple has been long-rumored to be working on some form of AR and VR technologies but it has been a long time coming. After initially working with Valve to bring support for its SteamVR platform to macOS in 2017, that collaboration has officially ended with development of SteamVR for Macs officially dumped. Valve has directed Mac users to continue using what is now a legacy platform while it now shifts its full development focus for SteamVR to Windows and Linux.
Apple was famously eviscerated by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey back in 2016 who said then that “We’ll make Oculus for Mac when Apple releases a good computer”. Apple responded by releasing its next generation of iMacs, MacBooks and iMac Pro with VR-level graphics capabilities and through its VR partnership with Valve. However, since then VR and AR technologies have struggled to gain widespread consumer traction.
This was highlighted recently when the once high-flying flag bearer of consumer AR Magic Leap announced a major restructure that cancelled its consumer AR efforts. Instead, in the process of shedding around 1,000 employees, the company is now pivoting to potential commercial applications for its AR tech. Similarly, Microsoft has also focused its AR Hololens efforts on enterprise and Apple is now thought to be doing the same.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS in Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 scores higher than the average Intel Core i7-10750H on UserBenchmark but still gets a lower bench result</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS APU sample has been spotted on UserBenchmark as part of an Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 laptop. The new Ryzen 4000 chip racked up some excellent scores on the benchmark that offered a higher overall score than the average overall score of all the Intel Core i7-10750H samples that had been tested…but the Renoir APU received a lower bench result.
UserBenchmark’s questionable scoring system seems to have been tested once again thanks to the appearance of an AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS sample on the test site. The Ryzen 4000 part was tested inside an Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 GA401II gaming laptop. The overall benchmark result for the Ryzen 5 4600HS was 86.2%, and its 1-core and 2-core results were surprisingly strong for an AMD mobile processor.
The AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS is a 6-core, 12-thread APU with a TDP of 35 W and a clock range of 3.0 GHz – 4.0 GHz. In comparison, the Comet Lake Intel Core i7-10750H is also a 6-core, 12-thread part that has a TDP of 45 W and a clock range of 2.6 GHz – 5.0 GHz. The Comet Lake processor was chosen for comparison simply because the Ryzen 4000 APU pretty much blows the older Intel Core i7-9750H out of the water – at least on UserBenchmark.
If you compare the Normal, Heavy, and Extreme scores (see table below) you can see that the AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS only just falls behind in the Normal result and then defeats the Intel Core i7-10750H in the Heavy and Extreme tests. Admittedly, this is based on a “peak” performance from the Renoir APU compared to the average of the Comet Lake samples (177 units tested at the time of writing). The overall scores created by adding the three test results are: 1,775 points for the i7-10750H and a credible 1,858 points for the Ryzen 5 4600HS. But the Intel processor is awarded a higher bench percentage: 86.9% vs. 86.2%.
This is not the first time UserBenchmark has been pulled up for this kind of result, and it cannot be all attributed to single-core performance score weighting, as the AMD Ryzen 5 4600HS manages a 1-core score of 129 points compared to the i7-10750H’s 133 points (average). That’s a small difference, especially when you compare the huge gap in the 64-core test results: 1,031 points (AMD) vs. 956 points (Intel). The curious bench result should not take anything away from the impressive performance managed by the new Renoir 4000 APU in the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The LG Velvet appears in hands-on images as a demo unit in South Korea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It seems LG has dropped all pretense of keeping its upcoming premium mid-ranger, the Velvet, under wraps until its May 2020 launch. It has been spotted in one of this OEM's physical stores in South Korea. This new leak may confirm a build quality to match its looks, and also how it looks with its Dual Screen cover.
The LG Velvet, a novel phone to be launched on May 7, 2020, has surfaced prior to this event. It has been spotted live in a brick-and-mortar store in South Korea. One of its patrons has snapped several photos of the device in question, which were then uploaded to a forum on the entertainment website Naver.com.
This user has also logged some observations on the Velvet's apparently high build quality and appealing finish along with these images. Then again, this new leak does not reveal anything new about this phone, only serving to re-affirm earlier reports on its specs, most of which have been corroborated by LG itself.
On the other hand, they do at least show how 2 of this new phone's colorways may look in real life. In addition, the Velvet's Dual Screen accessory is also shown in 1 of the images, revealing that this case has a waterdrop-notched second display that mirrors that of the actual device. However, no hint of either product's price is given in this new set of snaps.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Energy Star confirms Core i7-1065G7 and 32 GB of RAM for the Surface Book 3 but no Ryzen 4000 Renoir options; third Surface Go 2 SKU confirmed too</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Featuring a Core i7-1065G7 and 32 GB of RAM, the Surface Book 3 SKUs that have flown through Energy Star are sizeable upgrades over their predecessors. It looks increasingly unlikely that there will be any Ryzen 4000 Renoir options, though. Energy Star has confirmed the existence of a third Surface Go 2 SKU, too.
The Surface Book 3 has reared its head again, this time at Energy Star. Listed along with the Surface Go 2 in recent certification publications, Microsoft is expected to unveil new Surface hardware this month.
While the Surface Book 3 has been nailed on as one of the devices to be unveiled by Microsoft this spring, there has been plenty of talk about what processors it will feature. Energy Star has offered some clarification on this, and it is not good news for AMD and Renoir fans.
In short, it is looking unlikely that Microsoft will release a Ryzen 4000 version of the Surface Book 3. If Microsoft had planned to do so, then it would have assigned this model another SKU, as it has with the AMD version of the Surface Laptop 3 15. As it stands, Microsoft has only registered Intel SKUs of the Surface Book 3. Hence, unless Energy Star publishes another Surface Book SKU in the coming days, we doubt that Microsoft will release an AMD-powered Surface Book 3. 
Contrary to previous rumours, the two Energy Star listings suggest that Microsoft has developed Ice Lake-U versions of the Surface Book 3. Energy Star reports that both the 13.5-inch and 15-inch models have been tested running a quad-core Core i7 processor with a 1.3 GHz base clock.
Energy Star accurately reports base clocks, so these three elements are enough to deduce what processor is powering these Surface Book 3 units. Reasonably, only the Core i7-1065G7 matches the description offered by Energy Star, which also confirms that Ice Lake-U processor are headed to the Surface Book 3.
Do not rule out Microsoft releasing Comet Lake-U variants too, though. Microsoft would not need to assign another SKU for a Comet Lake-U Surface Book 3, in the same way it did not with 7th and 8th generation Intel Core versions of the Surface Book 2.
Energy Star confirms that the Surface Book 3 will be configurable with up to 32 GB of RAM, an upgrade over the Surface Book 2. Additionally, the listings make plain that the C3K1900 and C3K1899 at the FCC are the Surface Book 3 13 and Surface Book 3 15, respectively. Incidentally, the FCC has confirmed that at least the 13.5-inch model will be fitted with an Intel AX201D2W Wi-Fi 6 modem.
Energy Star also offered assurances that the Surface Go 2 will be configurable with up to a Core m3-8100Y and 8 GB of RAM. The listing references model numbers 1926 and 1927, on which we have previously reported.
Interestingly, the listing mentions model 1901, listed as the C3K1901 at the FCC. Confirmed to be featuring an Intel AX200 Wi-Fi modem, this is the first we have heard of a third Surface Go 2 SKU. Energy Star and the FCC offer limited details about the device too, besides it including an Intel modem. Regardless, the release of the Surface Go 2 and Surface Book 3 should only be a few weeks away now, although Microsoft is yet to confirm a date.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No "baap of all" this year? Raja Koduri claims Intel is still focused on integrated graphics in the short term, leaving RTX 2080 Ti safe at the top</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Intel's Raja Koduri recently tweeted that the company's main focus is on integrated graphics, quashing hopes that high-performance Intel Xe GPUs will compete with the RTX 2080 Ti and second-gen Navi cards this year.
Intel earlier tweeted that upcoming Intel Xe high-performance GPUs will have "tens of billions" of transistors, implying that the new Intel Xe parts could go head to head with 4K graphics cards.
However, a recent tweet by Intel's Raja Koduri poured water on hopes of a high-performing Xe part. Apparently in response to a question, Koduri had this to say: Our current focus is very much around unsolved user problems in PC Graphics - particularly in integrated graphics and segments immediately above that reach 100's of millions of gamers every year."
In Koduri's own words, Intel's "current focus" is on integrated graphics and the segment "immediately above," presumably NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050-class hardware. This aligns more or less with the performance figures we've seen so far from Tiger Lake graphics and Intel's DG1 unit.
While the "baap of all" Intel Xe High Performance GPU is being worked on, we don't expect it to arrive any time soon. Our first (and probably second and third) experiences with Intel Xe graphics will likely be with low-profile discrete and integrated options.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Pixel 4a's full camera specs are allegedly detailed in a new leak</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cuban vlogger TecnoLike Plus has already purported to have reviewed the Google Pixel 4a's cameras well ahead of its launch. Now, the same source has leaked this phone's relevant specs in more detail. It seems the phone has the same Sony IMX shooters as some older Pixels on its front and back.
The Pixel 4a's cameras have been leaked by TecnoLike Plus (aka Julio Lusson) to some degree already. Now, it is claimed that he has sent this upcoming budget-Google phone's full camera specs to the XDA. It comes in the form of Device Info HW and DevCheck app read-outs, allegedly associated with this device.
Their results may come as little enough of a surprise for in-depth Pixel followers. They apparently show that the 4a has an 8MP Sony IMX355 for a front camera, a sensor with an f/2.0 lens and pixels of 1.14 microns in size. Its single main shooter is a 12.2MP f/1.73 Sony IMX363 with 1.4 micron pixels. If they sound familiar, this is because they have also featured in the Pixel 3/3a and 4 respectively.
Despite this apparent recycling of tech at Google, this makes for good news for smartphone photography enthusiasts without quite all of the money. This new leak, should it prove accurate, points to the same shooting power so lauded in the 3 and 4 series. For example, they indicate that the Pixel 4a will be able to do effective portrait shots despite using only 1 sensor at a time.
In addition, XDA contributors point out that the 3a's successor may also deliver effective Super Res Zoom, Night Sight and dynamic range. However, these new camera samples also show it may suffer in terms of exposure in some shots.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AMD Ryzen 7 4800U in Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 arms itself with a Fire Strike Physics Score that shoots down the Intel Core i7-1065G7 and targets the Core i7-10750H</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An AMD Ryzen 7 4800U inside a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 device has managed a remarkable Physics Score in 3DMark’s Fire Strike test. The Renoir APU notched up 17,578 points, which puts it far out of reach of the similarly energy efficient Ice Lake Core i7-1065G7 and within shouting distance of the more power-hungry Comet Lake Intel Core i7-10750H.
A potent combination of an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U and a Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 has been found racking up formidable scores on 3DMark’s Fire Strike benchmark. We already reported about this Ryzen 4000 APU throwing up an amazing result of 18,588 points on the same benchmark in the past, but the system used for that run was not named. This time around, we have a new Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 and RAM @4,266 MHz to help speed things along.
Comparisons with the AMD Ryzen 7 4800U are a little tricky; for instance, in the past we compared the Renoir APU’s score with that managed by the Intel Core i9-9880H due to both processors wielding 8 cores and 16 threads. If we attempt to compare by TDP (and discount Intel’s notoriety in this regard) then the 15 W Ryzen 7 4800U APU can take on the 15 W Intel Core i7-1065G7. The Renoir part thrashes the Ice Lake chip in the Fire Strike Physics Score, but the AMD APU has twice the amount of cores and threads here.
The tipster _rogame compared the AMD Ryzen 7 4800U’s result with an unnamed Tiger Lake-U part, the powerful Ryzen 9 4900HS, and the 45 W Comet Lake Core i7-10750H. The Ryzen 7 4800U's score is close to the reported i7-10750H’s result and even more so when compared to our own results with the same Intel processor. But now energy consumption becomes a massive factor: The Ryzen 4000 APU in the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 utilizes an iGPU; the Core i7-10750H in _rogame’s post has a 15 W Nvidia GeForce MX350 alongside it while the Acer Predator Triton 500 we tested for a median result of 17,703 points featured a power-sucking Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 mobile GPU.
For additional clarity, all the results can be compared in the table below. It all boils down to the fact that taking into account core count and power consumption, the AMD Ryzen 7 4800U in the Lenovo Yoga Slim can cook up a great synthetic benchmark performance without cooking up the internals or your electricity bills. The new Intel Core i7-10875H, which also has 8 cores and 16 threads, can amass much higher Fire Strike Physics Score results, but yet again as a 45 W part with significantly higher clock rates it wields an imbalanced power advantage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">iPhone SE vs Galaxy S10e vs Huawei Nova 5T – The showdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Consumers looking for a premium smartphone without a premium price tag will find several options available from the world’s top three smartphone brands.
Apple recently launched its new iPhone SE, which takes the body of an iPhone 8 and combines it with powerful components from the latest flagship iPhones.
This follows Samsung’s Galaxy S10e, which offers a range of high-end features at a price that outshines its bigger S10 and newer S20 counterparts, and Huawei’s Nova 5T, a mid-range entry with high-end specifications and sleek design.
We compared these three smartphones to see which offers the best features.
The iPhone SE 2020 is the smallest smartphone of the three, although the Galaxy S10e is only slightly larger.
It features the same aluminium-and-glass body as the iPhone 8 and is available in white, black and red.
The Samsung S10e sports glass on the front and back, with a metal side frame. It comes in white, green, blue, and a bright canary yellow.
The Huawei Nova 5T is the thickest and tallest option of the three and also comes in an aluminium-and-glass body, with colour options of blue, purple or black.
When it comes to display size and resolution, the Nova 5T and Galaxy S10e are ahead of the iPhone SE.
The Nova 5T has the largest display, measuring 6.26 inches with a 1,080 x 2,340 resolution and 412 pixels-per-inch (ppi).
The S10e, however, boasts a more advanced AMOLED display, which delivers better colours and contrast.
Its resolution is slightly lower than the Nova 5T’s at 1,080 x 2,280, but its smaller 5.8-inch size means this translates into 438 ppi.
The iPhone SE features a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 750 x 1,334 resolution and 326 ppi.
When it comes to power, however, the tables are turned.
Possibly the biggest selling point of the iPhone SE is its performance, as it features the same processor that comes in the iPhone 11 series – the A13 Bionic.
Benchmarks have shown this chip outperforms rival offerings from Qualcomm, Samsung, and Huawei.
The South African version of the Galaxy S10e features Samsung’s Exynos 9820, which performed well in smartphone processor benchmarks.
Huawei has powered the Nova 5T with the same processor as the one in its 2019 flagship P30.
The Kirin 980 slots in just beneath the Exynos 9820 in terms of performance benchmarks.
When it comes to cameras, the iPhone SE sports a single 12MP wide camera on the rear and a 7MP sensor on the front.
The S10e also has a 12MP sensor but adds a 16MP ultrawide lens on the back for shots with a 123-degree field-of-view. On the front, it sports a 10MP selfie camera.
The Nova 5T packs a quad-camera combination of 48MP primary, 16MP wide, 2MP macro, and 2MP bokeh lenses.
Digital Camera World has said this makes for a powerful mobile shooter at an affordable price, with excellent low-light photography and AI capabilities.
Tests by TechRadar revealed that the 3,750mAh battery in the Huawei Nova 5T will typically provide users with a full day of heavy use, while still having around 20% battery remaining at the end of the day.
The battery supports 22.5W fast wired charging which can fill it up to 50% in 30 minutes.
Apple does not share the capacity of its smartphone batteries, but claimed that the iPhone SE battery will last for around 13 hours.
The S10e’s battery capacity sits between the iPhone SE and Nova 5T. It has a 3,100mAh pack which can be charged with 15W wired or 15W wireless charging.
Additionally, the S10e supports reverse wireless charging, which can be used to provide power to compatible devices.
While pricing and availability for the iPhone SE in South Africa is not available yet, it is currently priced at $399 for the 64GB version in the US.
The Samsung S10e and Huawei Nova 5T are available from various retailers and online stores in South Africa.
On Takealot, the S10e is available from R10,699, while the Nova 5T starts at R8,599.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Supersonic fixes leak in data usage website</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Internet service provider Supersonic has fixed a security flaw in its customer status and data usage website that could leak client information.
The usage portal allowed you to look up information about a customer using their account number, username, mobile number, or SIM number.
However, clicking the “Submit” button next to the blank mobile number field resulted in a list of eight customer accounts being returned.
Information from each of the exposed customer accounts that was potentially leaked included their name and cellphone number, as well as account number and username.
As Supersonic account numbers are sequential, a user would also have been able to harvest data about customers in the database with a script. Fortunately, there is no evidence that such an attack to mass harvest customer data took place.
“We have stringent systems and processes in place to detect issues like this and when there is a potential risk, we act on it as an emergency priority,” Supersonic told MyBroadband.
“Supersonic is governed by MTN’s data breach policy and would notify customers of any breach if there was one.”
Within three hours of the issue being reported to Supersonic, it had replaced its old status and data usage portal with a more secure version.
It only lets you view your connection status and data usage using the mobile phone number that has been linked to your account.
The new portal also has a basic arithmetic security question to prevent a human from manually trying many different mobile numbers in quick succession.
Screenshots showing the new and previous portals are embedded below.
This is the account list that appeared if you clicked the “Submit” button next to the mobile number field on the previous page.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Where fibre doesn’t reach – Wireless ISPs in South Africa need help</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) in South Africa have seen a massive increase in traffic on their networks following the declaration of a national state of disaster.
During “after work” hours from 17:00 to 22:00, WISPs have seen an average increase in traffic of 30%.
In normal daytime working hours, traffic on wireless connections around South Africa has doubled. They have also seen a doubling in Internet traffic during off-peak hours, between 22:00 and 05:00.
“There has been a huge increase in demand without an increase in revenue,” the Wireless Access Providers’ Association (WAPA) told MyBroadband.
This is because, unlike South Africa’s cellular networks, wireless ISPs usually sell flat-rated uncapped services. Prices are calculated based on average usage patterns, which have been thrown off completely as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and South Africa’s lockdown.
WAPA said that South Africa’s WISPs provide connectivity for around 450,000 homes and businesses.
While wireless ISPs are under pressure, WAPA said the support they have received from the government so far has been good.
“Government wants to know anything that’s stopping the networks, or holding them back,” WAPA stated.
WAPA also expressed appreciation for the work that the FTTX Council Africa have done on behalf of Internet access providers.
“There is a daily meeting with the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies,” said WAPA.
“The work that Andile Ngcaba and Juanita Clark has done there has been fantastic.” Ngcaba is the president and Clark the CEO of FTTX Council Africa.
In addition to engaging with the government, WAPA said its main focus has been ensuring the safety of staff members.
This includes a COVID-19 installation procedure guide, and a cybersecurity survival guide to allow technicians to continue to install and maintain links safely.
“We don’t want our technicians to be carriers of this disease, and we want them to be able to continue to do their work and connect people during this time,” WAPA said.
WAPA has also put out a standard essential services permit for its members to use.
“There has been the odd over-enthusiastic policeman out there, but generally it’s been good,” it said.
While there is constructive dialogue between the industry and the government, there are still areas where network operators and technicians are experiencing challenges.
For example, technicians have reported that while they can get the ICT equipment they need, it’s a challenge to get vehicle spares and other hardware.
Rawl bolts, ladders, and fan belts for vehicles have become difficult to get following the lockdown.
“There is a sub-supply chain that no one thought about until the lockdown,” WAPA said.
Wireless ISPs provide Internet access by connecting homes or businesses to high sites via Wi-Fi antennas.
Wi-Fi uses bands of unlicensed spectrum, which is allocated for use by ICASA.
ICASA recently handed out radio frequency spectrum for cellular networks to use on a temporary basis, which included TV White Spaces spectrum for certain wireless ISPs.
However, ICASA has not provided WISPs that rely on Wi-Fi with spectrum relief so that they can increase the capacity of their networks.
WAPA explained that wireless ISPs can’t really use the spectrum ICASA was handing out, because it would create an expensive problem for them when they have to give the spectrum back.
WAPA has submitted a request to ICASA to open up spectrum in the 5.8GHz – 6.1GHz range.
“A lot of WISPs already have equipment that can operate in that range. Some go as high as 6.3GHz,” WAPA told MyBroadband.
“WISPs are hungry for this. It would be a quick software configuration change that we can turn on within an hour.”
When asked if there was anything subscribers can do to help their ISPs, WAPA said the most important thing at this stage for small businesses is cash flow.
“We are linked into a global community of service provider associations all over the world,” WAPA said.
Countries like Italy and Spain are about a month ahead of South Africa in terms of feeling the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which gives WAPA a way to forecast what to expect.
“We’re waiting for feedback from Italy and Spain regarding potential revenue knocks to expect in SA.”
WAPA said the most important thing people can do is to pay their Internet subscriptions.
“Small businesses don’t have the reserves of cash that huge telcos do,” WAPA said. “It is really important that people pay their subscriptions on time.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Which ISPs will give free Openserve fibre and ADSL speed upgrades</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Openserve recently announced free line speed upgrades for fibre and ADSL subscribers.
The move has received a mixed response from Internet service providers in South Africa, however.
While some ISPs have praised the move, other reactions have been more measured or even negative.
Similarly, certain ISPs indicated they received a corresponding free upgrade to their wholesale capacity on the Openserve network, enabling them to pass on the benefits to their customers. Others said they will have to fund a portion of the upgrade themselves.
Additionally, only fibre connections slower than 100Mbps will receive line speed upgrades – along with ADSL connections slower than 10Mbps.
These upgrades were set to start rolling out from 1 May 2020 and will remain in effect for three months, Openserve said.
Only clients who had active connections on 22 April will qualify for the promotion.
MyBroadband asked several ISPs whether they will be passing on Openserve’s line speed upgrades to clients. Their feedback is below.
Cool Ideas said it will pass on the Openserve line speed upgrades to its subscribers.
It explained that Openserve has changed its wholesale model recently, and is flattening its billing structure.
Level-7 said it will pass the Openserve upgrade onto its subscribers.
“Our customers with active Openserve FTTH services on 22 April 2020 will be upgraded automatically in stages starting from 24 April and are expected to completed by 10 May 2020,” Level-7 told MyBroadband.
“While Openserve provides the access portion to customers with an upgraded fibre line speed, we are bringing our part and providing the additional bandwidth at no extra cost to assist all of our customers during the lockdown period.”
Afrihost said it will participate in Openserve’s promotion, even though Openserve did not provide a corresponding free upgrade to its wholesale capacity.
“Openserve is giving assistance during May on [wholesale capacity], but not June or July,” Afrihost stated.
“[A free upgrade] would be ideal, but even if they don’t, we will upgrade the [wholesale capacity] by whatever is needed – at our cost – so that clients get their full speed.”
RSAWEB said it has taken up the Openserve offer and its bandwidth utilisation has nearly doubled across the board, with customers experiencing great speeds and high throughput.
“New orders and existing services of 10/20/40 Mbps speeds will be upgraded for free to the next available package,” RSAWEB told MyBroadband.
New subscribers will also receive their first month free.
RSAWEB said that it will upgrade ADSL subscribers to 10Mbps where technically possible.
“We are pleased that Openserve has worked with us to assist our customers in this time of crisis and together we can offer even more value.”
Mind The Speed has informed customers it will not be participating in Openserve’s promotion.
The ISP told MyBroadband it has historically sold Openserve services at a big loss.
“While the [wholesale bandwidth] costs have dropped dramatically, the circuit costs have increased. This means that we will still actually make a loss on Openserve,” Mind The Speed explained.
“The most popular package on Openserve is our 10Mbps package, which was initially priced at R460 per month. We’ve had to revise this cost because of the new circuit costs. For now, we have not amended the cost to our existing customers due to the current economic situation.”
Mind The Speed said that when the lockdown was announced in March, traffic on its network increased by 50%.
“This has had a direct impact on our subsequent running costs, which have increased dramatically,” the ISP stated.
“To maintain the integrity of our network and speeds we’ve made the necessary upgrades to some parts of our network to manage the increased loads. The rand/US dollar depreciation has also contributed to an increase in costs, which we have not passed onto our customers.”
Mind The Speed said at this point it is trying to keep its costs down and absorb what it can to avoid passing it onto customers.
MWEB will pass Openserve’s line speed upgrades onto its clients.
MWEB said it has received a corresponding wholesale bandwidth upgrade from Openserve to go with its free speed upgrade promotion.
“As per the Openserve communication to us, this will be deployed in a phased approach envisaged to be completed by 10 May 2020.”
Vox said it will pass on Openserve’s free line speed upgrades to customers.
On whether Openserve provided it with a corresponding wholesale bandwidth upgrade, Vox said there was no free upgrade.
“Openserve gave the ISPs an option to opt into their new set of broadband products on ADSL and FTTH,” Vox explained.
“This new set of products has a different billing methodology to their previous products with a drop in [wholesale price] but an increase in the line rentals.”
Vox said that it will have to cater for the additional traffic on the Openserve network. This means it will have to increase the wholesale capacity it buys from Openserve to accommodate the increased line speeds, absorbing the additional cost.
Webafrica said it will pass on Openserve’s line speed upgrades to clients.
The ISP told MyBroadband that Openserve has zero-rated all wholesale bandwidth costs for April and May.
“The line speed increase period runs from May to July, so we’ll feel some heat from a cost perspective in June and July,” it said.
While Webafrica was positive overall about Openserve’s changes to its wholesale billing model, it also noted that it has been selling Openserve fibre at a loss.
“We have been selling Openserve fibre below cost for some time now in anticipation of a big [wholesale bandwidth price] reduction and therefore won’t reduce retail prices,” Webafrica said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Queer Eye's Bobby Berk Shares 6 Design Tips That Will Help Transform Your Space</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When it comes to interior design, is there anyone we trust more than Bobby Berk? Hmm, probably not, to be honest. As one member of Queer Eye's Fab Five, Bobby handles all things interior design on the show. From thoughtful design techniques to helping people incorporate their passions into their decor pieces, his ability to transform spaces — especially small spaces — is truly unmatched. And since so many of us are spending lots of extra time in our own spaces right now, chances are you might be thinking about how to change things up a bit or improve upon what you already have.
POPSUGAR recently spoke to Bobby to get his expertise on making the most of your space, and his advice already has us excited to give things a refresh. Keep reading to see his tips, and get excited for Queer Eye's upcoming seasons on Netflix!
POPSUGAR: What is your biggest tip for making the most of a small space?Bobby Berk: Going vertical. The more you can take things off the floor and onto the walls, the more your room will open up. In a small space, try to keep the floor plan as open as possible by installing floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with bins and baskets for storage as well as hooks to hang anything you need to keep handy. I also love to go big with wall art and play with the scale in the room. The combo of wall art and wall storage will keep your space feeling large, while still feeling inviting.
PS: What are some of the major don'ts when decorating a small space/some of the biggest mistakes people make?BB: Hanging the curtains right on the window frame. More often than not, people will hang their curtain rods right above the window frame which will block most of the light coming in your window and make the room smaller. Instead, take them up almost all the way to the ceiling and hang them 10 to 12 inches wider than the window. That way it visually makes your window look larger and doesn't block any light.
PS: Does color matter when decorating a small space?BB: Absolutely! A lot of people think that painting a small room white can make it bigger, but sometimes going dark can actually make the room more dramatic and visually blur the lines between walls, making it feel larger. Just be sure to add some pops of warmth around the room so that it doesn't feel too cold or stark. I love bringing in brass and leathers to mix with the darker paint tones on the wall.
PS: Any specific tips for making a home office space even if you don't have a separate room?BB: Clear out the clutter. Workspaces work best when they are uncluttered and give you and your mind some space to focus. Try to carve out an area that is dedicated to work and then include everything that you need within arm's reach. If you are the visual type and love having some inspiration around you, think about adding a little cork board above your desk area that you can pin inspiration to.
PS: Any favorite decor pieces you're loving right now that don't break the bank?BB: Plants! I always try to bring in greenery and plants into any space, no matter how big or small. Not only do they bring some life into a room, but they can also help with the air quality. Go with something simple and sculptural for the plant and place it in a modern planter to give it a custom look. If you aren't the type with a green thumb, there are some great faux options that are affordable.
PS: Tips for remodeling/overhauling a space on a budget?BB: Paint is always a good option when you are looking to totally give a space an overhaul and still keep it affordable. I love to use temporary wallpaper to take it to the next level. Bringing some pattern onto your walls can completely change the look and feel of the room. With just a few rolls you can create an accent wall. My line with Tempaper is a great place to start if you are looking for some graphic patterns for your walls.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hey Google — how about making a phone with a MediaTek processor for a change?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The tech world on the Android side is dangerously close to free-fall mode. Many companies are losing money, others are close but still breaking even, and it's only predicted to get even worse. But during the last quarter, there was one company that seemingly fiddled while it watched the industry burn even though it was partially responsible for the fire: Qualcomm.
Qualcomm shipped 21% fewer smartphone platform chips (that means the processor, GPU, coprocessors for things like the camera or AI) yet made 5% more profit. How the hell do you pull that off, you might be asking? The answer is that you overcharge for your product and make sure people will buy it anyway.
More: The Snapdragon 865 is driving up flagship prices during a renaissance of affordable phones
Qualcomm is the ultimate grandmaster of this game. Think about it — would you walk into the Verizon store and buy a flagship Android phone that didn't have the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 series chip inside it? Of course not. When you're paying so much for a thing you expect it to be the best of things.

Qualcomm knows this but more importantly so does Samsung and LG and OnePlus and every other company that makes the "best" Android flagship phones. We react by saying Qualcomm is horrible for adding so much to the cost of the latest Snapdragon that phone prices have surpassed the $1,000 mark, which is true. But nobody pulled Samsung's arm and forced them to use it. Except we sorta did because we demand and expect it.
There is an alternative. Several, if you're counting at home, but one sticks out as being brand-agnostic for use by any company that makes phones: MediaTek. Its new Dimensity 1000 mobile platform looks pretty damn incredible with things like 5G support, AI coprocessors, support for actual three frame HDR video capture in real-time and excellent performance. I'll bet it is a might bit cheaper than a Snapdragon, too.
The real problem is finding a phone maker that wants to use it in a flagship phone outside of China or India. That phone maker could be — no, should be — Google.
Google can make Android run really well on any chip it wants to. That means Google could take a powerful chip from MediaTek and make a Pixel phone that works exactly like a Pixel phone with a Snapdragon inside it does and bypass the Qualcomm taxes. That gets the ball rolling for third-party optimizations for MediaTek chips from game developers and forces MediaTek to be more proactive on the security front. Everyone is a winner.
We are pretty sure that Google is developing its own mobile computing platform, and it most definitely should. An in-house solution specifically designed to run Android would be a game-changer and it needs to happen. But that's going to take years to get right, so in the meantime why not use a drop-in solution like the Dimensity 1000 for the flagship and an Helio P series for the Pixel a series?
More: Google designing its own phone processors would completely change the industry for the better
I doubt this is ever going to happen and every flagship phone sold in North America and half of Europe will be $1,000 / €1,000 Snapdragon-toting overpriced models. But some company needs to dare to pull away from Qualcomm and Google could get away with it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Which MVNOs work with more than one carrier?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Signing up for AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon service is making a commitment to a network. MVNOs just sell access to one of the major networks with different services and plans that might work better for some people. Most of them ditch any sort of contract as well. Unless an MVNO is partially owned or operated by a specific carrier, it will have no specific commitment to any network.
With an MVNO, it can be possible to choose which network works best for you or use one that's compatible with the phone you already have. Keep in mind that if you roam a lot or see extended LTE popping up on your phone, you're using another carrier's network and you may lose service in these areas on an MVNO.

Just be sure to check the coverage map for each carrier before signing up.
In April 2020, T-Mobile completed its purchase of Sprint taking over all of its network assets. While this will undoubtedly have an eventual impact on MVNOs making use of either network, for the time being, there's no set timeline for major changes.
If you use an MVNO that uses both Sprint and T-Mobile, you will only have access to that one network. Some MVNOs have roaming agreements in place but you will still connect to the primary network if at all possible. The only exception is Google Fi.
Google Fi is unique in its ability to make use of three networks in the United States simultaneously with no input from the user. There has been a lot of work behind the scenes to make this work correctly and still only works on select phones. Still, if you need the coverage offered by Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular, Google Fi is your best bet as long as you're willing to use the right phone.
Many MVNOs allow you to choose, or choose for you, the best network for your area or phone. One of the main reasons is that people will be able to use nearly any phone they buy with at least one of the MVNO's SIM cards. This can be a huge benefit to someone trying to save money buying used phones that may not support as many networks as newer high-end phones.
These are the carriers that have access to multiple networks.
There are quite a few good options but keep in mind that you will need to make sure you check the coverage for the carrier you intend to use as well as phone compatibility. The most important factor is making sure a carrier has coverage where you need it to. Still, having the flexibility to use nearly any phone with a carrier can give you a ton of freedom and help you save a lot of money.
Unlocked with pure Android
The Pixel 3a from Google is an affordable unlocked phone from Google with pure Android and an excellent camera. It works with nearly any carrier so you can take it with you if you decide to switch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Best Phones to Use with Mint Mobile in 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Best Phones to Use with Mint Mobile Android Central 2020
Mint Mobile is all about getting great service for a fraction of the price of the big carriers, and for many, that philosophy extends to the phone they choose to use. Thankfully, tons of great Android phones embody the same idea: getting a great experience with the latest specs and features and not paying top dollar for it. The best example of this is the OnePlus 8 Pro, which offers a flagship-like experience for less than the direct competition. It's a great phone to pair with the solid-but-inexpensive Mint Mobile service.
The OnePlus 7 Pro is as excellent and well-designed as any high-end smartphone out today. If you know much about OnePlus, you'll be happy to know it doesn't stray from its traditional formula. Instead, it extends to its logical place in the landscape of 2020 flagships with more features and a higher price — but of course, not too high.
The hardware is toe-to-toe with any flagship, and it's punctuated by the best display OnePlus has ever used. It's bright, colorful, and has a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Inside, there are top-end specs, and that leads to amazing performance thanks to its excellent OxygenOS software — it's just a joy to use.
The 8 Pro also brings the best cameras yet to a OnePlus phone, with a new main camera that steps up to a true flagship level. The entire camera experience is a bit behind the likes of the Galaxy S20+, but then again, it's also less expensive. That's really where the 8 Pro fits. It's a true flagship from top to bottom, but for a bit less money than the traditional players with big brand names.
The best OnePlus has made, but for less
The OnePlus 8 Pro is an impressive and well-designed flagship for hundreds less than the direct competition.
Before the Galaxy S20, the S10 series was a proven winner — and everything Samsung did with this new generation made it easy to recommend the S20+. The S20+ makes improvements across the board, with a bigger and better display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a large 4,500mAh battery, more RAM, and a new Snapdragon 865 processor.
The big move up is with the cameras, with a new array on both sides. The new sensors are larger, which let in more light and take dramatically better low-light photos. It's not quite on the level of the Pixel 4 XL, but this is a step up for Samsung and is no longer a weak point of this flagship. You also get capable zooming at 5-10X while keeping an ultra-wide camera for fun shots.
The only way the S20+ downgrades from the S10+ is in its price and removal of the headphone jack. We're talking about a couple hundred dollar increase from last year, and removing the audio jack is a tough blow for those who rely on it. Both are a result of the way the industry is going — phones keep getting more expensive, and it was one of the last holdouts with a 3.5 mm jack.
Samsung's excellent all-rounder is a winner
The S20+ has a fantastic screen, top-end specs, a strong array of cameras, and feature-packed software. It's expensive but worth it.
Since the Moto G8 isn't being sold directly in the U.S., the new Moto G Power fills the gap by offering a solid Android experience at an amazing price. The phone stands out in the battery department, offering multi-day endurance. Pair it with great software, fun cameras, and solid specs for the money, and the Moto G Power packs quite a punch.
That said, missing NFC and facing Motorola's infamous history with slow or nonexistent software updates could be a reason to think twice before buying one. However, if you want to save money upfront, you just can't beat what you get for this price.
Enough for most people's needs, at an excellent price
The Moto G Power carries on a long history of superb affordable Motorola phones with solid specs and cameras.
The Pixel 4 XL is several months old, but it's still easily the best camera you can get. In daylight, mixed-light, and super-low-light, it consistently beats every other Android — and arguably, the iPhone 11 Pro. While we had issues with its predecessor's performance, the camera app is now fast and fluid. A telephoto lens, paired with clever software, takes good zoom shots at 5X. Its front-facing camera isn't as wide as before, but that's a marginal downside. It still takes crisp, colorful, and bright photos along with great portrait selfies.
The 4 XL, as a complete phone, is, unfortunately, let down by a few shortcomings. Its battery life is the weakest of the flagship competition, it has less RAM (6GB) and storage (64 or 128GB), and its face unlock system hasn't been adopted by many popular apps that need biometric authentication. However, that shouldn't detract from the great things it does — and it is still fully in the conversation of the best phones you can get today.
The best camera you can get in a smartphone today
The Pixel 4 XL has great hardware and the best camera, but it's let down by poor battery life and weak specs for the money.
Samsung typically isn't associated with good inexpensive phones, but starting in 2019 the company started investing heavily in its new Galaxy A line, bringing the best features of its flagships down to a much more reasonable price bracket. The Galaxy A50 is one such beneficiary, with a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen, along with an Exynos 9610 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a massive 4000mAh battery.
The best part is that despite its price, it has a capable triple rear camera setup, with a primary 25MP sensor, secondary 8MP ultra-wide camera, and third 5MP sensor for depth information. There's also a huge 25MP camera for selfies, neatly tucked in a display notch.
Samsung's also included an in-display fingerprint sensor, something missing on most other phones in this price range. It's also making a big deal of its One UI software, which replicates the experience you get from its high-end Galaxy S phones.
This is Samsung's best budget phone in years
Samsung finally stepped up its budget game with the A50, a fantastic device that you can pick up for under $300.
OnePlus didn't change a whole lot in the 8 coming from the last-gen 7T, but it didn't need to. You get fresh hardware and design that keeps it in line with the 8 Pro, plus a bump in specs with the same great basics elsewhere. There's a really good 90Hz display, great battery life, solid camera performance, and amazing software.
Keeping its price relatively affordable in the scheme of ever-pricier high-end phones, you had to miss out on a few things. The cameras didn't improve from the 7T, and in some ways downgraded — you lose a telephoto camera and pick up a dedicated macro camera that isn't very useful. Unlike the 8 Pro, you don't get wireless charging, and at the same time, you have to deal with the fact that OnePlus is charging $100 more than it did six months ago for basically the same experience.
Still, if you're looking for a value-focused phone and can't step up to the OnePlus 8 Pro, this is a great phone. Alternatively, if you can find it, consider buying the OnePlus 7T at a deep discount instead.
A less-expensive entry into great OnePlus phones
The OnePlus 8 is a 7T with a few new specs and a larger battery. But even at its higher price, it still represents incredible value.
The Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra have paired up to replace the Note 10+ as top-end Samsung phones. But the Note 10+ is still a new device, and it feels modern and capable in just about every way. The hardware is very similar, the internal specs are behind on paper but not in actual real-world use, and they run the same software — and the Note 10+ will still get at least one more big platform update, so it isn't left behind.
The only big downsides compared to the newer phones are in the cameras and display. The cameras have been completely overhauled in the S20 series, with a big step up in main camera quality and low-light capabilities that are way beyond the Note 10+. The displays are basically the same in every way, except for one critical one: they have a 120Hz mode that makes all motion on the screen incredibly smooth and easy on the eyes. It's something you have to experience, and you probably won't want to go back.
On the other hand, nothing can replace the Note 10+'s S Pen. If you love the functionality a stylus brings, the S20+ or S20 Ultra isn't going to get the job done. And because the new models are now available, the Note 10+ is cheaper than it was at launch and a couple of hundred dollars less than even the S20+ — that in itself makes it appealing.
All of Samsung's great features, plus a unique stylus
For many, there's no replacement for a Note. You get great hardware and specs, with a huge display, and the unique S Pen.
ASUS has focused on bringing all of the mobile gaming features you could want in a phone — whether you're playing PUBG, Fortnite, or other intense titles.
The RoG Phone 2 stands out with a unique design that includes secondary charging and headphone ports along the side so they're out of the way when playing games in landscape mode, Air Trigger touch sensors that let you use the corners of your phone as customizable inputs for shooting games, and an external Aero Active Cooler accessory included in the box that keeps the phone cool for long gaming sessions.
The 6.6-inch display features a 120Hz refresh rate for the smoothest possible graphics, and the phone does a great job running games on top settings — even if the ASUS software is a bit busy. And its battery is massive, so you won't be caught dying at an inopportune time. ASUS has refined its vision for the perfect gaming phone, and it delivers. With its polarizing design and huge size, you will need to have a gaming focus to pick this over something more well-rounded, but some people take mobile games seriously and this phone is perfect for that use.
A phone that goes all-in on gaming, and executes well
Excellent performance and lots of gaming-specific features like side ports and heatsinks make this a gamer's dream.
When you're using Mint Mobile, you're likely focused on getting great service for less money, and you want a phone that follows the same philosophy.

Mint Mobile lets you bring any unlocked phone to its network, so your options are wide open. You can go through this list and find any phone that appeals to you — and your budget — and bring it to Mint without any issue. Whether that's our top pick or something else that meets your needs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to enable VoLTE on a OnePlus phone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VoLTE isn't particularly new, but it's a luxury feature nonetheless. Otherwise known as voice-over-LTE, this tech allows you to use your data connnection to make dramatically clearer, crisper-sounding voice calls instead of the garbled mess we're all used to. Just about every manufacturer and carrier supports VoLTE these days, and OnePlus is no exception — here's how to enable it.
Enabling VoLTE on a OnePlus phone is as simple as jumping into the Settings app and hitting a switch. Nearly every OnePlus phone is compatible with VoLTE (especially if your phone was released in the last couple of years), but your carrier might also play a part in whether or not you'll be able to use it. The vast majority of carriers support VoLTE, but you should check with your particular carrier if the following steps don't work for you.
Once enabled, you should begin to notice an immediate and significant improvement in call quality. Not only will callers on the other end of the line sound more clear, you'll sound better to them as well. As an added perk, most carriers count VoLTE talk time against your minutes rather than your data plan, just like regular calls, meaning even if you're on a plan with a limited data allowance, you'll be able to place calls over VoLTE all day long.
OnePlus's first full-blown flagship phone
From water resistance to wireless charging, 5G support, and three excellent cameras, the OnePlus 8 Pro offers everything you'd expect of a modern flagship. That includes the price, but it's well worth it for anyone after one of the best Android experiences around.
Last year's budget champ is still a great value today
The OnePlus 7T is still an incredible phone six months after its release, thanks to powerful specs and regular software updates. It lacks the OnePlus 8 Pro's luxuries like water resistance and wireless charging, but for nearly half the price, it's easy to recommend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From the Editor's Desk: Dropped to $600, the Pixel 4 XL is now a compelling mid-range phone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Google cut the prices of the Pixel 4 and 4 XL on the Google Store by $300 each this week, down to $500 and $600; and Amazon's price dropped to match. Short-term sales and certain retailers had dropped the Pixels down to these prices before, but with Google setting its own store prices there, it shows this is the new ceiling for the Pixels until they're replaced later this year.
The combination of this $300 price cut, and a swath of 2020 flagships coming out at ever-higher prices, have created an interesting situation: the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are now compelling mid-range phones.
The Pixel 4 XL, in particular, offers surprisingly competitive value with its larger screen and slightly more acceptable battery life. (I still wouldn't recommend the Pixel 4, due to its poor battery life, unless you're dying to have a small phone.) Flagship phones now hover around the $1000 price point, which is an entirely different ballpark than where the Pixel 4 XL is now playing.

We all have different definitions of what "mid-range" is, and it certainly has changed over the last few years. But when you look at the data of what phones sell for, anything in the $350-$650 is now considered mid-range. A broad segment, indeed, but anything higher starts to be considered a flagship while anything lower is purely focused on budget buyers.
The important point of putting the Pixel 4 XL in this price range is that the expectations change dramatically. For hundreds less than proper flagship phones, you know you aren't going to get everything. For $600, every phone you can buy is going to be missing features, specs or certain capabilities — and individual standout feature matter a whole lot more. And I'm sure this will muddy the waters when the Pixel 4a is announced soon, probably at $400, but that's another discussion to have in a couple weeks when it's official.
Think about it: now the Pixel 4 XL, Google's best phone and arguably still the best smartphone camera available, is now $100 less the OnePlus's cheapest phone, the OnePlus 8. Yes the OnePlus 8 has a better screen, longer battery life and newer specs, but it isn't a guaranteed winner here. The Pixel 4 XL has dramatically better cameras, more unique hardware, Google-exclusive software features and wireless charging.
At $600, you can probably forgive its slightly dim screen and last-gen spec sheet; and you might even be okay with its weak battery life. And you also know that in giving up a few things there, you're getting incredible camera quality. It's interesting what a difference the price can make — when you're saving hundreds of dollars, you get dramatically more lenient about what you accept in a phone. In my 6-month on review of the Pixel 4 XL I found it still has a whole lot going for it in its software, camera and overall experience — and despite its specs, its performance has continued to be great.
Even though we know the Pixel 4 XL can't compete head-to-head anymore with the Galaxy S20+ or even the OnePlus 8 Pro, it absolutely can compete in the middle tier of phones focused on value and price. We should stop looking at the Pixel 4 XL as a flagship phone, and look at it where Google itself sees the phone: in the mid-range.
-Andrew
With a big price cut, it's worth looking at again
The Pixel 4 XL doesn't command its original price — but for $300 off, it plays in a different category and actually looks really good. Yes, its battery life is still bad, and the spec sheet is weak. But the software and camera are exceptional, and there are lots of nice features here to stand out at $600.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How to change the terrible keyboard on your Samsung Galaxy phone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Let's be frank: Samsung's default keyboard on its Galaxy phones is not good. The touch response just seems off. Word and sentence prediction is horrible. It has lots of customization options, and that's about all it has going for it. Thankfully Android offers everyone the opportunity to choose the keyboard that's right for them, with zero compromises. When Samsung's keyboard starts to grate on you to the point where you want something new, here's how you can switch — and recommendations for which keyboard you should pick.
If you want to really get into it, there are hundreds of keyboard options on Google Play. You could spend hours and hours researching, but if you want to cut to the chase, we highly recommend starting with one of our favorites.
Google's own Gboard and the ever-present SwiftKey are excellent starting points that millions of people use and enjoy. Critically, they're both leaps and bounds ahead of Samsung's own keyboard. And they're both free!
Install either one of these suggested keyboards, or another you find in the Play Store, and then you'll be ready to switch.
Now that you have a new keyboard set as the default, there are a few extra things to know about keyboards on Android.
When you install most third-party keyboards, they will come with additional settings you can use to tweak how the keyboard looks and acts. Sometimes this comes in the form of an "app" in the app drawer that you can tap that takes you to the settings. You can usually access these settings quickly from the keyboard itself — there will often be a settings icon that'll jump right to the same place. If all else fails, head back to the "Language and input" settings for keyboard settings.
You can have multiple keyboards installed at once! Only one can be set as the default, but you can keep several installed if you're still on the fence about which one you like. If you have a need to switch between keyboards regularly, by default, you'll see a small keyboard selection button in the navigation bar any time you have a keyboard open. Just tap it, and you can quickly switch between any keyboard you've previously installed. All of the configurations options stay put.
This power bank strikes a good balance between capacity and portability, at 10,000mAh. It has USB-C to quickly recharge and provide power output to modern phones, and it also has Qualcomm Quick Charge to juice up your Galaxy phone as quick as a wall plug.
Triple (or at least double) your phone's storage to make tons of extra room for photos, videos, music and more. You don't have to go all-out with a massive card — you still get a huge amount of extra space for a good price.
This affordable 10W fast wireless charging pad is thinner on your desk or nightstand than most chargers on the market — even most of Samsung's — but is still very affordable. A blue LED makes it easy to tell if your phone is charging or fully charged.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After debuting via a well-received Casablanca collaboration, New Balance‘s 327 is now set to roll out in a trifecta of in-line colorways. A modern-day interpretation of ’70s NB products, the 327 brings together pieces of vastly divergent heritage silhouettes to create an entirely new style.
This trifecta of makeups range from wild to mild: there’s a vibrant half blue/half orange style, a traditional gray/white makeup and a women’s-sized mixture of gray, black and pink, all built of trim nylon and suede pieces. Each features a super-sized N logo drawn from the New Balance 320 on the midfoot, a slim EVA foam midsole and a studded outsole inspired by the New Balance 355 — a classic trail runner.
Thanks to these split colorblocking schemes, sharply shaped suede overlays and visceral branded embellishments, all three pairs make for appealing lifestyle options for any die-hard New Balance fans. Each will release on the New Balance webstore come May 9 — both men’s styles are priced at $110 USD, with the lone women’s iteration sliding under the century mark at $90 USD.
Elsewhere, take a look back at the adidas UltraBOOST‘s first five years on the market and see how it saved the Three Stripes’ lifestyle products.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quibi Users' Emails Have Been Leaked to Facebook, Twitter, and Google</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to reports, mobile streaming service Quibi gave away its user’s signup emails to several advertisers like Google, Facebook, Snapchat, and Google.
When new users sign up with an email, a confirmation link is sent. However, once users click the link, their email addresses are sent directly to third-party advertisers and analytics companies in plain text. The new streaming service has already been downloaded 2.7 million times since its launch two weeks ago. “In 2020, no new technology organizations should be launching that leaks all-new user-confirmed emails to advertising and analytics companies — yet that’s what Quibi apparently decided to do,” wrote Zach Edwards, a Victory Medium researcher who first noticed the problem.
Edwards also reported Quibi’s leak had been active over a week following the company’s notification of it on April 17. In a statement to Varietyand several other sites who reported the story, Quibi stated: “Data protection is essential to Quibi and the security of user information is of the highest priority. The moment the issue on our web page was revealed to our security and engineering team, we fixed it immediately.”
Although user emails will no longer be given away in this method, Quibi’s Privacy Policy states that it may share personal data with third-party providers anyway. This allows third-parties to provide the company services such as “personalized advertising, measurement, and verification.”
In other tech news, TikTok has exceeded 2 billion users.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Originally just a concept sneaker, Saucony finally brought the highly-nostalgic Grid Azura 2000 to life with the help of Boston-based streetwear label Bodega earlier this year, creating together a blue-and-lime-green pair for the retro fans out there. Now, three months after its resurrection, the sneaker brand is once again expanding on the offering with two new summer-ready colorways.
The first pair brings together a vibrant orange suede and mesh upper with deep black suede overlays plastered across the entire silhouette, creating streaks reminiscent of a tiger and its stripes. White accents and a translucent mono-mesh panel by the midfoot complete the loud colorway, finished with a pristine white midsole wrapped in an orange and black outsole. The second pair swaps the bright oranges with tonal grays across its upper, working in tandem with dark purple instead of black for its iconic stripes and patterning. Complementing the more understated shades is a saturated pink, dressing the logos by the tongue and midfoot as well as the outsole.
For those looking for more colorful options to update their footwear game for the warmer months. both colorways of the Saucony Grid Azura 2000 are now available over at Sneaker Politics, going for $110 USD each.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We have converged in our thinking that this is likely a time of a prolonged global recession, at least for 2020, recognising that recession is a rare event. Covid-19 has forced economies, to a varying degree, to be offline in an effort to minimise the contagion rate. This is negatively impacting companies’ earnings. The world is scrambling to find resources to protect businesses and households in the short-term and fund an economic recovery going forward.
Actions by G-20, the IMF and multi-laterals, through debt rollover and new debt financing, will buy Pakistan time but only national action will find us cures. Finding a cure for overhauling the national budget by financing expenditures through superior alternatives as opposed to burdening the taxpayer is a good starting point. Raising revenues for the budget through non-debt creating instruments — including divestment, recovering taxes and monies owed to the state — hold the big bang for the buck, but managing expenditure at a structural level will be the crowning achievement. The post-Covid economy will require rounds of spending — the more these rely on savings, the more sustainable the economic outcomes.
The myth that budget expenditures are rigid with little room for savings is only partially true. Attempts for budgetary savings are invariably limited to unnecessary cuts in development expenditure — an option best avoided when the economy needs a stimulus for reviving growth. Economic growth anchored in savings rather than borrowing can yield long-lasting dividends for the country. It is thus fundamental to control the steep rise and flatten the curve of expenditures like the unsustainable and unfunded pension liability. The past five years have seen a doubling of federal pension expenditure. A paltry amount of Rs50 billion in FY2009, grew to Rs215 billion in FY2015; Rs342 billion in FY2019; and to Rs421 billion in FY2020. Astonishingly, it’s almost as much as this year’s federal development expenditure. A continued yearly increase of 33% can potentially double the pension expenditure to Rs800 billion by FY2023.
Pensions are ballooning owing to yearly adjustment for inflationary impact; rise in number of recipients; increasing average age requiring longer-term payments; and increasing family pensions, from 50 to 75%. The story at provincial levels is even more frightening. At an intellectual level, the concern is similar to that of the government guaranteeing the private energy producers payment of a fixed rate of return, irrespective of productivity.
A cure to reduce government expenditure, based on sound economic reasoning, is to create a retirement funds’ market. The magic of markets will give an individual, manoeuvrability to build her/his own nest. From investing in high growth, balanced or fixed interest funds to diversifying across asset classes including shares, property or government securities, people will exercise their choices depending on their risk appetite, life cycle and retirement needs. Superannuation arrangements will be put in place by the government, to encourage people in the state service to accumulate funds, leading to a steady income stream post-retirement. Retirement funding would be compulsory and incentivised by tax benefits encouraging individuals to a pay-as-you-go approach. Advanced economies have moved to allow people to run self-managed funds. Hopefully, once the federation leads the reform, provinces can follow suit.
What’s good for people is good for the economy. Shift from state pensions to pension funds will improve the current dismal savings rate of 10%. Pension expenditures can become a non-debt creating instrument as they fade away from budget in the future. Commissions have run their life with their reports left unattended with little or no follow-up. This is a real chance to create a new budgetary framework, weaning off growth in expenditures through structurally altering the nature of savings. An effort led by the economic leadership and implemented by a dedicated team of fiscal experts, chartered accountants and fund managers and operationalised in a given time-frame. We are in an existential crisis — every bit of government spending needs a rethink. Sound economic management is all that will work.

    <h5 class="mb-1">5 reasons to start using a jade roller stat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If you’ve been anywhere near social media in the recent past, you would have seen a jade roller show up on your feed and it just so happens to be one of the most covetable tools in the beauty industry. Over the past few years the jade roller has gained much popularity however, the jade stone has been used in Chinese culture for hundreds of years. 
In Chinese culture, the jade stone represents beauty and eternal youth and it is also believed that rolling it across your face can result in youthful, glowing skin as the movement of the jade across the skin rids it of toxins and enhances collagen production. It is also believed that jade rollers stimulate blood circulation which in turn aids lymphatic drainage and detoxification. With that being said, we bring you five reasons to add a jade roller to your skin care regimen stat, as compiled from Lather.
1. No chemicals, no additives
One of the major reasons that beauty fiends rely heavily on a jade roller is due to the fact that there’s nothing in it. A jade roller is made of jade stone and a stainless steel body, with no chemicals and no additives. What more could you want right? Jade rollers also come in a variety of colours so you can take your pick. Being free from synthetic materials, a jade roller can be used on any skin type. 
2. Soothing for the skin
A jade roller will quite easily just glide across your skin and is the best way to massage your face. Massaging your face with a jade roller is a whole different ball game as opposed to when you do it with your fingers. The smooth texture of a jade roller will preserve the skin’s elasticity and roll out wrinkles, while soothing the skin. The two different ends of a jade roller can be used for different parts of your face. Pro tip: put your jade roller in the freezer 10 minutes before use. We promise you’ll thank us. 
3. Hello glowy skin
Using a jade roller will increase blood circulation to your skin and with better circulation comes an increased amount of oxygen and nutrients flowing directly to its surface. You will instantly see results in the form of a rosy glow and a luminous complexion. Use the roller across your face in strategic motions and also on either side of the neck to enhance lymphatic drainage.
4. Smooths out the skin 
A jade roller is great for smoothing out the skin. We tend to make an array of expressions with our faces, including raising our eyebrows, frowning and raising our foreheads; all of which can create deep lines and wrinkles. Using a jade roller at the end or beginning of the day will help you relax your facial muscles and result in a smoother and more youthful complexion. Win win!
5.It will supercharge your other skincare products
This is probably one of the most important reasons to incorporate a jade roller into your skin care regimen. If you’re using expensive skincare products but not correctly, then they won’t be effective. For these to actually benefit your skin, they have to absorb into the skin. A jade roller will ensure that your serums and moisturisers are rolled into your skin effectively and provide your skin with all the hydration it needs.
If you don’t have a jade roller or have one lying around that you’ve never used, it’s time to put this tool to the test, stat!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Los Angeles Times published an op-ed by the executive director of Access Now, a global organization that works to protect privacy, free expression, digital security and human rights among internet users. Now that the sale of the .org registry has been blocked, he explains why that matters. As the pandemic has shown, it has been left to civil society organizations, and individual volunteers, to step up and fill the gaps left by governments and corporations. Large organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, the International Red Cross and the United Nations provide direct, immediate support to hospitals and healthcare professionals. Neighborhood and grass-roots organizations have distributed meals and provided accommodation and friendship to the sick and vulnerable. These organizations range in size, mission, effectiveness and reach, but have two elements in common: They're working toward the betterment of society, and their websites end in dot-org... From downloading government health guidelines to online learning to connecting with isolated friends and family, the internet has become a lifeline. It has become the town square, the hospital and the schoolyard all at once. Now was clearly the time to protect it, not sell it off to private equity.... Private companies cannot be trusted to not "increase the rent" on small organizations. Private companies do not spend $1.1 billion on an internet domain unless there is profit to be made...What happens next isn't clear. If the Internet Society no longer wants to control the dot-org domain, an alternative will need to be found... To find this special home, we'll need an open process, innovative ideas and committed partners — all of which we've built over the last few, wild months.

[S]ophisticated scammers are beginning to use the Google-owned service to prevent automated URL analysis systems from accessing the actual content of phishing pages, and to make phishing sites more believable in the eyes of the victim, Barracuda Networks warned.In fact, the security solutions provider observed a single phishing campaign that sent out 128,000 emails to a variety of organizations and employees using reCAPTCHA walls to conceal fake Microsoft log-in pages. This campaign used the lure of a voicemail receipt to fool users into solving the reCAPTCHA wall before being redirected to the malicious page, with any log-in info entered then sent straight to the scammers.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beware of Emails Impersonating 'Microsoft Teams' Notifications</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Researchers at the email security company Abnormal Security have discovered "a multi-prong Microsoft Teams impersonation attack" involving "convincingly-crafted emails impersonating the automated notification emails from Microsoft Teams," reports Forbes: The aim, simply to steal employee Microsoft Office 365 login credentials. To date, the researchers report that as many as 50,000 users have been subject to this attack as of May 1. This is far from your average phishing scam, however, and comes at precisely the right time to fool already stressed and somewhat disoriented workers. Instead of the far more commonly used "sort of look-alike" alerts and notifications employed by less careful cybercriminals, this new campaign is very professional in approach. "The landing pages that host both attacks look identical to the real webpages, and the imagery used is copied from actual notifications and emails from this provider," the researchers said. The attackers are also using newly-registered domains that are designed to fool recipients into thinking the notifications are from an official source...As far as the credential-stealing payload is concerned, this is delivered in an equally meticulous way. With multiple URL redirects employed by the attackers, concealing the real hosting URLs, and so aiming to bypass email protection systems, the cybercriminals will eventually drive the user to the cloned Microsoft Office 365 login page.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Opening 100 tabs in Google Chrome Mobile gets you a smiley face</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today I learned something new; Google Chrome Mobile has an Easter egg that turns the tab count into a smiley face when you have over 100 tabs.
For the past couple of weeks, my Chrome Mobile's tab count has been showing a smiley face rather than the normal tab count.
In between other things, I poked around the settings to figure out what causes it, but never really made an effort to look into it. That is until today when my son said: "Cool, you have a smiley face in your browser!"
It turns out that Chrome Mobile has had an Easter egg for years that causes a smiley face to display instead of the tab count if you have over 100 tabs.
While it would be fun to think that the smiley face is shown because you are feeding the browser so much memory, the more likely reason is that the Google developers didn't want to increase the size of the tab count box to display 3 characters.
By showing a smiley face instead of 100, the user interface does not need to be changed and they can continue to display two characters in the same sized box.
Still, it's a fun little Easter egg, and if you see it, you now know that you have 100+ tabs open and maybe it's time to do a little pruning.
